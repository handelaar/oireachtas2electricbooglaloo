      <P>I have received notice from Senator Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the reason St. Joseph's primary school, East Wall, Dublin 2, will lose a teacher in the 2001-02 school year.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 2, Horse and Greyhound Racing Bill, 2001 &ndash; Second Stage; No. 1, Carer's Leave Bill, 2000 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; and No. 3, Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Report and Final Stages, which is not to be taken before 1 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two ways to do business in the House. The right way is to consult people. If there are to be changes, people should be told in advance and their agreement should be sought. We received an urgent revised schedule of business for this week last Monday which stated that the Carer's Leave Bill, 2000, would be taken first today followed by the Horse and Greyhound Racing Bill, 2001. The Leader has told us the latter will be taken first without having consulted any of the groups on this side of the House. That is a great discourtesy to the Opposition, the spokespersons and the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had this row with the Leader previously and he apparently has not learned. Last Tuesday a complicated motion relating to Europe was before the House and I asked for one day's postponement so that the House could be informed as to what it meant. The Leader refused that reasonable request. I did not try to ambush him while he was on his feet. I asked him to get an <Col N="562" /> explanation but he said &ldquo;No&rdquo; and bulldozed it through the House.</P>
    <P>This morning when I arrived in the House I learned that the Order of Business had been changed. That is not the way to do business. I can agree to the Order of Business as it suits our spokespersons, but the Leader should at least do the Opposition the courtesy of telling or asking about such changes. I can agree to the Order of Business because our spokesperson, Senator Coghlan, has agreed to be discommoded. The same applies to Senator Cosgrave, who is a spokesperson on horses, greyhounds and other such matters. If the Leader wants co-operation he will get it but I appeal to him to inform people in advance and ask their permission.</P>
    <P>The Leader said on Tuesday he would have definite news for me about when the reviews by the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform into the arms affairs will be published. Can we expect those before the end of this session? </P>
    <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on Europe as a matter of urgency. It is becoming a national scandal that there is no policy on Europe and that the Government is speaking out of approximately five different sides of various mouths. I ask the Leader to reply to me, which he did not do on Tuesday, about the possibility of the Attorney General being invited to address the House under our new Standing Orders and to start a debate on European policy.</P>
    <P>What is the Government's policy on work for asylum seekers who have been here for more than six months? The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, and the Tánaiste are saying one thing, while the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is saying another. Is there a coherent Government policy on this matter? </P>
    <P>I ask the Leader about the legal basis of the proposal to create two separate classes of county councillors, namely, those who are paid for their work and those who are not. Is there a political basis for that? </P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter which can be dealt with during the debate on the Bill which will come before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the visit of European Commissioners to Ireland, Commissioner Prodi was in Ireland yesterday and Commissioner Solbes is due today. The Committee on Finance and the Public Service has again sought a meeting with Commissioner Solbes. I understand that is the view of the representatives of all parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the Senator a lot of latitude yesterday morning on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not make the argument. It is important for the House to recognise that a committee of the House is seeking a meeting and that it takes the view that these Commissioners <Col N="563" /> should engage with the elected representatives of the people.</P>
      <P>As regards the compellability committee, perhaps the Government will indicate to us its view on the initial stages of the Abbeylara inquiry. Is there an entitlement to compel the Garda witnesses to attend? This is a significant issue of democratic and political accountability and we should get an answer to that. I understand the process and I am not rushing it, but my understanding is that the month is now up and we should know what is happening. I would like to hear the Government's view on that.</P>
      <P>We have discussed many times the recognition of the views of public representatives. While I am utterly disinterested in this issue, it seems there is a clearly understood process. It is one thing if there is a matter of principle to be determined as to whether Members of the Oireachtas can become members of local authorities. However, once the issue of principle has been determined, it would be invidious discrimination to decide that some of them will be paid while others will not.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Bill comes before the House, there will be adequate opportunity for every Member to debate these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In the interest of anticipating difficulties which could arise, it should be clearly understood from a trade union point of view and in terms of equal pay for equal work that this would be utterly unacceptable to anyone. The issue of principle should not be confused with the issue of remuneration.</P>

      <P>Anticipating anything is a dangerous exercise in politics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that. The Bill should look at it from that point of view. I hope Members of the Oireachtas will not be cowed by their party leaders on this issue and that they will take a stand for once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Senator O'Toole, it seems this will be another climb-down for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the Nice treaty. We can invite Commissioners, such as Commissioner Prodi, Commissioner Solbes or Commissioner Byrne, to the House but we must debate the issue first and find out where we stand. Different versions emanate daily from both parties in Government. I would like the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come into the House to give us the definitive position, if there is one, on behalf of the Government. I would also like him to come into the House to discuss the possibility of putting in place accountability and communication structures between our Parliament and the European <Col N="564" /> Union. If we do not provide such communication structures, the Tower of Babel we have at present will continue into the future.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader to communicate to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, if he does not come into the House in the near future, the outrage at the fact that one of the European Union countries is detaining a 15 year old boy, who was attending a special school here. When an application was made by his lawyer to allow him to make a telephone call home or to allow his family to telephone him, the German court refused the request. This is a serious matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator had an opportunity to deal with this matter in detail on the Adjournment last week. I cannot allow him to rehash his Adjournment contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The boy is still being detained in the same cell in an adult prison as a murderer and a drug pusher, and I do not know what the Government is doing about this serious matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make a statement on this issue and to take action.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on Northern Ireland, of which we have lost sight. There is a crisis looming as 1 July is almost upon us. There is also a crisis in terms of decommissioning and the resignation of the First Minister. If we do not discuss this matter shortly and let our views be heard, it may be too late. The marching season is almost upon us. I ask for an urgent debate on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to resolve the problem with the Order of Business. I am the person to blame on this occasion, not the Leader. I apologise to the House and particularly to Senator Manning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did it to facilitate a Member on our side of the House. I was under the impression that the Member had cleared it with the Opposition. It was my fault and I take the blame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>An important report on the acute hospital services in Northern Ireland has been <Col N="565" /> published under the chairmanship of Senator Maurice Hayes. There are changes in the accident and emergency locations in Northern Ireland. It has been suggested that some specialist departments will be shared with the Republic of Ireland and that we will share some of its services. I ask the Leader for a debate on this report as it is important in terms of plans for our health service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the call by Senator Manning for the Attorney General to come before the House for all the reasons the Senator outlined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That request has been noted and it will be considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. However, there are other reasons he should come into the House, particularly the different&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not allow the Senator to discuss that matter further. I have said the request has been made and it will be considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will move on to another matter. Despite differences on such matters relating to the root of all evil, refugees and the issues Senator Manning alluded to in relation to European affairs, one sensible thing is proposed to happen tomorrow which I hope will soothe tempers, namely, the trip around the Ring of Kerry. I urge all Members to make that pilgrimage, following which the Government might be returned.</P>
      <P>I note that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, or somebody else in his absence, has made an order increasing the numbers of members of An Bord Pleanála. I understand there are two increases &ndash; one for five years and one for two years. Could the Leader tell us the number of members on An Bord Pleanála, and what is the Government expectancy in regard to reducing the enormous delays which have taken place in the recent past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to Senator Henry for her kind words and recognition of our report. It is flattering to be suggested as a subject for debate in the House, as long as it is not a debate on impeachment. At least it is better than being referred to a tribunal. I am not totally sure it is appropriate to debate the report here. It is a report to a Minister in another jurisdiction, although it does contain a cross-Border element. I am talking about a different system in which there are different relationships between the public and private sector. I hope Senator Henry will agree that we should reiterate the request she and I, and several Members, have made for a broader debate on health services, on which this report could have an input. I would be happy to draw on some of the ideas exposed in the report. That may be a better context in which to have a debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>At a time when Europe is being debated everywhere else on the Continent, it seems extraordinary that this House appears to be avoiding the subject. That may be material. President Prodi is due to come to Ireland tomorrow when he will meet a large number of anti-Nice treaty groups, or people who opposed it, which is a welcome development, but why will he not meet Members of this House who are opposed to the treaty also? This is totally symptomatic of the way in which European bureaucrats and civil servants in Europe ignore democratically elected representatives. It would be important for him to meet Members of this House who stated publicly that they voted against the Nice treaty, including Senator Norris and myself, for what we considered to be good reasons.</P>
      <P>On the substantial issue raised by Senators Manning and O'Toole about the injustice of paying people for one thing and not another, I hope the Minister will shed a tear in sympathy and spare a thought for those who took redundancy of £5,000 from the county councils about two years ago and are now losing about £10,000 a year by not being there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter which the Senator will have an opportunity to raise when the Bill comes before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my dissatisfaction with RTÉ at the lack of air time, both radio and television, given to young local artists trying to break into what is a very competitive market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is not in order on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader convey to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, that whenever the licence increase is being awarded, one of the conditions will be that more air time be given to local artists? What is happening currently is just not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in deploring the fact that Signor Prodi has refused to meet elected representatives. It would be important if people were given the opportunity to express their views to him, particularly in view of the ill-informed criticism that has come from some quarters in Europe. I would like also to be helpful to the leader of Fine Gael, Senator Manning, who spoke about Government spokespersons and officials talking out of all five corners of the mouth. The mouth, like everything else, has only four corners. There are other orifices which may have been employed by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I was too polite.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike me. I have never been noted for my politeness.</P>
      <P>Yesterday was World Refugee Day. That puts in context the call by Senator Costello for a debate on this matter and the Minister to give some indications as to progress that may have taken place in this area, of which there seems to have been very little.</P>
      <P>Since the tribunals were established by the Oireachtas, the Oireachtas, in particular this House, should have a report on their progress. That is important. I was very disturbed to read accounts that medical records of the wife of Mr. Denis O'Brien were summoned. That is the impression I was given, perhaps it was incorrect. If that is the case, it is an outrage. Are we going back to the days of the French Revolution? That woman was not a witness. She was not called to give evidence and if that is true&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a number of matters. First, is it the Leader's intention to have a debate on the Ombudsman's report before the summer recess, given that it highlighted certain matters? Second, without wishing to get into trouble with you, a Chathaoirligh, in terms of the question from Senators Manning and O'Toole on allowances to members of local authorities, I hope the Members opposite, prior to their next meeting with the Minister, will take on board the general views that have been articulated here and bring them to the proper quarter because if one is doing the work of a councillor, one deserves to be rewarded. Third, can the Leader confirm that, in line with the McKenna judgment, Commissioner Prodi will meet with both wings of the Cabinet?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call from Senator Maurice Hayes regarding his report on the acute hospital services in Northern Ireland. That would be valuable in the overall context of acute hospital services and a health debate here which I request for two reasons. First, the greatest difficulty is in the accident and emergency service. Second, the Government is formulating a health strategy. From the experience of the acute services, in particular accident and emergency over <Col N="568" /> many years, the report could provide vital information for any health strategy that would be brought forward. It would be a worthwhile debate and I hope it could take place before the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>In joining Senator Ross's request for Commissioner Prodi to speak to Senators and Deputies, it should not be exclusive to those who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;. That would be extremely discriminatory. He will be in the University of Limerick on Friday at 3 p.m. to give a lecture to which the public is invited, but I support Senator Ross's call on the condition that it would be inclusive of both sides.</P>
      <P>I support fully the call to debate Senator Maurice Hayes's report. Occasionally when we debate issues in relation to health, we get interesting glimpses as to how these issues are dealt with in Northern Ireland. It seems logical that we should be aware of what is happening on the other side of the Border. I would therefore welcome that opportunity.</P>
      <P>This is the third successive day on which I have called for a debate on the refugee and asylum seekers issue. Yesterday, being World Refugee Day, would have been the appropriate time for such a debate, we had signalled this many months ago in terms of asking that refugees and asylum seekers in the country for six months be allowed to work. Many of them have been waiting two years to have their applications dealt with. These are the forgotten people and it is extraordinary that we in this House have ignored them. We have been seeking a debate on this issue for many months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that the Government intends to do the Ring of Kerry as it is doing rings on every other issue, including the Local Government Bill. This Bill will come before the House and I will welcome the opportunity to debate the legislation. Another such issue concerns the right of refugees to work. The Government is speaking with different voices on this issue. However, this situation is most prevalent as regards the Nice treaty. The House and the public are demanding clarity on where the Government stands on this issue. Will the Leader ask the Minister to come into the House to speak from whatever orifice he wishes, but to give clarity on this issue and outline whether there are as many views on the Nice treaty in Cabinet as in the media?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning inquired about progress on the Arms Trial papers. I have not received word back on this issue, but I hope to have information by next Tuesday. Senators Manning, Costello and Ross called for a debate on Europe and the Nice treaty. I gave a commit<Col N="569" /> ment regarding this issue during the past few days.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Coghlan and Jackman asked for a debate on asylum seekers. I hope to be able to come back to the Whips and the leaders next Wednesday regarding finalising business to come before the House before the summer recess. Many debates have been called for. What I have in mind is to make available one full day to try to cover as many urgent debates as possible. This will be necessary due to the amount of legislation with which the House will deal before the summer recess.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the compellability committee and, in particular, the Abbeylara inquiry. The Senator pointed out that the one month has expired and I will make inquiries regarding this issue. Senators Manning, O'Toole, Cosgrave and Coogan expressed an eagerness to see the Local Government Bill before the House. I share Senator O'Toole's views regarding equal pay for equal work, as do many Members. This is important legislation and the House will not take its summer recess until the Bill is completed. Many Members have been waiting a long time for this Bill and I congratulate the Government for having the courage to introduce it and bring it before both Houses.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello and Norris asked for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come into the House to debate World Refugee Day and the difficulties being faced by a young Irishman in a neighbouring country's prison. I will pass on these views to the Minister and will consider these issues for the one day debate on various items.</P>
      <P>I will consider Senator Norris's call for a debate on Northern Ireland. Senators Henry and Maurice Hayes called for a debate on acute hospital services and the report on hospital services in Northern Ireland. I will consider these issues for inclusion in the one day debate. Senator Coghlan inquired about the number of members of An Bord Pleanála and the number of members who will be appointed to the board. I will make inquiries in this regard and communicate with the Senator later today.</P>

    <P>Senator Glynn called on RTÉ to increase the amount of air time it gives to Irish artists. This would not be difficult as it gives little time to such artists. This is a disgrace and a scandal and the RTÉ Authority has much to answer for in this regard. Irish artists cannot get air time on RTÉ. When there was one radio station 25 or 30 years ago it had single and album of the week, and powerplay of the day. Irish artists cannot get their music played on our national station. Senator Norris supports this view. The situation is appalling and if it does not improve there will be no opportunity for Irish artists to record or to work in Ireland. People in this industry have been good ambassadors in terms of portraying young Ireland all over the world. However, it is a scandal that their music is not played on RTÉ radio. I call on the director general of RTÉ and the chairman of <Col N="570" /> the RTÉ Authority to intervene to see what can be done in the interests of great Irish talent, including writers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Joe Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be in the House with further legislation regarding horse and greyhound racing, sectors which, during my time as Minister, I am pleased to have been able to improve in terms of structure and funding. I express my appreciation to Members of the House for taking this legislation today. Senator Cosgrave and his family have a long and distinguished interest in the horse racing industry and I will be happy to elaborate and clarify matters during the debate.</P>
      <P>There was consensus on, support for and constructive debate on this legislation in the Dáil. I was pleased to accept a number of amendments on Committee and Report Stages which strengthen and improve the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the establishment of the IHA in 1994 and the new financing arrangements for the horse and greyhound industries in 1999, the <i>raison d'être</i> of the Bill is to secure the future of Irish racing. Up to 1994 racing had seen little change for 50 years, since the establishment of the old Racing Board in 1945. The number of times the fate of either the horse or greyhound racing industries was discussed in the Oireachtas was <Col N="571" /> very few and, hence, I make no apologies for coming back to this subject as much as is required to get things right and put matters on a sound footing for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that it was not an easy task to get industry agreement to the full package of measures in this Bill. It represents the most radical change ever contemplated for the sector and change of this nature is never easy. I take this opportunity to thank and congratulate all those industry leaders who contributed to the process of negotiating the final agreement that underpins this legislation.</P>
    <P>In an area such as this one we cannot simply make laws and enforce them as one would for criminal activities; the law in this case has to be a blueprint for development. It represents only the framework within which the industries can move forward. After that, it takes much hard work, commitment, dedication and vision on the part of the people involved to make things happen and to shape the future.</P>
    <P>In this legislation we have finally arrived at an excellent structure and funding arrangement which is unique and ideally suited to the needs of Irish racing. It provides a degree of certainty for the future concerning funding resources for the development of the industry.</P>
    <P>Widespread industry agreement on this formula means that we will secure the drive and commitment to get the most out of it. We have the people and the skills, and we are now putting in place the structure and resources. Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon will have to plot the way forward and with everybody's active support I predict a solid and competitive performance ahead for both sectors on the national and international stage, as well as exciting times for all those involved.</P>
    <P>I was happy to see the proposals receiving such extensive support in the Dáil and I expect that Members of Seanad Éireann will also welcome these developments. Many Members of this House enjoy the sport and are actively involved. I wish to state my own vested interest in that I have, along with a number of Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, a small investment in a greyhound called Lotto Princess. The dog is owned by a syndicate of Members called the Leinster Lawn syndicate. I was also fortunate enough to become involved in the Grand Alliance syndicate that purchased Arctic Copper. I vowed that I would not be left out of the greyhound business. That is the disclosure I wish to make.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil debate it was not possible to agree on all the details but I am sure most people will accept that there is a single-minded consensus on the substantive issues. The horse and greyhound breeding and racing industries were long overdue this kind of overhaul treatment. I am particularly glad about the £200 million cap on funding, which will give this House and the Dáil an opportunity to debate the important horse and greyhound <Col N="572" /> industries every three to four years. This is as it should be. They should not have to depend on the interest of the Minister of the day in racing to have a fundamental review of activities, performance and general direction.</P>
    <P>The Government attaches a strategic importance to racing because of the roughly 30,000 people who are employed in these industries and the significant contribution the sector as a whole makes to rural development, farm and other incomes, the business and services sectors, tourism, the economy and the international reputation of the State. Racing also makes a significant contribution to the buoyant £1 billion off-course betting market. There is scarcely a town or village in the country that does not benefit in some way from these activities.</P>
    <P>Ireland is recognised as one of the leading countries in the world for the production of quality thoroughbred horses and greyhounds. Our natural resources are ideal for the purpose and Irish people have a breadth and depth of innate skills and experience in the breeding, handling, rearing and training of these often extremely valuable animals. This combination can scarcely be matched elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The last five years have seen the number of thoroughbred horses being registered annually here rise by over 20%, with a similar increase in the number of runners. The gross value of our thoroughbred sales has more than doubled to near £100 million in that time. The IHA company, Irish Thoroughbred Marketing, has been working hard to ensure that we get our fair share of growth in existing markets and new markets worldwide. In the past year alone, ITM has conducted an unprecedented number of promotional visits to 25 established or potential markets for Irish thoroughbreds. It has set up an excellent website on the Internet and distributes information on Irish horses to over 2,500 contacts in 64 countries. It operates an extremely successful inward buyer programme.</P>
    <P>The result is a huge increase, in percentage terms, in customers for our horses coming from Australia, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Tunisia. There is still potential growth to be experienced in the trade to Turkey. Of the emerging markets, Spain and Greece are showing great promise and other countries which offer serious potential include China, Korea, Saudi Arabia and South America.</P>
    <P>Ireland has always been regarded as the home of the best racing greyhounds. However, when the racing sector was in decline here for lack of investment in and promotion of the sport, there was a serious knock-on effect on the breeding front. Since the home industry has been rejuvenated over the last five years or so, prices for our quality greyhounds have risen and our markets have opened up again. The Leinster Lawn syndicate got some idea of the increase in prices of greyhounds in recent times. We export Irish greyhounds to the UK, the US, Australia and many European countries. Nevertheless, there remains <Col N="573" /> a big job of work to be done in developing existing markets and exploring new ones.</P>
    <P>We have never been short here of world class thoroughbred horses and greyhounds, and famous breeders, owners, trainers and jockeys whom we can rightly describe as legends in their own time. Last year alone, Irish-bred horses won 30 group 1 races around the world. The highlights included the record-breaking performance of Sinndar who won the Irish Derby, the Epsom Derby and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe; Istabraq's outstanding run at Cheltenham; Papillon's win in the Aintree Grand National; and the Irish-trained Giant's Causeway who ran in eight group 1 races and won five. Just last week, Imagine and Galileo were added to that long list, having won the Epsom Oaks and Epsom Derby respectively.</P>
    <P>Just as important, and some would say even more so, are the human heroes behind those horses, the youthful Aidan O'Brien, John Oxx, Ted and Ruby Walsh, and another father and son combination, Tommy and Paul Carbery. I must also mention the legendary Vincent O'Brien who has been our most famous ambassador as a renowned trainer under both codes &ndash; national hunt and flat. Johnny Murtagh had a tremendous year in 2000, riding 12 group 1 winners and Michael Kinane came a close second with 11 such wins.</P>
    <P>I also wish to mention Paul Hennessy, an outstanding greyhound trainer. His latest achievement has been the performance of the Late Late Show greyhound. Mr. Hennessy's dogs have won a substantial number of major races, including some of the classics, yet he is still only in his twenties. Both Mr. Hennessy and Mr. Aidan O'Brien are great examples of the young people who are coming through the system and swiftly reaching the top of their sporting sectors.</P>
    <P>Irish-bred and trained greyhounds have been winning consistently at home and abroad. Bord na gCon finds it difficult every year to choose its hall of fame award winner, such is the large number of successful and extremely committed greyhound breeders, owners and trainers in the industry. This year, the award went to Pat Dalton, a Tipperary man, who is as well known in the US as he is here for the extremely high quality of his greyhound breeding and racing on the international scene. Mr. Dalton is generally regarded as Ireland's leading ambassador worldwide for the greyhound industry. I had the pleasure of presenting the award recently at a most impressive ceremony in Shelbourne Park.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the subject of breeding and rearing horses and greyhounds, and the people involved, I would like to record my thanks and appreciation for their co-operation and commitment on the foot and mouth disease issue. This was one of our bigger challenges in recent times and presented for all of us many tense occasions and situations. The response from those involved in agriculture and the public generally was tremendous. Foot and mouth disease galvanised <Col N="574" /> the whole country into extraordinary action on a single issue with one goal in sight.</P>
    <P>I hope we are close to the end of the crisis, but it is not over. Events in Britain continue to cause concern with an average of four to five cases revealed every day. Thanks to a great effort by all, we have been successful in keeping foot and mouth disease out and we must continue to be vigilant. I take this opportunity to thank those in the horse and greyhound industries for their voluntary, enthusiastic and proactive stance since February. There were many times when it must have been extremely difficult for most of them.</P>
    <P>If we have any doubts about the merits of the level of investment proposed in this legislation we need only look at the performance of these industries over the last five years and see their capacity for growth and development. Attendances at horseracing have grown from about one million to over 1.35 million people and on-course betting has jumped from £96 million to over £160 million. Prize money has justifiably shot up from £14 million to almost £25 million, with the contribution of sponsors and owners also increasing. I have already outlined the consequential and significant growth achieved in the breeding and sales of thoroughbreds over the same period.</P>
    <P>Proportionately, the greyhound sector has seen an even faster rate of growth. Attendances have grown from just over half a million to 900,000 people and the one million target is expected to be broken this year. On-track betting has jumped from £23 million to over £53 million and prize money has more than doubled, rising from £1.9 million to about £4 million when we include the welcome development of the recently introduced special incentive schemes for racing. The contribution of sponsors to greyhound events is also increasing.</P>
    <P>This is an appropriate time to introduce legislation putting these industries on a stronger, more secure footing for the future. Despite progress and growth, both sectors operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment. The time has come to introduce fundamental changes.</P>
    <P>That is the general background to the legislation. Its essential purpose is to put funding, support and resources for the industry on a sound footing and to introduce certainty, enabling those who guide and develop it to plan in the medium and long terms. I will be glad to go through the detail of the Bill for the House later today but now I wish to give Members as great an opportunity as possible to make their contributions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. This is a subject much discussed inside and outside the House by some of the Members present. As an obviously interested participator and spectator in the Grand Alliance, I wish the Minister and his colleagues luck with Lotto Princess in her imminent debut. If the syndicate has the same enjoyment and success as the Grand Alliance has had it will be going places. We will all be watching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="575" /> There has been much discussion and various viewpoints have been taken on board, which was not without difficulty given the historical interests of the Turf Club, racing board and other interested parties. The Minister has accepted amendments in the Dáil and has now got as near to having the right package as can be expected. What we want now is to move the Bill on and I am happy to have all Stages go through today. If there are a few questions on Committee Stage or there needs to be clarification I am sure the Minister and his officials will be glad to provide answers.</P>
    <P>We have seen racing change and become a greater spectator sport and greater entertainment. More people now enjoy a day at the races or a night at the dogs and there are more corporate facilities. We can be proud of having a good product and in certain areas we can hopefully improve it.</P>
    <P>I mention in passing some of the great festivals, the big national hunt days and the Irish Derby but there are other days where you have what we call a bad card, one full of maidens and odds-on shots which take place in small fields. That has to be looked at. We have flagship studs like Coolmore with the expensive yearlings and the horses that will go on to success. I think of Galileo and Imagine in recent days. However, there is the other end of the market where we find the smaller breeder at the sales and we have to achieve a balance whereby the smaller investors and syndicate or club owners get their return.</P>
    <P>Clubs and syndicates bring a lot of extra people to tracks. There are 17 members of the syndicate I am involved in and while it is a rare day when all travel, it is usual for 12 or 14 to do so with their supporters, their entourages and their drivers. Tracks have to look at better facilities and simple things like extra badges because the more those who attend enjoy themselves &ndash; particularly those who do so casually &ndash; the more often they will return.</P>
    <P>This has been a difficult year for the racing industry and some great events were lost to us, such as Cheltenham, but I compliment the industry on the way it handled itself. I also compliment the Minister and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Davern, who led the effort. They got co-operation from the Houses of the Oireachtas, from farmers and from the racing industry. Some people were badly discommoded and at a financial loss &ndash; such as those in the tourism industry &ndash; and while there might have been the odd tetchy moment along the way we were able to respond in the national interest. We showed what we could do by facing the problem together.</P>
    <P>The report of an inter-departmental task force on the future management of the Curragh of Kildare came out in May 1999. There are various interests involved like the Department of Defence, the racing industry and sheep farmers. <Col N="576" /> It is a massive expanse of land. I am not saying there are not a few things which could be done better there, but I am wondering if there is to be a further response to that report. It is, as Senator Dardis knows well, a tremendous tract of land and there are inter-related uses of it. It should be used slightly more extensively without causing the problems that may arise when extra people come in, which range from rubbish to damage caused by fires. One must be careful. Does the Minister have any opinions on the report which came out two years ago?</P>
    <P>I have raised Leopardstown Racecourse, the flagship track, on a number of occasions. I am glad there is some progress on the part of the council, of which I am a member, and the racing authority regarding the M50 roadway. I and many others are concerned by the way in which the roadway is proceeding. If works commence, will there be a knock-on effect for the tract of land near the two fences past the stand? Will that land be affected? We saw what happened with Punchestown and Doncaster. Putting down tracks is not like putting down tarmacadam and we are talking about horses worth £3 million or £4 million running on the track. I do not know if the Minister has any update on Cheltenham but we hope there will be some progress which enables the autumn meetings to be held at Punchestown.</P>
    <P>I still believe that the construction of a new six furlong track at Leopardstown is fraught with difficulty. It is important that Dublin holds its last track. I hope I am around to see Group 1 Heinz winners on that track but the reality is that a track is being considered for where trees and stables are at present. I am not a total expert but I do have some knowledge of laying grounds. Some of these excavators and builders are not thinking in terms of racing, they are thinking of the roadway. As the land goes down towards the roundabout, perhaps it could be shaped like a runway. The Minister should pass on our concerns about Leopardstown.</P>
    <P>This industry has its highs and lows. The Minister mentioned people like Aidan O'Brien, Ted and Ruby Walsh, Paul and Tommy Carbery and John Oxx. We have had great moments in the last 12 to 18 months but there have also been downsides. A young amateur was killed at Punchestown and Shane Broderick suffered a serious fall within a few months of his great race at Cheltenham. That side of the industry should also be looked at, whether it is the stable lads or the jockeys' benevolent fund. Some part of the cake should be allocated for them as there are hardship cases involving smaller trainers and jockeys who get a couple of spare mounts. Those who raised money for Shane Broderick are to be complimented but there may be other injured people who were not looked after quite as well. It is great to see winners but there is also a downside which the Minister should address.</P>
    <P>Obviously I am interested in how this media process will work. It is important we sell the tracks well and the sport should get the widest <Col N="577" /> possible coverage on RTÉ, Channel 4 and other new channels. RTÉ may or may not have programmes the public likes but many Members would have loved &ldquo;Airs and Races&rdquo; with Val Joyce, which was axed. There is still coverage but at times one does not get the build-up to a race, one would nearly get a rerun of &ldquo;Lassie&rdquo; quicker than an update on a prominent racing event. Sinndar won last year's Arc but many in two channel land, for want of a better description, could not see it. RTÉ was able to make arrangements for big matches in certain competitions and it should be open to us to make adjustments. If the public demand is there, it should be possible to get something, it should not be beyond the bounds of possibility. How is funding to be determined? I am aware there will be a report here and assume there will be annual reports, as was the case previously. We have a good product but we can make it better.</P>
    <P>I am more knowledgeable about horse racing but the improvements to the dog tracks at Harold's Cross and Shelbourne should be replicated at other tracks. Fine Gael held a fund-raiser at Shelbourne Park.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>A Dáil colleague also held a function there and it is a very popular evening's entertainment. For a relatively small sum people can book rooms and get a free drink or bet. Offices all over town organise nights out there and if the product is good and the comfort is there, people will come back. We must look at providing food, comfort and heating at racetracks. If one is in Navan, one should be able to see how the big race at Cheltenham or Ascot is going. The consumer must be looked after.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of a racecourse consultative forum in section 9. The Racing Club of Ireland has done great work under Kevin Smith and it is good to have a forum where the punter or consumer, as distinct from the others involved, can discuss their concerns in a structured way.</P>
      <P>I may have more questions on Committee Stage but the Minister might address the points I have raised. We support the Bill and the industry and wish those working within it every success. In that regard, we are anxious that the Bill gets through all Stages today.</P>

      <P>Before I address the Bill, I want to explain my part in the mix-up in the ordering of today's business. Senator Tom Fitzgerald said that it was his fault. He received a request from a Member to have this item taken first today. I was that Member. Another Member in my group was also anxious to have this item taken first. I asked Senator Fitzgerald whether it would be possible to have this item taken first and he told me it would not. He told me that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development had a <Col N="578" /> meeting at this time and would find it difficult to attend. I conveyed this information to the chairman of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine who consulted the Minister. It was then understood that the Minister was anxious to have this item taken first. I returned with this news only to be told that the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, was anxious to have the Carer's Leave Bill, 2000, taken first. I did not know that this item was to be taken first today until Senator Cosgrave informed me of this at 9.45 a.m. I apologise for any mix-up caused, especially to Fine Gael Members in the Seanad. I will be slow to ask for a change in the Order of Business in the future.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment him on introducing the Horse and Greyhound Racing Bill, 2001. It is necessary legislation which will help give both horse and greyhound racing the development they need. I compliment the Minister on the way in which the Bill was arranged on a consultative basis with the relevant interests, including the Racing Board, Bord na gCon and others. All have welcomed the Bill.</P>
      <P>Racing's contribution to the State is important, as the Minister mentioned. He said that the Government attaches strategic importance to racing because of the 30,000 people employed in the industry, and because of the significant contribution the sector makes to rural development, farm incomes, the business and service sectors, tourism, the economy and the international reputation of the State. This is evident, especially in rural areas where hotels are booked out when there are big festival meetings such as Listowel, the Curragh and the Derby. It is similar for one day meetings such as Mallow, or two day meetings at Tipperary, Clonmel etc. Racing also provides an income for many farmers, be they dairy or beef farmers, who may have several brood mares or other horses.</P>
      <P>There has been significant expenditure on improving facilities in the horse racing industry and at race tracks. The industry has enjoyed tremendous success during the years in relation to horses in training, runners and prize money. The number of horses in the industry increased from 4,666 last year to 4,766 this year. Last year there were more than 25,000 runners while the figure for the previous year was just over 24,000. There was also a substantial increase in the number of races run. At many race meetings, where there are six races, this will have to be extended to seven to accommodate the increased number of runners. This happened at a recent meeting I attended at Tipperary. Prize money increased from £20.4 million in 1999 to £24.2 million last year. There has been a 74% increase in prize money since 1966, a gigantic increase in any terms. Those who have been going to the races during the past ten years have seen prize money doubled over that period, which is most encouraging for owners and trainers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> While it is important that there are Group 1 races and that the standard of Irish racing is protected, it is also wise to look after those in the industry competing for the smaller prizes. Last year, 22.5% of all races were worth in excess of £10,000. That is a huge advance and the sort of progress which must be encouraged. That is what the Bill aims to do.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to owners' costs. When one considers that there were fewer than 5,000 horses in training last year and that prize money was just over £24 million, it is obvious that most will not make money from racing. Their investment is more about entertainment. For a small investment, people get a great payback. There is a wonderful social side to racing. This is what we must encourage. It was once said in relation to horseracing that if one wants to make a small fortune, one must invest a large fortune. Perhaps, that is truer today than ever, but people are still prepared to support the industry. There is room for large and small investors and we must treat them in a similar fashion.</P>
    <P>In that respect &ndash; the Minister referred to this &ndash; we can talk about the syndicate or Grand Alliance among Members of this House which owns Arctic Copper. That syndicate is due to a small investment by 17 Members, including Senator Cosgrave who was the chairman of our group. A swallow never flew on one wing, and I am anxious that we might get another horse to complement the one we have.</P>

      <P>We will manage without it. There have been great improvements to race tracks throughout Ireland, including Mallow, where I often meet the Minister. He is a great supporter of racing. Mallow is a great facility, as is Tipperary which has also enjoyed recent improvements. It is magnificent, although there may still be room for further improvement. It is very comfortable to go racing at Tipperary now.</P>
      <P>I am a member of both Tipperary and Mallow racing clubs. The Minister mentioned developments at Limerick. There is a magnificent new racecourse and facilities at Patrickswell, County Limerick. I visited it some time ago and believed that we would have racing there by now. Unfortunately, the condition of the track has prevented this. There will be no racing there until October. Perhaps the Minister can enlighten us as to the current position. I am sure he is informed and will have the honour of opening the track. I tried to become involved as a shareholder. I made inquiries &ndash; I do not know whether I was direct enough in that regard &ndash; but no one seemed interested in my application. I do not know why I was ignored but I will try again because I would like to become involved.</P>

      <Col N="580" /> Racing was suspended earlier in the year as a result of the foot and mouth disease crisis. The outbreak of the disease had an impact on the racing industry here and has led to a reduction in the revenues of certain trainers, some of whom had to lay off staff when race meetings did not proceed. Many meetings were curtailed and much money, including prize money, was lost and additional expenses were incurred by owners and trainers. I compliment the Minister and the Department on the steps they took. Had they not taken action and ensured that foot and mouth disease was kept at bay, the difficulties experienced by trainers and owners would have been much worse because racing would not have resumed. The Minister must be given credit for the work he has done, particularly in conjunction with the task force, in ensuring that foot and mouth disease was kept at bay. This was vital not only for the horse racing and greyhound industries but also for the agriculture industry.</P>
    <P>Ireland has never suffered a lack of world class thoroughbred horses and greyhounds or famous breeders, owners, trainers and jockeys, whom we can rightly describe as legends in their time. In 2000 alone, Irish bred horses won 30 group one races throughout the world. Highlights included the record-breaking performance of Sinndar which won the Irish Derby, the Epsom Derby and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and Istabraq's outstanding run at Cheltenham. Istabraq is owned by a friend of mine, J. P. McManus, and we are all proud of his achievements. We were disappointed that because of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease the horse could not travel to Cheltenham to win his fourth Gold Cup. In addition to Sinndar and Istabraq, Papillon won last year's Aintree Grand National and the Irish Grand National. This was a great achievement for Ted and Ruby Walsh. Ted Walsh's cousin, Tom Walsh of Kildorrery, had a great success with a horse that raced in England this year. I do not recall the animal's name at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. The horse enjoyed great success, which is a great advertisement for Irish bred horses and will provide encouragement to other breeders. Another horse, Giant's Causeway, ran in eight group one races last year and won five.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people would say that the human heroes behind these horses are even more important. I refer here to Aidan O'Brien, John Oxx and the family combinations of Ted and Ruby Walsh and Tommy and Paul Carbery. I must also mention the legendary Vincent O'Brien who has been our most famous ambassador as a renowned trainer under both codes &ndash; national hunt and flat. When I first began attending race meetings, there were two champion jockeys, Martin and Tim Maloney from Croom, County Limerick, who were heroes in the racing world and Liam Ward from Rathkeale who was flat champion jockey on several <Col N="581" /> occasions. This year, Johnny Murtagh has enjoyed tremendous success, although newspaper reports today indicate that he has had some bad luck. However, I am sure he will overcome his difficulties and return to win further races.</P>
    <P>Irish bred and trained greyhounds have been winning consistently at home and abroad. Bord na gCon finds it difficult every year to choose its hall of fame award winner. As the Minister indicated, this year's award was won by Pat Dalton from County Tipperary. In the past there were other great greyhound trainers from Tipperary including, Dick Ryan, who trained a number of Waterloo cup winners, and Ger McKenna, who trained many Irish Derby winners and whose brother served as a Member of this House.</P>
    <P>I will now deal in more detail with the greyhound industry. I compliment the Minister on his foresight in providing statutory funding on an ongoing basis. This is a dream come true for the Irish Greyhound Board. It is a realisation of the hopes and aspirations of successive Bord na gCon administrations under the chairmanship of the late Dr. Paddy Maguire, the board's first chairman, and his successors, Des Hanrahan from Limerick, Noel Brassil from Kerry and the current chairman, Paschal Taggart. I compliment the chairman and members of Bord na gCon on their success in the management of the industry.</P>
    <P>Now that the Irish greyhound industry has been assured funding, I ask the Minister to ensure that an equitable amount of this annual subvention be directed towards the coursing sector of that industry. I was involved in greyhound racing at one stage and had a runner in the Irish Coursing Derby at Clonmel. I hope coursing will not be neglected because, without it, we will not be able to breed the type of greyhounds that have gained for the industry a great reputation throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Since the start of the last century the Irish Coursing Club regulated all aspects of greyhound sports, racing and coursing until the advent of Bord na gCon in 1958. The services provided by the club, which is based in Clonmel, are vital to the ongoing success of the Irish greyhound industry. It provides a role and function in compiling the stud book for the entire island of Ireland and ensures, with unequalled professionalism, the integrity of the Irish breed and is acknowledged worldwide for this. The Irish Coursing Club has 10,000 affiliated members on both sides of the Border. However, for reasons I cannot understand, it receives no subsidy or benefit from moneys collected from betting revenues within the industry nor from annual Government subventions to the industry. The legislation governing the Irish greyhound industry clearly defines the role, functions and responsibilities of the Irish Coursing Club in the development of the greyhound industry. I would appreciate if the Minister would ensure that adequate funding be made available to enable the ICC to continue the good work it has been doing for the greyhound industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="582" /> There is nothing as entertaining as greyhound racing, particularly during the summer when evening meetings take place. There are great facilities on offer at the greyhound tracks in Shelbourne Park, Harold's Cross and Cork. The latter is a particularly magnificent stadium, although I have only seen it while passing by on the road and have not yet attended a meeting there. I understand its patrons can enjoy its great facilities and watch races in comfort. I am sure greyhound owners and breeders in the Munster region will benefit from having access to such a wonderful facility.</P>
    <P>We need to continue to improve facilities in the industry. I understand that Bord na gCon is building a new greyhound track at Limerick. I do not know, but I believe the board has encountered difficulties in selling the existing track. Perhaps the Minister will recognise their efforts and give whatever help he can to ensure greyhound racing will continue at Limerick.</P>
    <P>Going to the races and a night at the dogs are two great pastimes. There was a time when horse and dog tracks had limited and primitive facilities. That has changed thanks to the funding the Government has given and which the Minister is most keen to continue. Stadia with state-of-the-art facilities have been developed recently at greyhound racing and horse racing courses. Both sports have seen huge increases in attendances at meetings. The Bill will allow the two industries develop further and help simplify their funding, management and development. It is long overdue and will receive a near unanimous welcome from all those interested in the racing of dogs and horses.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave mentioned section 9 which provides for the establishment by Horse Racing Ireland of a special racecourse consultative programme to give racegoers generally and other interest groups affected by decisions of the HRI which use the services or facilities provided by that body and which are not directly represented on the board of HRI an opportunity to discuss their concerns in a constructive manner and present their views and proposals to the HRI for consideration. This is welcome and I compliment the Minister on inserting this section in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I also welcome section 20 which removes completely with effect from 31 August next the flat rate charges on off-course bookmakers' shops introduced in 1999. I received a tip for a horse from a colleague yesterday and travelled to a local bookie to place my bet. I had to pay a little extra in tax, something I will not have to do after 2001. Unfortunately, the horse did not win and my bet and tax were lost.</P>
    <P>The bright side of horse racing, such as winning, was mentioned, but Senator Cosgrave also mentioned the downside. I remember a jockey saying one time that, when he races, two ambulances follow him around the track. I highlight the unfortunate accident which befell Shane Broderick to which Senator Cosgrave referred. Horser<Col N="583" /> acing lost a wonderful jockey in Shane Broderick. He was a stable jockey for a neighbour of mine, Michael Hourigan, in Patrickswell, County Limerick. That is part of the ups and downs of racing.</P>
    <P>I am interested in racing and attend many meetings when I get the time and do not have to fulfil Seanad duties. It delights me to meet some of my colleagues, such as Senators Cosgrave and Dardis and the Minister, at those meetings. I welcome the Bill and wish it every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill. I congratulate him on his excellent work in the foot and mouth disease crisis. While it is not yet at an end, it is to be hoped that we are nearing it. I compliment the Minister on his calm, cool and thorough handling of the crisis. He listened to the opinions expressed on all sides.</P>
      <P>Foot and mouth disease had a bearing on the horse racing industry. Cheltenham was cancelled as well as many other racing events. Without the Irish participating it was not likely to be a valuable meeting. I pay tribute to those owners and riders who respected the call for non-participation to protect the livestock industry and the country from the threat of foot and mouth disease.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, horse racing is a substantial industry with 30,000 employed and a turnover in off-course betting of £1 billion per annum. This is a sizeable amount of money. It is not all in the racing area but it forms the largest segment of betting in the country. It is important we ensure its viability and future and that the industry is sufficiently resourced in terms of the State response to funding the industry and in terms of media rights funding, which is invested in the industry and the tracks. It is also important that we attract quality thoroughbred animals which are the best in the world and that we are seen as the premier country in the world in terms of thoroughbreds, training and racecourses. This should be an exciting and attractive industry and we should be at the cutting edge in terms of progress in the area.</P>
      <P>The greyhound industry is much smaller but it, too, has made progress recently. Greyhound racing at Shelbourne Park is now an acceptable night out. The industry has responded by making it an attractive event where people can come to eat, drink, place bets and enjoy themselves. In that regard, I welcome the fact it will now be possible for people not just to bet off-course in bookmakers but also to linger there, have a cup of tea or coffee or a soft drink and a snack and read newspapers. That is desirable.</P>
      <P>A previous speaker referred to Giant's Causeway and a few other horses. I discovered Giant's Causeway on the way from Belfast to Ballycastle which left me desperately seeking a bookie's in Ballycastle. It was his first Group 1 race and he was at 9/1. I won on him then and have done almost always since, and that was a few years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industry is something in which we take a tremendous interest and of which we are proud. <Col N="584" /> It would be a shame were we not to take it seriously to ensure it is properly funded.</P>
    <P>I have a few concerns, one of which relates to greyhound training. We must be careful the industry is kept clear of the threat from blood sports. That is something which has been looming on the horizon for some time. If conflict arises about the manner in which greyhounds are trained, and many people have a tremendous love of animals and are abhorred by any animal being hunted or used by the industry, the industry will suffer in years to come. The situation will worsen in terms of confrontation and unacceptability in the public mind.</P>
    <P>Another concern relates to off-course betting. The excise duty on such betting will be part of this fund, which is fine. Why then did the Minister deem it appropriate to abolish the 0.3% betting turnover charge and the £500 and the £2,000 requirements introduced in the 1999 Act?</P>
    <P>It appears off-course betting is extremely profitable. I believe both could have been added to the fund which is being established and that the excise duty and 0.3% tax on off-course revenue could go into the central fund.</P>
    <P>In general, I am pleased this legislation is being introduced and I hope the industry will have a very bright future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and the legislation before us. The Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, must be congratulated on the work they have done. I am aware it was difficult at times to get agreement between the various bodies involved so that the legislation could be introduced and that we would have a blueprint into the future for the industry.</P>
      <P>It would be very tempting at this stage to collapse the debate on the basis that there is no one on the other side of the House. However, because I am so anxious to get certain matters off my chest, I will carry on.</P>
      <P>We all hope the legislation will have the desired effect. Unquestionably, we are dealing with a premier industry, if not the premier industry, in economic terms after farming. It is a flagship around the world for this country. The significance of the industry internationally, which has been outlined by many speakers and which I will not reiterate in numerical terms, cannot be underestimated. It is responsible for much of the tourism industry and positive image of Ireland abroad. In many instances, it is the only thing people associate with or know about Ireland. It produces that positive image which is an adjunct to the other important activities that take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much legislation in recent years relating to the horse racing industry, including the National Stud, other aspects of racing and now greyhounds, and on each occasion I made the same statement, which I will repeat. I was told at one stage by someone who was involved in farming that the road to ruin was paved by fast women, slow horses and fattening cattle. I have <Col N="585" /> experience of two of the three and I will leave it to the Minister to determine which one I have not experienced. I have some experience of slow horses.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely made an important point about the essential role of small owners in the industry. I accept Godolphin, Sheik Maktoum, Coolmore and so on are very important and have a huge influence on the industry. However, that is underpinned by small owners. Regardless of what happens in future, I hope that essential element of the industry will not be lost. It is part of the attraction and part of what makes it a great industry. I would be critical of the racing authorities for the way they have looked after small owners. Thankfully the prize money aspect has been addressed. I note from the annual report of the Turf Club that the prize money has increased significantly in the past year to approximately £24 million annually. However, I am not talking about prize money but about simple issues. If one has a runner in Thurles, one should be able to park one's car in some comfort, get into the course easily and get a race card. When I had a runner in Thurles I was under serious pressure to get to the racecourse from Dublin and a gentleman in a white coat would not allow me into the car park. I had difficulty getting into the ground on time for the race I wanted to see and when I got in, I found it impossible to get a race card. That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Obviously difficulties that cannot be anticipated crop up, but there is an onus on racecourses and the authorities to ensure people who underpin the industry, whether small trainers, owners or punters, are looked after. Thankfully the facilities have improved enormously and the Minister, successive Governments and the racing authorities must be congratulated on that. Having arrived early in Fairyhouse one winter's day, I was very taken by the fact that one walked into a tote hall which was heated. Even ten years ago the very thought of heating in a tote hall would have created abhorrence among the hardy souls who frequented race meetings. It is only now beginning to register significantly within the industry that it is more than an industry, it is entertainment. It is a highly competitive sector in terms of attracting the public and trying to get people to come through the gates. Given the advent of digital television and so on, it can be much easier to stay home and watch races on television than to go racing. There have been marvellous improvements in Naas and Punchestown racecourses. There have been improvements in the Curragh in terms of the entrance and the general facilities. This has been to the advantage of the racing fraternity in attracting people to attend races.</P>
    <P>The Arctic Copper adventure and the success of the Grand Alliance was mentioned by several speakers. At a very early stage in the career of Arctic Copper I could see it had certain possibilities. I tried to buy in, so to speak, and one member told me at the time that I could buy in but it <Col N="586" /> would cost me one Dublin taxi plate. That was prior to deregulation so I think it would have been a very good investment from their point of view if the taxi plate had been the entry fee.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with naming, entries, stakeholding, the calendar, registration and so on. It is essential that Horseracing Ireland and the Turf Club are fully integrated, that there is not an overdue overlap and that there is a single premises, single accounting and so on, which is the essence of good sense. An important issue is the integrity services and the other aspects covered under paragraph 6 of the Schedule relating to the rules of racing and so on. It is crucial that there is independence and that the integrity which underpins the status of racing is maintained. I am pleased the Bill deals with the rules of racing and that the inspection of courses, licensing, doping controls and so on are covered within the ambit of the racing regulatory body. This is extremely important, otherwise ordinary punters going to race meetings would not have the confidence that racing is being conducted on a fair and even basis, which is essential.</P>
    <P>The Annual Report of the Turf Club 2000 makes very interesting reading. The chief executive of the Turf Club is present and I welcome him to the House. In his message as senior steward, Mr. Scanlan said:</P>
    <P>I believe the arrangements we have now made are in the best interests of the industry we serve, and will fully protect the Turf Club's capacity to ensure the highest integrity in the sport.</P>
    <P>.. If a situation were to develop where the essential regulation of the sport were to be made subservient to the equally essential promotion, marketing and development of the industry, that strength could easily be undermined.</P>
    <P>I certainly agree with and endorse that sentiment. He speaks about submitting the blueprint to the Minister about the unified structure and so on. I am happy agreement has been reached. It was said at one stage that the talks were forthright. I suppose this is the type of diplomatic language to which the Minister is accustomed when he goes to Brussels, which has a profundity of meaning.</P>
    <P>The Turf Club was treated very unfairly many times during this debate. One of the things that was frequently said about the Turf Club was that it was a sort of exclusive Anglo-Irish 200 year aristocracy club and the members were out of touch with reality. Nothing could be further from the truth. If one looks at the list of members of the regulatory bodies, whether honorary members, members emeritus or joint members, it is an absolute who's who of Irish racing. It includes the very best in racing not just domestically but also internationally and includes those with a huge stake in the industry, who understand it and have enormous business experience. That sort of remark is nonsense and very wrong. In passing, it is with regret that I <Col N="587" /> mention that one of the prominent members of the Turf Club, Mr. Robert Griffin, died tragically earlier this year. He will be very much missed within the industry.</P>
    <P>The dog tracks have shown what can be done. It has now become fashionable to go to Shelbourne Park on a corporate outing, even if it is a Fine Gael fundraiser. Bord na gCon is to be applauded on the facilities there and on the way it has managed that sector of the industry. It is something of which racing people could take note. I mentioned the integrity services. The cost of doping control went up by £3.3 million in 2000, that is 10% higher than previously. Another good element of the Bill is that there is an emphasis on point-to-point racing.</P>
    <P>The whole issue of technology is very important in terms of the racing industry, racecourses and the betting aspect. The chief executive spoke in his review of the year about the introduction of the digital photo-finish camera. A lot can be done in the context of modern technology to improve the speed and accuracy of photo-finish decisions and generally to make improvements at racecourses. Technology can now be used in the case of the tote where one can bet from the comfort of the executive gallery where the Minister would normally be when attending the races but which humble mortals like myself would only occasionally see. The technology aspect is important and that is implicit in the changes made in regard to internationalising the activities of the tote and allowing betting houses to use the tote. Betting can now be done on the Internet without reference to the betting shop or the tote. It is essential for the tote to accept that reality to be able to compete within that market. The tote has a new logo and I saw some very bright advertising it has produced. I wish Mr. White and his people well with the tote. They have a tough task ahead to compete within that international environment but there are aspects of the legislation which will help them do that more competitively and more tellingly than in the past.</P>
    <P>The issue of foot and mouth disease was mentioned. There is an important point to be made here which relates to something said by Senator Cosgrave. I agree with what was said with regard to the Minister and the role of his Department in the handling of this crisis and I also agree with Senator Cosgrave that we are not quite home yet and we need to maintain vigilance. The racing industry behaved very responsibly at the outset of the foot and mouth disease crisis. At the start of the crisis there was a lot of talk about whether Cheltenham should be cancelled and whether racing should continue etc. I even heard interests within the industry say at an early stage that Cheltenham was hugely important and should go ahead. Mr. Willie Mullins was one of the people who stood up then and said &ldquo;No&rdquo;. He said the industry was more important than racing and it had to be protected. The racing industry is to be <Col N="588" /> applauded for that. It was very significant on the Curragh plain that when the order was made to remove the sheep and to regulate the movement of horses there the trainers on the Curragh precincts did exactly as was required from the word go, while some of the sheep owners were positively obstructive in terms of co-operation with the authorities. The racing fraternity can hold its head up with regard to its response to the foot and mouth disease crisis and it is important that we publicly acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>The whole issue of prize money is very interesting. There is a mine of information in the Turf Club's accounts. The value of individual races is a significant matter. Slightly more than half the races held have prize money of less than £7,000. I accept that the situation has improved since the days when we looked at first prizes of £1,200 or £1,300. Even if one was fortunate enough to win it was not a great help after everybody got paid. Returning to the point I made earlier about smaller owners, that is an area that I would be anxious to see improved. I am aware that under the provisions of the Bill there will be a 50% increase in funding to racing from 2001. I note under the Turf Club's report that national hunt prize money rose by 20.6% to £12.2 million in 2000 and flat racing prize money rose by 16.4% to £11.99 million in 2000. That is very desirable as the health of the industry is very much related to it. It is significant too in terms of the number of stable employees who are also listed within the report. The total number, including full time and part time, currently employed has increased from 2,032 in 1997 to 2,816 in 2000. That is an indication that there is some profit within the industry. The number of active owners has increased from 3,135 in 1997 to 3,646 in 2000.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the significance of the industry nationally but it is also highly significant in County Kildare. There is a very good development in County Kildare, the Kildare Horse Development Company, which was formed in 1998 to promote and develop the industry and to brand County Kildare as the thoroughbred county. It has been successful in doing that. It may not be generally realised but it was established by a report that was done by the Kildare agricultural task group under the local Leader company that the horse industry in County Kildare directly employs 5,500 people and there are a further 10,000 in associated industries and services. In contrast, agriculture has about 4,000 employed directly in the county. The general perception would be that agriculture is vastly more important than the horse racing industry but that shows it is the reverse from an employment point of view.</P>
    <P>The horse industry in County Kildare is the dominant activity by far. There are 162 stud farms and Turf Club figures show that there were 1,035 horses trained in County Kildare in 1998 &ndash; that was 23% of the national figure. Six of the top winning trainers were based in County Kildare and they accounted for 62% of the win money <Col N="589" /> from racing. It is an extremely important and significant industry for the county and that is why so many of us from the county take such an interest in it. Nearly 20% of participants in the survey kept horses and they averaged seven horses per establishment. That underlines the fact that they are not all big stables like Dermot Weld and John Oxx etc., there are many smaller people involved.</P>
    <P>I have a question for the Minister on one aspect of the betting. He speaks about getting rid of the 3% betting turnover charge on off-course bookmakers as well as the flat charge of between £500 and £2,000 on each off-course betting shop. The revenue from that went straight to the IHA and Bord na gCon in the past. I ask him to expand on his intention to remove the charges as soon as possible. The Bill allows the tote and bookmakers to sell tea, light snacks and newspapers, which is sensible. They will not be allowed to sell alcohol, with which the racing fraternity has an unjustified association. Perhaps vintners made a telling intervention, although it is proper that alcohol be sold on licensed premises only.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave made an important point about the reintroduction of sheep to the Curragh. Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on his plans in this regard. The Departments of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Defence have large interests in the management of the Curragh plain. On behalf of Kildare County Council, I attended oral hearings of the commission which examined the future of the Curragh. Most councillors held the view the traditional interests on the Curragh are entitled to continue their pursuits, but many in County Kildare believe sheep should not be on the plain. Whatever about controlling sheep, I cannot understand how horses would be trained in County Kildare without access to the Curragh. I realise that the area controlled by the Turf Club was railed off following an Act several years ago and that training grounds produce great revenue. All traditional activities on the plain have to live side by side with one another. Many outside of farming circles believe sheep are undesirable on the Curragh, but the type of grass on the plain might not be preserved without grazing. Perhaps the Minister will comment on the future of the Curragh, which is very important.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the access from the Curragh to neighbouring properties, as wandering sheep are highly undesirable from a disease control point of view. I do not know if the Minister or his colleagues, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, can afford to put up fences to prevent sheep from wandering from the Curragh, but it is important that the matter be addressed if diseases are to be controlled, especially given welcome developments regarding traceability and tagging.</P>
    <P>I wish this legislation well. It provides a blueprint for the future of a very important industry and I am glad that some of the original difficulties <Col N="590" /> have been ironed out. The Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Finance and members of the Irish Horseracing Authority, the Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee are to be applauded for the work they have done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and this Bill. I do not have the same knowledge of this industry as previous speakers, including the Minister. Horse racing has given terrific entertainment during the years and people enjoy it. It is wonderful that the Minister is introducing the Bill and that he has supported the industry by allocating £200 million. I congratulate the Government for its great work, the proof of which is the money to which I referred.</P>
      <P>Navan is the most convenient racecourse for me, although Fairyhouse is quite close too. Such facilities provide enjoyment for many who look forward to racing on special occasions like bank holiday weekends and St. Stephen's Day. The closest greyhound racing track to me in Dundalk has been given money by the Minister in recent years. I thank him for helping many tracks throughout the country to keep going, as they entertain many. I must mention a greyhound from Ballybay bred by Cathal McCarthy that won many trophies. The dog helped put Ballybay on the map at the time. As I do not wish to detain the House, I welcome the Bill, wish it well and thank the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Joe Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their unanimous support for this Bill which will add security to the industry by standardising funding and resources. The provisions of the Bill were brought about by consensus in the Dáil and within the industry. Although there was a degree of tetchiness before agreement was reached, a memorandum of understanding was hammered out in October 2000. All concerned signed up to the memorandum and I am honouring the agreement. I appreciate the constructive and supportive way in which all sides of the House have dealt with the provisions of the Bill. I accepted amendments to it from the Dáil on Committee Stage and Report Stage yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first and most fundamental element of the Bill is the establishment of a State body to be called Horse Racing Ireland, which will replace the IHA and take over some of the functions of the Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee. It was felt that some resources were being duplicated in the latter two bodies as there were two separate head offices, finance and accounting units, IT services and personnel and management functions, as Senator Dardis said. The headquarters of the new body will be in the Curragh, County Kildare. The operation of the industry will be streamlined. Many within it agreed with the Minster for Finance and I that better efficiency of operation and cohesion could be achieved if all the main administrative <Col N="591" /> and financial streams of the industry could be brought together in a new body. With the sole exception of disciplinary matters, all elements of the industry will now deal with one body in relation to their arrangements.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave raised media rights, an important issue which is the subject of a major debate in the United Kingdom. I would like the Senator to go into more detail on that. Other than State and industry funding, the sale of racing pictures and associated information on Irish meetings is the other key source of potentially high levels of revenue for the sector. The media rights were vested in the racecourses in the 1994 Act. However, it was felt that because of the huge impact that the terms of any sale of racing pictures could have on the industry as a whole it would be better if the negotiation of the sale of media rights in the future were to be handled, serviced and funded by the State body, which will now be directly representative of all the major interests in the industry.</P>
    <P>It was agreed by the Association of Irish Racecourses that all the negotiations on rights would be continued centrally. Section 10 prescribes that the negotiations will be undertaken by an HRI committee. The representative of the racecourses on the HRI will chair the committee and the Turf Club will also have a representative.</P>
    <P>In the early days of racing people got together in a specific location and provided land for a racecourse. The land has become very valuable over the years but people made it available voluntarily, selflessly and patriotically. I wish to record our appreciation to them for the provision of these fabulous racecourse facilities because those early years were vital.</P>
    <P>Racecourses will receive the full income from the sale of media rights for the next five years. After that HRI will be obliged to negotiate with the racecourses. By then, hopefully, much increased income from this source may be distributed throughout the industry to all those who contribute to racing. In that context HRI will be required to guarantee to the racecourses revenue from this source for each of the following five years which will at least equal the average annual income for the first five years. In other words, racecourses will be guaranteed income for the next ten years to ensure they have an opportunity to keep their premises up to the highest standards expected by racegoers.</P>
    <P>The Turf Club agreed that the property rights it had up to now and the information on runners and riders compiled by the registry office could be immediately vested by this legislation in HRI, subject to a guarantee that the income over the next ten years will accrue to it.</P>
    <P>The subject of funding has been raised by Senator O'Brien, among others. Section 12 contains most of the financial implications of this legislation. Exceptional returns have been achieved over the past five years on the investment to date in the IHA and Bord na gCon and <Col N="592" /> it is widely acknowledged that there is huge potential for further improvements in this area. On that basis the Government feels the case has already been well made for a permanent and guaranteed provision of State funding at a significantly increased level for these important industries.</P>
    <P>The domestic horse and greyhound breeding and racing sectors provide the raw material for the off-course betting market and deserve to receive some of the fruits of their labour in this regard. That is why the Bill proposes that HRI and Bord na gCon will between them receive this year Exchequer funds equivalent to the revenue generated from excise duty on off-course betting last year, which amounted to approximately £46 million. Ireland generates significant betting turnover and it is expected that £1 billion will be bet off-course this year.</P>
    <P>The income will be divided between the two bodies on a 4:1 basis with HRI receiving 80%, approximately £37 million, and Bord na gCon, 20%, approximately £9 million. In future years these bodies will receive the equivalent of the revenue generated from the excise duty in the preceding year or the £46 million they received this year increased in line with the consumer price index, whichever is the greater. The latter needs to be provided as a guarantee for obvious reasons connected to potentially fast moving changes in the off-course betting market. The rate of excise duty on betting may at any time in the future have to be adjusted downwards from the current 5% to maintain competitiveness. The UK is seeking to implement substantial changes in this area and nobody can be sure yet what the full effect of increasing credit and Internet betting will be on our off-course market and how the bookmaking industry will respond. The globalisation of the industry and the availability of Internet and off-shore betting without regard to the domestic industry was raised by a number of Senators.</P>
    <P>The legislation provides for a new operating structure for Irish racing which will be more effective and efficient in managing this important big business. We want to provide security in terms of the level of funding required to fully exploit the potential for the benefit of all concerned. This can only be done if the bodies involved can plan into the future, which will only be possible if they are guaranteed the level of funding promised. This will allow them to get on with the job. The only involvement of the Government of the day will relate to the appointment of the chairperson of HRI. All its other members will be nominated.</P>
    <P>The mechanism of the fund to be managed by my Department is set out in section 12 and it is the best way to achieve what it required. However, if the House agrees with this procedure, it should also be involved in reviewing it from time to time. The aggregate limit placed on funds to be made available to the horse and greyhound industries through this guarantee system is £200 million, which may be increased by regu<Col N="593" /> lation approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas. There will be an opportunity in approximately four years to review the performance of HRI and Bord na gCon. It will be good to give their performance an airing.</P>
    <P>The contributions of Members, similar to those of their colleagues in the Dáil, were informative and based on tremendously detailed knowledge of the industry. There is no other Parliament in the world in which Members would be able to contribute so knowledgeably to a similar debate.</P>
    <P>All the normal financial and other controls will be applied to the expenditure of the fund because a large amount of taxpayers' money will be used and accountability and transparency will be required in regard to the disbursement of the fund. In addition, under sections 13 and 14 the annual accounts of HRI and Bord na gCon will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the chief executives of the bodies will be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts in respect of the accounts. Under section 15 the chief executives may also be required to appear before other Oireachtas committees to give evidence concerning the general administration of their bodies.</P>
    <P>I accepted amendments in the Dáil yesterday which will permit the chief executives to comment on policy and the performance of the Minister of the day. I do not have a difficulty with that. It is important in a democracy that a liberal attitude is taken to critical comment. The chief executives will report on their annual accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Committee of Public Accounts and other Oireachtas committees.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the abolition of the existing charges on off-course bookmakers. In 1999 the Minister for Finance reduced the excise duty on off-course betting from 10% to 5%. This had a knock-on effect and the 5% on-course betting levies, which were an important source of income to the IHA and Bord na gCon, had to be abolished. As a result and in order to replace that loss of revenue for the bodies concerned, we introduced, among other things, a new 0.3% betting turnover charge on off-course bookmakers as well as a flat rate charge of between £500 and £2,000 on each off-course betting shop. The revenue went directly to the bodies.</P>
    <P>It is considered that these charges are no longer required in the context of the new funding arrangements for HRI and Bord na gCon. I, therefore, intend to remove these charges as soon as possible. Section 19 removes the turnover charge while section 19(2) allows the Minister to set the date for the removal by order. This will be done at the earliest and most administratively convenient date for the Revenue Commissioners and their collection systems following the enactment of the legislation. Section 20 removes the flat rate charge from 31 August. Surcharges for this year would not be payable under the 1999 Act until 1 September. There will, therefore, be no moneys due in respect of these charges in <Col N="594" /> 2002, with the possible exception of any amounts that remain unpaid from last year.</P>
    <P>We will also introduce new regulations regarding the tote which will allow for co-mingling of tote betting. Punters in other countries can bet on that tote at the Irish Derby or the greyhound derby and the same will be the case for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. I agree with Senator Cosgrave that it was a shame we were not able to see on our national television network the tremendous achievement of Sinndar, Johnny Murtagh and John Oxx in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe last year. I hope we will be able to see such international events on digital television from now on. We know that Dermot Weld was able to send Vintage Crop to the Melbourne Cup, where it won, and Go and Go which won in the Belmont Stakes. He also had other international achievements. We should be able to see and enjoy those great events. We will not only be able to do that in the future, but we will also be able to have a bet on the tote. As we know from the national lottery, the larger the pool, the greater the interest. There will also be an opportunity to extend the tote to betting shops on the high street.</P>
    <P>Many speakers, including Senator Dardis, referred to bookmakers. It will be possible to have a cup of coffee and a snack in the bookmakers from now on. It may also be possible to buy <i>The Irish Field</i> and any other racing publications there. It is not easy to get <i>The Irish Field</i> in little towns, such as the one I come from, on a Saturday. Sometimes one has to wait until dinner time. If one wants to place an early morning bet, one is not up-to-date with what is happening. I hope these betting shops continue to have special features on their walls in the future and that people will be able to have a cup of coffee and a snack there.</P>

      <P>Perhaps a nosebag as well. If people want a drop of alcohol, they should have a little flask with them in the wintertime instead of purchasing it there. People should keep away from alcohol at least until the racing is over if they want to get the most from their investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of other issues were raised. I will refer briefly to the board of the HRI. Paragraph 16 of the Schedule to the Bill amends the Schedule to the 1994 Act and defines new rules on the composition of and appointments to the board of the HRI. The board is being reduced from 15 to 12, which will make it more compact and manageable. The only member of the new board to be decided by the Government of the day will be the chairperson. All the other members will be nominated directly and will be representative of the industry's organisations. These organisations will be required to use an open and fair electoral process to democratically select their nominees. There will not be a question of a few people getting together in a room over a bar. It must be <Col N="595" /> democratic and at a general meeting for which adequate notice has been given. Because of the significant transfer of functions from the Turf Club and the national hunt steeplechase committee to the HRI, their representation will be increased to five members on the board.</P>
    <P>I take on board what a number of speakers said, including Senator Dardis who made the strong point that small owners should not be forgotten and that they should have adequate representation on the board. The same points were made during the passage of the Bill through the other House. It was stated that the national hunt element of the industry should get appropriate and adequate representation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the grand alliance? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The grand alliance can chip in and make its case for representation as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The other interests to be represented on the board will be racecourses, owners, trainers, breeders, bookmakers, employees and the sector in Northern Ireland. One of the features of this industry is that it is a North-South body. The Turf Club is an island of Ireland body which is responsible for fixtures in Downpatrick and Down Royal. I am glad my colleague, Ms Bríd Rodgers, was able to allow racing to continue and to allow the transportation of horses to and from the North of Ireland. Each of those interests I mentioned will get one seat on the board.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators referred to the racegoers consultative forum. That is an effort to take into account the 1.35 million racegoers who go racing every year and other different interests, including jockeys. The point was made about the unfortunate case of Shane Broderick. There are few activities where two ambulances are needed to follow a person performing their duties. As difficult as our job is, at least we do not need an ambulance. We are in the box, the parade ring or the bookies quadrangle, yet the jockeys, particularly national hunt jockeys, endanger their lives every time they go out. The other people for whom I have great sympathy are the handlers at the start because if the horses are not put into the stalls, there will not be a race. They endanger life and limb because the thoroughbreds are psyched up for the occasion. That range of interests should have an opportunity to make a contribution because without them, racing could not be held. The stable lads and the vehicle drivers who load up and drive to Galway or Tramore early in the morning and then take the horses back in the evening and load them up for the following day, while we enjoy the sport, should have a chance to make a contribution. I have written into the Bill that their opinions must be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> There is also a provision for turnover. A person will not get on the board and be allowed to stay there for 20 or 25 years, like some politicians, including myself. There will be a fairly regular turnover of members which will give new blood to the board. There is also a provision in the Bill dealing with the transfer of staff and the security required. That is important.</P>
    <P>Other provisions in the Bill include relatively minor changes to the business of the fixtures committee and to the grants for development work at racecourses relating to the implementation of important health and safety measures. There will also be improved controls on on-course bookmakers. They are two important points. Up to now a 50:50 grant was given to smaller tracks around the country, including Roscommon and Tramore. That has been changed to graded grants which means that if smaller tracks want to make safety improvements, they can get up to 100% rate of grant. That is only right and proper.</P>
    <P>A number of specific matters were raised. Senators Cosgrave and Dardis asked about the management of the Curragh in Kildare. This morning I asked my colleague, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, about that because he has primary responsibility for it. He said they were coming close to a new management system for the Curragh. I know how difficult it is because the old regulations date back to the last century. We hope that with the agreement of Dúchas, the Department of Defence and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, a more acceptable way to manage the Curragh will be found shortly.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave mentioned the M50 roadway. I know meetings were held in recent weeks between the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the National Roads Authority and the Leopardstown authorities, and my understanding is that agreement has been reached which will allow improvements to be made without disturbing the six furlong straight track or the track itself. The fear that Leopardstown racecourse would be closed for a long time no longer exists. The road realignment will be carried out without unduly interfering with Leopardstown as we know it.</P>
    <P>Senator Rory Kiely mentioned the Limerick track. There seems to be a problem with the soil in Limerick in terms of growing grass. Is that not amazing? Anyway, an agronomist has brought about a tremendous change there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose they have, although they are getting better at the hurling. They beat Cork by one point, which was a travesty, but we have to carry on. I hope we will hear Senator Kiely and others give a rendition of &ldquo;Limerick, You're a Lady&rdquo; some time in October of this year. At any rate, there is a good flush growth of <Col N="597" /> grass there now and a good skin on the ground. It is envisaged that Patrickswell will be open in October of this year. We look forward to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I would like a day out in Limerick.</P>
      <P>Senator Kiely also raised the question of greyhound racing in Limerick. First, the future is assured because that is the headquarters of Bord na gCon. The question of planning for the Markets Field and other options for alternative venues are being examined. The finances are available to provide adequate and up-to-date facilities. I cannot guarantee they will be as good as Curraheen Road in Bishopstown, but we will try to have a track appropriate to Limerick.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello talked about training systems, especially for greyhounds. That is vitally important. Nobody wants cruelty in the sport, and I would not stand over that. I introduced a measure some years ago on the muzzling of greyhounds to take the kill out of coursing and remove the cruelty from the sport in so far as it is possible. That has been successful. The general training methods used should have regard to animal welfare and reducing cruelty.</P>
      <P>Senator Cosgrave raised a number of other matters, including the resources that will be provided for the downside of the industry and those less well off. That is important. There is a section dealing with the provision of education and other training facilities. That is important because we have a reputation around the world of having very good handlers, staff, jockeys and so on, but we do not have a particularly good structure for them. From time to time one meets older hands who are literally dependent on, say, a non-contributory old age pension. We have very good training and education courses, for example, in the National Stud. There is also the Equine Centre in Limerick, and for the non-thoroughbreds we have Kildalton Agricultural College.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and RACE at the Curragh. It is my intention to have a day out at the Curragh soon because we put a little money aside for a farriery school at the Curragh. Blacksmiths were once a feature of every village in Ireland. It is a great craft and a great skill. We should have a master farriery school and we will have that. I intend to turn the sod very soon adjacent to RACE because horses need to be shod properly and many young people, especially those from rural backgrounds, and even some from Dublin, are interested in this area. The Cherry Orchard project, for example, and others are exciting developments and will give people who have a love for and are skilled in the horse business a training and education structure which will pro<Col N="598" /> vide them with a livelihood in the industry for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>I think I have covered most of the points raised on the various sections of the Bill. I thank the Senators for their constructive contribution to the debate on this milestone legislation. If any other clarifications are required, I will be glad to elucidate on them.</P>

I will invite the various bodies, owners, breeders and so on &ndash; I hope this afternoon &ndash; to have their general meeting and submit their nominees. I will then appoint a chairman.

      <P>This section is to be welcomed. I hope the Minister will have as many people on the board, particularly those who paved the way, including the Racing Club of Ireland under Kevin Smith and other very good supporters clubs throughout the country. There has been a type of twinning with tracks where groups go on stable visits etc. For instance, Navan would twin with <Col N="599" /> Newbury, or something like that. Does the Minister envisage an extension of that practice? I am aware that tracks undertake research and look for suggestions on improvements that are needed &ndash; we probably all do that. Will the Minister take that on board? I wonder if he has further information to give us on the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section dealing with the race boards consultative forum. Much debate took place in the Dáil about this and there was a call for the race course to be represented on the board. The Minister is correct in the way he has structured the board, which is now down to 12 members. The only way these bodies can operate effectively is if the boards are not too large.</P>
      <P>I have a number of queries with regard to the race course consultative forum. One concerns paragraph (2) which refers to other interest groups. I am not clear as to whether the type of categories represented on the board could be representative within the forum, in other words, that there are people directly involved in the industry who could also be on the forum, or is it just for race course clubs, supporters clubs and the like? I am a little unclear about that.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (5) states that the HRI shall have regard to any opinions expressed by the forum on any matter affecting the interests represented by the forum which may be reviewed by the HRI. I am clear about the first part of that but I am not clear about the addition of the phrase &ldquo;which may be reviewed by the HRI&rdquo;. I am not clear on the import of that and how it would affect matters.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister may appoint two members of the forum because it is important that he should be represented. I am aware there are similar models to this within agriculture &ndash; I think there is one in the sheep industry and in the horticulture industry. They appear to have worked well within the broader agricultural sector so there is no reason a similar forum in this sector should not work as well as those which have operated more widely in the agricultural sector.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the support for the idea of a consultative forum. One member of the IHA was nominated to represent the views of racegoers, of whom there are 1.35 million. However, it was difficult to accommodate all views on the IHA. The idea is that there will be a forum of 12 to 15 people representative of various interests, including jockeys. Surely jockeys are entitled to their views and make a contribution. The same is the case for handlers and sponsors. We are always looking for good sponsors for races. Sponsors have ideas which might be worthwhile taking on board and that is what we have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dardis spoke about syndicates. A syndicate may have 70 members who need to take a driver with them to a particular race meeting. <Col N="600" /> Finding a parking space can be difficult and the group may only have two entry passes. This is no way to treat syndicates.</P>
    <P>Racing clubs do a very good job and have an important contribution to make. There are also racecourse supporters' clubs. However, Senator Rory Kiely pointed out that it is difficult to become a member of some of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">

      <P>Senator Cosgrave referred to twinning. It is a good idea to twin tracks. Some of the clubs might also consider twinning. The Grand Alliance could twin with an alliance in the Northern Ireland Assembly. Some Members of the House of Commons are interested in horse racing. The former Foreign Secretary, who is now Leader of the House, has been known to dabble in horse racing and perhaps we will investigate twinning in this regard.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis referred to section 9(5) which states, &ldquo;HRI shall have regard to any opinions.&rdquo; This will be the case. In addition, section 9(6) states, &ldquo;HRI may publish any opinion or report of the Forum.&rdquo; In other words, if the HRI is reviewing some aspect of the industry with a view to change, the consultative forum is entitled to make an input into that process.</P>

      <P>Under section 19 of the Betting Act, 1931, activities in bookmakers' licensed premises were very restricted. These shops were dingy places into which one stole, placed one's bet and made one's exit. However, today people are entitled to various services, including betting services. They will now be entitled to enter a betting shop which will provide seating accommodation, newspapers, sporting media and non-alcoholic beverages.</P>
      <P>Tote terminals will be provided only in existing licensed betting shops, but the terminals will still be owned and controlled by Tote Ireland. This is an additional facility which existing betting shops will allow. This will mean that when one is in a betting shop, one can bet in the normal way with one's bookmaker or place a bet on the tote. This will be particularly relevant regarding the co-mingling of tote internationally. One will be able to place a tote bet in one's local shop and the revenue will go back into the industry.</P>

      <P>I am happy to be back in the Seanad to deal with this important legislation and I thank Senators for their constructive comments so far. As regards this amendment and others, we have consulted in great detail with ICTU and IBEC on the question of carer's leave. Everybody in the House accepts that the combination of the carer's leave entitlement and benefit is a good proposal. On this side of the House we feel it is innovative and family-<Col N="603" /> friendly legislation. It is user-friendly for persons providing care and for those who require attention.</P>
      <P>We feel that the Bill will improve the quality of life for people who find themselves in particularly difficult and trying circumstances. It will also benefit employers who will retain valuable staff because they can avail of this facility. In the context of discussions we have had with Senators, there is provision for people to work for ten hours and still receive the benefit and leave.</P>
      <P>Because we have agreements with ICTU and IBEC, I must stick to my position on this matter of deleting &ldquo;6&rdquo; and substituting &ldquo;8&rdquo;. The purpose of the six week gap between the periods of carer's leave for the same relevant person is to give employers time to recruit and train replacement staff. A Government amendment to section 9, passed on Committee Stage in the Dáil, recognised emergency situations in the giving of notice of carer's leave. I am satisfied that the six week requirement strikes the correct balance all round, both for employers and employees, given the differences in approach to the issue between ICTU, who wanted four weeks, and IBEC, who wanted eight weeks. I ask Senators to accept my position. Much compromise was involved throughout the drafting of the legislation. I accept the bona fides of the Senator's amendment but I literally came down the middle between both sides.</P>

We believe the legislation is good, important and in keeping with the spirit of social partnership.</P>

      <P>The Bill as drafted requires employees to go through the procedure set down in section 6(5) of the Bill before obtaining a second period of carer's leave for the same or another relevant person. The inclusion of the amendment proposed is therefore unnecessary. Such a requirement would, in any event, be likely to be interpreted by employees as unnecessarily bureaucratic. If employers have concerns regarding whether the relevant person is still in need of full-time care and attention, they are free to use the provision of section 18. Therefore, there is a provision elsewhere for what the Senator is trying to achieve.</P>

The employee must inform the employer that the person to be cared for is a person to whom the Social Welfare Act is relevant and give the dates on which he or she proposes to commence the leave period. The IBEC view that the notice proposed is not long enough is reflected in amendment No. 4 and a revised period of eight weeks is suggested. We are trying to achieve the best consensus.</P>

Section 12 provides for the postponement, curtailment and variation of the form in which carer's leave may be taken, by agreement between the employer and employee. The section also provides that where the carer's leave is postponed, curtailed or varied it may, subject to section 16 of the Bill, be taken at another time.

It was decided that the tribunal should be the appellate body under this Bill because of its previous experience as the appellate body under the Parental Leave Act, 1998, the Maternal Protection Act, 1994, and the Adoptive Leave, 1995. Given the nature and sensitivities of cases likely to be the subject of appeals under the Bill, we are satisfied that the tribunal is best placed to address such matters. The tribunal has traditionally dealt with individ<Col N="607" /> ual rights issues while the Labour Court has dealt with interest issues such as those involving trades unions and collective bargaining.

      <P>I thank the Members of the Seanad for their constructive comments. We had a very detailed <Col N="608" /> debate on Second Stage and today Senators have been very helpful in giving the Bill a speedy passage through the House. I was determined that this Bill be enacted before the summer because of its importance and I agree absolutely with Senator Cox who described the legislation as pioneering. I thank my officials and those in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs who have worked closely and tirelessly on this Bill.</P>
      <P>There is a lot of good legislation coming through our Department and part-time workers have been mentioned in the other House. Hopefully, that will be coming through this forum in the near future. There are lots of pressures on our officials to deal with all of the excellent legislation I am trying to steer through both Houses. Having said that, the ICTU and IBEC also have a role and that has been acknowledged here. They have again played a very important part in helping us get the right balance between employers and employees.</P>
      <P>The legislation is good and solid and I am delighted to be involved in bringing it before this House but I would not have managed to get it so far so speedily without the Senators' help. I thank not just Senator Coghlan but Senator Costello too who played a central role in our last debate. The House might like to know that the number of applications for the parallel carer benefit scheme now stands at 608 compared with 602 last Tuesday when we had our debate on Second Stage. The numbers of applications approved of and awarded by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs stands at 230 compared with 208 last Tuesday and I have no doubt that when the Bill is enacted the number of applications will increase significantly. It proves to all of us that this is important legislation and we have not even begun to get our message across or to advertise it.</P>
      <P>I said that the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and I will jointly launch an information campaign to get this information out to members of the public to make them aware that there is a new provision for them to get carer's benefit. In many cases they are getting the benefit but my role is to help them get leave from employment. I thank Members for their co-operation. It was very important to pass this speedily today in which Members have helped. I also thank them for their contribution in making the legislation as good as it is.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&ndash;A political party, the President, a member of either House of the Oireachtas, of the European Parliament, of a local authority or of Údarás na Gaeltachta, or a candidate for any of the said offices, shall not directly or indirectly accept a donation for political (including electoral) purposes from any person (including a body corporate) other than a Dáil elector.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment addresses a key issue in the Bill, namely that a political party shall not directly or indirectly accept a donation for political purposes from any person or body corporate. That is the key to our approach. Those involved should be Dáil electors and therefore Irish citizens and should be persons as distinct from a body corporate. Contributions should only come from that quarter. We have a particular difficulty in relation to corporate donations and this is not just a matter of a principled position. It is desirable that there should be no funding contributions to political parties, good, bad or indifferent, or from individuals to politicians. However, because there have been so many problems and controversies relating to this, resulting in tribunals being established, we see the difficulties that have arisen with political donations on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>Whether we like it, in the public mind we, as politicians, are now identified with brown paper bags. We are identified with donations and the public has made what is for them a logical connection, that donations are made for a political purpose. If one gets a large donation from a body corporate or an individual, people will reach what seems to them to be an obvious conclusion: that politicians are in the pocket of business and big business in particular.</P>
      <P>We have a responsibility to put our house in order and until we take the initiative on this and make hard decisions then we will not get the respect of the electorate that is required for politics. Politics should be above reproach. Plato said that those who aspire to politics should be people of the highest wisdom and that only those with wisdom, experience and maturity and who had reached the highest pinnacles were fit to govern their peers. At present the electorate would laugh if one asserted that that is the profession of which we are part and parcel. I ask the Minister of State to look at this from that point of view, not a party political or Opposition point of view. He should look at this from the perspective of what we must do to reform politics and change the attitude that has cast a huge shadow over all political activity in Ireland in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Money is at the heart of the problem. Until we can eliminate money from that problem substantially and significantly we cannot deal with this. I <Col N="610" /> am asking the Minister of State to look at this matter again and accept the amendment, which would change matters by allowing only a Dáil elector to provide a donation. This would also apply to areas outside the country. Large sums of money have been used for political purposes within this jurisdiction which emanated from people and organisations which have no direct contact with the electoral process here. They are certainly not citizens of Ireland but have huge influence on the way politics develops here.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to look at where we are and to look at this important legislation and put down a benchmark which shows how we want to go forward. We should do so in such a way as to allow us to say, after the legislation is passed, that this is what we are doing to reform the situation and to ensure that in future there are no allegations of corruption, bribery or interference in the political arena.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment.</P>
      <P>The distinction between my amendment and that of the Labour Party is subtle but there is no great difference. Amendment No. 1 would prohibit corporate donations while my amendment refers to certain people being allowed to make donations and disallows corporate donations. The same principle underlies both amendments and the reason for tabling them is the same.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello referred to Plato. I am not sure who said that if we did not learn from our history, we were doomed to repeat its mistakes but that is true here. The history about which we are talking is that being made in the tribunals. We recognise that nobody has been charged there but the implications of what appears to be going on have undermined public confidence in this profession.</P>
      <P>It is more of a profession than a career and should appear to be so. The distinction between the two is subtle but important. People devote themselves to public service for the good of the public. That is a profession. The public must recognise that those they have elected to do the job are above reproach. Unfortunately, they cannot do that today because of the relationship between large businesses and Government. They see that this relationship is a symbiotic one. The greater the contribution made, the more likely it is that influence will be won and legislation swayed.</P>
      <P>This is accepted in the United States where there is legalised lobbying by large groups such as the tobacco industry, the arms industry and the oil industry. We recently discussed in this House the proposed visit of President Bush to Europe. We are aware of his views concerning the oil lobby. We know that the Kyoto agreement, which is strongly supported in Europe, is being washed down. I do not doubt that there is an influential relationship between the large oil companies and the presidency of the United States.</P>

      <Col N="611" /> That kind of relationship may suggest to some people that we are all a little bent somewhere along the line. That is not a standard we want. We do not want to tell our young people that this is acceptable. It is not acceptable and the only way to make sure this message hits home is to break the link between business and politics. If the Minister were to accept the amendments in the spirit in which they are intended, it would be a large step in breaking the perceived link between big business and political influence. That is critical.</P>
    <P>The subject of amendments Nos. 29 and 30 may seem small. Amendment No. 29 seeks to reduce the sum from £2,000 to £500. However, the sum of £500 is adequate. It is a serious enough contribution but four times that amount is more than serious. It may require or demand influence.</P>
    <P>Another matter, which also influences Senator Costello's amendment concerns contributions from outside the State and the undue influence that may come from those. The possibility of influence by groups which may have little or no concept of what is happening in Ireland should be brought into the public domain. Through large contributions and emotional relationships, such groups may feel that they can improve Ireland. They often contribute to anarchists and terrorists who seek to overthrow the State. I believe that the Government has intentions in this regard, but I ask the Minister to take on board the points raised by Labour and Fine Gael with regard to the relationship between big business and political influence.</P>

      <P>I come to this with a different perspective than that put forward by many Members. There is a danger in referring to the tribunals. We must recognise that any payments that are now under investigation by the tribunals were from an era of total secrecy. There were no declarations of interest. That culture has changed.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a legal obligation on Members to declare all amounts in excess of £500. That brings transparency to the system, which is desirable and good. It is said that if the amounts are reduced and the payments are not allowed, this will remove bribery and corruption. That is a facile view. In trying to outdo each other on the high moral ground, there is a danger that we will shoot ourselves in the feet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should recognise that since the foundation of the State there has been a high degree of probity at all levels of administration, among professional and elected officials. There have been few transgressions, but where they occur they must be dealt with. A small minority who have dishonest inclinations in the future will not be <Col N="612" /> influenced by the limits proposed in these amendments. It is proper policing that is needed to ensure a proper culture. We pass much legislation in the Houses which is put in place because of human weakness. People will transgress all sorts of laws.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 suggests that there should be no contributions made from private sector interests, be they individual or corporate. Amendment No. 32 confines the level of contributions from individuals only. I have a difficulty in separating corporate contributions from individual contributions. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with corporations or individuals making a contribution to parties or individuals running for election. There is expense in the political process and as we have seen recently at home and abroad, the challenge is to keep people engaged in the democratic process and exercising their franchise. It is unhealthy for democracy that only a small proportion of the people exercise that franchise. It can lead to unrepresentative results.</P>
    <P>Political parties need large sums of money to administer their affairs. There is nothing wrong with that. All that expense should not be imposed on the taxpayer. A mix of private and public funding is the way forward. In relation to the amendments, the new limit of £2,000 in the Bill is acceptable and reasonable. I do not agree with Senator Coogan that £500 is a large amount of money. A person may incur expenses of that magnitude for one particular trip. A 300-mile round trip will incur such expenses. A sum of £500 is a small amount today. The £2,000 is pitched at an appropriate level.</P>
    <P>I said on Second Stage that the limit of £5,000 for political parties is unrealistically low. Having thought about it since Committee Stage, I feel it should be at least £25,000. However, I accept that the £5,000 limit is now part of the Bill and the Minister will not change that. The cost of running the main political parties runs into millions of pounds per year. To get a reasonable proportion of that money in contributions from those who may have like-minded views to a political party or an individual, and wish to support them, is not wrong in a transparent system. I am opposed to the amendments under discussion.</P>

      <P>These amendments propose to limit the giving of political donations to Dáil electors and set limits to donations of either £500 or £1,000. The subject matter of the amendments was discussed on Second Stage and Committee Stage when the arguments for and against were well made by Senators. I note that Fine Gael Members do not seem to be able to agree on the figure which should apply. In amendment No. 29 the suggested limit is £500, while in amendment No. 32 it is increased to £1,000.</P>

      <P>It would not be feasible to restrict donations to Dáil electors only. What about other electors who are not Dáil electors, such as those eligible to vote at European Parliament elections and local elections? Surely, in a free democratic system, these people should also be entitled to make a donation to a political party or candidate.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that it is practical or feasible to distinguish between corporate or non-corporate donations. None of those proposing the banning of corporate donations has sought to explain how to distinguish between an individual and a corporate contribution. We dealt with some of the questions which arise in that regard on previous Stages, but no legal explanation has been put forward by those proposing that a ban be imposed. As stated on Committee Stage, the Government sought legal opinion on this matter from a number of sources, all of which confirmed that it is not legally possible to make a definite distinction between the two in legislation and that it would not be possible to enforce that distinction.</P>
      <P>Most of the arguments in respect of this matter have, therefore, already been made in this House and the Lower House. It is not necessary to repeat them at this point. I cannot accept the amendments and ask the Senators to withdraw them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the Minister of State's reply. I have now had an opportunity to read amendments Nos. 29 to 32, inclusive, tabled by Fine Gael, and discover that they run along the same lines as the amendment in my name.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State's reply was inadequate. He stated that he received legal opinion in relation to this matter to the effect that it is neither practical nor feasible to separate corporate from personal donations. Previously, the Taoiseach stated that the legal opinion he obtained was to the effect that it is unconstitutional to separate them. Which opinion is correct? Why is it not possible for Members to be shown the text of the legal opinion which indicates that it is not practical or feasible to make a distinction between corporate and personal donations?</P>
      <P>My amendment would, if accepted, clarify the position because an elector is a person &ndash; a body corporate is not an elector. Where does the difficulty lie? The Minster of State indicated that the amendment does not take account of the position <i>vis-à-vis </i>Presidential elections, local elections, etc. If that is the case, I have no difficulty in removing the word &ldquo;Dáil&rdquo; from the amendment to change the text in order that it refers to citizens whose names appear on the register of electors in respect of all elections which take place in this jurisdiction. That would not be a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the will was there, there would not be prob<Col N="614" /> lems in this area. However, there is no will to make the separation or to have a reasonable threshold for or ceiling on donations. That is the problem. I do not accept what Senator Walsh said. A sum of £2,000 would be a sizeable personal donation for any candidate to receive. If we place a ceiling on the amount of money any candidate can spend in an election campaign, a single contribution of £2,000 will go a long way towards reaching it. A donation of £5,000 is extremely hefty. The difficulty is that we are seen by members of the public as being in the pocket of the corporate sector. If we allow significant sums of money to be donated by major business people or corporate entities, it will not matter if we protest that it is expensive to run an election campaign because people will believe that when we accept such money we must give something back in return.</P>
    <P>We must put our house in order. That is the kernel of this issue. Senator Coogan and I are proposing a structure that will allow us to go before the public and state, hands on hearts, that we have put in place a system that is not open to corruption or bribery. If we create such a system, no one will be able to state &ndash; everyone does so at present &ndash; that politics is corrupt. The sooner Members in both Houses realise that the better because otherwise democracy will be reduced and diminished and fewer people will vote in elections, etc. There are already serious signs that people do not trust politicians and are, therefore, not bothered to vote. If they do vote, they tend to oppose whatever politicians recommend. That was clearly shown by the result of the recent referendum.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the Minister of State's reply in respect of this extremely serious matter. If the amendments are not accepted, the legislation, particularly in terms of how it deals with the public's perception of politics, will be flawed when enacted.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&ndash;(1)The Referendum Commission is hereby renamed <i>An Coimisiún Toghcháin</i> or in the English language the Electoral Commission.</P>
      <P>(2) The Minister may by order assign to the said Commission such of his or her functions under the Electoral Acts, 1992 to 2001 as he or she considers fit.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment, which proposes to rename the Referendum Commission, seeks to assist the Minister of State and those who will succeed him. It appears to be rather inappropriate for a Minister to make key decisions in regard to electoral Acts. It would be more appropriate if an independent commission had the responsibility to do so, which would allow the Minister of State to operate at arm's length. He could assign the making of the decisions and functions, as he considers fit, to the independent body, which would be a more desirable approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, which is a repeat of a Committee Stage amendment, proposes to change the name of the Referendum Commission to the Electoral Commission and that the Minister would assign to it functions under the Electoral Acts. This issue is not appropriate to the Bill before us. The provisions in regard to the Referendum Commission are set out in the Referendum Act, 1998, and any changes in the commission's function would fall to be considered within the context of that Act and referendum law generally. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment and ask the Senator to withdraw it.</P>
      <P>The Referendum Commission is not a full-time body. It is re-established for each new referendum. As no one knows how frequently referenda will be held, it would not be practicable to have a full-time body. Four staff members of the Ombudsman's office were appointed to service referendum commissions when established. When no referenda are pending, the staff are engaged in work in the Ombudsman's office. If what the Senators envisage is the establishment of an electoral commission such as in other countries, this would obviously require substantial legislation involving detailed consultation with the different agencies concerned. A study of the position in other jurisdictions would also be necessary as most electoral commissions have different ranges and functions. It would also have implications for the decentralised responsibility for the conduct of elections as it would probably involve centralising authority in one body. I regret I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 20, line 16, to delete &ldquo;Clerk of the Seanad&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Chairman of the Appeal Board.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Following the debate on the last occasion, there seemed to be a clear distinction between the office of the Dáil and the office of the Seanad. The Seanad by its nature has no party political involvement, therefore, it would be inappropriate to involve the Clerk of the Seanad in matters of registration of a political party and decisions to be taken in terms of an appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="617" /> The amendment proposes to replace the &ldquo;Clerk of the Seanad&rdquo; by the &ldquo;Chairman of the Appeal Board&rdquo;. This would appear to be the appropriate method of dealing with the issue because the Clerk of the Seanad will not hear the appeal. Under the proposed legislation, the office of the Clerk of the Seanad is to be the channel whereby the appeal and the deposit will be registered. The clerk would then have the function of forfeiting it or handing it back as the case may be. The actual appeal mechanism is different because there will be an appeal board and a chairman of the appeal board. Why not remove the Clerk of the Seanad from a function which is totally inappropriate to the Seanad Office on constitutional grounds and send the registration appeal directly to the chairman because the Clerk of the Seanad will be handing the appeal to the chairperson who will be dealing with the body applying for registration? Why not rest all the functions in the appeal body and the chair of that appeal body, which would resolve the problem in regard to the Seanad?</P>

      <P>I am surprised the amendments have been tabled because I thought there was a full discussion on the matter and that I had given a reasonable explanation as to why the change being sought should not be granted.</P>
      <P>At present the Clerk of the Dáil, while acting as the registrar of political parties, receives applications for registration of a political party. In the event of a refusal, the party can appeal the decision to an appeals board consisting of a High Court judge as chairperson and the chairpersons of both Houses as ordinary members of the board. The registrar receives the appeal application. All sides of the House agreed last week that a person other than the registrar should be the recipient of the appeal. The Clerk of the Seanad, as the second highest official of the Houses of the Oireachtas, is now named as the recipient of an appeal. In normal circumstances, one might expect the appeal to be received by the clerk assistant but that would not be appropriate either as the clerk assistant acts for the registrar in the absence of the registrar and, in a particular case, may be the person who made the original decision. It is as an official of the Houses of the Oireachtas that the Clerk of the Seanad will receive an appeal application which will not interfere with his or her functions as Clerk of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>It is important to emphasise that this is not an onerous undertaking. There have been just three cases in the past ten years. The actions required where an appeal arises are straightforward. This includes publishing a notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, sending a copy of the appeal to the registrar of political parties, accepting a deposit of £300, lodging it in a bank account and making documentation available for inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> For the first time, the revised section 25 provides that any service, including the services of staff, that may be reasonably required by the appeal board for the purpose of an appeal shall be made available to it by the chairman of the Dáil from the joint staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas. While it is not for me to determine the allocation of staff in the Houses of the Oireachtas, it is plain from the new provision that the appeal board will be allocated staff to enable it to perform its functions once it is established.</P>
    <P>The appeal board is not a full-time body and would not be convened until after an appeal is received. The chairman of the appeal body would not be an appropriate person to receive the appeal application as the board would not be in existence at the time of receipt of the application. Is there any precedent for the proposal? Since 1937 the Clerk of the Dáil is nominated to receive appeal applications against the refusal of the Clerk of the Seanad to applications for registration on the panels for Seanad elections. Does this involve the Clerk of the Dáil interfering with the functions of the Seanad, as seems to be suggested by the Senator? I do not think so. If so, why have Senators not tabled amendments to ensure the Clerk of the Dáil does not accept such appeals? I cannot accept the amendments and I invite the Senator to do the sensible thing and withdraw them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I still feel that the Minister is wrong in what he proposes here. It is undesirable and he quotes a precedent which is not the same thing. The involvement of both Houses in exactly the same constitutional situation is not the proper way of going about it. The Minister has not given any reason the Clerk of the Seanad needs to be involved. He has not addressed the question of why the chairman of the appeal board cannot be the conduit for the appeal. The chairman of the appeal board and the board will make the decision so why should the Seanad be involved? Why is the clerk necessary and why can the letter not be sent to the chairman? </P>

      <P>We had a useful discussion on these three amendments the last day. The Minister seemed to be coming round to my view on the matter. We were talking about the extension of the right to stand for election to people detained in custody, prisoners and bankrupts. I would like to hear what the Minister has to say on the matter as he indicated he would look at it sympathetically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments which we discussed on Committee Stage would have the effect of removing two disqualifying criteria for membership of Dáil Éireann, namely, prisoners undergoing a sentence of imprisonment exceeding six months and undischarged bankrupts. I undertook to give more consideration to these disqualification categories on Report Stage. Having examined the matter further, I do not propose to accept the amendments.</P>
      <P>In considering the prisoner issue it is important to state clearly what is involved in this disqualification category. Paragraph (j) of section 41 of the Electoral Act, 1992, which the amendment proposes to delete, provides for the disqualification of any person receiving a sentence in excess of six months. It covers prisoners undergoing sentences for serious offences and will certainly cover those convicted for more serious criminal offences. On the other hand, a prisoner undergoing a sentence for a minor offence would in most cases not be disqualified. The consequences of imprisonment are severe. When a person receives a sentence of imprisonment he or she is deprived of his or her liberty, contact with persons outside prison are curtailed, he or she cannot engage in his or her normal occupation, movements are strictly controlled and normal actions associated with freedom of expression, association and movement are suppressed or curtailed. Against such a backdrop it is difficult to envisage how a prisoner serving a sentence exceeding six months would be in a position to discharge his or her functions as a Member of the Dáil if he or she was eligible for membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would also be inappropriate to provide in legislation that the important constitutional position of membership of the Dáil should be the one position a prisoner would be entitled to hold <Col N="620" /> while detained. A number of Senators referred to the fact that prisoners were elected to the Dáil in 1981, and this was the case. Two H-block candidates, Ciarán Doherty in Cavan-Monaghan and Paddy Agnew in Louth were elected. However, they were entitled to stand only because they were not incarcerated in this State. Interestingly, the position in Northern Ireland and the UK today is that persons sentenced or ordered to be imprisoned or detained indefinitely or for more than one year in the UK or Ireland, or who are unlawfully at large at a time when he or she would otherwise be detained, are disqualified from membership of the House of Commons. A case on a separate but related issue &ndash; voting by prisoners &ndash; was heard in the Supreme Court on 14 May last. It would be unwise to seek to legislate in this general area in advance of the Supreme Court decision and careful examination of the implications of that decision when it is delivered.</P>
    <P>In relation to bankruptcy, paragraph (<i>k</i>) of section 41 of the Electoral Act, 1992, provides that an undischarged bankrupt is not eligible for election to or membership of Dáil Éireann, a disqualification that has been a feature of Dáil electoral law since 1923. As I pointed out on Committee Stage, disqualification on grounds of bankruptcy is based on the view that a person who has been shown to be unable to conduct his or her affairs in a satisfactory manner should not be entrusted with the conduct of the affairs of the country. There is, of course, a case to be made against the disqualification of bankruptcy. Bankruptcy may arise from simple failure at business and does not necessarily denote misconduct, neglect or incompetence on the part of the bankrupt.</P>
    <P>On balance, I am in favour of retaining this disqualification which is mitigated by section 42(3) of the Electoral Act, 1992. That section provides for a period of grace of six months for a sitting Member of the Dáil who is adjudicated bankrupt to obtain a certificate of discharge under section 85(7) of the Bankruptcy Act, 1988, before the disqualification takes effect. If a certificate of discharge is obtained within this six month period the person does not cease to be a Member of the Dáil. In the context of the revised and strengthened donation and expenditure regime which this Bill will introduce, it could be considered inappropriate to allow a bankrupt to become or remain a TD with the consequent temptation that would arise in terms of being offered and accepting inappropriate financial assistance in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Both of these issues are matters that can be revisited when the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution has finalised its report on the institutions of the State. In view of what I have said I ask the Senator to consider withdrawing the amendments as I am not prepared to accept them at present.</P>

      <P>I have no intention of withdrawing them although it might be appropriate for the All-Party Committee on the Constitution to examine the issue. These are ongoing matters that have been part and parcel of the electoral system in this jurisdiction and the other jurisdiction for decades. I am not impressed by any of the arguments made by the Minister in relation to either prisoners or bankrupts standing for the Dáil. The simple principle should be there. If we go down the road of identifying categories that should be prohibited, there are many categories we could mention. The simple principle should be, let the electorate decide. It is not appropriate for us to stand in the way of the electorate's decision-making. Bankrupts are a throw-back to a bygone day when property was important in relation to voting.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes that, where practicable, a map of the location be inserted on the polling information card. I agreed on Committee Stage to accept an amendment to include the address of polling stations. While I agree with the sentiment of the amendment, I do not favour making a statutory requirement which may delay the issue of polling information cards in the event of premises being unavailable. Section 92 of the principal Act will now permit additional information to be included on an information card, including a map showing the location of the polling station, if possible. The amendment is therefore not needed. After the enactment of the Bill, I will consider how polling information cards can best be designed to include useful information for voters, along the lines suggested. I do not intend to accept the amendment as its objective has been achieved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not argue the case for this amendment as it was discussed at length on Committee Stage. It differs slightly from the original amendment which proposed polling from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. as earlier opening of polling stations may be desirable. The reason for this amendment is that the time for the opening and closing of polling stations should be defined. It should not change because of the time of year or depending on whether it is a general, local or presidential election or a referendum. We must eliminate the uncertainty regarding the opening and closing time of polling stations. Nobody is sure of the <Col N="623" /> details of polling as they change from election to election.</P>

It would not be appropriate in this case to involve a member of the Garda. I do not consider this area to be comparable to special voter circumstances as if one agent was selected, other parties would be entitled to appoint agents. It would be intimidating, for example, were a group of gardaí to arrive at a nursing home.

      <P>All these amendments are intended to assist people in finding their polling station and give a sense of an election taking place. The prohibition of canvassing, emblems and posters from a curtilage of 100 metres of the polling station has caused great difficulty. It is agreed that provisions need to be made to focus attention on the polling station, while ensuring all parties are treated equally. It seems that some of the Minister of State's proposals will discriminate against parties while favouring independent or individual candidates. The amendments under discussion, including those of the Minister of State, will help us to achieve the objectives I have outlined.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. The Minister of State has modified the rules relating to election day as posters may now be erected 50 metres, rather than 100 metres, from polling stations. The point was made on Committee Stage that a sense of atmosphere must be created near a polling station. I would not be averse to limiting the size of posters if they were allowed in the curtilage of the polling station, as they would help to indicate the presence of a polling station to voters. This may not be as important in rural areas as it is in urban areas, where indication of the polling station's location is necessary.</P>
      <P>As I stated on Committee Stage, I am not bothered about the measurement. I am trying to ensure no party or individual with substantial moneys to spend can erect large signage measuring 40 feet by 20 feet while another candidate erects a poster measuring 1 metre by 1 metre. A regulation should be introduced where each candidate would be limited to using posters of a certain size. If a party has five candidates, the size of the poster should be multiplied by five. It is a simple proposal and would be effective in reducing the number of posters outside polling stations, which is a waste of money anyway.</P>

      <P>Activity around polling stations on election day has always been part and parcel of informing the electorate about candidates in general, local and Presidential elections and issues in referenda. A ban on posters and other literature within 100 metres of polling stations was introduced a number of years ago. However, many would not know where polling stations were, particularly in large towns and cities, if it were not for the election material around them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is relaxing the ban on the erection of election posters to 50 metres. There are three roads leading to polling stations in a number of <Col N="625" /> towns and villages in north Westmeath, including Delvin, Castlepollard and Mullingar. Will candidates be permitted to erect a poster on each road? Will each candidate be allowed to erect a poster? An independent candidate could put up a poster on each road but if Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party had two or three candidates, they would still only be permitted to erect one poster. I compliment the Minister of State for addressing this problem but in the interest of fairness each candidate should be allowed to erect one poster.</P>
    <P>Will party workers who bring voters to polling stations and who must stay outside the current 100 metre exclusion zone be allowed to position themselves 50 metres from the polling station where the posters will be following the enactment of the legislation? I would welcome such a move. The regulation was introduced by Deputy Michael Smith when Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>The activity around polling stations at election time in the past provided an example to our young people and created a breeding ground for politics. Young people witnessed something interesting in which they could become involved. Many of us supported the party into which we were bred, born and reared, which was not a bad thing. When we were young elections were big events and we were able to participate in the campaigns. One would swear a wake was taking place in some parishes on election day nowadays. There is no activity whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Various plans are being implemented to generate interest among the electorate to vote but the ban on the provision of election literature near polling booths and on the activity of party workers was introduced to benefit candidates who were not organised, particularly in urban areas. The Minister of State represents a constituency which has both significant rural and urban populations. It is unfair that party workers who serve loyally for years cannot go near polling stations to support their candidates and it is bad for democracy. This issue should be addressed in the legislation. I welcome the provision that has been included but ask the Minister of State for his views on my contribution in support of Senator Coogan, who comes from the same constituency as the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered this matter since Committee Stage and propose in amendment No. 17 that the most suitable way to accommodate the views expressed is to reduce the 100 metre zone to 50 metres in section 147 of the Electoral Act, 1992. Amendment No. 16 seeks to <Col N="626" /> repeal the prohibition in section 147 of that Act on the display or distribution of any notice, sign or poster other than a notice, sign or poster displayed by the returning officer or card circular or other document relating to the election within 100 metres of a polling station. This is much wider than the proposal in section 33 of this legislation to allow one poster within 100 metres of the polling station on any approach road and the proposal in my amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 19 proposes that the posters be a maximum size of 1 metre by 1 metre. While this seems reasonable on the face of it, it would be very difficult to police on polling day. Polling staff and gardaí have enough other duties without asking them to measure posters, some of which could be placed high up on electricity and other poles. A question would also arise as to whether they would have any discretion if the poster measured 1 metre and 1 centimetre by 1 metre, for example. This provision would impose an onerous task on the Garda and bring the law into ridicule.</P>
      <P>While there is a demand for some sign of political activity at polling stations, as outlined by Senator Cassidy, my amendment will bring such activity close to the station while at the same time keeping it at a distance in order that electors will not be subject to canvassing as they enter the polling station. It is not proposed to amend the ban on canvassing within 100 metres of the polling station. It is an excellent provision, introduced by the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Padraig Flynn.</P>
      <P>However, because there has been no activity around polling stations and returning officers have not advertised the location of the polling stations adequately through signage voters have had difficulties finding polling stations. I have discussed this issue with the Minister since Committee Stage. Regulations will be introduced to require returning officers to erect large signage at each polling station indicating its location.</P>
      <P>We will try to facilitate the electorate any way we can. Nobody wants to go back to the days when there were scrums around the gateways to polling stations and people were practically intimidated and bombarded with literature. I have done it myself and it was not an edifying practice. None of us wants to return to it. We are dropping the proposal that posters for parties with a number of candidates should be the same size as those of a one candidate party. Posters can be erected 50 metres from the curtilage of the polling station. If three roads comply with the law and the regulations, they can be put up on the three roads provided they are not within 50 metres. One cannot canvass within 100 metres.</P>

      <P>This amendment, which is similar to a Committee Stage amendment, seeks to make <Col N="628" /> it a statutory obligation on a registration authority to notify a person on the register when it is proposed to delete that person's name from the new draft register or register unless the person has died. There is an existing statutory provision for this matter. The Minister has power under section 18 of the Electoral Act, 1992, to issue instructions to registration authorities in relation to the arrangements for the registration of electors to ensure uniformity and efficiency in the procedures to be followed by the various registration authorities. In September 1997 the Minister issued an instruction to all registration authorities requiring that where it is proposed not to include on the next year's draft register a person's name which is on the existing register, a notice should issue to the person concerned informing him or her that as the registration authority's normal inquiries failed to establish that he or she is still resident at the address he or she is currently registered at, it is proposed to omit his or her name from the next year's draft register unless he or she notifies the registration authority within ten days that he or she is still residing at the address.</P>
      <P>As this statutory provision covers the content of the amendment, I do not consider the amendment to be necessary. In case the instruction is not being fully complied with, the Minister has indicated that he will issue a reminder to the registration authorities on this matter.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2) No equipment may be approved for the purposes of <i>subsection (1)</i> unless a full technical description of the said equipment (including all source code and information regarding independent testing and verification relating thereto) has been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving a draft of the order approving the said equipment has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment and later amendments relate to electronic voting. A resolution should be put <Col N="629" /> before and approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas before any equipment is bought. It is important to know what type of equipment will be used, what expertise is required and the difficulties and complexities which could arise. Because there is a high level of technicality, the equipment should not be used until it has been clearly examined. Electronic voting is not necessary and it will be extremely difficult to operate. Until there is a more thorough examination of it and until we are satisfied it is foolproof, we should not introduce it. It will be expensive and it will require much back-up. I am not satisfied it will deal with the intricacies of our system of proportional representation in a satisfactory manner.</P>
    <P>That issue has not been dealt with nor have any of us in this House been given a demonstration of the new system. We should give it serious consideration and examine it in a detailed and comprehensive manner because this is a fundamental change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I voted against the introduction of electronic voting because I have not been familiarised with it. I am not blaming anyone for that, but I was not informed that a course or exhibition had been organised to demonstrate how it would operate. Even if I had attended such a course, I am not sure I would know how it operates because it involves technical skill.</P>
      <P>A valid point has been made that voting, through the use of proportional representation, tells us what people are thinking and how they feel about a person, subject, party or policy. Indicative of that is the social and political phenomenon of knowing where the number two and three votes are coming from, which indicates public opinion on certain issues. That will be lost if this system is introduced. It should be examined by both Houses and by the Committee on the Environment and Local Government before it is introduced. If it is introduced, there will be a loss of knowledge about voting patterns.</P>
      <P>Many people are also frightened by technology. If elderly people hear they must use a computer, they will be inclined to avoid voting. We have already seen how difficult it is to get people to vote without putting another obstacle in their way. I know the Minister of State will say it will make things easy. However, it is one thing to tell someone it will make it easy and another thing to make a person realise how easy it is.</P>

Under the current practice, if there are 900,000 votes in a box, a party or political candidate will know that there are 200, 400 or 450 No. 1 votes in that box. While that practice was unofficial practice, it was still an important motivating factor for the public representative in the main and the political parties in general in terms of how much they were appreciated by the people in their parish.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to seek legal opinion on this matter. He has the best legal advice available to him and I fully appreciate the position in which he finds himself. He is one of the most senior, respected and long-serving Ministers in either House and I thank him for his contribution over many years. With his energy and experience, I have to accept his advice but he knows where all parties in the House are coming from on this issue, and it is not just the Government side. Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour are anxious that the practice of using the ballot box will be retained in some way, either officially or unofficially, as it has been for generations.</P>

      <P>I will not repeat what I said on Committee Stage, but will the Minister of State confirm that the equipment used will be capable of giving the results box by box? Various Senators outlined the reasons for that. That information, be it for policy planning or political activity, is important.</P>
      <P>If there is any legal reservation in relation to this issue, perhaps it could apply to boxes where the votes cast would be above, say, 100 votes, or something like that. That area could be examined, but the information would be invaluable. As we said previously, one of the greatest challenges in the western world is to keep people engaged in the democratic process and participating by exercising their franchise. Obviously, information to political parties can be fundamental to the continuation of that. Any aid that can be utilised should be, and this is one such area.</P>

      <P>This amendment, which is generally similar to the amendment discussed on Committee Stage, proposes a new subsection to section 36 to provide that the Minister would not be able to approve the use of voting system equipment under subsection (1) until a draft ministerial order is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, including the laying before both Houses of technical documentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I explained the position on the technical documentation and the testing of the system last week <Col N="631" />&ndash; I presume there is no need to repeat that again. It is only after the receipt of reports on the testing of the system that the Minister will seek Government approval for the use of the new system at elections. As I said last week, all reports will be available and will be lodged in the Oireachtas Library. I do not consider it necessary that a draft ministerial order be brought before both Houses as the voting machine is not a new development and is used in other countries.</P>
    <P>When this issue was being debated last week, a question arose about the knowledge of political parties in terms of the way the machines operate and the opportunity for political parties to look at the machines doing mock election activity, and Senator Costello said his party had not been informed.</P>

      <P>I would like to record that on 15 September 1999, the following letter issued to the Labour Party:</P>
      <P>As discussed on the telephone this morning, the Department will be testing in October and November four machines which enable electronic voting and counting to take place at elections. No decisions have been taken on the use of such machines which would in any event require amending legislation. [That is what we are doing now].</P>
      <P>The Minister has suggested that a demonstration of the equipment be given to Members of the Oireachtas and that the most suitable time might be at the end of parliamentary party meetings. Deputy Gilmore saw the equipment earlier this year.</P>
      <P>If the Labour Party wished to see a demonstration of one or more of the machines, which will take about 15 minutes, please contact the undersigned.</P>
      <P>I just wanted to clear up that aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Coogan said that elderly people would be afraid of these machines and reluctant to go to the polling station to vote. It has not been the experience in other countries where they have introduced electronic voting that elderly people have been afraid of the system or that it has any effect. One of the encouraging aspects was that elderly people were well versed in the way it worked, capable of utilising it and not inhibited in any way. Ten years ago it might have presented a fear of the unknown to many people, but that is not so today. The experience has been that eld<Col N="632" /> erly people have had no difficulty using electronic voting machines.</P>
    <P>On the question of what we commonly call tally results, if we go electronic we will have the result within a very short time of all the cartridges being inserted into the machines. The results will become available within a few hours so we will not have those long, tortuous counts. Political parties seeking to establish the outcome of an election can examine each ballot box being emptied and sorted. They can then do a rough mark down as to who is getting the No. 1 votes, perhaps even the No. 2 votes, although we would need a very sophisticated machine to go further than that on the first count. That kind of information will be lost to the political system.</P>
    <P>I have to point out that there is no statutory provision or legal right to allow people observe the count and record the voting pattern in each polling station as the ballot papers are being sorted. That practice has been exercised but it has not been provided for in law. The law lays down very strict conditions. Indeed, there is a provision in the Constitution on the need for legislation to ensure the absolute secrecy of the ballot. That whole issue, therefore, hangs over this question.</P>
    <P>Senators Coogan and Cassidy raised this issue. Between now and the next Stage in the Dáil, I will seek the Attorney General's view on the potential to get that kind of information out of the system, which would comply with the constitutional requirements. Where there is a small number of voters in a box, it could be deemed that votes might be identifiable. Perhaps boxes containing less than 100 votes would be excluded, but I do not know if that would stand up to a legal challenge on constitutional grounds. We would have to be sure as to where we were going with that issue.</P>
    <P>It is a legal requirement to preserve the secrecy of the ballot in terms of how an individual votes. We could not condone or legislate for anything which would disclose that information in any way. The secrecy of the ballot must be assured at all times. The issue will be raised with the Attorney General before the Bill is introduced in the Dáil, or at some point before it is passed by the Dáil. I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

At present if, for whatever reason, a voter leaves the polling station without putting his or her ballot paper in the ballot box, he or she is not entitled to reapply for another ballot paper or put a ballot paper in the ballot box as the presiding officer would not be aware if the ballot paper was genuine or not, or how or who marked the paper.

This has given rise to difficulties for political parties, elected Members, candidates and the Public Office Commission in the interpre<Col N="640" /> tation of what constitutes an election expense under the Act. The aim of this amendment is to define, in a more constructive way, what election expenses encompass. For convenience and clarity these matters are set out in a new Schedule to the Bill together with, for the avoidance of doubt, specific exclusions. The list included in the Schedule features expenditures typical at an election. They include expenditure on advertising, publicity, posters, leaflets, office rental, transport, market research and payments to campaign workers. As before, the exclusions will include free postage under the Electoral Acts, payments or services and facilities provided out of public funds, the transmission of party political broadcasts and the payment of a deposit.</P>
      <P>Clarification is made to the list of exclusions in paragraph 2(<i>f</i>) of the Schedule to include accommodation as a reasonable living expense. The amendment to paragraph 2(<i>g</i>) clarifies the meaning of minor expenditure as expenditure of less than £100 on any item, by an individual out of his or her own resources, provided the costs are not recouped to the person. In addition, the exclusions include expenses in respect of property, services or facilities in so far as those expenses are met out of public funds.</P>
      <P>Changes are also being made to the expenditure regime for presidential and local elections. The legislation currently covers everything except listed exceptions. The problem with this approach is that unless an expenditure item is explicitly listed as excluded, it is by definition included. An example of the difficulties that can arise were seen at the Dublin South Central by-election when child care expenses of a candidate, which are not explicitly excluded under current law, were viewed as election expenditure. This has been dropped, it was unacceptable that such an interpretation should be made as it could discourage female candidates. There is no doubt similar instances will arise in the future. A definitive list of expenditure categories, qualified by a listing of exclusions, will assist all concerned to monitor and comply with the legislation. I recommend the amendment to the house.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 46:</P>
      <P>In page 66, to delete lines 13 to 16 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>l</i>) in section 32 by the substitution of &lsquo;£14,460' for the sum mentioned in subparagraph (i), &lsquo;£17,600' for the sum mentioned in subparagraph (ii) and &lsquo;£20,700' for the sum mentioned in subparagraph (iii) of subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) and by the addition to subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) of &lsquo;and that the figures referred to in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) increase to remain in line with the consumer price index which shall be reviewed annually';&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" /> This is a very simple but important amendment. It refers to the collection and expenditure of money. It also ensures balance between candidates. I propose the simple formula of taking the provisions of the 1997 Act and linking increases to the consumer price index. That is fair. If it was fair in 1997 why is it no longer fair? Accounting for the consumer price index there is an increase from £14,000 to £14,460. That is a substantial sum, although Senator Walsh says it is only the revenue from one 600 mile trip. The increases proposed by the Government are totally disproportionate. In one case you are talking about £6,000, in another, £7,000, and £10,000 somewhere else. A 50% increase is too much. If the 1997 provision was good enough it should be related to the consumer price index. Will the Minister of State explain the basis for these figures? This means the larger party with the larger collection will be able to spend the most. It is a simple inequity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the amendment and second it. This is one of the legislation's controversial areas. The proposals in the legislation would have the effect of allowing a 50% increase in expenditure per candidate and the party with larger numbers of candidates is the party that will have by far the largest expenditure. That is wrong and I cannot see why there is such a substantial increase. The consumer price index is the way to go about this. The sum thus calculated is reasonable and fairer. These new increases will ensure the playing field is uneven for all candidates in the election. The danger is that it will allow and encourage abuse whereby token candidates are put forward to gain extra funding. That would be a very undesirable development were it to take place. This sum is very substantial and likely to allow the major party in the region of £1 million in extra expenditure over the course of a general election. That is not the way we should be going. We already had a long discussion about public perception and how money seems to be the root of all evil in politics today. Increasing by 50% the amount of money available to, and spent by, each candidate is a detrimental move. We should be moving forward in a much more positive fashion, reducing the amount which can be spent in elections. It should be clear to the public that money is not the centre of political activity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the arguments being made as an intolerable interference with the democratic process. There is a need to have the process accessible and open to the most vigorous campaigns, anyone who wishes to participate should be able to do so. If one imposes limits, one is conferring an advantage on sitting members when name recognition is long established by those who have been involved in the process. Now if someone wants to contest an election as a first time candidate, he or she has only the period of the campaign in which to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="642" /> Limits are very questionable in a proper democracy. I have seen no evidence of a relationship between the amount spent in a campaign and electoral success and there are many instances of people spending a lot of money and doing very poorly in elections. It should be open to people to spend their own money if they wish, particularly when there are limits to contributions that will act as a brake.</P>
    <P>There is a by-election in Tipperary South and one candidate has the advantage of being able to recycle his posters. Others are not in that position because it is their first time out and they did not participate in the last by-election. All parties would probably admit that because of the limits people are photocopying material rather than printing it, which is amateurish. That is not the way to run our political system. We can all act whiter than white but we are going from one extreme to another here. Interfering in the process undermines the system of democracy and does not enhance it, which is what we should be doing. When one looks at the limits, 50% of those limits is taken up by parties at national level. Therefore the amount available to a candidate is far less at constituency level. As a consequence, independent candidates may have an advantage.</P>
    <P>This needs to be looked at. The amendment is going in the wrong direction. We have tied politics into such a knot that it will be unattractive for anyone to participate in it. One thing that is needed in politics is renewal and regeneration. It is like a business. The system should facilitate that happening. By imposing limits one is interfering with the process by conferring an advantage on those who are sitting members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to replace the expenditure limits proposed in the Bill by the present limits, rounded up by nearly £100. Arguments concerning expenditure limits were extensively debated on Second and Committee Stages and it is not necessary to repeat them at this point. There is a strong case for increased expenditure limits and the amounts proposed are in line with the limits proposed by the Minister in 1997. The two lower limits, adjusted for inflation, are less than the Minister's proposed 1997 amounts. Costs of printing, advertisements and costs associated with canvassing, such as petrol and food, are high and have increased greatly since 1997. I consider the proposed limits reasonable and that they would permit a candidate to run a reasonable campaign without the need to watch every penny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen the difficulties parties now confront when it comes to keeping a tally of expenditure and the consequences of exceeding those limits can be quite calamitous for individual candidates and parties. Extreme caution has to be exercised and putting in tight limits would create exceptional difficulties, particularly when one must take into account that expenditure by the party at national and local level is combined. In <Col N="643" /> that sense these levels are not available to the candidate on the ground in his or her constituency. A one page or half page advertisement in a provincial newspaper runs to thousands of pounds and one will not be long spending these kinds of amounts. That is the unfortunate reality in which we live &ndash; elections are expensive.</P>
    <P>The Government has gone some way towards helping to fund political parties with other proposals but in this case there is no State funding available to pay for this expenditure. Money has to be raised locally, as Members are aware, through raffles, golf outings, race nights and whatever Members can think of. As these are people who will be in the national Parliament advocating prudence and good management, it is essential that they can run their own campaigns in a prudent and efficient way enabling the bills to be paid when they come in after the election. There are many responsibilities nowadays on those offering themselves for election to the national Parliament and I consider these limits reasonable in view of the kinds of expenses that will be incurred and the divide between local and national expenditure.</P>
    <P>I am a member of a small party which has rarely run more than one candidate per constituency and we accept these figures as being reasonable. I find it difficult to understand the arguments being made by some Labour Party spokesperson when these figures are mentioned. One would imagine that the money was being given by the State and that larger parties were going to benefit enormously. That was the implication and our partners in Government were named as the party that would benefit but these will apply across the board. If anyone wants to get out and raise funds to achieve success, they must work at it.</P>
    <P>The limits are reasonable enough. One might say: &ldquo;God be with the days when there were no limits,&rdquo; but extraordinary sums were not spent on electioneering in those days either, though there were no limits at all. Money does not grow on trees and people do not throw that much money at political parties.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to extend postal voting provided for in section 63 of the Electoral Act, 1997 &ndash; for electors whose occupation, service or employment renders it unlikely that they will be able to go to a polling station on polling day &ndash; to include the personal circumstances of an elector. This would effectively mean that postal voting would be available on demand as registration authorities would not be able to decide what personal circumstances should be allowed.</P>
      <P>Extending postal voting to all electors would require serious consideration. While there might be a case for extending it to electors going on holidays or into hospital, the matter requires serious consideration having regard to maintaining the secrecy and integrity of the ballot paper. It would also be of use to evaluate the experience in the United Kingdom where universal postal voting arrangements were available at the recent elections.</P>
      <P>Concerns have also been expressed about extended postal voting arrangements in the USA. The findings of a recent study of turnout found that liberal or no-fault absentee voting limits voter turnout, early voting hurts voter turnout, continuation of early voting and liberal and no-fault absentee voting has had a mixed effect on voter turnout, election day registration helps turnout in elections which generate late interest, and mail ballots do not produce an impact on voter turnout. In view of this, I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment as I cannot accept it.</P>

We do not seem able to find such a mechanism. This is because there is no will to do so. At the same time, we wring our hands and say that the electoral turnout is lower than it should <Col N="646" /> be. It is, but we should be encouraging those interested in voting to vote.

    <P>I want to suggest something different for Seanad elections. We should have a fresh look at the panels. It is out of date that there are only five seats on the educational and cultural panel whereas there are 11 on the agricultural and labour panels. Likewise, there are discrepancies between the panels. It goes from a high of 11 to a low of five. I am attempting to introduce a measure of equality in so far as that can be done. I have proposed three nine seaters and two eight seaters. That would ensure greater numbers. <Col N="649" /> There would be a relatively equal number of Senators on each panel and it would bring into line the differences which have developed during the years in terms of the importance of different areas. Culture and education merit more than five seats on their panel. Agriculture has declined during the years and perhaps does not merit 11 seats. Likewise, the labour panel can be brought to greater equality also. The business and commercial areas are major ones at this time.</P>
    <P>I propose a level playing pitch for all panels. It would be a preferable way of progressing. This is a useful opportunity to have a look at the panels to see whether they merit an equality of seats on each.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who took part in the debates on the various Stages of the Bill for their constructive approach. I appreciate the amount of time and effort they invested in studying the legislation and drafting amendments. I understand that it can be disappointing when one's amendments are not accepted, but this will always happen when political judgments have to be made. I sought, as far as possible, to try to accommodate the suggestions that were made. <Col N="654" /> However, while we will have to agree to disagree on certain matters, I believe the debate was courteous, constructive and thorough.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains many progressive provisions to assist in the registration of electors and the conduct of elections. It is important that the Oireachtas continually reviews electoral matters to ensure that the procedures employed are suitable for a changing environment. While ensuring that the secrecy and integrity of the ballot is maintained, other procedures, as far as is practicable, should be such as will facilitate maximum participation in the electoral process.</P>
      <P>I was somewhat surprised at the level of doubt expressed at the prospect of direct vote recording and electronic vote counting. This may arise from a lack of knowledge of the system and is, perhaps, understandable. The provisions in the Bill are enabling and it is needless to say the Government will not agree to the use of any system unless it is convinced that system will meet the objectives set for it. The current position is that the Government has agreed, in principle, to the use of direct vote recording and electronic vote counting, subject to satisfactory testing of the system to ensure that it is suitable for Irish electoral conditions. The Department expects to receive delivery of six voting machines, together with the necessary software, in July. Due to the holiday season, intensive testing will not commence until September.</P>
      <P>The Minister will invite representatives from political parties to join the steering group overseeing the testing of the system. In addition, when the voting machines are delivered, Government officials will provide demonstrations to party spokespersons, individual Members or groups of Members. The Government would wish to reach an all-party consensus, if at all possible, on this system. All testing reports, specifications and documentation relevant to the voting machines and software will be placed in the Oireachtas Library for the information of Members and Department officials will facilitate Members in providing information on the system. In addition, publicity and information programmes for the public will be carried out before use.</P>
      <P>The Bill also contains important provisions concerning a limitation on the size of political donations, a prohibition on certain donations from abroad and matters relating to the opening of special accounts for political donations. I consider that these measures will go a long way towards allaying public concerns about donations to political parties and individual politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members will be aware that the Minister has recently been indisposed, which resulted in others being obliged to take responsibility for some of the work he had commenced. He regrets his inability to be present. I thank Members for the constructive approach adopted on the various <Col N="655" /> Stages. I particularly thank Senators Coogan and Costello for their co-operation. I know we have not met all their requirements, but in my opinion the Bill makes a major contribution to the area of local government and heralds the dawn of a new era. In addition, it will lead to our embracing information technology to a greater degree and it will be good to see the eventual introduction of electronic voting, as far as possible, with the agreement of all Members of the Oireachtas. I assure anyone with concerns about this matter that it is not intended to rush the introduction of electronic voting and it has not yet been decided whether a pilot scheme for its use will be launched during the next election. The Government is proceeding cautiously with its testing programme and will keep Members on all sides informed to the greatest degree possible before final decisions are arrived at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his kind words. I would like him to convey to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government our wishes that he will be restored to full health in the immediate future. I compliment the Minister of State, who was thrown in at the deep end, on the rapid manner in which he brought himself up to speed on this legislation which, on the surface, might appear simple but which is, in fact, quite technical in nature. His experience as a Minister and Minister of State aided him in becoming familiar with the legislation and he dealt with the debate in a very able and efficient manner.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the main focus of the media and members of the public will be on political donations. I regret the Minister of State could not take on board my recommendations and those of the Labour Party regarding the relationship between political donations and corporate bodies.</P>
      <P>The electronic voting system heralds a new era but there is no doubt there will be a certain loss. There was a great relationship between tallymen and the voting structure in their attempts to work out the permutations. It was not wonderful for candidates but the public and the people who supported candidates had a wonderful time working out the relationship between third and fourth preferences and transfers and such like. That will be a loss, unfortunately. I look forward to seeing how the system works. I do not know how the breakdown came about that I and a few other Members were not informed there was an opportunity to see it in operation. We can do that in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, I was not allowed to speak a second time because of rules and regulations. I had wanted to ask the Minister of State about the legal opinion he received on the distinction between corporate and individual donations. Will he circulate to me and to Senator Costello an <Col N="656" /> explanation why a distinction cannot be made between the two?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with Senator Coogan's remarks and compliment the Minister of State on the manner in which he handled the legislation. Having come in at short notice, he has done remarkably well. I convey my good wishes to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government that he gets well soon. I am sure he will be in the Seanad with the Local Government Bill before long.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State and I disagreed fundamentally on some elements of the Bill, such as corporate donations and spending limits in constituencies. I believed these were the areas which required most action from politicians to show the political process was not too closely linked to big business or money. I am sure the Minister of State and I will continue to disagree on those.</P>
      <P>I am reassured by what the Minister of State said about trying to achieve all-party consensus on electronic voting and that it will proceed only if we are assured business can be conducted in a safe and secure fashion.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on the courteous manner in which he dealt with the debate. I also compliment his officials on putting together what is in most cases good legislation, with the caveats I have highlighted. It is a job well done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Minister of State in his compliments to Opposition Members who did a great deal of work in tabling many amendments which enhanced the debate and probed various aspects of the Bill. I will not re-open the nebulous debate on corporate and individual donations. We dealt with that during the course of the discussion on the Bill.</P>
      <P>I also join in the compliments to the Minister of State who hit the ground running and whose experience and expertise in the area was brought into play when he took possession of the Bill at short notice. I join those who wish the Minister for the Environment and Local Government well. We hope to see him back in good health soon.</P>
      <P>Through the Department and the Ministers of State, Deputies Molloy and Dan Wallace, much valuable legislation has been enacted of which this is certainly a part. The main aspect of the Bill is undoubtedly the use of information technology and computers for electronic voting. It behoves us as one of the leaders in that area to apply best practice to all aspects of administration and voting. It will change the process of voting and, I hope, be an attraction for people to participate and vote. I hope the officials who played a significant part will find a way to ensure that, when electronic voting is in place, we will get the detailed information necessary for us to conduct our political affairs vigorously and competitively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I raise is the threatened loss of a teacher for the forthcoming school year in St. Joseph's primary school in East Wall, Dublin. I raised the same matter this time last year. The school was threatened with the loss of a teacher and the campaign to retain the teacher was successful on that occasion. It is a different matter this time because the numbers are 12 short of the figure needed to retain the teacher. It is the same old story of the school not having sufficient numbers at a certain point even though it may have them at a later stage.</P>
      <P>The school in question is in a disadvantaged area. It has been unfortunate in not receiving the benefits of the Breaking the Cycle scheme, which it should have. The end result of the loss of the teacher in this case is that classes will be doubled and the remedial teacher will have to take time away from remedial work which is needed in a disadvantaged area. The school will lose a teacher who is happy to stay on at a time when it is unable to employ a resource teacher on a temporary basis and a specialist teacher because no one is interested in taking up a job in a deprived area of the inner city.</P>
      <P>The children need all the resources they can get. In an era of considerable Exchequer surpluses, I would have thought a school in a disadvantaged area, which would have easily retained the teacher had it been granted the Breaking the Cycle scheme, would not be threatened with the loss of a teacher. The danger is that, once a teacher is lost and classes must double up, more parents will take their children out of the school and send them to a school with a better pupil-teacher ratio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable development in the area is on the horizon as part of the docklands development. Property has been bought in the area, not necessarily by people with families. However, with 20% of private development now going to social and affordable housing, this will mean families will move into the area, and we should be prepared <Col N="658" /> for that. Will the Minister of State reassure us the teacher in question will not be lost?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to outline to the House the current position in regard to the staffing at St. Joseph's primary school, East Wall, Dublin 2. The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners. The enrolment at the school in question has decreased from 234 pupils on 30 September 1999 to 218 pupils on 30 September 2000. This latter enrolment will entitle the school to a staffing of a principal and eight mainstream class teachers for the 2001-02 school year. An enrolment of 240 pupils on 30 September, 2000 was required for the retention of the post of the ninth mainstream class teacher. In addition, the school has the services of a learning support teacher, a concessionary teacher, due to the school's disadvantaged status, and a shared home-school liaison teacher.</P>
      <P>The only deviation from the agreed schedule to which the Minister referred is in the case of schools that are experiencing a large increase in enrolments. In such cases, an additional staffing post may be sanctioned by the Department of Education and Science if the school meets the defined criteria as outlined in Circular 12/01 which recently issued to schools. In the case of St. Joseph's, an enrolment of 245 pupils on 30 September 2001 would be required to meet the criteria as outlined in Circular 12/01.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science launched the new programme, Giving Children an Even Break, in January to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. Schools participating in the programme are eligible to receive a range of additional supports, including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.</P>
      <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the new programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils will be supported, where necessary, over the three year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes, infants to second class, and a pupil-teacher ratio of 29:1 in senior classes, third to sixth classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school in question is included in the urban dimension of the programme and is eligible to <Col N="659" /> receive supplementary grant aid of £1,860 towards the provision of suitable educational supports for the pupils concerned in respect of the current school year. The school was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff, <Col N="660" /> based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the school as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.</P>
