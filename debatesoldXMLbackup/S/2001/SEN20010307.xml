      <P>I have received notice from Senator Caffrey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to approve the grant application which is necessary to complete Ballina Sports Complex, County Mayo, which is now boarded up through lack of funding even though the project is 80% completed.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline the restructuring of community employment projects in primary and second level schools and how she proposes to cater for the existing community employment workers and supervisors in the schools.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Trustee Savings Banks (Amendment) Bill, 2000, Second Stage, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes; No. 2, Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Bill, 2001 &ndash; all Stages, to be taken at 2 p.m., with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes and on which Senators may share time; No. 18, motion No. 27, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and No. 2, if not previously concluded, to be resumed thereafter.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said yesterday, my party will co-operate fully in trying to get this emergency legislation enacted. When the Government asks <Col N="874" /> that the normal procedures be short-circuited, there is an expectation that it will co-operate also. I attach no blame whatsoever to the Leader in what I have to say but we were assured yesterday that the Bill would be in our pigeonholes at 4 p.m. It arrived at 10 a.m. today and did not include an explanatory memorandum. A briefing was arranged with officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development with our spokesperson and other spokespersons on agriculture from this House, but the officials did not turn up this morning. Our spokesperson was left hanging around waiting and that meeting has not yet taken place.</P>
      <P>We all know emergency legislation is very dangerous legislation and that on more than one occasion it has ended up before the courts because it was rushed through and sufficient care and attention was not given to it. The Opposition has been treated very badly by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development by the discourtesy shown in the briefing not taking place this morning and the late availability of the Bill. In my experience on the other side of the floor, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has consistently treated this House in the worst way possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It has regarded this House as simply a place where Bills should be rubber-stamped at the convenience of the Department. Of all Departments, it has consistently been the most cavalier in its treatment of this House. That behaviour has continued in relation to this Bill. I register the strongest possible protest at the way in which this has been done. That does not mean we will not co-operate. If the Leader wants to make extra time available, the Progressive Democrats could postpone its Private Members' motion tonight and we will not claim our time next week. Our space next week could be made available to the Progressive Democrats if more time is needed this evening. I again register my protest at the way in which this matter has been handled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Bill will be taken at 2 p.m. It is important to spend the remaining time debating it. I strongly support what Senator Manning has said, that if the Progressive Democrats were prepared to yield its time, it would give us an opportunity for a really serious discussion on this Bill. It is a critical moment in the life of the country economically and socially as well as agriculturally and Senators should have the opportunity to discuss it fully. There was a very important, wide-ranging and clear debate on foot and mouth disease a week ago but there was no coverage of it. That is a pity but at least it was indicated on the airwaves today that this Bill would be taken in the Seanad first. We should treat the material here with the greatest possible seriousness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I made a mistake when I spoke earlier. I said there was no explanatory memorandum with the Bill when, in fact, there was. I would like to put the record straight on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with everything that has been said in relation to the introduction of this legislation. We were promised that the Bill would be in our pigeonholes by 4 p.m. yesterday. It has still not arrived in my pigeonhole and I do not think it is good enough that we have to go to the stationery office to get a Bill. I had thought that because of the urgency of the situation we were to take all Stages today. We should not have to take the Trustee Savings Banks (Amendment) Bill until 2 p.m. as there is no rush on it.</P>
      <P>It is bad form to make an announcement that there is a need to take the legislation in question as a matter of urgency and then not give us an opportunity to study it. We will not have an opportunity to be briefed on the legislation prior to its introduction. This is extremely unsatisfactory. It would be better if the Leader of the House waited until tomorrow. We can deal with the legislation when it arrives but it should not be finalised today. The debate should continue until tomorrow to give us an opportunity to reflect on it. There is a tendency to get some elements of emergency legislation wrong. Given that the debate is not due to start until this afternoon, it should continue on Thursday to give us time to reflect on the legislation overnight and to come up with amendments for Committee and Report Stages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition has made a suggestion regarding Private Members' time which I am reluctant to sacrifice because the motion is topical. We are all anxious to facilitate the legislation and ensure it is passed as quickly as possible, but taking Committee and remaining Stages tomorrow morning would not help because it would mean that the Dáil might not be able to deal with the Bill and result in it coming back to us. If Senator Manning is agreeable and if, as the case may be, many Members wish to speak at 6 p.m., we can review progress at 5 p.m and perhaps make way to allow others to speak on the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a leak to one of the Sunday newspapers on the strategic management initiative in the Garda Síochána. It appears that a report prepared by Deloitte &amp; Touche for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will suggest that at least 100 rural Garda stations should close. Any station with four members or less will be earmarked for closure. That will be the criterion. That would be crazy. Some of the most serious and vicious crimes in the last ten or 12 years have been perpetrated in rural areas. There have been attacks on elderly people and all kinds of robberies. Everybody agrees that the answer is more gardaí in rural areas. I take it that <Col N="876" /> the leak was an inspired one and that the report is imminent. When it becomes available, the Leader of the House should allow time for a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, and the Minister for State at that Department, Deputy Davern, on their excellent work in keeping the country free from foot and mouth disease. I received a complaint from a constituent about hill walkers who tried to pass through a sheep farm in a mountain area. The person concerned had to call the Garda to stop them. Something similar happened in County Wicklow. The people concerned are intelligent, educated and upright. It is sad that they would treat a serious problem in such a flippant manner. I ask the Leader of the House to arrange a debate on tourism and hill walking in particular. While people wish to comply, there must be rules and regulations which the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation should in place to enable the matter to be controlled properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree in the strongest possible terms with Senator Manning on the publication of the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Bill. Sadly, there are some cowboys out there. We, therefore, agree with the general outline issued publicly by the Minister. This House, however, is being treated as a rubber stamp and that is disgraceful. We should be afforded a proper opportunity to scrutinise the Bill in some detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the suggestion that there is no real need to deal with the Trustee Savings Banks (Amendment) Bill. It is legislation that could have done with a lot more reflection. It is unique legislation which involves the expropriation of a bank by the State in order to sell it to make money for the State. It is, therefore, particularly peculiar legislation. There is a basic constitutional issue involved here which Departments seem to forget. The Oireachtas does not exist to be helpful to Departments. Departments are part of Government and, therefore, accountable to the Oireachtas. This legislation was capable of being disseminated with great hooh-ha to all the media yesterday but was not available to Members of the Oireachtas until 10 a.m. today. That is not a printing problem or anything of the sort. It is a problem of priorities in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Its priority was to get it to the media and not to those they regard as rubber stamps. There is a constitutional issue here, the Department is subordinate to the Oireachtas, and I ask the Cathaoirleach to raise this issue with the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concerns of Senators. Senator Ryan suggested we need not deal with the Trustee Savings Bank, but that is not the issue. Even if we could take the Bill in five minutes' time the issue is that the spokes<Col N="877" /> persons will not be briefed. This Bill deals not only with foot and mouth issues but with the eradication and dealings of other diseases. It will have to stand the test of time and I cannot understand why it is being rushed through in this manner.</P>
      <P>The Leader promised some time ago that we could debate autism and appropriate education for children suffering from autism. Can this debate be brought forward as quickly as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader consider a debate on the recently published National Roads Authority road development programme? It would give those of us concerned with the continuing east-west divide and the infrastructural deficiencies west of the Shannon the opportunity to raise issues pertinent to the report. The publication this morning in the papers of toll road legislation for the Kinnegad to Mullingar end of the N4, which will be brought up to motorway standard, is in stark contrast to the NRA's continuing refusal to upgrade the N4 from Mullingar to Sligo and so open that area of access to the west. The most recent report in that context confirmed that there is a deficiency in funding at infrastructural level leading to continuing economic disparities. Will the Leader give us the opportunity to question the priorities of the NRA in the context of road development over the next ten years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Disease of Animals (Amendment) Bill. While it is being taken at short notice the present situation requires specific legislation and I welcome the opportunity to discuss it today.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to the House to discuss the notice circulated in the press regarding taking the power to deal with waste management from local authorities? It is a diminution of power and, as councillors, we have responsibilities to those at county level. The demise of democracy because of our failure to do our duty would be a shame.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Jackman in relation to a debate on autism. This whole area is inadequately funded. I support Senator Mooney's request for a debate on the National Roads Authority report. Will the Leader arrange for that debate soon? Whatever about the N4 route, no funding is provided for the next number of years for the N5 national primary route.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Mooney's call for a debate on the NRA report. The NRA does not seem to be listening to the views of local authority members, indeed the unanimous views of local authorities. A case in point is the Vee of the Downs, where local people have been campaigning for a grade separated junction. This is a T-junction and it is a death-trap. I do not wish to pre-empt a debate but the point must be made.</P>

      <P>Many Senators have expressed their concerns about the emergency legislation which is being initiated in the House today. I agree with Senator Manning in his concern about the unavailability of copies of the Bill. I will inform the Secretaries General of the various Departments about our concerns and ask that copies of legislation be available to Members of this House at the same time as to Members of the Dáil. I am grateful for the full co-operation of the Opposition and the Government sides of the House in relation to the Bill. I assure the House that all the necessary time for a wide-ranging debate will be available.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello said that he was not personally briefed about the Bill. The Labour Party amendments are in the Clerk's office. However, I accept that the Bill was only delivered to Members just before 10 o'clock this morning.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis, the Deputy Leader, has asked for clarification of the Private Members' motion put down by the Progressive Democrats for tonight. In the event that the time is forfeited, I propose to devote time instead on Wednesday, 21 March.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor expressed concern about a Sunday newspaper article dealing with Garda stations. The Department has dismissed this article as pure speculation. I come from a neighbouring rural constituency and I fully agree with the Senator's sentiments. I have no difficulty in having a debate on this issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke called for a debate on the Objective One area and whether we are getting our fair share of the cake. We need a wide-ranging debate and it could be included in an all-day debate on funding for local authorities and on the National Roads Authority report as requested by Senators Mooney, Burke and Glynn.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell asked for a debate on tourism and hill walking, and I will arrange time for that. Senator Chambers asked that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government be present at a debate on the issue of local authorities and waste management. I will arrange time for that.</P>

    <Title>Trustee Savings Banks (Amendment) Bill, 2000: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Center">
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The trustees of TSB requested the Minister for Finance to authorise the reorganisation of the TSB last December. The Minister agreed to their request and published the Trustee Savings Banks (Amendment) Bill, 2000, which amends the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1989, to provide explicitly for the proposed sale mechanism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="879" /> The proposal from the trustees, made following a fully competitive sale process, involves selling the assets and transferring the liabilities of the bank to the Irish Life and Permanent Group. The employees of TSB are to benefit from an employee share ownership trust agreed along the lines of the ESOTs in both Eircom and ICC Bank. The offer from Irish Life and Permanent values the bank at £339 million.</P>
    <P>The trustees' request and accompanying documentation was examined by Arthur Andersen, the Minister's financial advisers, who advised him that the sale process had been carried out by the trustees and their advisers in an open, transparent and fair manner. Arthur Andersen further advised the Minister that the bid from Irish Life and Permanent plc. represented full value for the bank and recommended that the reorganisation should be authorised. The Minister also benefited from the legal advice of Arthur Cox.</P>
    <P>TSB was created by the amalgamation of the TSB Dublin and the Cork and Limerick Savings Bank in 1992. TSBs had been severely restricted in their range of activities prior to 1989. They were required to maintain at least 80% of their customers' deposits with the Exchequer and could only lend to personal customers. In response to the changing situation in the financial sector and in order to deal with the fact that the original purpose of TSBs was no longer widely relevant, the Dáil provided for a broadening of the range of activities of TSBs in the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1989. Since 1989, the TSB has grown significantly with customer deposits increasing from around £760 million to over £1,775 million at the end of 1999 and the number of employees increased from around 800 to in excess of 1,200 over the same period.</P>
    <P>The trustees have, with the agreement of the staff, reached the conclusion that the best interests of all stakeholders in the bank will be best served by moving on to the next stage of the process by changing the status of the TSB and merging with the Irish Life and Permanent Group. This change will give the bank access to the capital markets, a wider product range and a broader set of delivery and distribution channels which are all necessary if the bank is to continue to grow and prosper. Most importantly, it will provide continuity for staff and customers so that they can benefit from ongoing developments in the banking market. This merger will also result in a very strong third competitor in the retail banking market in Ireland and is, therefore, to be welcomed from a competition viewpoint.</P>
    <P>Section 57 of the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1989, provided for the reorganisation of trustee savings banks into companies. This section was incorporated in that Act because it was already clear from developments in the Irish financial markets and from experience in other European countries such as Britain, France and Denmark <Col N="880" /> that trustee savings banks would need to become companies in order to adapt.</P>
    <P>The provision for the reorganisation of trustee savings banks was very broadly drawn in the hope that it would cover any likely scenario. It was anticipated that it would only be necessary for the Minister for Finance to bring a draft of any order authorising the reorganisation of the TSB before both Houses of the Oireachtas and secure a motion of approval before proceeding.</P>
    <P>Section 57 of the 1989 Act provided for the reorganisation of trustee savings banks into either a company controlled by the Minister for Finance or one not controlled by the Minister. The latter option is being adopted for the current process but under section 57 as it currently stands, it is not possible to establish an ESOP in the TSB as it does not have any shares. It is also impossible to establish the ESOP following the merger of TSB's operations with Irish Permanent because it is not possible to establish an ESOT for a particular group of employees within one company. Therefore, it has proven necessary to have an intermediate step. The bank's assets and liabilities are, therefore, being transferred to Kencarol Limited, a subsidiary of Irish Life and Permanent, at which point the ESOT will be established and then immediately transferred, with the ESOT in place, to Irish Life and Permanent plc.</P>
    <P>Existing legislation does not permit the establishment of an employee share ownership plan by a company while it is controlled by another company. Accordingly, section 3 is required to allow for the establishment of the employee share ownership trust in Kencarol Limited while it is controlled by another company.</P>
    <P>The employees are in favour of the transaction. Their employee rights, including conditions of employment, are protected by employee rights legislation, especially the provisions of the European Communities (Safeguarding of Employees Rights on a Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations, 1980, SI 306 of 1980. This means that the employment of all employees of TSB Bank immediately prior to the sale is automatically transferred to the purchaser and that the same terms and conditions as they enjoyed with TSB will apply. This is expressly acknowledged in the business sale agreement between TSB Bank, Irish Life and Permanent plc and Kencarol Limited. As pension arrangements fall outside the scope of transfer of undertakings regulations, the business sale agreement provides for Irish Life and Permanent to continue the pension schemes in place in TSB prior to the sale.</P>
    <P>The employees will benefit from an employee share ownership trust under which 5% of the shares in Kencarol Limited will be transferred by the trustees to the ESOT in return for agreement to the flexibility agreement, and the ESOT is purchasing a further 9.9% stake in Kencarol Limited for £19.8 million. On completion of the reorganisation, the ESOT's Kencarol shares will be swapped for shares in Irish Life and Permanent plc worth £50.5 million. As with all other ESOTs, <Col N="881" /> the ESOT must hold the shares for a period of three years before it can allocate shares to employees through an approved profit sharing scheme. The maximum tax efficient allocation by the APSS is £10,000 per annum per employee. Senators should note that, while the flexibility agreement envisages redundancies, it is a requirement of the agreement that all redundancies arising from the transaction must be on a voluntary basis only.</P>
    <P>Separately from the Bill, provision is being made in this year's Finance Bill on Committee Stage to ensure the benefits of the ESOP due to the employees of the TSB will be maintained after the merger with Irish Permanent. Specific exemptions are being created for the TSB, and also for ICC Bank where the same issue arises.</P>
    <P>As amendments were required, the operation of section 57 in its entirety was examined and further amendments were proposed to provide for certainty, in legal terms, in its operation. The net effect is that the existing section 57 is being restated in the Bill in its entirety, but in an amended form. The main amendments are additions to provide for the ESOP, the structure of the transaction and certainty regarding the transfer of assets and liabilities, including property and customer accounts from the TSB to the Irish Life and Permanent group. The other amendments are of a minor nature.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the detail of the Bill, I wish to deal with two issues which may concern Senators: the use of the proceeds of the reorganisation and the possibility of branch closures. I will address the use of the proceeds issue first. There are two issues: a legal issue concerning the ownership of TSB Bank and whether, irrespective of the legal issue, the customers should receive a payment as a reward for being customers.</P>
    <P>The ownership of the TSB has been the subject of legal advice from the Attorney General. This advice is that trustee savings banks do not have members, are not owned by their depositors and that the relationship between TSB Bank and its customers is the same as the relationship between any bank and its customers. The conclusion of this advice is that the Oireachtas has the power to dispose of the assets and this was fully reflected in the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1989, which copperfastened the legal position. The customers of other State companies are not shareholders either. Public assets such as these are held by the State on behalf of citizens. It is not open to the Minister to arbitrarily allocate publicly owned assets to a small group of citizens. The only way he can discharge his overall duty is to take the proceeds of disposals into general public ownership.</P>
    <P>During the passage of the Bill through the Dáil, comparisons were made between the TSB and building societies where customers received shares on demutualisation. There are a number of fundamental differences between TSBs and building societies. Customers opening a share account in a building society are informed that <Col N="882" /> they become an owner of the society with the right to vote at annual general meetings. Customers of a building society run the society and elect the board of directors. It is their decision whether to wind up the business or to demutualise.</P>
    <P>In the case of the TSB, the customers have no ownership stake. There are no annual general meetings of depositors, the customers do not elect the trustees and they have no role in the running of the bank or a decision to sell it. The trustees have taken the decision to request a reorganisation. Customers opening accounts in the TSB do so in accordance with the rules of the TSB which clearly state that they have the right to their deposit and the interest thereon. They are not given any indication or impression that their account confers any ownership interest on them.</P>
    <P>The second issue is whether customers in the TSB should receive some payment from the proceeds. The argument made is that they have been loyal customers for many years and they built up the bank. There has also been the argument that the State has not invested capital or given any assistance to the bank or its predecessors. On this latter argument, prior to 1979, almost all of the TSB's funds, and until 1989 at least 80% of its customers' deposits were placed with the Exchequer. The customers received a rate of interest on their accounts which was funded by the Exchequer and the TSB was paid a margin of 1.65% above this to cover its administration costs.</P>
    <P>The TSB has, throughout its history, been funded by the Exchequer and customers effectively benefited from State support of their deposits. In addition, as customers had a choice regarding where to place their deposits, the rate of interest on these accounts had to be attractive. Since 1989, the TSB has been allowed to operate on the same terms as any other bank but, until 1992, it was exempted from corporation tax in recognition of the fact that the reserves of the TSB effectively belonged to the public generally. It was only in 1993 that the TSB started to pay corporation tax at a reduced rate and it has only paid at the full rate since 1996.</P>
    <P>In reaching his conclusion on this matter, the Minister also took precedent into account. In the case of Irish Life, Telecom and ICC Bank, there were no free shares for customers and the proceeds received by him and his predecessors were paid into the Exchequer. The customers have no ownership stake in the TSB. This is also the situation in all State companies. The Minister for Finance is bound by the precedents outlined and the general legal considerations. He has, therefore, concluded that he must discharge his responsibilities by taking the proceeds into State funds for the benefit of all citizens.</P>
    <P>The second issue of concern to Senators and customers of both the TSB and Irish Permanent is that of branch restructuring. In response to this issue in the Dáil, the Minister quoted the following public statement by Mr. David Went, group chief executive of Irish Life and Permanent plc:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="883" /> Let me start by stating quite emphatically that, as a group, Irish Life and Permanent is committed to maintaining a strong branch network and Permanent TSB will have that. Our plans envisage a combined branch network of approximately 110 branches. In a simple combination of the existing networks of TSB and Irish Permanent, there is clearly an overlap of as many as 45 branches. To deal with this, Permanent TSB will initiate a comprehensive and objective evaluation of all the branches of the combined entity. This will identify those which, in terms of design, size and location, will be best suited to offering the combined customer base the full breadth of products in the most convenient and comfortable locations possible. And let me add, there will be no town which currently enjoys the services of either Irish Permanent or TSB Bank which will be left without banking services as a result of this exercise. [I am sure Members will welcome this.] And indeed we'll continue to review opportunities to open new branches.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the sections of the Bill. Section 1 substitutes a new section 57 for the existing section 57 of the 1989 Act. As there are numerous additions to the section, the advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government was that section 57 should be restated in its entirety for ease of use. I will go through each subsection, explain its purpose and indicate whether it is an existing subsection or an addition. I will also indicate any amendments made to existing subsections.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) is an existing subsection which defines certain terms used in the section. It has been expanded to include such new definitions as are necessary for the operation of the section. Subsection (2) is an existing subsection which provides that the Minister can make orders for the purposes of this section and that he can also make orders amending or rescinding orders made previously. Subsection (3) is an existing subsection which provides that an order may authorise the reorganisation of one or more trustee savings banks into either a company controlled by the State, referred to as a State company, or a company not controlled by the State. In the current transaction, this is Kencarol Limited.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) is a new subsection which confirms that the trustees have the power to enter into contracts to effect a reorganisation subject to an order. It also empowers them to sell or otherwise transfer shares received by them in any reorganisation to an ESOT subject to an order. The subsection also provides that the trustees are carrying out their duties as trustees in exercising the powers conferred on them and complying with the obligations imposed on them by this section. As such, the personal liabilities of trustees in relation to a sale process are limited as set out in section 22 of the 1989 Act, as is the case with their other duties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="884" /> Subsection (5) is a restatement of the existing subsection (4) which provided for the reorganisation of TSB into a State company. It stipulated the matters that the order should take into account. There is one amendment to the subsection in paragraph (<i>g</i>) which prohibits the transfer of the Minister's shares other than to a director of the company. The amendment allows for the transfer of shares to an ESOT. This subsection is not being used in the current transaction but the amendment is being made for the sake of completeness as the 1989 Act is not being repealed.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) is a restatement of the existing subsection (6). Paragraph (<i>b</i>), which provides for the payment to the Minister for Finance of the proceeds arising from the reorganisation into Kencarol Limited, has been amended to take into account the fact that the trustees will have proceeds arising from the transfer of shares to ESOT.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) is the existing subsection (5) which provides that an order may provide for the transfer of specified assets to the Minister. It is not being used in the current transaction.</P>
    <P>Subsection (8) includes the existing subsection (7) but there have been additions. It provides that the 1989 Act will not apply to a company not controlled by the State and that it will be subject to the Central Bank Act, 1971. Paragraph (<i>c</i>) has been added to provide that the order may make provision for the regulation of Kencarol Limited in the period during which it has the assets and liabilities of TSB Bank. This is to avoid a gap in the regulation by the Central Bank of the operations of TSB Bank. Paragraph <i>(d) </i>is a new paragraph which provides that from the transfer date the trustees will cease to act as trustees in the business of the bank.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (<i>e</i>) is a new paragraph which provides that the trustees shall continue in office to comply with their obligations in relation to the final accounts of TSB Bank prior to the transfer date. Paragraph (<i>f</i>) is a new paragraph which provides that any trustee who becomes an employee or officer of either Kencarol or Irish Life and Permanent shall cease to be a trustee.</P>
    <P>Subsection (9) is a restatement of the existing subsection (8). It provides that the order may provide for the conditions of the staff. It is not being used in the current transaction because staff's entitlement and conditions of employment are protected by employment rights legislation and provision has also been made for the staff in the business sale agreement between the trustees and Irish Life and Permanent plc.</P>
    <P>Subsection (10) is a new subsection which makes certain provisions in respect of the period after the transfer of the bank's operations to the Irish Life and Permanent group. It provides for the dissolution of the TSB, the distribution of the proceeds of the reorganisation to the Minister, the preparation of accounts by the trustees for this period and vacation of office by the trustees.</P>
    <P>Subsection (11) is a new subsection which provides that Irish life and Permanent will be able to use &ldquo;TSB&rdquo; in their name subject to the conditions <Col N="885" /> set out in the order. This is required because section 14 of the 1989 Act prohibits anyone other than a trustee savings bank using the name or its derivatives. I agree with the Minister that this is a reasonable, commercially sensible approach and I am satisfied that, subject to the conditions the Minister will place in the order on the use of the name, it will not cause confusion.</P>
    <P>Subsection (12) is a new subsection that provides for the technical aspects of the transfer of operations from TSB Bank to Kencarol Limited and on to Irish Life and Permanent. It has been</P>
    <P>modelled on provisions in the Central Bank Acts and similar legislation that provide for the transfer of the operations of one financial institution to another.</P>
    <P>Subsection (13) is a new subsection that provides for the transfer of TSB's properties to Kencarol Limited and on to Irish Life and Permanent plc. Subsection (14) is a restatement of the existing subsection (10). It is not being used in the current transaction.</P>
    <P>Subsection (15) is the existing subsection (11). It requires the Minister to obtain a motion of approval from each House of the Oireachtas for the draft of any order he proposes to make under this section. The Minister will be laying the draft order before each House as soon as possible after the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Subsection (16) is a new subsection that disapplies section 60 of the Companies Act, 1963, to the provision of assistance by Kencarol Limited or Irish Life and Permanent or the ESOT company itself in the acquisition of shares by the ESOT. Similar provisions have been made in legislation dealing with Telecom Éireann and ICC Bank.</P>
    <P>Section 2 extends the original provisions of section 64 of the 1989 Act. That section provided an exemption from stamp duty arising from a reorganisation. This exemption is being extended to the second step of the current transaction, the onward transfer from Kencarol Limited to Irish Life and Permanent plc. This is being done because the only reason Irish Life and Permanent plc is going through Kencarol Limited is to facilitate the establishment of the ESOT in accordance with ESOP legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 3 amends section 12 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, to allow Kencarol Limited to establish an ESOT, even though it will be controlled by Irish Life and Permanent plc at the time. This is necessary as it is not possible to establish the ESOT prior to the transfer to Kencarol Limited because the TSB in its current structure does not have any shares. Section 4 is a standard section setting out the Short Title and collective citation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this legislation is to enable the £340 million sale of the Trustee Savings Banks to Irish Life and Permanent plc. The TSB was created by an amalgamation of the TSB Dublin and the Cork and Limerick Savings Bank <Col N="886" /> in 1992. Prior to the passing of the 1989 Act the activities of the banks had been severely restricted. They were required to deposit a percentage of their customers' deposits with the Exchequer and could only deal with personal accounts.</P>
      <P>Ownership of the Trustee Savings Banks was debatable until it was clearly established under the 1989 Act. The British Government announced the privatisation of such banks in 1986. Some depositors successfully challenged the decision on ownership, but this was overturned following an appeal by the British Government to the House of Lords. In their judgment the Law Lords said that the Trustee Savings Banks and their offices belonged to the state. That concurs with the opinion of the Attorney General, which the Minister of State outlined.</P>
      <P>The 1989 Act gave the banks new powers to respond to the changing situation in the financial markets. Since the passing of that Act, the TSB has grown significantly. Customer deposits have increased, as have the number of employees employed by the bank. The chairman's report of December 1999 outlined the vibrancy of the bank and pointed to growth in business in all areas, including lending, savings and mortgages. The chairman went on to say that the 40% increase in pre-tax profits reflected a very satisfactory period for the bank. Loan growth continued to accelerate at an impressive rate, with advances increasing by 24%, while the deposit side of the business grew by 16%. This is a very proud record for any institution. The bank's vibrant growth is reflected in its sale price to Irish Life and Permanent plc.</P>
      <P>In the financial markets there is little room left for small lending institutions. The original concept was to amalgamate the ACC, the ICC and the TSB into a third banking force. The ACC had a good rural record, especially with the farming community while the ICC provided finance for business and industry. The Trustee Savings Banks gave a reasonable return to customers on their investments. All three banks looked after the ordinary people.</P>
      <P>The Minister might recall that last week the House debated a Bill to amend the role of the Central Bank. Reference was made to the need to provide a people's bank. Many of the major banks are not interested in small depositors. Many bank branches have been closed and one bank is refusing to cash cheques for its customers. The Trustee Savings Banks acted differently. The bank has many loyal customers who have been banking with it for a long time and who speak fondly of it. Many customers equate the activities of the Trustee Savings Banks with those of the credit unions and the bank is close to addressing the needs of its ordinary customers. With the sale of these institutions, the public will, unfortunately, lose that contact. I regret this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides that the employees of the bank will be well looked after. It provides for the establishment of an employee share option scheme which will give the TSB's 1,200 employees a 5% share in the sale of the bank <Col N="887" /> which will entitle them to approximately £40,000 each.</P>
    <P>On the sale of the bank, while there will be three major winners &ndash; the Government, Irish life and Permanent and the employees, through the proposed share option scheme &ndash; there will be one loser, its loyal customers. If the changes to mutual societies are considered, through amalgamation or privatisation, all of them, at one stage or another, acknowledged their customers by way of some benefit. I do not know the reason the customers have been left out in this case and ask the Minister to consider rectifying the situation.</P>
    <P>The merger of Irish Life and Permanent and the TSB will result in the closure of 45 branches. While I am pleased to note that there will be no compulsory redundancies, the closure of branches is worrying. Mr. David Went, the chief executive of Irish Life and Permanent, is on record as stating that no town which currently enjoys the services of Irish Permanent or TSB Bank will be left without a banking service as a result of the merger, but we have heard these promises before and it is up to the Government to guarantee this commitment will be honoured.</P>
    <P>While the Minister of State outlined the legal position on rewarding customers, I am saddened that no provision has been made in the Bill to acknowledge the loyal service given by customers of the bank. This is what has made it so profitable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the legislation which provides for a natural progression as regards what is happening to small Trustee Savings Banks and is a follow on from what has happened in other countries in recent years.</P>
      <P>We are, to some extent, turning our backs on what were locally supported institutions for many years, of which the Trustee Savings Bank is but one. The others include the great supporter of the farming community, ACC Bank, and ICC Bank in regard to industry. To some extent, we are experiencing a phase of economic activity to which I hope we will not return.</P>
      <P>This is necessary legislation which will place the Trustee Savings Bank in a new field of activity and provide for its progression and survival in the economic market under new ownership. It must be accepted that that is the position.</P>
      <P>Only last week we debated a Bill introduced by the Labour Party to compel institutions to provide outlets. While I understood the intent of the legislation, it is not practical to provide for it in law. If financial institutions are hamstrung, they are open to takeover and not being viable. That is where the difficulty lies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I commend this Bill to the House because it is necessary, I feel that certain communities lose out in the rush to make profit from economic activity and because of the greed of shareholders and financial institutions. I note that the bank may close 45 of its branches throughout <Col N="888" /> the country. We did not need to wait for this legislation to know what the financial institutions are doing. They have forgotten totally about the customer in the communities they have served over the years. This does not apply only to the Trustee Savings Bank. It applies to every financial institution in the State. The customer and the community are now of little or no importance to them. Their sole reason for being in business is to make a profit. The other matters are ancillary. While they might have glossy brochures inviting people to take out a loan or open an account, the harsh reality is that they want to make a profit and they could not care less about individuals or communities. I can see that trend continuing at a faster pace and that down the road practically all of the banks will abandon smaller communities. That is sad.</P>
    <P>I wonder if there is an alternative we can identify. I have thought long and hard about this and I feel that the post offices and the credit unions offer the only hope for the smaller communities because they are not involved in these developments. If there is an opening for those two institutions, it is to fill the void which will be left by other financial institutions who will abandon branches in smaller communities. In the past many people concluded that post offices might close due to lack of business or the diktat of people at higher levels at An Post. However, there is a new understanding. With the availability of modern technology, post offices are linked through their computer systems and through e-commerce.</P>
    <P>Recently one of the banks abandoned its branch in a town in my county, with which the Cathaoirleach will be familiar. There are other financial institutions in the town and I am sure they will take on some of the customers, but more of them may move to the bank's branch in a neighbouring town. By and large, every time one takes a cog out of that wheel one is in some way disrupting the fabric of life which has prevailed in those towns, villages and communities. I see this as another step on that road, even though I recognise that the Bill is necessary for the survival of TSB Bank.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in the Labour Party's philosophy of many years ago that every industry should be nationalised. They believed that banks could be nationalised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>A void will be created by commercial financial institutions leaving communities in smaller towns. In looking at the overall provision of financial facilities to communities in small villages and towns, the Minister should take a further look at what the State can do to modernise and promote the system of post offices. That system has served us well. The post office has been a meeting place as well as a place to deposit money. Usually a person needed to travel only a short distance to withdraw £50 or £100 to deal with a family or household crisis. That has not been fully appreciated but it will be in future when many of the larger institutions, including the one we are supporting today in legislation, decide for economic reasons that they can no longer provide an outlet in some of the areas to which I refer. The opportunity is there and I would like to see the Government coax, support and massage that opportunity in the future in order that there may be local financial institutions in these villages and communities. The credit unions are doing a fine job in local areas. They are another side to that equation.</P>
      <P>While the Bill relates to a totally different matter, it is important that we identify how the sector will develop in the future. While this legislation is necessary for the survival of the Trustee Savings Bank under its new name as a viable economic entity, we as public representatives must be conscious of the consequences of the pursuit of profit, which is the goal of these financial institutions, and of how this will be reflected in our small towns, villages and communities in the future.</P>
      <P>This policy of financial institutions will affect these communities badly. The institutions will say that they look at this from an economic point of view. They will close branches in small towns and open branches in satellite towns or outside third level colleges where there are great opportunities. They certainly will not provide a social service to a community where there are 300 pensioners, some of whom are unable to drive or do not own cars. Nobody in this House is naive enough to think that these institutions will provide such services in the future.</P>
      <P>The Government and the Oireachtas need to be conscious of the need for financial services to be provided in villages and small communities and make provision for some alternative in the event of these institutions closing. I have identified at least two opportunities under that heading. I know that it is not part of the terms of the Bill but we are on Second Stage and we are talking about a trustee bank that is moving to a new financial situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will respond to the points I make as to what can be provided in the future, and by whom, for smaller villages and towns. I would like us, as elected representatives, to be caring enough not to abandon smaller communi<Col N="890" /> ties in the rush to slap ourselves on the back for our undoubted economic success. People would be left to their own devices to get to larger towns and cities to do their banking. It may be just to lodge one third of their pension in a deposit account or to put away money to provide for nursing home care in the future. It is an area of economic activity that we cannot abandon. I have heard people speak today about the opportunity of e-mail and so on. That is fine, but if you are a 60 or 70 year old, that is not a reality.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation. I support it and commend it to the House. I have no doubt that it will be passed. The query as regards shareholders is explained in the Bill. That was raised by Senator Doyle. There is also a precedent for this in other jurisdictions. Employees will get their part out of the business down the road. We need to look at the customer base, and I would like the Minister to reply to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great pity that things are done for reasons of ideology, particularly when ideology does not conform to practical experience. This proposal is profoundly ideological. It is driven by a myth of private sector efficiency. There is ample evidence that it may not work and that is profoundly regrettable.</P>
      <P>Senator Finneran reminded me about alternative ways of banking. It is interesting that you cannot do electronic banking from Leinster House. I cannot access my Internet bank account from here due to security considerations. A system so riddled with problems could not be a substitute for a proper diffused banking system based on physical access to banks. Does anybody seriously believe that, by amalgamating the TSB with another bank, we will get anything less than what they call rationalisation and what I call a reduction in service for their customers? </P>
      <P>Senator Costello read from an internal bank memorandum about the closure of a branch in Stoneybatter. Anyone who heard the extraordinary cynicism towards customers should be left with no illusions about what we are doing when we hand over a banking institution. We insert it firmly into the ethos of cynicism which was displayed when the bank in Stoneybatter was closed. They mocked their customers. They laughed at them for their lobbying. They simply had a ploy to hold on to their more valuable customers and effectively said that smaller ones did not count. Small customers were effectively an irritant they would have to live with. They did not matter. They would not care if they lost them. That is what that said about the way in which these institutions work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all on the record of this House and it is a great pity that in the debate about service and customers the reality is not dealt with. Instead we have an ideological assumption that it is more efficient because it is private and because it is in the marketplace. It would be if we had real free market competition. That rarely exists as most unideological observers can attest. I can give a <Col N="891" /> dozen examples of it, not just one or two. If real competition does not exist you end up in a situation where you reduce choice further. It is only nominal or pretend competition. You take away a service which has worked very well.</P>
    <P>Remember what the TSB was. It began as a series of small savings banks put together by trustees to provide a benevolent and humane source of savings for the less well off. The trouble is that we forget these things. I am not surprised we are in this position. The speech the Minister delivered in this House last week could have been written by the Irish Bank Standing Committee it was such a eulogy to them. The truth that they do not behave very well was demonstrated last week. I am fascinated by the way people believe in competition when it is ideologically necessary and they do not when it is inconvenient. Many of the Members who will speak most enthusiastically about this are vigorously in favour of the retention of the groceries order. They believe people should be given choices and that small shopkeepers would be squeezed out of business. I agree with that view. The truth is that we are quite prepared to sit back and see small banks close at great inconvenience to ordinary people. There is no middle road. If you do not retain a variety of banking services, some of which do not have a shareholder-at-all-costs ethos, you will end up with a diminution of service and a concentration in areas of maximum profitability.</P>
    <P>Nobody believes banks are, or could be, charitable institutions. It is possible to reconcile proper business activity with a sense of social concern. The trouble is that we have jumped from a silly position of indifference to competition to an equally silly position which forgets that there are no one-dimensional solutions to any of life's problems, solutions such as nationalisation, to which I never subscribed. Nationalisation was a 19th century concept. Public control is the issue, not ownership. The 19th century myth was that ownership gave control. It took the left about 100 years to figure out that ownership and control are not the same thing. What is necessary is that the State and democratic institutions are in a position to regulate all powerful forces in society where those forces would come into conflict with the greater good of society. That is the position I have always taken and continue to take.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will reflect on the German equivalent of the Trustee Savings Banks &ndash; I think they are called the Handelsbanks. I remember the chief executive of those banks being asked if they were seeking to privatise them. He was astonished and asked why they should. He said they had a role to serve society which would not be helped by the banks being converted into just another bank. That is a very successful quasi-publicly owned banking service, although not in public hands, that provides banking services which the major banks either cannot or will not provide in Germany.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="892" /> Let us not try to pretend that Germany is not a remarkably successful economy. No economy in the world could have absorbed a population equivalent to one third of its original population and survived in the remarkable way Germany has done. It took the monopoly money of 15 million people, called it real money and survived without a major financial crisis. That is a commentary on the robustness of the German economy and one that people leave out when they talk nonsense about its structural problems.</P>
    <P>There is evidence that other countries operate from a pragmatic view, that is, that what is good for society is what they do and not what is driven by any silly one-dimensional ideology of left or right. One is as ridiculous as the other but there is very little of the left wing ideology remaining at present. The ideology which is liable to cause us the most trouble for the next 20 years is an equally daft one of the right which believes that giving things away cheaply to the private sector creates some sort of efficiency.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech was interesting because it was remarkably defensive about ownership. The idea that he would state in a speech about something we are selling that the Attorney General told us we are entitled to sell it raises the fact that the Government felt it had to ask the Attorney General if it actually owned this bank. Because nobody else owned it&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it is not illegal to do this. I think it is profoundly wrong and it amounts to expropriation. However, there is nothing illegal or unconstitutional in this society about its appropriation. Under these circumstances, the Government had a variety of options but chose the one which was most ideologically acceptable, which was to take it into public ownership for a moment in order to sell it at a large profit to the State. I <Col N="893" /> have no idea why that is regarded as a good thing for society and why it could not have taken a different route.</P>
      <P>The issue of privatisation of any of these bodies raises interesting questions. There is an old legal maxim that when one wants to figure out why something is being done, the question is <i>qui bonum</i>, or to whom is the good? The first good in all our privatisations is to the senior executives of the company whose salaries will probably double or treble instantaneously. Of course, it is a terrible thing to suggest that that might be behind their impulse to privatise. Everybody else is driven by the profit motive. The profit motive is a good thing but the suggestion that chief executives of State owned organisations would want to privatise so that they would make more money is regarded as an unworthy accusation. It is the most obvious conclusion to draw that people in these organisations get rich out of privatisation.</P>
      <P>The second question relates to the myth that this makes for greater efficiency. We are at a very early stage in the experiment of privatisation. Of course, there are areas which needed to be privatised. I have no great problem in some respects with Greencore, but the idea that the State's sugar quota is owned by a private company is an interesting one. That the State will negotiate and use the power of the State to protect a quota owned by a private company is a fascinating idea. I do not know what it has to do with market efficiency. The truth is, however, that many of the experiments in privatisation and deregulation are proving to be singularly less successful than was imagined.</P>
      <P>When two of the big American airlines amalgamate, as they are expected to do by the end of this year, half of all American airline flights will be controlled by one airline, a wonderful contribution to competition in the United States, a wonderful step forward, a deregulated, unregulated, privatised, quasi-monopoly. The citizens of California are suffering the consequences of ideological nonsense in terms of electricity shortages.</P>
      <P>I am not saying I am against or for something. I am simply saying that the solution to these things is always what works. It is time we learned that things do not work. This will, of course, work from the point of view of enriching the senior executives and adding funds to the Government coffers. However, I defy anybody to tell me that it will improve the quality of service to banking customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Irish Life and Permanent, the Irish Permanent was perhaps the most secretive financial institution in the State when it was a building society. I could not but smile when the Minister said that customers of a building society actually run the society. As a customer of the Irish Permanent before it was privatised, I knew less about it than I did about the bank of which I was a customer because it told me nothing. This was a building society which would not tell its customers &ndash; its members and owners &ndash; how much its chief executives were paid. It would not <Col N="894" /> tell us anything and had cosy little deals with directors' firms involved in things like the advertising budget. A legal firm was also involved.</P>

      <P>We would never stop him, a Leas-Chathaoirligh. We would not want to interfere with Senator Finneran.</P>
      <P>I would like to know what good is supposed to come out of this for the customers of Irish banking because Irish banking treats its customers disgracefully. Senator Costello's recitation of an internal memorandum really showed what banks think of their customers. Irish banks have desperately tried to close down the credit union movement by making false and, in my belief, malicious comparisons between themselves and that movement. They have resisted, and so has State ideology, the extension of a full banking licence to the post office. Once they got themselves into that position, they reduced their services. The queues are longer, the number of things one can do in a bank has been reduced and the number of branches has been reduced.</P>
      <P>Will somebody tell me how all this is supposed to be good for ordinary customers? It is very good in that it makes banks extremely profitable, which is a desirable objective. I do not want our banks going bust. However, there is a balance to be drawn in society between the profitability and efficiency of the banks and the service of their customers. The three things do not go together. Profitability and customer service only go together when one has serious and real competition. Doing this eliminates one further element of competition and reduces the chance of us creating competition in the future, and it essentially protects the quasi-monopoly the banking sector has which it uses at the expense of its customers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions on the Bill. I will start by answering the question Senator Ryan has just posed. The position of the Labour Party Front Bench spokesman on finance is as follows: &ldquo;It marks a historic day for Irish banking as a third force is being created which has the capacity and penetration to offer genuine competition and service to a huge number of customers.&rdquo;  The Senator should not take my word on it but that of his own party. That is a fairly glowing tribute to what he and the Senator's party believes will be the result of the TSB becoming part of Irish Life and Permanent.</P>

      <P>They obviously have not told the Senator everything. I would not be dismissive of everything the Senator said. However, it is not appropriate to suggest that this is an ideologically based move. I believe that our politics have moved on dramatically from those static arguments of 15 years ago. We have the support of the employees of the bank who are primarily concerned. We have the support of all the political parties. It is clearly evident from what is happening that this is a very positive move for the bank, for customers and all others concerned. I am surprised that the Senator has gone down the road of some kind of ideological cruise.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell, the Labour Party spokesman on finance, asked in the Dáil whether there was any persuasive reason to retain the TSB in the ownership of the State. He answered this himself by saying:</P>
      <P>I suppose this is a critical question and I suppose the honest answer is &lsquo;not really'. TSB does not have a strategic role. The bank has become more commercial and more business orientated and clearly this trend will continue, whoever owns it.</P>
      <P>There was a strong commitment and support for this Bill from the Senator's Labour party colleague. In supporting the TSB sale, the only caveat that Deputy McDowell entered was on loyalty payments to long standing customers which was rejected. Senators Doyle, Finneran and Ryan raised this issue. Because of the debate in the Dáil, I went into some detail for the benefit of Members of this House. I do not treat coming to this House lightly and will always give it the full benefit of all information I have. That has been acknowledged by Senators.</P>
      <P>This decision was not taken on the basis of a court case in the UK. However that fact alerted us to the possibility of a similar action here and we sought the advice of the Attorney General and others. The position needed to be crystal clear. I laid this out in my Second Stage speech so that there would be no confusion. Senators Doyle and Finneran are right in saying that this is an issue.</P>
      <P>The State over the years in the way it has dealt with the TSB and the way it guaranteed deposits and the interest paid showed a very strong commitment to the customer base. We are moving to a different era. It would be entirely wrong if, when disposing of State assets, small groups of people fundamentally benefited. This has been a big issue in corporations whereby a few people at the very top have made millions of pounds and nobody else in the organisation has had the same access to reward for enterprise and effort made. Where the State is selling assets or cashing in on its reserves, the benefit should go across the board to all citizens. That is what we as legislators are here to do and that position should properly be supported by Members of both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Finneran and Doyle raised the issue of bank closures. I have an interest in this and <Col N="896" /> have had some meetings within the Department of Finance on the matter. We need to determine how we can use our influence as legislators to minimise the social and economic impact of such closures, especially on people in isolated rural areas. This is a question that rightly should be addressed by all Members of the Oireachtas and the Government. The Minister for Finance has had an advisory group looking at this. The message from Government to the banks is that we are not happy with the position on closures. We must put in place proper mechanisms to ensure that people have full access to facilities. It is too simplistic to say that this can all be done by computer technology. It is part of the answer for some but not for everybody.</P>
    <P>On 20 February, the Minister for Finance answered a parliamentary question from Deputy McDowell on the related issue of the future of post offices and how they could take up much of this role. People want to ensure that they have access to a range of services in a banking institution in their area. The Minister stated in reply:</P>
    <P>Proposals have been received in 1999 from the banks to myself and the Taoiseach in relation to the improvement of the retail payments system. Among these was a proposal for the establishment of a payment account to be operated on a non-competitive basis by an arm of the State or the central payments system companies owned by the banks. Among the payment transactions which such an account could facilitate would be payments of salaries, social welfare allowances, pensions and grant payments made by the State.</P>
    <P>The proposal is being dealt with by the Department of the Taoiseach. A working group has been established and, I understand, discussions are ongoing with the banks and An Post to develop the proposal further. I look forward to receiving the final proposals on this concept.</P>
    <P>It is a valid issue for the Senators to raise and I am happy to confirm that the Government is dealing with this issue. It is indicative of the Government's view that the Department of the Taoiseach is directly involved with the working group reporting to him. I hope that offers the Senators some definitive comfort.</P>
    <P>Senators Doyle and Finneran said that the State should step in on this issue and I have outlined what the State is doing. I agree that the State must find a way forward with the banks without interfering with their right to make their own commercial decisions. They have responsibilities which may not necessarily cost them money. There might not be huge profit but we do not expect them to do it at a loss. If structured properly the customers, communities, banks, building societies and the State can all win. That is an outcome I look forward to.</P>
    <P>I hope I have covered the main thrust of the questions raised on the branch issue and the way we will do business in certain parts of the country. There is substantial support for the sale. The <Col N="897" /> ESOPs in place will be very important. Under the ESOP, the TSB staff will not be given shares. Just as in ESOPs in Eircom and ICC bank, staff are paying for 5% of their shares through transformation, including agreement to voluntary redundancy, etc. There is a <i>quid pro quo</i> on the part of the staff. The staff has purchased the remaining 9.9% for £19.8 million. Senators should note that the main funding for the 9.9% stake has been raised by the bank buying out a salary increase to the staff due under the PPF. There has been quite an imaginative and positive approach by the staff, and the State to recognising and rewarding what the staff have achieved.</P>
    <P>I hope that covers most of the issues. We will have a further opportunity on Committee Stage and I look forward to that.</P>

      <P>I wish to present the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Bill, 2001, which amends the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966. It is now two weeks since we first learned of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Britain. Within hours of confirmation of the disease in Britain, an unprecedented mobilisation of effort on a national scale was triggered here. Since then thousands of people throughout this country have been engaged full time in a massive effort to ensure that this country remains free of this disease. The people most directly involved have included many of my own staff and members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces and appropriate State agencies &ndash; I offer my sincere good wishes to the two members of the Garda <Col N="898" /> Síochána who were injured in the course of their duty on the Border. In addition, an enormous number of individuals, companies and organisations have stepped forward and willingly played their part in this concerted national effort.</P>
      <P>I will begin today by paying tribute to all those people&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been easy and in many cases the hours have been long and the weather inclement. The work has been arduous and there has been significant inconvenience, but clearly it has been worth it.</P>
      <P>While this gigantic national effort has been under way, and dedicated people in voluntary and sporting organisations throughout this country have contributed to it, it has also become clear that others, very few in number, have, through their commercial operations or in some cases through illegal activities, put our agri-food industry at risk. This is why I am before this House today presenting this Bill. I am seeking support to put in place some important enhancements of the controls which are provided for in the Diseases of Animals Act so that we can exercise better control of and, where appropriate, eliminate such activities.</P>
      <P>I now propose to introduce the different sections of the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Bill, 2001, to the House. Section 1 provides for the definition of the words and phrases used in the Bill. Most of the terms used in this Bill are defined in the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, and therefore do not require re-enactment.</P>
      <P>Section 2 provides for the insertion of a new section in the Act of 1966. This section allows the Minister to appoint a wide range of persons to be authorised officers for the purposes of enforcing the section. The section also confers extensive powers on authorised officers. These include powers to stop persons and vehicles. They also include the power to enter land or premises where there is a reasonable suspicion that an animal may be infected, or has been in contact with an infected animal, or that an animal has been moved either illegally or through a place where infection may exist. An officer may also detain and mark any animal, animal product, fodder or litter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 gives extensive powers of search, seizure and detention in respect of vehicles, animals, animal products, fodder or litter. A person may <Col N="899" /> be required to produce documents and give information. This section also provides that an authorised officer, where he considers it reasonable, may dispose of any animal, including by slaughter, or any animal product, fodder or litter. This provision is not linked with compensation. There is already provision in the Act for slaughter with compensation. Slaughter without compensation would only be appropriate in rare cases. It is important to make this provision because taxpayers would rightly be very unhappy if compensation was paid in a case where there was clear wrongdoing.</P>
    <P>The constitutional position on a person's residence is safeguarded by a requirement to obtain a search warrant prior to entry to a dwelling. Obstruction of an officer is made an offence, for which a person may be arrested. On summary conviction, a person guilty of obstruction is liable to a fine of up to 1,500 euros and-or imprisonment for six months. On conviction on indictment, a person is liable to a fine of up to £100,000 and-or five years imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill inserts a new section in the Act to address the issue of dealers. It gives the Minister the power to approve and register dealers and their premises, and to regulate their activities by order. I intend to make an order on this matter very soon.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that, in certain specified circumstances, the Minister may by order ensure that a person who purchases an animal may not move that animal, save under permit, for a period of 30 days. This is necessary to prevent the outbreak or spread of disease. This section is intended to eliminate some practices that have put the health of the national herd at risk. It is my intention to ensure through the permit system that this restriction does not interfere unduly with normal and reasonable commercial activities, including assembly of animals for live export. The details of the permit arrangements will be worked out in consultation with relevant interests.</P>
    <P>Section 4 and section 5 are inserted on legal advice to confirm by statute the foot and mouth order of 1956 and the various orders and regulations made since the onset of the present crisis. It also provides for increased penalties for breaches of the foot and mouth order. The new penalties are in line with those in section 2 and those in the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, as amended by the National Beef Assurance Act, 2000.</P>
    <P>Section 6 and the Schedule to the Act deal with miscellaneous amendments to the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966. The main thrust of these amendments is to extend the provisions of the Act to areas and animals infected or suspected of being infected, and to cover areas and animals at risk of infection. This is highly relevant to the current situation in which we do not have a confirmed case but are obviously at risk because of the situation in Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="900" /> Section 7 of the Bill provides for the forfeit on indictment of vehicles and containers used in the commission of an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill provides that a court may, in addition to any other penalty, ban a person or company from agriculture related activities. This is similar to the provision in the Animal Remedies Act, 1993. It is important to make provision for this penalty which a court might find appropriate in some cases where, for example, deliberate action by a person, farmer, factory manager or mart manager led to an outbreak or spread of infection.</P>
    <P>There are a number of technical amendments to the Bill made on legal advice. Section 9 provides for an offence by a body corporate. This is a standard provision of more recent legislation. This means that, for example, where a factory is found to have breached the Act, the officers of that company, as well as the company itself, shall be liable to proceedings, including disqualification.</P>
    <P>Section 10 relates to the important issue of interference with ear tags. It creates a presumption of illegal removal, switching or tampering of an ear tag or, as appropriate, illegal importation of an animal, in relevant proceedings. Ear tags are a vital part of our control systems for cattle and a similar system is being introduced for sheep. As they play such a vital role, it is important that we ensure that there is the tightest possible legal enforcement of the rules relating to tagging. This section of the Bill will facilitate this. Section 11 provides for the short title and citation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the new powers and controls introduced in this Bill are significant. I stress that these provisions are targeted at a relatively small group of people. It is not my intention to interfere with the normal business of farming and the food industry in any way, but rather to protect them from the risks caused by the operations of less responsible elements. The stakes in the battle against foot and mouth disease are very high. The agri-food sector is of enormous importance in economic terms. It accounts for 10% of our GDP and 11 % of our employment and constitutes a much larger share of the Irish economy than almost any of our EU partners.</P>
    <P>These figures alone do not capture the full importance of the sector to us. Even in purely economic terms, the sector is more important than the basic figures suggest because of its deep internal linkages in our economy. The agri-food sector has a very low import content and a very high expenditure within the Irish economy. It, therefore, accounts for up to 27% of our net trade earnings, when one allows for imported inputs and repatriated profits. That is an enormous share of our trade, and it is this trade that is put at risk by foot and mouth disease. It is clear that the short to medium-term impacts of a major outbreak of disease would be considerable, and there would also be long-term impacts, as markets lost are not easily regained.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" /> For this reason the Government put in place from day one a comprehensive range of measures to guard against the disease and the damage that it would do to the Irish economy. The action taken was swift, decisive and well focused, and the resources provided have been considerable. The measures implemented in this country go beyond those in other countries and have been implemented with a very high degree of professionalism and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there has been criticism of some perceived weaknesses in our systems. In so far as that criticism is positive and contributes to the development of our defences, I welcome it. I do not pretend that our systems are perfect &ndash; no systems are. I believe, however, that in the time available an extraordinary amount has been achieved and we owe a great deal to those who have manned the barricades. I regret that, in addition to the positive criticism, there have been entirely negative contributions that have belittled the tremendous work undertaken by those on the front line and were damaging to the national interest.</P>
    <P>The measures proposed will add significantly to our defences against foot and mouth disease during the current crisis and will also bolster our ability to deal with any future problems. They will be implemented with the same vigour and effectiveness as the other measures that we have taken.</P>
    <P>A number of issues have been raised by Members with my officials. These matters are being examined by the Attorney General's office and I hope that Government amendments and other amendments will be brought before the House as soon as drafts are available. The Government amendments relate to the following matters: that provision will be made for the review of section 2 of the Bill by the Oireachtas after a period of 12 months; that the definition of a &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; in section 3 will be amended to refer to 45 days rather than 100 days; that in section 3 a right of appeal against any decision not to provide a permit under section 29A(5) will also be provided, and this will be done by amendments to the Agriculture Appeals Bill, 2001, which will be considered in Dáil Éireann, it is hoped, tomorrow.</P>
    <P>A number of amendments have been put down by Senators O'Meara, Costello and Ryan. I accept the general spirit and thrust of their proposals, but am advised by the Attorney General that some are not necessary from a legal viewpoint as the matters are covered by existing legislation or in jurisprudence. The Attorney General has also advised against two other amendments dealing with penalties.</P>
    <P>The proposal to insert a new section 2(9) is unnecessary and is governed by fundamental practices and decisions of the Supreme Court involving the National Irish Bank. In respect of the proposed amendment to section 2(13) the legal advice available is that the provision should remain as originally drafted. It is important that <Col N="902" /> officers who acted in good faith, and so far successfully, to avoid the spread of foot and mouth disease should know that the Government stands behind them. The Attorney General has been advised that six months is the appropriate limit.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the amendments to section 2(15) and section 4(2)(a). I can accept, however, the reference to &ldquo;affirmation&rdquo; in section 2(17). As it is important to provide for the possibility of applying conditions to dealers generally and individually, I cannot accept the proposed amendment to section 3. I am strongly advised by the Attorney General that section 4(1) is necessary to remove doubt as to the legal effect of the powers conferred by the Foot and Mouth Disease Order, 1956. He also advises that section 5 is necessary to give legal effect to the orders and regulations referred to in this section which are made at very short notice to avoid a national catastrophe. I cannot, therefore, accept the proposed deletion. I accept the substance of the proposed amendment to section 8. I am advised that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court in this matter is provided for in general legislation. I can also accept the proposed amendment to section 10.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. This legislation, which is being introduced at very short notice, is quite draconian and contains many strong measures. We had to search for copies of the legislation this morning and I commend the departmental officials for their assistance. I welcome the Minister of State's undertaking that he will consider the amendments proposed this morning by Opposition spokespersons.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to absorb the myriad measures contained in the Bill. While Fine Gael supports the legislation and the Department's efforts, we expect that the Bill's provisions will only apply for a short duration and are of the view that they should be revisited in six months to determine how they are being implemented. The Bill contains some drastic measures which will alter the structure of agriculture and a way of life with which we are all familiar.</P>
      <P>There is a tradition of buying and selling animals in Ireland, although criticism has been levelled at the number of times animals change hands. Animals move from farms to dealers and back to farms again. The time an animal spends at calf, yearling or fattening stage can be broken down into three separate areas. Dealers and agents are very much a part of agriculture as we know it. Many farmers are part-time farmers because, through no fault of their own, they were forced to seek employment in industry etc. Some are even involved in politics. Such farmers do not have time to attend marts and source animals. We must address this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hayes appears to be under the impression that the legislation will apply to the overall agricultural scene. That is not the position. The orders will apply where there is a high incidence of foot and mouth disease, brucellosis or TB in a particular area or a danger of such diseases breaking out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister of State's comments. We are doing everything possible to keep foot and mouth disease out of the country and the signs are good that we will succeed. However, normal agricultural practices must go on. We may have to wait six months before we can be assured we are disease free. Cattle change hands at this time of the year and are even moved around within farms. These legislative provisions will be implemented in the next few days and I hope they will not interfere with the normal running of agriculture.</P>
      <P>Certain agents and dealers are very genuine and make a good clean living. These people, who have played an important role in the development of agriculture, have not committed any offence. The legislation should only apply to those who have broken or flouted the law. They should be rooted out.</P>
      <P>Many questions remain to be answered about authorised officers. A great deal of mistrust has built up during the years between farmers, the Department and the district veterinary officer. Trust has broken down and must be rebuilt. Farmers must be assured that any provisions in this area will be good for them in the long run.</P>
      <P>Agriculture is a huge industry which has undergone a major sea change. A small number of farmers have been prosecuted for breaking regulations and flouting laws. Has any departmental official ever been reprimanded for failing to handle a situation properly? The Agriculture Appeals Bill was introduced in recent weeks in response to pressure from farming organisations which were not satisfied with the behaviour of departmental officers. We must question the role of these officers and scrutinise them to the same extent as we scrutinise members of the farming community who may be involved in rogue practices. There are two sides to every argument; the Department is not above reproach and we must be extremely vigilant.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State and I are proud that the tags used are manufactured in our constituency. The business employs many people and is a worthwhile industry. While I am not critical of the tags or the system, nonetheless they fall out, are broken or damaged when cattle are housed in sheds or out in fields. This creates problems. I want to receive an assurance that genuine mistakes made in these circumstances will not be treated harshly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> I welcome the fact that the Minister of State has not only accepted our amendment but has gone further. That said, I urge him to give a commitment that we will revisit the legislation in a few months when, I hope, the crisis is over. People are concerned about what is happening and for the future of the country. They have been vigilant. We, in the Seanad, should commend ourselves for holding one of the first and most constructive debates on the subject. Members wanted to be helpful and did not want to score political points. We initiated a healthy debate and drew to people's attention the importance of agriculture. Previously, they did not understand the crisis foot and mouth disease would cause were it to reach Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains harsh measures, but I understand the reason it is being introduced. My party colleagues in the other House are of a similar mind. The main point is that we should review the position after a few months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the Minister of State, Deputy Davern. The past week has been difficult for everyone. The news last Wednesday of a confirmed outbreak of foot and mouth disease in south Armagh sent shock waves throughout the agriculture and food producing industry. The £9 billion industry faced possible disaster as a result of the actions of a few individuals who placed a nation's future at risk for a small short-term gain.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the remainder of the Cabinet, especially the Minister, Deputy Walsh, the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, and Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development for their immediate and effective response to the foot and mouth outbreak in Great Britain and Northern Ireland on Wednesday last. They showed true political leadership at a time of great crisis. Great credit is also due to officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces and the many others who worked very hard in difficult weather conditions on the Border and at ports, airports, etc., to keep the terrible scourge of foot and mouth disease out of Ireland. The enormous efforts of so many people throughout the country in the past week have been wonderful, especially in the agriculture sector as farmers volunteered to man disinfectant points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The immediate response of sporting and voluntary organisations in cancelling and postponing events is to be commended. I especially commend the GAA, the FAI and the IRFU for their immediate response which stopped the movement of vast numbers of people. While we are free from foot and mouth disease, we cannot let down our guard. The disease is still rampant in Britain where more than 80 cases have been confirmed to date. We must continue to be on high alert and take every possible precaution. I welcome the cancellation of all major events this weekend and for the St. Patrick's weekend. We <Col N="905" /> appreciate the enormous inconvenience and disruption to well laid plans which, in many cases, have been months in the making. This is to safeguard an industry worth £9 billion.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed and concerned, however, that events which could have disastrous consequences for Ireland are still going ahead. I refer to the Cheltenham racing festival and the planned Westlife concert in Dublin in late March. The organisers of the Cheltenham festival should postpone the event. Should they continue, Irish people should not travel. Great work has been done so far, and travelling to Cheltenham, only a short distance from an exclusion zone, could result in Ireland's agricultural economy being wrecked. We can be very proud of the international success of Westlife, but I urge the group and its managers to cancel the planned concert to safeguard our disease free status.</P>
    <P>The spread of the disease in Britain is a major cause of concern. Are the British authorities taking seriously the situation in their country which is now out of control? I welcome the announcement last night by the EU veterinary committee of a ban on all livestock markets in Europe. The Bill will put in place controls on the movement of animals which will greatly reduce the activities which threatened the survival of the agriculture and food industry last week.</P>
    <P>The animal sector must have strict disease control and traceability measures. Farmers have built up an excellent farming system over the years which has produced quality food in a clean, green environment. However, the great work of many has been damaged on many occasions by the actions of a few rogues. The Bill will stop their activities. The penalties of a £100,000 fine and-or five years in jail show the seriousness of the offences.</P>
    <P>The tagging of sheep over six months will ensure traceability, and the fact that all animals must be retained for 30 days, unless a special permit has been granted, will greatly reduce the spread of all diseases, including TB and brucellosis. The Bill also deals in detail with the highly dangerous offences of illegal removal, switching or tampering with ear tags. The legislation gives the courts the ultimate sanction of removing an individual from farming or agricultural activities. I urge the House to support the speedy passage of the Bill to give effect to a proper and effective disease control system in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and his Department on the effective measures they put in place to ensure Ireland maintains its disease free status. The success of the new foot and mouth livestock movement controls was clear yesterday when more than 100 meat plants and abattoirs complied with the issuing of over 1,000 movement permits. Farmers, meat plants, abattoirs, Teagasc, the ICOS and the Department should be complimented on keeping Ireland free of foot and mouth disease. The measures may be inconvenient for everybody and they will disrupt fix<Col N="906" /> tures and plans. However, it will be worthwhile for the economy and all our people.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, on the effective and constructive way he and the Minister, Deputy Walsh, dealt with the problem over the past two weeks. They were upfront and they got to grips with the problem that was caused when a case of foot and mouth disease was identified in south Armagh in Northern Ireland over a week ago. The problem has been controlled and everybody concerned should be commended. If measures had not been taken by the Ministers and the Government over the past two weeks, Ireland would be in the same situation as Britain now and that would be most unfortunate. I commend the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I was watching RTÉ before lunch and I heard some commentary which suggested that complacency is already emerging on this issue, particularly in the midlands. Those concerned inferred that because Ireland has survived for the past five or six days, people are beginning to think that the problem is over. I warn against that view because I detect a certain infection of that nature in the House. People are suggesting that the Government should be congratulated on the great measures it has taken because they have kept the disease out of Ireland. However, that is not the case. The only reason the disease in not here at present is the mercy of God. It is not related to the measures.</P>
      <P>I have serious reservations about emergency legislation of any type, although I will support the Bill. However, the legislation is possibly 33 years too late. I do not understand why emergency legislation of this nature is required now. Why has such legislation not been in operation since 1967 when the last outbreak of foot and mouth disease occurred? It appears the legislation was spurred on by events in south Armagh. The world and his wife have known about what has gone on in south Armagh for the past two years. We have all known the potential consequences and we have been waiting for an accident of this nature to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I readily admit that I do not know much about agriculture, but there has been open smuggling of livestock of all sorts on the Border from time immemorial. It is an industry up there which successive Governments and politicians, including the Independents, have either ignored or connived in for 33 years or more. However, when something happens in south Armagh that affects us in the Republic, emergency legislation is introduced. Up to now, sheep were not tagged and nothing has been regulated in that area. Smuggling has been rife and people have been living on its proceeds. Everybody, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Develop<Col N="907" /> ment, the IFA and Ministers, has known about it. However, people will now be prosecuted for doing what they have done for a living with our tacit agreement for many years.</P>
    <P>It is a reflection on us all that something was not done about it before now and it would be dishonest not to admit it. South Armagh does not appear to be properly policed in a military or agricultural sense. This makes it extremely difficult for us on this side of the Border to do much about it. I am open to correction by the Minister because I do not know enough about agriculture and how it works to understand whether the measures in the Bill will be effective. However, they are not sufficiently fundamental to tackle the problem properly. The first step should be to stop the smuggling. It is not the cause of foot and mouth disease, but it has got people moving. There ought to be a declaration of intent and a commitment &ndash; perhaps a hostage to fortune &ndash; that smuggling on the Border will be stamped out to prevent a scare of this nature in the future.</P>
    <P>I presume smuggling on the Border is still going on because smugglers do not care if all the herds in the country catch foot and mouth disease. They are only interested in their profits. This is not just an immediate problem but an endemic problem which should be tackled. I commend the fact that this problem has been recognised. It is time to declare war on an industry which has made so much money from illegal activity. In six months' time the Minister should be able to say that smuggling of this sort on the Border does not exist. God willing, this outbreak will be controlled, but there should not be a similar scare in future.</P>
    <P>Obviously this country is not immune. It would be wrong, partitionist and unhelpful to say the problem is confined to Northern Ireland. I do not know what happened in Kepak, nor does anyone else, but people from south of the Border were involved in these illegal activities. It may be that the problem is institutionalised. Why has the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development not been able to do anything about this matter? Why has Kepak been able to accept animals in that state? That question, which is much deeper and more important than the immediate one, must be asked.</P>
    <P>It appears we did not learn the lessons of the beef tribunal. Everyone knows that activities in the meat and food industry and in political life were utterly exposed at that time. Certain aspects of the agricultural and the agri-food industry were not policed properly and that is still the case. Nothing has been done in this regard despite the fact that a tribunal sat for two years in relation to an allied problem. Suddenly when something goes wrong, emergency legislation is introduced.</P>
    <P>We need to look at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Given my dealings with it &ndash; I say this with a heavy heart &ndash; I have no confidence in the Department. It is <Col N="908" /> part of the problem and part of the culture which has affected agriculture. The vast majority of farmers are very honest and good living. However, there is a kind of underworld culture in farming of which we are all aware. I do not believe there is a commitment on the part of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development &ndash; I do not mean the Minister &ndash; to stamp out this activity. It is part of the problem and I have plenty evidence to support that view. To some extent, matters are still in the hands of certain barons of that particular industry. The fundamental problem is that it still plays that game rather than the game of the politicians, taxpayers and of regulation.  </P>
    <P>There were problems to begin with but it would not be correct to say very much about the slowness in taking action concerning people coming from the UK. I agree with Senator O'Brien in relation to Cheltenham. We should take a lead in this regard by not allowing Irish horses to go to that festival. I listened to Ruby Walsh on RTÉ this morning saying that people do not follow jockeys, they follow horses. That is the sad fact. He is going to the UK to ride a couple of English horses. If Irish horses go to the UK, Irish people will travel there. If the Cheltenham festival is not cancelled, Irish people who travel there are in real danger of bringing back foot and mouth disease. With great regret, I join in the appeal to trainers not to send horses to the festival, even if they stay there for months afterwards, because they will be followed by people who will bring back the disease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation and congratulate the Labour Party on the speed with which it was able to get through the legislation and table amendments. While the Minister has ruled out most of these amendments in terms of direct application to the Bill, he has accepted them in principle. This shows the House functioning as well as it can under the adverse situation of the late delivery of the Bill and information on it to Members of this House. This was remarked on extensively on all sides, including the Government side, on the Order of Business this morning.</P>
      <P>This is a serious matter. Senator Ross indicated his feelings on Cheltenham, about which I also feel strongly. The British are once again proving to be bad neighbours, as was the case in relation to AIDS, BSE and so on. It is extraordinary they should take such a relaxed attitude, given the possible outbreak of the disease within a very short distance of the racecourse. Because of the problem with Britain, we must be on our own watch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a problem regarding the attitude of certain people here. I regret what is happening in south Armagh, a matter to which Senator Ross referred. There is a curious situation in relation to Sinn Féin. The Sinn Féin Cumann in Trinity College organised an enormous meeting which was held on Friday evening despite advice to the <Col N="909" /> contrary. I have just phoned the college and I was told that all the speakers attended, including Gerry Adams and Damien Kiberd, editor of the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>. Is it responsible to organise these mass meetings in commemoration of the H Blocks, hunger strikers and so on? The attitude of a strong lawless element in that community is something responsible people in south Armagh must address.</P>
    <P>The impact on farming could be enormous, but it does not just relate to farming. The Minister has indicated that the agricultural sector accounts for 10% of GDP, 11% of employment and 27% of our net trade earnings. I heard John Dowling of the Hotels Federation saying on radio yesterday that 20,000 jobs in the tourism industry will be immediately in the balance if there is an outbreak of the disease here. For that reason the measures introduced are welcome.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the regulation of the activities of dealers. God knows, it is high time action was taken in this regard. Eddie Punch of the Irish Cattle Traders and Stockowners Association told <i>Ireland on Sunday:</i>I would compare the attitude of the meat plants in this affair to a dodgy car salesman who pays cash and asks no questions.</P>
    <P>The reality is that in the meat processing business, margins are so tight that every corner has to be trimmed.</P>
    <P>Under this legislation, dealers and the meat plants are placed under considerable restrictions, which is welcome. For the first time, there are strong penalties on indictment. There is £100,000 fine and/or five years imprisonment, which is precisely the kind of measures which will get members of the business and farming community and dealers to take these issues seriously. There is provision for the forfeiture of vehicles, plant and equipment. This type of seizure which will hit people directly, that is, in the pocket, is the only thing that will have a real effect. There is the introduction of offences for bodies corporate, including the meat plants. There are really serious questions to be asked in this regard and the situation must be kept under review.</P>
    <P>On the completion of the Single Market we had to suffer the removal of our national controls at points of entry. We are relying on other countries and inspection at the point of origin of beasts. When we have bad neighbours we are very vulnerable. If the neighbouring island takes a relaxed attitude, we are in trouble.</P>
    <P>Research papers show a recurring pattern of disease outbreaks, including foot and mouth disease, Newcastle disease and swine fever, in several European countries, especially since the completion of the Single Market. One report concluded that it was only a matter of time before there was an outbreak of a major disease in Ireland. In terms of animal disease it used classical swine fever as a model for risk assessment and the report was hardly published when there was <Col N="910" /> an outbreak in the United Kingdom. It was subsequently traced back to the consumption of imported pork kitchen waste by pigs.</P>
    <P>The article in the<i> Sunday Tribune</i> of 4 March concludes:</P>
    <P>Ireland should be seen as being proactive in establishing its own effective food inspection/regulation protocols within a revised framework of EU directives. These controls and safeguards will become even more important in the future as GATT trade agreements are ratified and further imported products are introduced on the national markets. More certification at origin, enhanced traceability protocols and a well funded proactive regulatory monitoring service in the field all cost money. We are now being forced to ask the tough question, which is more important? &lsquo;Safe trade' or &lsquo;free trade'.</P>
    <P>That is well put. It is the question that concerns us.</P>
    <P>The reasons for smuggling are clear. They are economic. It has been ongoing for a long time. The British authorities have recorded that cross-Border smuggling amounts to a loss of £100 million annually to the British Exchequer. It is a widespread phenomenon, supported by the activities of subversives. A report in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 4 March states:</P>
    <P>Last December, alleged members of the Real IRA held gardaí and customs officers at gunpoint and snatched back fake video and computer games which earlier had been seized from a van near the Border. Seven armed men in combat dress and balaclavas surrounded the officers as they examined the haul, which had been uncovered during a raid on a shed straddling the Louth-south Armagh border at Carrickaneena. Armed with a handgun and possibly a rifle, as well as iron bars and broom handles, the gang forced the unarmed gardaí to give up their haul. They sped off from the van and trailor across the Border in the direction of Jonesboro, south Armagh.</P>
    <P>What goes for stolen or illegally reproduced videos also goes for the smuggling of lamb.</P>
    <P>Livestock is being smuggled because of a VAT scam. That is what happened in the cases which may have led to the possibility of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the Republic. The profits in this illegal livestock trade come from a complicated VAT refund scheme operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. This allows farmers to make a 4.3% tax refund claim on transactions with meat plants. Livestock imported legally from Northern Ireland and Great Britain with veterinary clearance does not qualify for this VAT refund. This adds to the incentive to smuggle it in and claim that it came from another source, as they did in the case in the North of Ireland. A newspaper article indicates that the one person who has been <Col N="911" /> named is a cattle trader who hoped to make an additional profit of £1,000.</P>
    <P>This legislation is important. Initially, it was not welcomed by farmers. They and their officials resisted it. According to the article I have before me the IFA and Kepak, the processing plant involved in this case, campaigned against tagging. The article details the instances when they objected. Although we support the farmers, they must learn from their mistakes. According to the article, on 25 September 2000, as the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development tried to obtain approval for a sheep tagging and traceability system, the IFA's sheep committee chairman, Mr. Frank Corcoran, accused the Minister of breaching the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness by moving to impose compulsory sheep tagging on 45,000 flock owners. This is an example of the difficulties facing the Minister. It is tragic that it required this complex, dangerous situation for the country to bring the farmers' organisations into line at last with what is necessary to keep foot and mouth disease out of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>While I will be seeking clarification on some aspects, I welcome the thrust of the legislation. Up to a fortnight ago we were concerned with the scourge of BSE and its likely negative impact on the economy. That has now been forgotten because of the danger of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, which places the present crisis in context. In the past week innumerable people have outlined their views on the consequences and effects of any outbreak of the disease, taking account of the size and scale of the agriculture and food industry, the numbers employed, directly and indirectly, and the knock-on effect on the economy.</P>
      <P>I have been especially irritated by some commentators on radio, especially the pseudo-intellectual ones, who when asked for their views on the impact of an outbreak on the economy said that it might mean a reduction of between 1% or 2% in GDP or that exports in a given year might be reduced by 3% or 4%. They are not dealing with reality. Senator Ross indicated the possible effect on tourism. If there is an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, not only will the agricultural economy be catastrophically affected, so also will the tourism industry. These pseudo-intellectuals need to think again. They should not portray the issue as if it was not serious. It is time people realised that it is extremely serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the confirmation of the outbreak across the Border in Meigh, south County Armagh, exemplary action has been taken here. Nothing has been as positive as the reaction of the public. Virtually everybody has supported the action taken by the Government because they are concerned and want to ensure a situation does not arise where the economy would be seriously affected. They must be complimented for this. I have met people who have nothing to do with <Col N="912" /> farming and who may not have walked in a field for several years who are placing disinfectant mats outside their doors. If we continue in this way, we will keep the disease at bay.</P>
    <P>The Minister and several other speakers complimented a number of organisations that took proactive action in the early stages. The one that immediately comes to mind is the IRFU, which cancelled the international rugby match last weekend and did so at such an early stage. That showed it considered sport is sport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The owners of Arctic Copper did the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to come to that, but I have a few more titbits the Minister of State might like to hear.</P>
      <P>Given the positive action of so many, what is happening in relation to Cheltenham is appalling. Nobody more than the Irish would like to go to England with their horses to compete with the British and the French in the major event of the season and beat the British on their own soil. There is nothing the Irish would like better, but I am saddened by the actions of Ruby Walsh and the other jockeys who are going over, although admittedly I heard him say on radio this morning that they will not come back and, therefore, will not expose us to the possibility of the spread of the disease in that way. The leadership they are giving is not the right way to go. That is what concerns me more than anything else.</P>
      <P>The current situation in south Armagh and the major threat to our economy is as a result of rogue traders, farmers, factory owners or whoever they are. There are many reasons those people do what they do, which is probably better known to themselves than anyone else. As Senator Ross said, smuggling pays and it has always paid. We have enough legislation in place to prevent this happening, but we are not policing this field. We have necessary legislation in place in other areas, but we are not implementing it.</P>
      <P>One of the problems resulting from the changes in the Common Agricultural Policy in recent years is that farmers are far more interested in the number rather than the quality of animals they have on their farms. The Common Agricultural Policy extenuated this and continues to do so. We will have to examine seriously the direction these policies are going, as unless we reward people for effort, we will not put the smuggler out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard a number of people say that if we get over this weekend without an outbreak, we will be in the clear. I strenuously emphasise that if we get over this weekend or this day next week, we will have got over the problem that arose in relation to Carlisle, as the incubation period for the animals brought into Northern Ireland and then to Roscommon will be over, but that does not mean there are not other major threats of which we do not yet know. If we even consider relaxing the current arrangements, we will run <Col N="913" /> into the same situation that happened in 1941, the last time we had an outbreak of food and mouth disease here. When the initial outbreak occurred in that year, everything seemed to be under control and then the regulations in place were relaxed and there was another outbreak thereafter. Had it not been for that, Kilkenny would be in lead in all-Ireland finals today because Cork got a soft one that year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I must correct the Senator. It spread from Kilkenny into Tipperary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a number of issues concerning the details of the legislation. The questions that must be asked relate to the farmers, dealers, smugglers, factories, those who transport the animals and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Take the lorry load of animals slaughtered in Athleague two weeks ago. The tags had been removed from their ears, but that was not spotted. Why not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The holes were filled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>If we know holes are left following the removal of ear tags, we should check for them. It is not good enough to say those holes were filled. It would simply involve running one's hand along the ear to establish if holes have been filled. We have inspectors in place to check such matters, but unfortunately these animals got through. It is not the first time such things have happened. These matters need to be sorted out.</P>
      <P>Section 2(8)(<i>f</i>)(ix) states that such an officer may dispose of, or require the owner or person in charge of or in possession of, the animal, poultry product, fodder or litter to dispose of it in such a manner, including slaughter, as the authorised officer sees fit. It is not good enough just to leave it to the owner to dispose of them; they should be properly supersvised. The Minister of State might consider that matter.</P>
      <P>Section 3 provides that if a person buys an animal, he must retain it for 30 days before he can sell it on. How will that affect someone who buys animals for slaughter on behalf of a factory? I note the Minister of State is nodding, but he might expand on that when replying to the debate. There are agents for factories whose job it is to buy animals at marts for slaughter.</P>
      <P>With regard to sections 4 and 5 in relation to the 1956 order, why is it in place? If it is intended to put it on a statutory basis, why has it not been established on a statutory basis for the past 40 odd years? Is it the case that charges made against anyone found to have breached any of the regulations and orders listed, some of which were implemented recently, may not have been legal? The Minister of State might address that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="914" /> Section 8 refers to corporate bodies. The legislation in this regard does not state exactly to what that refers. Perhaps I do not understand it. The fact that the word &ldquo;factory&rdquo; does not appear in the legislation worries me greatly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation in general deals harshly with dealers and farmers, and rightly so, but it is equally important to deal with factories in the same way. When one thinks of the history of the factories, as Deputy Ross said, one thinks of their actions as outlined in the report of the beef tribunal. One of the reasons smugglers are successful is that factories are prepared to take the animals. They know who is involved in smuggling and they know if the animals brought to them have been smuggled, yet they take them. The approach has been to seek to make a quick buck. One of the general points I would make about the legislation is that the factories are not referred to specifically. This weakens the Bill greatly because they are as culpable as anybody.</P>
      <P>Returning to section 3, I referred to the 30 day residency period. I wonder whether it would be advisable to have that retained permanently. The Bill states that this may be rescinded by the Minister as he or she sees fit. If that was to be retained permanently, it would act in the future to reduce the risk of the spread of any disease which may enter the jurisdiction. For the same argument, if, in a given location, a farmer imported animals legitimately and it turned out that they had a disease, the fact that they were retained on that farm would give a period in which the disease could be identified before the animals mixed with others. Perhaps this is worth considering.</P>
      <P>Section 10 relates to ear tagging. Will the Minister clarify whether the penalty of a £100,000 fine or five years imprisonment would also apply to somebody convicted of tampering with or removing ear tags? This is not clear to me. The way the Bill is worded, it seems to be ambiguous in terms of the proposals coming forward regarding the tagging of sheep, where tags must be moved from one ear to the other depending on the age of the sheep. Perhaps this is something the Minister could tease out because I am keen to know about that.</P>
      <P>If animals at a meat factory are discovered to have tags which have been interfered with, who is responsible? Is it the meat factory, the person who transported them to the meat factory, the dealer or the farmer? It is important to clarify that issue also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally this is good legislation, but there are some weaknesses in it. The one thing that con<Col N="915" /> cerns me more than anything else is that factories are not identified as clearly as they should be. They should be treated in the same way as everybody else because of their history.</P>
    <P>When the legislation is passed with whatever amendments may be agreed to, it is imperative that it is implemented and properly policed. I appeal to the Minister not to let this fall by the wayside in the way much other legislation has in the past because it was not implemented properly. There is no point in us going through this exercise if it will not be implemented and policed rigorously.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, to the House. This is significant legislation. According to what I read on the Internet this afternoon, the Irish Hotels Federation said that in the order of 500 conferences have been cancelled since the outbreak of foot and mouth disease and that there will be 22,000 jobs at risk if the situation gets worse. Significantly, this affects not only the farming sector, but everybody. It affects all aspects of life. It has affected our sporting life and our social life. Every aspect of the economy has been touched by the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in County Armagh and, indeed, in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>It is important that this legislation is draconian. It is also necessary to combat the people whose activities put at risk the livelihood of farmers and the whole economy. I support in principle the contents of this legislation. People would need to think carefully before flouting this Bill which empowers the authorities not only to apply the severest penalties on conviction in the Circuit Court but to put those responsible out of business forever. Those convicted will never again be able to get involved in animal husbandry or farming. It is not a crime which would affect them for only a short period, it would affect them for as long as they live. Therefore, it is important legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obviously important that the legislation has come before us quickly. I would make the following criticism which is intended to be constructive. I would like to have had a copy of the Bill earlier &ndash; others also expressed this view. It may be that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development sent us an e-mail copy of it. I do not know whether they did, but they should communicate more effectively with Members of the Oireachtas when emergency legislation is proposed. When I rang the Department to get the Bill and to ask to speak to somebody about it, I was told that the gentlemen concerned were somewhere in the Houses, but I did not know where. There ought to have been somebody in the Department to answer queries or if they were <Col N="916" /> giving briefing notes in the House, they should have circulated all the Members with those facts in order that we would be in a better position to comment on this important and urgent legislation.</P>
    <P>There are a few points regarding the legislation which come to mind. Regarding the difference between the fine on summary conviction and the fine on conviction on indictment, certainly the fine on indictment is significant. Perhaps the fine on summary conviction should be heavier because £1,500 is not a large sum if a person has willingly broken the regulations relating to foot and mouth disease. Perhaps that issue should be revisited. Senator Hayes made the point that this legislation ought to be reviewed in six months to see how it is working. Perhaps issues such as the size of the penalty on summary conviction could be looked at again.</P>
    <P>Section 29A(2)(<i>b</i>) of section 3 states that the Minister may by order &ldquo;provide for the approval and registration of dealers and dealers premises&rdquo;. Is there not already a registration process in place? What, if anything, is wrong with that process? What is meant by providing approval of dealers? Does that deal with the premises rather than the dealers?</P>
    <P>The Bill, on page 7, line 11, states:</P>
    <P>Where a member of the Garda has reasonable cause to suspect that a person has committed an offence under subsection (14), the member may, without warrant, arrest the person.</P>
    <P>I presumed that the Garda already had those powers. Since a garda can arrest on suspicion of a crime being committed, why is it necessary to have that provision?</P>
    <P>Due to the problems in the UK and the farming industry generally, they have not been as vigilant as they should in Britain. An article in <i>The Economist </i>of 3 March states:</P>
    <P>Ten years ago in Britain the agricultural ministry had 43 regional animal health offices staffed by 303 vets. Last year it ran half as many offices with a fifth fewer vets.</P>
    <P>The priority they give to agriculture, monitoring of disease and the control of what is happening is not acceptable. With the drop in the income of farmers, diseases like foot and mouth have been allowed to spread. People have not been as vigilant as they should and did not have the money necessary to invest in support services from vets.</P>
    <P>Consumer confidence in food, particularly in Irish products, could be affected by something like foot and mouth disease. It would have a serious effect in terms of our exports. Consumers need the guarantee that when they buy Irish beef it is Irish beef and has not come over the Border in the last two or three hours. By definition we are talking about a minimum of 30 days. I do not know if that is proposed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="917" /> I come from a Border county. Fear and apprehension were real and palpable all over County Louth upon the outbreak in south Armagh. We are very lucky that foot and mouth disease has not spread to the rest of the country. I acknowledge the efforts of the Garda, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, and all the arms of the State in fighting this outbreak. I welcome the legislation, provided that we review it in six months or a year. We must have a finite period to see how it works. This legislation is necessary. It is draconian and properly so. The consumer needs to have greater confidence in the product they get. One of the ways of doing this is to have more significant and rigid control of animal movement, as this Bill proposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, and this very necessary legislation. I commend him on his efforts since this outbreak began. There were some criticisms of failure to act quickly enough but many of the measures put in place have been vindicated.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence that we have a case in the 26 counties. Every day that goes by is a bonus. The incubation period is relatively short and if there were a case it would be coming to the surface at this juncture. We will keep our fingers crossed for the next week or so and hope that nothing happens.</P>
      <P>Since the outbreak occurred in England many people have endured hardship and inconvenience. They have lost a lot of money. Every sector of society has been affected, even though we have not had an outbreak of foot and mouth disease. The effort the nation has put in contrasts sharply with what is happening in Britain, where the agriculture industry is not regarded in the same way as it is here. There is a general acceptance in Britain that this is one of these things that happen. They will live with it for a while and it will go away. That was their record over the course of the last century. They have had many outbreaks of this disease, which they have endured until eventually it has gone away.</P>
      <P>That contrasts totally with our attitude, which entirely justifies the measures the Government has put in place to prevent an outbreak. Some people may think they are extreme, but they are not. One outbreak could put us back six months, with enormous consequences for the massive agricultural exports upon which we depend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This new measure to curb rogue dealers is also justified. There is a lot of criticism that we know this has been happening for 30 or 40 years, especially the smuggling of cattle, sheep and other commodities across the Border. Smuggling has been endemic in the Border counties for many years. It is only by implementing these measures and making it an unprofitable enterprise that we will eliminate it. If it is not profitable people will not engage in it. This Bill will ensure that anyone caught in an act that jeop<Col N="918" /> ardises our livestock industry will certainly not be in a profitable position.</P>
    <P>All the sporting organisations are to be commended for their actions in postponing events. Tourism has been badly affected. Cancellations of many social functions have taken place over the past few weeks. Many small hotels and guest houses have had to forfeit off-season business on which they were depending. In the light of all this, it is very disconcerting to see that the millionaire groups can flout the law. They are ignoring the pleas of Government and society and going ahead with major social functions. I refer to the Westlife concerts. It is all right for the small boy. He can make the sacrifices but the millionaires cannot make any sacrifices. That is the signal that this is sending out, not just here but all over Europe. These concerts attract people internationally. This is an international group and I am told that they will have people from the British Isles, from Europe and even from as far away as America. These are gatherings that should not be allowed in the present climate. The Government should look closely at what is happening and invoke more powers in the unfortunate event of an outbreak. We should enact more emergency legislation to ban those types of concerts. There have been calls in Seanad Éireann today, and I am sure in Dáil Éireann as well, for these people to respond in the same generous manner in which the entire nation has responded to calls to prevent the large-scale gathering of people during this type of epidemic.</P>
    <P>This invisible virus is lurking around every corner, but luckily it has not surfaced. I hope this Bill will prevent the type of action we have seen in the past that has led directly to the scare. That action was taken by unscrupulous people trying to make a few quick bucks from a very shady operation. I appeal to the Government and the Minister, who is very familiar with the situation, to keep their eye on the ball over the next few weeks. I hope we will get over this scare unscathed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke last week I started by saying that with God's help and the help of others, we would be successful in keeping foot and mouth disease out of this country and I finished by saying &ldquo;God willing&rdquo;. That has happened to date, thank God.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and compliment him on the role he and the Government have played. I specifically mention the role of the Minister, Deputy Walsh. It would be remiss if we did not recognise the role Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development staff and the voluntary agencies have played in helping and in assisting in inclement weather. Despite the fact there were some criticisms of what was being done, I suggest that a great deal must have been done right to achieve the success we have achieved to date and we look forward to that success continuing, with God's help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> I welcome this Bill to control the spread of foot and mouth disease and to give assistance to State authorities in overcoming any difficulties, anomalies or bad practices in which people may engage, not for the benefit of farming in general or agriculture but for their own selfish ends. I think somebody said the Bill was draconian but it will protect the honest-to-God decent farmer doing his job day in, day out with fear or favour and without breaking the law. This Bill will give protection to the 95% of farmers who do their job well and deal with people who break the law. That is why I welcome it.</P>
    <P>Is the Bill tough enough? On summary conviction, a person guilty of obstruction is liable to a fine of £1,500 and/or imprisonment for six months. On conviction on indictment, a person is liable to a fine of up to £100,000 or five years imprisonment. Is that severe enough? I pose that question because of a recent case in my part of the country where a person convicted of changing tags got a three year suspended sentence. The application of the Bill when it becomes an Act will be at the discretion of the judge who presides over the case. I ask that consideration be given to making those fines mandatory. If we set the jump high and hard enough, it will help us to overcome this.</P>
    <P>I do not know why a fellow gets a three year suspended sentence for changing tags when a poor unfortunate woman gets six months for stealing half a dozen sausages to feed, as she claims, hungry kids or where some other unfortunate woman gets six months for stealing a handbag with £20 in it. Because I have difficulty understanding that, I believe the penalties should be mandatory. The decision as to whether someone is guilty or innocent rests with the court, but there should be no discretion in the implementation of the fines.</P>
    <P>In cases where there are serious transgressions, why is the Criminal Assets Bureau not involved? Section 7 states:</P>
    <P>On a conviction on indictment under the Principal Act or <i>section 4 </i>of this Act the court may order the forfeiture to the Minister of any vehicle, vessel, aircraft or container involved in the commission of the offence.</P>
    <P>The CAB was set up to deal with serious crime &ndash; for example, drug dealing. What has been happening and what has been shown up deserves the same care and attention and application of law &ndash; hence the point I made relative to the CAB, which should be brought in.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that a court may, in addition to any other penalty, ban a person or company from agriculture related activities. Should that section be stronger? I do not like the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; when it comes to the serious matters with which we are dealing.</P>
    <P>The legislation is designed to deal with rogue dealers and, indeed, rogue farmers. However, there would be no rogue dealers if there was <Col N="920" /> nobody to receive the goods. I accept that the protection and manning of a land border has complications and difficulties. Senator Gibbons raised the question of Athleague. How did that load of sheep get into that plant to be processed? Somebody said it arrived there at approximately 4 a.m. Was that done by special arrangement with the management? We talk about rogue dealers and rogue farmers but what about rogue factories? Is it not time they were included? Other speakers have said the position in regard to factories which support those engaged in illegal activities by being available to slaughter animals is not clear in the Bill. They are not all up here; some of them are down the country. Cattle and beef go down the country. There are many well-known and highlighted cases of that.</P>
    <P>We need to license the primary producer to produce. The set up in the dairy industry, for example, is absolutely brilliant. The beef industry is coming right but the sheep industry is wide open. If we could manage to introduce a framework where the beef, pig and sheep industries could operate within the same type of framework as the dairy industry, we could hold our heads high in the world and say to anybody who wants to listen that we are doing the job right.</P>
    <P>We have talked about the illegal movement of cattle across the Border. They do not all come from one small area of south Armagh. They are being brought in through the ports for financial gain. The Good Friday Agreement was, is and will continue to be a wonderful document. Despite the political and other difficulties, embodied in that Agreement are the cross-Border institutions. I consider the framework of those bodies highly suitable for an inclusion of the entire island to deal with the problems that affect both North and South. There is no great difference in the difficulties we have on both sides of the Border. My contact with farmers would suggest that many engaged in agriculture in the North would welcome an all-Ireland approach to solving our many common problems.</P>
    <P>There have been criticisms of this Government over its actions on the foot and mouth scare. However, it must have done much that was right. We have not had the disease here since 1941. Britain has not had it since, I think, 1983 and has not had a serious outbreak since 1967 when we succeeded in keeping it out. There was considerable agreement between the agricultural authorities, North and South, at that time. Bríd Rogers and her department are doing as good a job as they can and there has been only one outbreak on the island as a whole. Some bloody lunatic from up there has claimed on the radio that it must be down here and we must be hiding it. However there has been only one outbreak in south Armagh.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to adopt an all-Ireland approach to exclude, as far as humanly possible, diseases from the island. I urge immediate discussions between the veterinary officials in our Department led by Colm Gaynor and Paddy <Col N="921" /> Rogan and their counterparts in the North. When Paddy Rogan was a raw recruit in veterinary practice, he was trained and got his experience working in west Cork.</P>
    <P>This goes beyond the scope of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and into the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Waste food is now believed to have been the source of the disease in England. Senator Quinn has made many comments about this topic. If we are to be protected then the Department of the Environment and Local Government has to be engaged in the disposal of waste. We must be careful of that.</P>
    <P>Section 3 concerns dealers and inserts a new section 29A into the principal Act. What does the Minister envisage for subsection (4)? Does this mean subsection (3) will not apply until the Minister makes an order under subsection (4)? Subsection (5) appears to allow the Minister or an officer to issue a permit allowing movement within the 30 day period. This seemed clear earlier, but perhaps the Minister might confirm this.</P>
    <P>How will subsection (3) impact on the export of live animals? Will the new fines proposed under the Bill, also apply to other offences under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966? Can the Department implement the proposed measures, other than through the livestock marts, which are already well covered by Department regulations? Will the Minister give a commitment that the operation of the proposed new Bill will not interfere with the normal operation of livestock marts?</P>
    <P>God willing we will keep out the disease.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister for State. I commend the Department on its speedy legislative response to this matter. Less than a week ago, when we were discussing the Agriculture Appeals Bill, the Minister and the Department showed flexibility and openness to the views of the Opposition. While it worried some of us that we were expected to pass all Stages of the legislation having barely looked at it this morning, the approach of the Minister and the Department to the views expressed by the Opposition in terms of briefing and in this House has been speedy and exemplary. The Bill as published this morning will be considerably changed by the time it leaves this House, presumably this evening, because of the extent of the amendments tabled here today. Some of these are being tabled as we speak and many are very significant. The amendments outlined by the Minister already will improve the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the principle of the legislation. As Senator Callanan has said, no honest and decent farmer or dealer at a factory operating within the law need have any fear of this legislation. They should welcome it because it is designed to protect the industry at a time of national emergency. It is exactly a week since the Northern Minister, Bríd Rogers, confirmed her worst fears that there had been an outbreak in Northern Ireland. Very <Col N="922" /> few people thought that the virus would not spread over the Border. A week later, we have a great sense of relief that there has been no outbreak in the Republic.</P>
    <P>Other people have referred to the wonderful mobilisation of voluntary and State effort and particularly the response by ordinary individuals to protect us from this terrible virus. That vigilance must continue. It is disappointing that the Cheltenham race festival is not only going ahead but, judging by reports in today's media, many people from here intend to travel in spite of the outbreak within a short distance of the course. That is very worrying and suggests that complacency has crept in to replace vigilance.</P>

      <P>The Armagh outbreak has confirmed the suspicions of some that we have a major problem with animal smuggling and fraud with which the legislation is designed to deal and on which it should be commended. This has been known officially for some time. The draconian nature of the legislation confirms the size of the problem and the powers needed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to deal with it. The legislation confirms the urgent need for the Department to deal with the problem. It is a pity that it took the foot and mouth crisis to produce this response. Smuggling and fraud pose a huge danger to our industry and undermine public confidence in it a period already made difficult by BSE. The legislation is to be welcomed, therefore, even if is considered draconian and extraordinary.</P>
      <P>We are living in extraordinary times and extraordinary measures are needed to control this terrible disease and protect our national industry. The legislation will be tested in six months when we can review the situation and establish its level of success. How many rogue dealers will have ceased operating and to what extent will the industry have been cleaned up by the measures contained in the legislation? The Minister of State should review the legislation and discuss it with us in the House. We will need to review it to ascertain if it is working, how it is being used and if it is achieving its declared objectives. If smuggling and cross-Border fraud cease, it will have been worth it. Our experience of the revelations at the beef tribunal implies that we have still not managed to clean up the industry and restore public confidence in it. Nobody in the House can fail to welcome the Department's approach to rooting out the bad apples in the industry in order that honest farmers, dealers and factories operating within the law are protected and consumer confidence is restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fear has been expressed that the powers contained in the legislation will have a dreadful effect on innocent individuals charged under it. <Col N="923" /> For that reason I welcome the Minister's announcement concerning amendments. There will be a review of section 2, which contains wide powers, after 12 months. The Minister of State has listened to the views of Members on the definition of &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; and the right of appeal provided for in the Agriculture Appeals Bill will be extended to this legislation. Such essential protections are required when legislation contains such wide powers. Some farmers have fears due to bad relationships with local agricultural officers and given the powers vested in such officers, it is important that a balance is struck in the legislation to protect the innocent. I commend the Minister of State on his speedy response.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that the purpose of the Bill is to enable power to be exercised in cases where there is a risk of an outbreak of a serious animal disease. This suggests that the emergency will come to an end. I notice that the Minister of State is shaking his head.</P>

      <P>It is time two matters were looked at to restore consumer confidence, the first of which is the need to separate food production from food safety &ndash; it is essential that confidence is restored in food production &ndash; and the second the issue of a food producer's licence. When I suggested to a number of farmers over the weekend that this would protect the honest decent producer, their response was that it would be a good idea. I look forward to the legislation being discussed in the House in the not too distant future. When this emergency has come to an end we should have a stronger agriculture industry which has the confidence of the consumer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. It is important that legislation is being introduced. Its extent, detail and substance show how unregulated the sector has been. The movement, slaughter, transport and sale of animals has been open to tampering, smuggling and abuse. I do not like to see legislation introduced in an emergency fashion. It always goes wrong, and I could quote a number of instances in which this has happened. Here we have draconian legislation in terms of <Col N="924" /> the powers that are given to the authorised officer. From what the Minister has said, it looks like this legislation will be in place for a long time to come. We have been totally unsuccessful in eradicating bovine TB and brucellosis, despite the millions of pounds spent. Clearly, there have been abuses and it is not just the old badger which has been responsible for the spread of both those diseases.</P>
      <P>One of the things missing from the Bill is an emergency plan. We have plans in place to cope with disasters such as floods and bombings. The local authority was able to put a plan into action when there was major flooding a few months ago in Dublin. There should be a disaster plan available for a crisis of this nature. At the first warning of foot and mouth disease, the Minister's Department, transport companies, port authorities and local authorities should all be able to implement a pre-ordained plan. This would avoid complaints from the public through the media that there has been an inadequate response in certain areas because officials were unsure of what to do and procedures were not in place.</P>
      <P>Senator Callanan suggested that there should be a single veterinary regime for the whole island and I agree. Similar precautions would then be in place right across the board. This could ideally be dealt with in the context of the cross-Border institutions. I think this should be a major part of the input of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development into cross-Border institutions.</P>
      <P>My greatest concern about this legislation is that while it clamps down very strongly on the importers, dealers and farmers, there is no sense of emphasis on the factories. I see the wonderful phrase &ldquo;body corporate&rdquo; in the Bill. I would like a spade to be called a spade on this issue. It is referred to as an aside and I am concerned that the emphasis is not where it should be. If the factories were doing their job, it would not be possible for smugglers to make money out of the scams. If the tags were properly checked at the factories, if there was proper supervision and if the factory owners were held responsible for any scam perpetrated, there would not be this traffic in animals.</P>
      <P>The Bill's proposals are inadequate. Section 9(1) deals with offences committed by a body corporate. What is a body corporate? It is not clear&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That should be outlined in the interpretation section. A body corporate should be defined and it should be spelt out that it covers the factories that have been abusing the system, that it covers companies such as Goodman and Kepak which have been engaged in questionable practices for a very long time. I want that spelled out here. The small importer, the small farmer <Col N="925" /> and the small dealer are targeted but the big body corporate sector is not adequately targeted.</P>
      <P>Section 9(1) states that the body corporate is &ldquo;also&rdquo; guilty. Why &ldquo;also&ldquo;? He or she should be up there at the very beginning. Section 10 is a very important section dealing with ear tagging. It refers not to the body corporate but simply to the person who has unlawfully brought the animal into the State. That is the only person being targeted in relation to the offence of ear tagging, yet there could have been many other people involved.</P>
      <P>The body corporate that is ultimately responsible for allowing the scam of avoiding ear tagging is the factory. How can a British animal be brought to a Kepak factory in Athleague, County Roscommon, without ear tags and it goes unnoticed by the factory personnel? Was Super Glue used? Did the scars heal so well&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will consider amendments in relation to a review of this legislation.

    <P>I agree with Senators Ross and Norris. They put the point across with a good deal more verve than I can summon up. It is important that the public is kept aware of the disease. The public can only be shocked for about a week at a time and then something else comes along. It must be spelled out to the public how awful and terrible the disease is. Some of the London broadsheets described foot and mouth disease as a form of animal flu. People recover from flu in about three weeks, and so do animals from the disease, they <Col N="926" /> said. The insidious nature of this disease has to be explained.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation and congratulate the Minister. I am concerned, however, about emergency legislation, particularly draconian legislation. The Statute Book is littered with legislation which was initiated in response to an emergency of one sort or other and which was then found not to be effective or to be over the top. I would welcome an indication that the Minister will be willing to look at this again in tranquillity in six or nine months' time when we can look at the effect of this legislation and decide what must be done.</P>
    <P>Throughout this Bill there are loud reverberations of stable doors being shut, although I hasten to say that it was not the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, who left them open. Nevertheless, we are dealing with problems which have been latent and not properly recognised. To put it at its most charitable, there has been a history of irregular movement of stock on the south Armagh border since the time of Cúchulainn and the Táin. We have known for the last 30 years that people are making tracks across the Border. This is why some people in Northern Ireland look wryly at current efforts to seal the Border, which was sometimes permeable to semtex, and make it impenetrable to beef burgers and epizootic diseases. We must wake up to the fact of a land border which is exploited for criminal reasons, in ways which are destructive of the economy and which drain money from the exchequers North and South. These issues should be addressed when the current crisis is over.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy with Members who want this matter treated on an all-island basis. I reflected last night on photographs of the meeting of Jack Lynch and Terence O'Neill in 1967 when there was a foot and mouth threat to the island. They quickly put together a regime which ensured that the island was kept free of disease and it would be an enormous pity if, with the institutions and machinery which have followed the Good Friday Agreement, we were less able to do that today. This machinery should be built on, as it is important for the farming industry in Northern Ireland that it becomes a disease free region and maintains its position as a food producer.</P>
    <P>Although I am a strong supporter of the European Union, the completion of the Single Market has created difficulties, as Senator Ross mentioned. I hope it will be possible for the Minister to approach the European institutions to argue for safety measures before free market access in this case. The free market has dismantled the defences which were available on this island so that we are not now able to impose inspections at ports and points of entry. If defences could be arranged on an all-island basis so much the better.</P>
    <P>As Senators have remarked, there is strong evidence of scams, wrong-doing and of criminal <Col N="927" /> activity by many people along the line. It is scandalous that sheep are brought from England and Scotland through Northern Ireland and into the Republic, then accepted by meat plants as Irish sheep for the purpose of purchase, remuneration, grants or rebates. I hope those guilty of such offences will be pursued with the full rigour of the law.</P>
    <P>While this law is not retrospective, nevertheless I welcome the section dealing with tags and the changing of tags on animals. I have some difficulty with the construction of the new section 17A(8) and its relationship to section 17A(9). These subsections seem to indicate that there are two kinds of authorised officers with different powers, one group who are simply authorised officers and others who are inspectors of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. That may be my bad reading but I would welcome an explanation from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for the steps taken and for bringing forward the legislation. I suggest that every effort be made to deal with this problem on an all-island basis, within the remit of the all-island institutions that have been set up, to ensure that this and future epidemics are kept off the island. The current crisis should not blind us to the fact that there is a money-making racket in operation along the Border, involving not only cattle but diesel, drink and unbranded goods. Until the profit motive is removed this will continue and it cannot be stopped by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development alone but by the entire effort of the Governments, North and South, acting in concert. I wish the Minister well and pray that we escape a real outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the Republic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, but reluctantly as I regret the need for it. This a national crisis, a fact recognised by the vast majority of the population. I met shoppers in a supermarket in Dundalk this morning who must cross a roadblock to get to the centre of the town as the exclusion zone surrounding the quarantined farm at Meigh reaches the town. To bring goods home from the centre of Dundalk people must go through a Garda patrol. The British talk of the Dunkirk spirit and I saw a similar spirit in Dundalk today, a recognition that we have to overcome this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for cool heads. My daughter rang me yesterday from Paris where she is in the business of importing Irish goods to French supermarkets. She told me that it is difficult to explain to people in France that, while we do not have foot and mouth disease in Ireland, many normally available products are banned from export to France. She blames some people in Ireland for losing their heads. The headline in a Dublin newspaper read &ldquo;The plague is here&rdquo; when foot and mouth disease was discovered in <Col N="928" /> Armagh. Unless we act coolly we will lose control of the situation.</P>
    <P>We face nothing less than a national crisis and it is one which will cost us dear even if we succeed in keeping the disease from this part of the island. It is already the cause of losses in the tourism industry. As the chairman of the St. Patrick's Day festival, I and fellow organisers last week had to make the decision to postpone this year's festival for some time, although we did not find that decision too difficult because of the crisis. Active members of tourism bodies did ask that we opt for some measure short of cancellation. Despite that, we were all very aware of the heavy losses that will be incurred if these measures are not taken, not just by the tourism industry but by businesses and individual traders.</P>
    <P>The overall cost of the crisis to our tourism industry is estimated to be in the region of £500 million for this year alone. It is a truly staggering amount and one that will have a knock-on effect for all sectors of the economy. Yet it is a price all are agreed it is right to pay. Something which struck me in conversation over the past two weeks is that this crisis has brought home to people how flimsy is the foundation on which our recent prosperity is built. One person I spoke to in Dublin was worried that suddenly his job, his house and his whole future was at risk from something that one month ago would not have been imagined. This crisis may have the positive side effect of puncturing the reckless confidence which became a national characteristic as the Celtic tiger went from strength to strength in recent years. Up to one month ago nobody would have envisaged a scenario which would stop our economic growth in its tracks. We may be better off in the long run for having received this wake-up call. Senator Gibbons spoke of his anger towards those who decry the importance and seriousness of this matter. We must remember how flimsy our economy is; anything could go wrong.</P>
    <P>Now that we have successfully mobilised the public, our priorities should change and we should seek to maintain a cool head. We may be in for a long haul in regard to this disease and should examine how best to position ourselves as far as the outside world is concerned. I was alarmed to read that the Taoiseach intends to send most of his Ministers around the world with the St. Patrick's Day message that Ireland is treating foot and mouth disease more seriously than the British. That appears to be a rather impetuous reaction when we should be adopting a steady and cool headed approach. By shouting about our attitude to the disease we will draw attention to the problem rather than mitigate its impact.</P>
    <P>Many people do not quite understand what the problem is. The more we portray the disease as a national threat the more seriously it will be viewed throughout the world, but people will view it seriously on their own terms rather than on ours. A senior manager in the tourism industry, involved in organising the arrival of student <Col N="929" /> bands which planned to attend St. Patrick's Day parades here, but which will not now be on public display, has received calls from anxious parents asking him to ensure their children will not be fed beef. This clearly displays the way in which the situation can be misinterpreted. Some appear to think that foot and mouth disease is a food safety issue. I find it very difficult to explain to people on the shop floor that it is not. People confuse foot and mouth disease with BSE and CJD. If people see us treating this disease even more seriously than we treated BSE, they will naturally jump to the conclusion that it is more threatening to human health.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to explain to outsiders the reason we take foot and mouth disease so seriously when it does not pose any threat to human health. We must ensure our actions do not convey the impression to outsiders that there is such a threat. Neither is foot and mouth disease threatening to animals. Left alone, animals would recover from the disease in a week or two in the same way as we would recover from a mild flu. The disease is only fatal to animals because humans make it so; the burning of carcases is evidence of that fatality.</P>
    <P>I do not deny that foot and mouth is a serious disease which poses a national threat. It is a serious disease not because it is life threatening to animals or humans, but because it threatens the world trade in food on which we rely to such a great extent. The confirmation of foot and mouth disease in Ireland would result in Ireland losing its disease free status on world markets. That fact is not clearly understood by members of the public here or abroad. The loss of our disease free status would be a national disaster and we must fight with all our might to prevent it.</P>
    <P>We must avoid creating more serious problems through our handling of the crisis. The <i>New York Times</i> carried a front page story about the cancellation of St. Patrick's Day festivities due to foot and mouth disease. I did not see the article myself, but I hope the reason for the cancellation was clearly explained. I sense, however, that people a long way from here will simply feel that we have a disease problem, as evidenced by the comments of the band members' parents. It would be better if Government Ministers stayed at home for St. Patrick's Day.</P>
    <P>I had one major reservation about the Bill, but it was removed by the Government amendment imposing a time limit on its provisions. I congratulate the Minister of State on introducing it. I have always taken the view that &ldquo;quickie&rdquo; legislation usually proves to be bad legislation. Senator O'Toole regularly makes the same point. I am delighted by the Government's agreement to attach time limits to emergency legislation and I am of the view that the time limit in this case is quite logical. Law passed in the heat of the moment does not receive the scrutiny which permanent legislation demands and deserves. It is only proper that we would respond quickly and effectively to a crisis and I congratulate the Department on so doing. We must realise, <Col N="930" /> however, that our response in the heat of passion may be an overreaction and that we should revisit these issues with cooler heads.</P>
    <P>The Bill confers powers which can truly be described as draconian, a word used several times today. It confers powers to invade, search, seize and destroy private property on a raft of people, actions which, under the Constitution and our legislation, we are very careful to restrict in normal circumstances. We should only make permanent provision for such actions after very careful consideration, consideration which is not afforded to us at this stage because of the urgency of the situation.</P>
    <P>In meeting current urgent needs, we do not need to mortgage our entire future. The imposition of a time limit on the Bill's provisions will force us to revisit the legislation in less frantic circumstances. The situation may look different in 12 months and we may discover that changes are required. We may then be able to acknowledge that this problem extends further than the dozen or so rogue traders who have been discussed at length in recent days. I suggest that for every rogue trader, there are a dozen officials prepared to turn a blind eye and 100 law abiding farmers fully aware of the wrongdoing perpetrated in their names.</P>
    <P>I addressed a large IFA meeting in the Curragh three years ago and spoke about the enemy within. I am not old enough to remember World War II, but I recall the signs in Britain which stated &ldquo;beware of the enemy within&rdquo;, namely, those who supported the enemy cause. Such enemies have existed here for a long time and, having listened to many of the speakers here today, their identity is clear. We have, however, turned a blind eye to them for years.</P>
    <P>I listened to &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; earlier and heard Joe Duffy's interview with an individual who admits responsibility for bringing foot and mouth disease into Ireland. It was clear that he believed he was carrying on normal business. Such people could not work unless others supported them and turned a blind eye to their activities. I do not understand how a factory opens at 4 a.m. to accept animals from across the Border. Perhaps that is normal. In the case in question, I understand the names of local farmers were allocated to the beasts which arrived. If that is the case, many people are turning a blind eye. We must do something about the enemy within.</P>
    <P>This problem will not have gone away in 12 months, but we will be in a better position to deal with it than we are now. I, therefore, welcome the Government's amendment that the legislation will not be extended without the agreement of the Houses. At that stage we will be able to identify any problems created and any improvements which need to be made. I welcome the Bill, the Minister of State and the fact that he has recognised the need for and accepted amendments, be they Government or Opposition amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="ÜfcMr. Chambers ÜfcMr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Government, with the Commissioner, Mr. David Byrne, at EU level, on their positive and constructive approach to dealing with this issue. They have made decisions and put structures in place to deal with the problem in a proper and planned manner. The legislation is necessary. While we have been bogged down with regulation and legislation during the years, given the situation and the importance of the industry, the legislation is necessary. That said, it is important that it is reviewed because it contains many strong measures. The legislation needs to be carefully applied to be fair to all concerned and to ensure the rights of individuals are not infringed by the strong measures given to departmental officials.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas has passed much legislation dealing with the beef sector. We established a beef regulation scheme to regulate the supply of beef from farm to consumer. The current situation has identified a weakness in the regulation of the sheep industry. I also heard the interview on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; with the farmer who imported sheep from Northern Ireland. It was interesting to hear his views about what he did, and he regarded it as normal practice. He said that it was done in the sight of departmental inspectors. That highlights the need for the legislation. The Bill will respond in no small way to the needs of the agriculture industry, which is very important to the economy, while dealing with some outstanding issues which are and will continue to be of great concern and which create significant costs for the State.</P>
      <P>Dealers have been part of the agricultural economy for many generations, and we must be careful to allow them trade in a businesslike way while protecting the resource and the industry. Factories need supplies. Live exports are fundamental to the beef industry. Many people are involved in dealing and they play an important part in the agricultural economy in an open, fair and organised way. They make a great contribution and it is important that the measures in the legislation do not interfere with them unduly. I understand the measures deal strictly with areas which have the disease or which are of concern and require control and inspection.</P>
      <P>I concur with the views expressed about ethics within the Department. Dealers cannot transgress the law without its support. There is a need for a code of ethics and responsibility audits for departmental officials who will operate the legislation and deal with factories and beef exports. I welcome the section which introduces tagging for sheep. It is important that there is traceability in order that we know from where livestock has come and how many are in the State. We should plan for this and provide the necessary funding. Regulation of this type is needed for the long-term planning of the agriculture sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a certain element of confusion in dealing with disease. There is a school of thought that the closure of small abattoirs has resulted in an increase in the transportation of livestock for <Col N="932" /> slaughter. On the one hand, this leads to improved control systems, a view advanced by the food industry and Enterprise Ireland. On the other, it results in the increased transportation of stock, a factor in the spread of foot and mouth disease. There is a strong case for keeping cattle close to where they were born to reduce the movement of livestock. The more local the abattoir, the less need for transportation. This will result in greater control and less risk to the health of livestock and, consequently, the economic health of the agriculture industry.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the thrust of the legislation, there is a financial incentive through currency differentials or different VAT rates between North and South to smuggle sheep or other livestock from the North or other parts of the United Kingdom into the Republic. There is a need to examine this incentive on a cross-Border basis. It is not enough to enact legislation, although it places a responsibility on people to register and make themselves more accountable to the State and the profession. There is a need to examine the industry on a cross-Border basis. If certain changes were made in tandem with the legislation, much of the incentive for people to take advantage of the State would be wiped out. Their actions put in jeopardy an industry that is fundamental to the economy.</P>
    <P>I thank the organisations, particularly the IFA and other farming bodies, which have played a major role in supporting the Government and other State agencies. They have done what they can in relation to preventing the spread of foot and mouth disease to the State. Their actions were constructive and positive. The people have been united on this issue and they feel a responsibility towards the State. While there may be some criticism of the quick introduction of the legislation, the people recognise that it is a necessary response. It is progressive in the context of dealing with the needs of the agriculture industry.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, and join him in complimenting the farming organisations and companies. I also commend the tremendous civic spirit that has been evident since the outbreak in Northern Ireland. People have responded well in terms of preventing an outbreak here that could be disastrous. I hope such an outbreak will not occur, but it is worth reminding ourselves of the dire consequences if Ireland is contaminated by foot and mouth disease.</P>
      <P>I understand why the legislation is necessary, although some people said it is draconian. We have witnessed the country almost coming to a halt in terms of the movement of people in an effort to prevent the disease spreading, but we should consider what would happen if there was an outbreak. Ireland would lose its disease free status and, as a result, most of its food export markets. The ban would remain in place for at least six months and this would have dire consequences for the country. It is important to understand the consequences and the need for the implementation of the legislation as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Some economists suggest the potential loss to the economy could be approximately £1 billion in terms of our exports, which account for 90% of our food production. One should consider the number of people who would be affected, particularly farmers and workers in the food processing industry. There would be a domino effect in rural Ireland in addition to the problems of the shrinking population and the decline of services. There would be an effect in relation to the money that passes through rural areas and this would impact on services there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding consumers, Senator Quinn said certain people who do not have links with farming and the country are unclear about the nature of foot and mouth disease. They were concerned that it would affect humans. They just about understood the position in relation to BSE, but they linked that problem to foot and mouth disease. There should be much more proactivity on the part of the Department of Agriculture, Food <Col N="934" /> and Rural Development in this regard. It should use libraries, local authorities and schools to make the importance of farming to the economy clear. It should also produce various notices about diseases that can spread and place them in schools. This is done in relation to human diseases and it should be done in relation to animal diseases given the extreme importance of the food industry and agriculture to the economy.</P>
    <P>The public do not want much, but they will demand traceability &ndash; they should do this as of right &ndash; and safety in relation to food. They should be guaranteed it. If they do not get it, the level of meat consumption will fall. Undoubtedly, the level of meat sales and consumption fell as a result of BSE. People will now worry about poultry because the Bill refers to animal and poultry products. People may be confused in relation to the legislation, but I hope that is not the case.</P>
    <P>In terms of the need to make the position clear to people, consumers should get as much information as possible in a simple manner. There has been tremendous media coverage, much of it negative, including widespread coverage on television. The small excerpts presented nightly by Mairéad McGuinness probably did much more to help than all the documents and newspaper articles. The information was direct and consistent and Ms McGuinness repeated the message, which was important.</P>
    <P>I worry about smuggling, but the problem will be difficult to resolve. The Bill does not mention how many authorised officers will be located along the Border. It will be a major challenge for them, but I am sure we will get that information at a later stage. There should not be such a big problem in relation to the Border. At a plenary session of the EU agricultural committee, it was stated that Border surveillance was a matter for member states, but if evidence was found, the member state concerned must investigate. It was also stated that the Commission has a direct interest in ensuring that is done. In reply to questions from British MEPs about whether criminal charges could be brought against fraudsters, the Commissioner said that while it was not his duty to require prosecutions, he felt they could be appropriate in the circumstances. This was stated during a discussion in the European Parliament about the outbreak of foot and mouth disease at the end of February. I am most concerned about this aspect. Senator Ross spoke about the problem of smuggling for much of his contribution and he said it happened not only in Armagh. He also said it would be difficult to stamp out.</P>
    <P>During the discussion in the European Parliament, the EU Commissioner, Mr. David Byrne, said that imports from third countries were subject to extremely strict controls and had to be certified as coming from regions free from foot and mouth disease. I would like to know how the disease entered the UK. It was reported that it arose from swill from airlines, but it has also been stated that the disease entered the UK through an airport. As I said during the Order of Business <Col N="935" /> on many occasions last week, I am concerned about reports of people hill walking in Northumbria and then singing in choir competitions in Wales without taking any precautions in terms of disinfectant. The measures in this regard should not be relaxed, although I do not know how long the Minister intends such measures to continue. When the crisis has diminished, I hope we will continue to be as concerned and thorough in this regard as we are at present.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that a person who purchases an animal may not sell or move that animal from his lands, save under permit, for a period of 30 days. Perhaps the co-operatives and marts could be more proactive in linking farmers. For instance, if farmer A has good calves for sale, the co-operative should put farmer B, who is anxious to buy the animals, in contact with farmer A. This would mean minimal movement, even though a haulier would be involved. I would like marts and co-operatives to be more proactive.</P>
    <P>I was in Iowa this time last year, which is an extraordinarily important state within the United States in the context of farming. I visited one farm where the farmer was doing all her business through e-mail. I would think there are very few farms at the moment where there are not computers. Children use computers all the time and any farms in Limerick East which I have visited had computers. Many young farmers and farmers' children use computers to check many items, including the weight and feedstuffs of animals. The farmer in Iowa was doing all her buying and selling through e-mail. While I was visiting her, she had been on to three marts to buy animals. This is essential in a large state which has a population approximately the same size as Ireland. There was no problem in this regard. The farmer did not just do her wheeling and dealing in the state of Iowa, she bought her animals in other states also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely. Given that Ireland is a major IT exporting country, many people, including farmers, are very familiar with computers. Computer courses are held and a lot of farming activity is done through computer. The time has come for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to take on board this aspect. This new information technology should be used. This would stamp out a tremendous amount of wheeling and dealing and smuggling. If one does business through e-mail, one can discuss matters, know exactly who they are dealing with and carry out surveillance and spot checks. One can also link in instantly with other farmers. While I do not wish to cut out the dealers or hauliers &ndash;  there is a place for them also &ndash; one to one contact can take place readily. This is a small country where everyone knows <Col N="936" /> one another and e-mailing would be no big deal. People would then be dealing with reputable dealers and farmers. If there is a bad apple in the bunch, this will be much easier to trace through the e-mail than the way it is happening at the moment.</P>
      <P>Even though I missed some of the Minister of State's contribution, I am pleased he agreed to review matters.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, to the House. I realise he must be here to bring the legislation through the House. However, I wonder if the Minister and Minister of State were in both Houses last week for too long, given that they may have had other matters to attend to in dealing with this crisis. Of course, we understand that parliamentary accountability must be at the core of our democratic system.</P>
      <P>While I am not sure if the Bill is welcome, it is absolutely essential. I am aware that extreme situations demand extreme measures and the State must protect itself, its largest industry and the annual £5 billion worth of food exports, given that 20% of our net trade earnings come from this sector. That is the context in which the Bill is essential. If legislation is required to deal with certain defects which may have been apparent from a legislative point of view, the Bill should be disposed of quickly, go to the other House and be enacted into law so that the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, and the Minister, Deputy Walsh, can do everything necessary to protect the country from the scourge of foot and mouth disease.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the pressure the Minister, Deputy Walsh, the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, the officials in the Department, the Garda, the Army and other agencies involved are under. These people have responded very well in difficult circumstances. As the Minister said in his opening statement, there may have been deficiencies but, where deficiencies are pointed out in a spirit of co-operation and goodwill, they are taken on board. I have pointed out some of these deficiencies and I hope they were taken on board in the spirit in which they were intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing here with a major national crisis. There are aspects of the Bill which may result in an infringement of civil liberties but, in the national interest, this must be allowed, even to the extent that an appeals procedure may have to be restricted so that people cannot use legal devices to impede the authorities when it is <Col N="937" /> apparent that speed is of the essence in terms of responding to the foot and mouth crisis. I agree with other speakers who referred to the marvellous national response to this crisis from the sporting organisations, including the Irish Rugby Football Union, racehorse trainers, the Gaelic Athletic Association and other bodies, even though there have been a few exceptions. The general public have also responded magnificently. They have been very prudent in what they have done. If meetings were thought to be a potential source of spreading the disease, they were called off without pressure being put on people to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the perceived weaknesses which were pointed out in a reasonable way would be dealt with effectively. I had reason to phone the Department last Saturday afternoon and as I was unable to get through on the main switchboard, I got through on the helpline. The young lady involved was extremely helpful. She undertook to contact the Assistant Secretary of the Department to ask him to phone me. She is to be applauded for the way in which she responded.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out, a great number of people have willingly played their part in a concerted national effort to keep the disease out of the country. However, we must acknowledge that some people did not co-operate and this is the focus of the legislation. When the legislation becomes law, I hope it will be implemented and enforced to the degree necessary to ensure its success. If we look back at previous efforts in relation to growth promoters, BSE, animal remedies and other aspects, it has not always been apparent that the will has existed at official level to ensure these measures are implemented even-handedly and rigidly and that there are no exceptions. One can only have respect for the law if it is even-handed and all are subject to it.</P>
    <P>Extreme difficulties demand extreme measures. In many respects the legislation mirrors the animal remedies Bill, 1993. As far as I recall, there was considerable controversy at the time about conferring powers on the authorities to enter premises without warrant on suspicion that illegal growth promoters were being used or stored on the premises. There is an exclusion in the legislation regarding the dwellinghouse. I am not sure if that was included in the original animal remedies Bill and there may be strong constitutional grounds for this. In any event, I do not think many people keep sheep or cattle in their dwellinghouses. Nevertheless, this issue struck me and perhaps I am correct that it is a constitutional issue.</P>
    <P>I also have reservations about emergency legislation. It is useful that it should be reviewed. While the debate may be long and detailed, it is very important that the House gives proper scrutiny to these matters. In my experience it frequently happens that something can slip through which had not occurred to anybody as a problem and become law but for the scrutiny of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="938" /> Foot and mouth disease is not amenable to legal wrangling. Every effort must be made to ensure that individuals who wish to subvert the will of the Department or officials to prevent the spread of the disease cannot resort to illegal devices. Last Friday evening, in the knowledge that sheep were to be removed from the Curragh plane I drove across it where many sheep were grazing. Two hundred yards from the plane was a field in which a large number of sheep were enclosed behind wire. Some of the Curragh sheep were interacting with them. That is a recipe for the transmission of disease. Early on Saturday afternoon I contacted the assistant secretary in the Department and that evening I took another look and saw a very large tract of the Curragh with no sheep on it. However, in the area between the Ballymany roundabout and the racecourse there was a large flock of sheep. I detected somebody who might be associated with the flock talking to some officials and asked if it was not the case that the sheep were to be removed from the Curragh. The official sources said yes but the other answer was that while the Department of Defence wanted them moved the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development did not. Irrespective of whether that was correct, it indicated that the individual concerned was going to use every possible device to ensure that a reasonable request was not complied with.</P>
    <P>The animals should not have been moved from the Curragh other than to one secure location, because being aware of the scattering of farmers with sheep there I considered there was a potential for infection in distributing them among other herds. However, once the decision was made it was for every responsible citizen to comply with it regardless of whether they agreed. This situation went on over the weekend. It is indicative of an attitude of a minority within the industry to obstruct, to regard themselves as exceptional and to take the view that while other sheep might get the disease, their sheep would be exempt. I made the point to the individual concerned that he would be the first to seek compensation if the disease broke out.</P>
    <P>Anybody responsible for that type of activity should not qualify for compensation. The legislation covers this. While there are responsibilities to innocent parties who suffer severe misfortune, that could be extended to other industries affected by the foot and mouth epidemic.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Costello's view that the legislation does not adequately deal with the factories. It covers individuals, corporations, companies and so on, but it is framed in the context of people who are dealers and farmers acting as corporate entities. We must accept that factories are part of this problem. The farming organisations have repeatedly brought to the attention of the authorities the fact that these sheep are coming into the country. If the figure of 8,000 sheep entering the country from the other jurisdiction, reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> today, is correct, I cannot understand how not one of those <Col N="939" /> sheep appears to have been the subject of detection by somebody at a meat plant operating on behalf of the State. This again indicates what a journalist described as a voluntary blindness operating at certain levels. That must stop. We cannot decide that because of the nature of the business or because it generates a certain amount of revenue, there must be a blindness to animals coming into the country, with tags removed, being presented at factories and treated as if they were Irish.</P>
    <P>The Bill should deal with the factories explicitly and not just indirectly. They are part of the equation. If the dealers and farmers must be dealt with, so must the factories. I see no difference between these different categories in terms of their responsibilities under the law. As may have appeared to be the case, it is not a question of a partnership between the Department and the meat factories. That is not how it should be. There are precedents with regard to angel dust, growth promoters and BSE. Has that culture been, or is it being, eradicated?</P>
    <P>Extreme penalties are rightly provided for in the Animal Remedies Act, 1993. They were increased when the Bill was under consideration by the Oireachtas. The remedies provided for in this Bill are also severe.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that section 4 provides that the order of 1956 is confirmed to remove doubt. I am not clear what is meant by that. Perhaps he will explain it in greater detail. The purpose of section 5 is to give legal effect to orders and regulations made during the current foot and mouth crisis. Last week I was assured by the Minister that they had a proper legal basis. Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify the position.</P>
    <P>Section 8(1)(<i>a</i>) provides that a convicted person may also be disqualified from keeping, dealing or having charge of any animal or class or classes of animal. Experience teaches that the removal of a herd number from a person does not necessarily stop him from trading, even though it should be the case that without a herd number animals should not be able to leave the land. This brings us to the matter of traceability about which we all talk and to which we give lip service. If there is to be traceability all these measures must be in place. Following that there is the question of slaughter.</P>
    <P>I am not clear about the question of ear tags. Is ear tagging to be introduced for Irish sheep or is it the case that penalties will apply for removing tags from sheep coming into the jurisdiction? That is my understanding of the legislation.</P>
    <P>There are practical difficulties, of which I am sure Department officials are aware. We are coming into a period where there will no longer be enough feed to keep cattle in sheds and they will go out to grass. The transfer of calves from the dairy to the suckler herd is another difficulty. While this can be done under permit, logistical difficulties will arise. What is the position regard<Col N="940" /> ing milk which is sent to the North, to Strathroy, and which is returned to the South? Is it advisable for this to be happening in the present circumstances?</P>
    <P>We must debate the culture of the industry and whether the Department sees itself acting on behalf of the industry or as a regulator. Is it possible for it to act in both capacities and, if not, what should be done to address this? We have seen past examples of the failure of the regulatory authorities to act &ndash; it was pointed out in the beef tribunal report and the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General. We must decide if it is time to ensure that these failures cannot recur.</P>
    <P>The reputation of the industry is at stake. What is involved is our ability to sell on international markets and to stand over the product we produce which should be regarded as clean and free of disease. It would be helpful if the Department of Health and Children was to state, as the Taoiseach did in the Dáil, that Irish meat is safe and that the health of our meat has nothing to do with foot and mouth disease.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and will start by answering Senator Dardis's second last question. It is no longer possible for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to deal with the issue of food safety from the point of view of both the consumer and the producer. The first thing we must do is realise that we must transfer the food section of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to a separate area as consumers have lost confidence in our products in the light of the current situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to debating the issue next Wednesday week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator. I make that point in case there is not enough time for me to make a contribution on the night. The Senator is aware that I feel strongly about the issue.</P>
      <P>The Senator also asked the Taoiseach and others to speak out about food safety. The Senator may have heard me on the Order of Business earlier this week encourage people to give blood when the Blood Transfusion Service comes to Leinster House. I have given plenty of notice in order that they can eat plenty of good healthy Irish beef in order that their haemoglobin is well up to the required level.</P>
      <P>It is fine for people like me to say that Irish food is healthy, but then we get another smack in the face. I have repeatedly been contacted about the quality of Irish food. While the BSE issue was extraordinarily serious, it is not the only one. I am delighted that other Senators have said that more than a few are involved, there are widespread problems in the industry. They are not confined to farming only; they appear to extend to the meat industry. That is the reason many have said that they very much regret that meat factories are not covered under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> I had better say that I welcome the Bill, but I am not sure whether I do. How many of the regulations recommended in the beef tribunal report, which I have read, were enacted? Nothing has happened as a result. We are in much the same situation now as we were in before the beef tribunal. There has been no change in philosophy on the part of those within the industry. It appears that the message has not yet got across to those who produce or process beef that someone must eat it. I presume that was the position because beef was sold into intervention for so long, but EU taxpayers are fed up. The first thing they want is safe food. The main aspect is that it is a minor miracle that foot and mouth disease does not have any effect on humans, but who among us wants to eat diseased animals? </P>
    <P>I have had to devote much time to reassuring people about the quality of our milk. In the period before Christmas when there was more bad news about BSE, people began to contact me about the safety of our milk. This was particularly important as the then Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy O'Keeffe, had a dairy herd on the same farm as a herd of pigs, to which he was feeding meat and bonemeal. People contacted me to ascertain if the cattle had inadvertently been given meat and bonemeal, if they could get BSE and if BSE could then appear in the milk. I had to send them World Health Organisation updates from December 2000 which state that one will not contract BSE from milk. It is ridiculous in a food producing country that we are reduced to having to try to reassure the public in this way. Growth hormones and angel dust have been found in beef cattle, both of which affect human health. It is not a joke. If the Americans want to eat synthetic hormones, that is fine, but we do not know what effect those by-products have on human health. The European consumer does not want to eat them, and in a market economy, the consumer has a say. We must make sure that what we produce does not contain those by-products. It would be great if we could enforce the regulations in place. I am sure there will be trouble in enforcing the regulations provided for under the Bill.</P>
    <P>When Departments are asked to do additional work it is important to ensure additional resources are made available. I have repeatedly found that has not been the position in the Department of Health and Children. Fresh projects are taken on or hospitals are told to do this, that and the other without additional resources being put in place. We need to make sure the necessary resources are made available to provide for the implementation of the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Many farmers are extraordinarily good in dealing with this issue, but on Sunday a friend of mine from the country telephoned to say that her next door neighbour was spreading slurry. She also telephoned the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, which I am delighted to <Col N="942" /> say acted rapidly that afternoon. Is it not outrageous that a big farmer would spread slurry in an area near an urban population? A friend said, &ldquo;Everyone around here is being so good they are not even letting their dogs out.&rdquo;  Yet the farmer in question spread slurry on a Sunday afternoon. We cannot simply say that only a few rogue operators are involved. What is happening is outrageous.</P>
    <P>There is not a philosophy among a large proportion of the farming community that we must supply to shops what the consumer wants. To quote Senator Quinn, they do not seem to understand that the consumer is king. There is no point in producing products no one will buy.</P>
    <P>The current situation appears to have been addressed from an economic point of view, which I can understand, rather than from the point of view of restoring consumer confidence in our food. More needs to be done.</P>
    <P>Some Senators expressed concern about the Taoiseach's call on Ministers travelling abroad for St. Patrick's Day to tell everybody that we are dealing with the situation much better than the United Kingdom. That is a mixed message. I know everyone present will be delighted to hear that I cancelled my St. Patrick Day's travel arrangements to the United Kingdom. It might have been better if Ministers had been advised to stay at home as well.</P>
    <P>I will relay three anecdotes to give Members an insight into the level of consumer confidence in our products abroad and how it is being adversely affected. There is a sandwich fair in Paris at which a friend of mine has a stand. She had no problem bringing her samples with her, as they were in jars and were vegetable and so forth. At the beginning of the week, the Dairygold stand had no samples, as it was unable to get its products through French customs. I do not know if the situation was rectified during the week.</P>
    <P>On Monday I invited a French businessman to lunch in Leinster House. He transacts a good deal of business in Ireland to which he has been coming for about 30 years. He said to me:</P>
    <P>Tell me Mary about this story about the lambs. Is this the situation, lambs come from Scotland to Northern Ireland, then they come down here, they go to a meat factory here, immediately they are Irish lamb and then they are exported to France as Irish lamb. I see them advertised in Paris in a shop or on a menu. I remember Connemara and Donegal and I buy my Irish lamb, but that is not so Mary, is it? They could be lambs from anywhere.</P>
    <P>I was obliged to say, &ldquo;Alain, you are right&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The next anecdote relates to trying to differentiate ourselves from the United Kingdom, a very serious matter, as the United Kingdom is dealing badly with the situation. A friend of mine was in a large butcher shop in Paris about a month ago. The butcher knows that she is Irish as she has lived in Paris for a number of years. <Col N="943" /> There were about 12 people in the shop and suddenly the butcher turned on her and started shouting, &ldquo;You Irish, you are all the cause of the trouble with the BSE&rdquo;. She said:</P>
    <P>No, we are not. That came from the United Kingdom. It is not us. We have been very careful about it. We have had very little in the way of trouble.</P>
    <P>He kept shouting at her, &ldquo;No, you are all the same, you Irish have caused this problem&rdquo;. She left the shop as it was not the time to start a major EU argument.</P>
    <P>We have a serious problem in trying to show that our meat is of good quality. The emphasis appears to be on quantity and headage payments. I listen to the prices paid and the emphasis is on the price per pound, not on whether one receives more for producing quality beef or lamb. I was astonished by the story about the lambs. I had not realised what was going on and always told people that Irish lamb is terrific, it is absolutely safe and they would have no problems with it.</P>
    <P>There is one area of the Bill in which we could do a little more, that is, section 10, to which I have tabled an amendment. Although I am delighted about any measure which will improve traceability, ear tagging is an old method of traceability. I want the Minister to tell me with what the holes in the lambs ears were filled because I know many plastic surgeons who would want to know the name of the compound used. One of the most difficult procedures is trying to repair earlobes which have been pierced. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, can tell me the name of the compound so that I may advise these plastic surgeons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Senator should send her clients to south Armagh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, thinks the British Army should go there and ask these smugglers what they are doing. I am sure the Minister, Deputy Davern, will find out the name of that compound because I do not believe that those ears were inspected. All those sheep's ears were not filled in. Plastic surgery is slow and there was not enough time. I look forward to hearing the name of that compound.</P>
      <P>The amendment I tabled states that we should make sure this legislation covers all forms of identification of animals. For example, the EU may suddenly decide tomorrow that they all need to have microchips inserted or that DNA testing is necessary, which is another possibility because ear tags are old-fashioned and there is a great deal of work involved in changing them from one ear to another and in filling in the holes with plastic surgery. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, will accept my amendment because it would be worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a university Senator, I have plenty of constituents in the Department of Agriculture, Food <Col N="944" /> and Rural Development. The Department has always policed itself and I wonder about the value of intra-departmental policing. We must keep the food safety area separate. I know that the food safety area is under the Department of Health and Children, but the whole food area must be removed from the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. I presume this is what is behind the Progressive Democrats' motion which we will debate in two weeks.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will do some good because I know many terrific people who are involved both in farming and in agri-business. When one thinks of the economic devastation caused by this disaster to other areas of the economy, I pity those involved in tourism. They are having a hellish time and they will not receive compensation. This issue will drag on for months because of the way the British are going about it, and I regret that very much indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, to the House. I welcome the Disease of Animals (Amendment) Bill. Many important points have been made by Members already. I wish to associate myself with those who praised the efforts of many people and the decisions of sporting organisations, such as the GAA and the rugby and soccer organisations, to cancel matches, and the decision of other organisations to cancel functions. They have done their bit to ensure that the State remains free of foot and mouth disease. We must also recognise the efforts of the farming organisations, the IFA, the ICMSA and Macra na Feirme. We must recognise the efforts of the Department and the district veterinary offices, which have done great work in providing advice locally. Teagasc has worked around the clock and provided helplines to keep people up to speed and to give them the information they sought. That has been very important.</P>
      <P>Regarding the fact that sheep have come into the State from the North, it is important that we recognise the efforts made by the Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture, Ms Bríd Rodgers. I have listened to her speak forcefully on television on a number of occasions about the problem in the North and she has done her bit to ensure that sheep and cattle will no longer come here through the North.</P>
      <P>This is vital legislation to protect the integrity of the agriculture and food industry. The Minister outlined the importance of agriculture to the economy in this age of the Celtic tiger. It is easy to forget the role of agriculture in the economy at national and local levels in terms of the maintenance of vibrant rural societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our agricultural economy is based on sound animal health policies and this is the first step in guaranteeing the integrity, safety and wholesomeness of our food. The control of the movement of livestock is critical to the process. This Bill, together with other measures, will help to <Col N="945" /> protect the Irish livestock industry. The existing national beef assurance scheme allows full traceability of cattle and guarantees compliance with all statutory animal health regulations. The existing quality assurance scheme only requires independent accreditation to make it the best in Europe. My information is that the question of this independent accreditation is being examined at present.</P>
    <P>Speaking of quality assurance, as long as ten years ago Senator Quinn's business was providing quality assurance. He was sourcing his product from certain farms and since then his supermarkets, like many others, have been able to give assurances regarding the source of their products. It must be recognised that many companies have carried out their business in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>If we add to the above two measures to which I referred the fact that most cattle come from farms participating in REP schemes, the picture which emerges guarantees traceability, food safety, quality assurance and environmentally friendly production. No other EU member state can claim a better system. The Bill is a critical addition to the measures to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>In case anybody is in doubt about the importance of agriculture and the food industry to local communities, I will outline to the House a few facts about my county which we discussed recently. Some 25% of the population of County Offaly live in farm households. Farms in County Offaly produce a total of £140 million of product annually. Farmers spend almost two thirds of that sum buying goods and services for the farm businesses. The remainder is spent on living costs. That is a substantial sum of money and it gives some sense of the importance of the sector to the national economy. Few of the goods and services bought by farmers include imported content. I hope this provides a picture of the agriculture sector in my county.</P>
    <P>The Minister addressed the concern about the movement of animals. Initially many farmers were concerned because they thought a 30 day restriction would be imposed. That would have caused many problems at this time of year when many dairy farmers must sell or move stock.</P>
    <P>While there are a few rogue dealers, there are many well organised dealers. Those dealers bought cattle for farmers at marts and it was important that difficulties were contained in areas which had been closed. We have to realise that dealers are at ringsides in marts until 1 a.m. buying stock for farmers. A farmer would be unable to spend that amount of time in the mart. That has been the case for many years and they will continue in that.</P>
    <P>The biggest problem is the illegal movement of animals, a factor that has been commented on by many speakers. Section 2 refers to slaughter without compensation where people are caught trading illegally in stock. At one time farmers did not get paid for cattle found in factories to have illegal hormones. That stopped the use of hormones to a degree. In the early days there were <Col N="946" /> factories that looked for cattle that had been given hormones. There has to be a major responsibility on the procurement officers in factories, the people who source the livestock and check it when it comes in. They should know where stock comes from and if there is anything wrong they must carry a major share of the responsibility.</P>
    <P>What we thought were our national newspapers talked about a plague being here. That was very wrong. They should have made a public apology to the people, the farmers and the Department for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, who have done so much to ensure that a plague does not get in here. Those newspapers have a lot to answer for and certainly did a lot of harm to the industry. It was commented on in an interview today with the infamous Mr. Walsh on the Joe Duffy show. I did not hear the programme but I know without having done so that, while he might come across as a very plausible type of fellow, he is no fool and he has been in that game for quite some time. He and a small number of others like him have done untold damage to the industry. Given what he has done to farming he should not be interviewed on the airwaves.</P>
    <P>I support this Bill and compliment the Minister and his officials who have worked hard to bring it before us so quickly. I hope we will see benefits for the farming community as a result of its introduction. It contains many important measures and will stand us in good stead for many years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this legislation and express the support of this side of the House. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Davern. The people have shown their support for the work being done. If advice was given from time to time it was not by way of criticism of anything that he had done or not done. There is so much at stake in this matter that all of us wanted to make sure that we would not be looking back and regretting we had said this or not done that. The Minister has dealt with a very serious problem. We are winning the battle, even if we have not yet won the war.</P>
      <P>Various points in this legislation are particularly relevant to a small percentage of people who, seeing a short-term gain for themselves, want to carry on regardless. It behoves us to thank all the people who have spearheaded the effort in recent times, the Garda, the Defence Forces, the various State agencies and the Minister of State's Department. It has not been easy, particularly if you are on duty. We should compliment, in particular, members of the public who have responded very positively. At a time like this it is important that we look at exactly what has happened and where we are going. Will we come out of the other side of the tunnel having escaped the problem? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="947" /> The Minister of State has stated that there does not seem to be the same concern across the water. Maybe it is a percentage thing. It is important that at every level we put across the very serious way we are taking this issue. It behoves all of us to make this effort. I was slightly disappointed that his speech did not refer to some pertinent matters like the match last Saturday between Scotland and England. I know it is outside his jurisdiction but I am sure he would have a certain viewpoint about 70,000 to 80,000 people gathering in London with so many coming from Scotland, so many from the south of England and possibly quite a number from farming backgrounds. I do not know what remedies were taken at the ground but it behoves the Minister to convey that there is concern here.</P>
    <P>The match in Cardiff was called off. We have cancelled racing and the England-Ireland match will probably be called off. We are making every effort, particularly in relation to what is close to all our hearts, the commitment of the members of the grand alliance to our famous horse. He may not be a great horse but, to quote the Minister, he is certainly a good horse. We are all supportive but is there a slight weakening in the resolve? Is the Minister of State confident that no member of the Government will go Cheltenham next week? I understand he himself has cancelled some other engagement. I think I speak for most Members on this side of the House when I say that we will not go.   </P>
    <P>There seems to be a slight weakening of resolve. There seems to be a move to let Istabraq run, but no other horse &ndash; certainly noble sentiments and in an ideal world, we would all support that. I hope the Minister will get the message through to the trainers. There is, I suppose, a certain amount of scout's honour in relation to this. We have to be slightly concerned that a number of jockeys will go to Cheltenham, even though they will not come back. The word I have is that quite a number of people will travel, of which I am sure the Minister of State is aware. It is clear that they are not all from urban areas and that those travelling may include members of the IFA who, despite the best intentions, may decide to travel and to do whatever they have to do. What discussions has the Minister had with Mr. Parlon and others to ensure the message is being sent out that people should not travel this year as there is too much at stake? I hope we will see the races on television.</P>
    <P>It appears there has been a mood change among the French within the past 24 to 48 hours and that some of the famous French horses will travel to Cheltenham. I do not want to be totally parochial in this but there is a danger that there will be a mood change in relation to this and that we will take our finger off the buzzer, even though there is still a risk. I am sure the Minister of State will confirm this. When he is replying, the Minister might respond positively by saying he has taken on board what I have said and that <Col N="948" /> the message is still being sent out by his Department that we do not want people to travel next week. I declare an interest in that I will be slightly out of pocket, although not fatally, as a result of not travelling next week.</P>

      <P>Not if Arctic Copper won. People will be out of pocket. Some people have acted responsibly and maybe the Minister will convey to his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, the need for some gesture to reduce cancellation fees in respect of the airlines and hotels. I am not saying we should abandon them. I have heard Mr. O'Leary of Ryanair look for the devil and all and talk about Aer Rianta, but apparently to date he has done nothing. People do not necessarily want a refund of their money but perhaps they might be given a voucher for a trip at a future date or some <i>quid pro quo </i>where one might lose 20% or 25% but would get a voucher. People do not necessarily want their money back, we all accept that. That is the way in which people have entered into the spirit of things.</P>
      <P>By and large, people have taken this crisis on board and they support the farming community. Many of them probably have relatives and friends among the farming community and they recognise the need for care. The Minister might suggest to some people that they could do a little more at this time.</P>

      <P>Some have declared what they will do, but we still await a response from others. I have not seen many poor bookies, as the Minister will know. I do not want to focus totally on Cheltenham as there are a lot of other serious issues.</P>
      <P>What is the position in relation to tagging? Is it being introduced? Will it be introduced over a period of time? I do not come from the biggest rural constituency in the country and declare only a dozen small to medium size farmers, who are probably not totally dependent on agriculture. Questions need to be asked about some of the factories. Following from the beef tribunal, there are matters which have not been fully addressed. I suggest to the Minister that there has never been a better time to put certain things in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This side of the House, including my colleague, Senator Hayes, our spokesman on agriculture, support the Minister in all he is doing. It has not been an easy time and he has been sent up front. As he said, using his own inimitable words, he is not the plumber in the airport. If the Department says that certain things have to be done, I hope that is conveyed down the line. If they are not being done further down the line and a report or complaint comes back to the Minister, it will be <Col N="949" /> up to him to get them done. The Minister cannot be at every port or airport. People are flying to England and Wales, and while I am not saying they are putting anything at risk, there must be a realistic appraisal in this regard.</P>
    <P>I return to a hobbyhorse. I have a friend who runs buses to Newgrange and Glendalough who is out of business at the moment. There are people who depend on racing, and they are not all like Ruby Walsh or Norman Williamson. They are not getting fees at the moment, although trainers may be getting fees. I will not speak for the owners because I probably have a vested interest, but I hope we are slightly in front for the year.</P>

If this crisis passes in four to six weeks, the Minister might have discussions with the racing authority about staging extra events at a later date, whether extra maiden hurdles or a few extra point-to-points because some people are taking a hit at the moment. Obviously, we do not want to take the biggest hit of all but everybody involved has to play their part. I know the Minister has not been found wanting in the past. As a fellow member of the alliance who is slightly disappointed about not travelling to Cheltenham next week, I suggest that maybe 2002 will be even better.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. It is unfortunate that we have to put in place this legislation for the minority of gangsters involved in this illegal activity for their own financial gain. It is, however, necessary legislation. As somebody who has lived along the Border and grew up on the stories about smuggling across the Border, I am fearful that, regardless of what legislation we introduce on any aspect of smuggling, there will always be individuals who will find a way to avoid being caught until something like this happens. The outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Britain is possibly a blessing in disguise as it exposes the activities of a number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that this Bill places the emphasis on dealers. We have to acknowledge that farmers, dealers and factories have been involved in this activity. Some of the blame is with the people in the factories because this would not be possible without the co-operation of all these people. It is important to enforce this legislation. Unfortunately the enforcement of legislation is not as good as it should be. The public has a perception that this Bill will prevent the ordinary farmer, who has been operating within the law, from <Col N="950" /> carrying out his daily work. We must emphasise that it is dealing with specific people during particular outbreaks of disease.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill covers dealers and mentions people who purchase an animal and sell it on within 100 days. Many farmers fall into that category. We need to specify that they are not necessarily included. These are not draconian measures that will prevent them from carrying out their work.</P>
    <P>Section 3 also mentions that the Minister could provide for the approval and registration of dealers and dealer premises. I have some difficulty with that. Our aim is to keep the island free of foot and mouth or any other disease. We need to look at co-operation between Northern Ireland and the South. I suppose, up to now, we prided ourselves in having all the rogues around the Border counties, but I am pleased to hear in the last few days that they are throughout the country. It may not be necessary for the legislation to specify co-operation, but it is essential to strive for registration that is recognised both north and south of the Border.</P>
    <P>I have heard Senators, over the last couple of years, speaking about various crises. I feared that at some stage we would have a crisis and, having cried wolf so often, nobody would believe us. Over the last week, I have witnessed considerable panic among ordinary decent people who work hard seven days a week for a basic living and we all know there is not much in farming now.</P>
    <P>Over the last day or so there has been an air of optimism that we have managed to keep the disease out of the south of the Republic. Considerable credit is due to the Minister for State, Deputy Davern, and the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and all those involved including the Civil Defence and the Department officials who have played their part so efficiently. I fear that there is a certain complacency and as time goes on we will ease the restrictions we have imposed.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave mentioned that it is a difficult time for other people and industries particularly as we face into the main part of our tourist season. It will be difficult for another couple of weeks but we must hold a tight rein during that time. There may be difficulties in the short term but we have to get over this hurdle for our long-term benefit, particularly in agribusiness.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with authorised officers. Some of my constituents have been hounded by officers from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development particularly over the Animal Remedies Act and its regulations on sales of veterinary products. Sometimes the investigation will drag on. There should be a time limit applied to these authorised officers. Who are they answerable to? Sometimes they seem to be involved in a power game and they run away with themselves. They have to be held back. This may seem contradictory but I am concerned about people having too much power without having guidelines.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="951" /> I welcome the legislation but it has to be enforced. We cannot let complacency set in during the next couple of weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for State and the legislation. It is unfortunate that this Bill is necessary but the small number of people who knowingly break the law for their own greed have to be stopped and dealt with. It appears that we have succeeded in keeping this dreaded plague out. Senator Ross said earlier that he felt it was God's will that kept it out and not any precautions implemented by the Minister and his Department. I vehemently disagree with that. We put measures in place as soon as was humanly possible. Both the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and the Minister for State, Deputy Davern, have worked exceptionally hard at every opportunity to advise the farming community and the public. They have done an excellent PR job for our country.</P>
      <P>Some people questioned whether we got off the mark on time. This was much discussed in the media in recent days. On &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; last Monday, the four people on the panel along with the Minister all agreed that we did introduce the necessary measures on time. Foot and mouth disease was not here and we were taking precautions in case it might arrive. It was on the island, a couple of miles across the Border and, with due respect to the man above, God's will was not good enough to keep it out. The precautions put in place were absolutely necessary and I compliment everybody because I feel we have succeeded. As my colleague Senator Leonard said, this is not a time to be complacent but at least we can be optimistic and continue working to ensure that this dreaded plague will not come here.</P>
      <P>Some people in the media were very critical of the Minister and his officials in recent weeks. It was disgraceful for a national newspaper to carry a banner headline saying that the plague had arrived here. That was not the case. It has not arrived yet and I believe, because of the measures taken, it will not reach us. The day after the Minister stated this in the Dáil, a scurrilous editorial was written castigating the Minister. This was totally unjustifiable and there is an apology owed to the Minister and to everybody who has worked so hard to ensure that the disease is kept out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's speech. There has been obvious confusion among genuine cattle and calf dealers who are on the road making an honest living. It is ironic that on a recent RTÉ television programme, there were two such cattle dealers interviewed who were at pains to point out that they were genuine. They did not have to convince me of that. They were mystified by the fact that they were all being tarred with the one brush. As politicians, we know how hurtful this is when there is corruption by a tiny minority. I fully sympathise with them. The vast majority of cattle <Col N="952" /> dealers and buyers are genuine and trying to make an honest living.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that in certain specified circumstances the Minister may, by order, ensure a person who purchases an animal does not move that animal save under permit for a period of 30 days. This is necessary to prevent the outbreak or spread of disease. The section in question is intended to eliminate practices which have put the health of the national herd at risk. It is also the Minister's intention to ensure, through the permit system, this restriction does not interfere unduly with normal and reasonable commercial activities. I welcome this because there was confusion. It is reassuring that honest persons can conduct their daily business without restriction except in exceptional circumstances where there is a threatened outbreak of disease. It is important for me to say what I have said as a representative of the rural Limerick West constituency which depends hugely on the agriculture sector.</P>
    <P>When the Minister spoke in the House last week he said that both he and the Department could only do so much and that there was a responsibility on every individual in the country for which he was criticised by a member of the Opposition. The public, as individuals and members of organisations, has responded magnificently. Many have made huge sacrifices at their own financial expense on which they are to be complimented. We need to keep the control measures as tight as possible in coming days. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, and the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, will be commended if we succeed in keeping out of the country foot and mouth disease. It will boost farming and enhance the reputation of our beef trade abroad.</P>
    <P>I welcome this necessary legislation and I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on it.</P>

      <P>Last Wednesday I was faced with the decision in my organisation as to whether the Northern conference should take place in Newry. I sought advice in two places. I sought advice from the Minister for Agriculture in Stormont and former Senator, Bríd Rogers, as to whether it should go ahead, but could not receive clear advice from her office. I also spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, and his office from which I received clear and unambiguous advice which allowed me to organise the cancellation of the conference. I make that point to illustrate that, regardless of early or late intervention, there was clear advice available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remind the Minister of State that before this crisis started he discussed the issue of food in the House when I pleaded with him to examine the <Col N="953" /> case for amendment of the legislation dealing with abattoirs. It should allow the slaughtering of beef by licensed local butchers in order to ensure traceability from grass, to butcher to table. It is important that this be done in order that the people will have confidence in their food sources.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State's response in bringing forward the legislation which I hope will not experience the same fate as many other reactionary pieces of legislation, including that dealing with wandering horses and dog muzzling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">

      <P>The Control of Horses Act is working well and effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It was brought forward by another party. The legislation dealing with dog muzzling was brought forward by the Minister of State's party when the <i>Evening Herald </i>carried a headline indicating that someone had been savaged by a dog.</P>
      <P>I intend to bring forward two amendments on Committee Stage to which I ask the Minister of State to be open. Section 10 is almost incomprehensible. I had to read it four or five times to figure out its meaning. It does not require the ear tagging of sheep here. I suspect, however, that the Minister of State does have authority under the principal Act to provide for this under regulations. For that reason, I intend to propose a new section requiring the Minister within one month of the commencement of the legislation to bring forward a protocol or regime for the ear tagging for sheep. Section 10 is almost inoperable in a situation where there are both tagged and untagged sheep. It is only when there is a requirement to tag all sheep that section 10 will operate effectively. I urge the Minister of State to commit himself to the introduction of ear tagging within one month of the commencement of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also intend to propose a new subsection to section 10 to make the owners of licensed abattoirs and meat factories responsible for the failure to detect breaches of the section which they could reasonably have been expected to detect. That is very important. The country is outraged by what happened last week. I do not make a judgment, but a phrase in section 10 states that it shall be presumed in any proceedings, until the contrary is shown, that the accused unlawfully brought the animal into the State. That is a presumption of guilt and ignores the presumption of innocence. While my liberal tendencies react against it, it is required on this occasion. I would like to be reassured, however, of its constitutionality with which there may be a problem. I would not like to see it being challenged in the Supreme Court. It seems to set aside the presumption of innocence. I have used the same phrase in the section I intend to propose dealing with factory owners and hope it is constitutional. I ask the Minister of State to accept these proposals in the spirit in which they have been brought forward and to show that the legislation is supported from all <Col N="954" /> sides. The Minister of State can be assured of our full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the general thrust of the legislation. It is very important that the Minister of State tighten the regulations on the movement of animals. I come from County Roscommon where there was an incident that could have led to Armageddon. Sheep from an infected flock in the United Kingdom were brought to County Armagh and thereafter to a meat processing factory in Athleague, County Roscommon. There is a huge mystery as to their arrival in Athleague, the time of their arrival and the fact that all these animals had punched ears because they had been tagged in Britain, yet this was not noticed. There is a rumour mill operating in that area which is that this was common practice.</P>
      <P>Quite obviously, there has been an enormous amount of irregularity in the way animals have been transported throughout the country. There have been irregularities in slaughtering plants in relation to proper identification of animals. A tax scam seems to have been operated in relation to VAT and VAT refunds were being fraudulently claimed. This practice was highlighted in a television programme some years ago. It appears that the Revenue Commissioners became active and there was a revenue clawback. Criminal activity was not prosecuted through the courts, the State being quite happy, it would appear, to have retrieved some portion of the value added tax which had been defrauded from it.</P>
      <P>Cattle dealers are often cast as the villains. I must declare my interest. I am a farmer and I have dealings with cattle dealers. Like many farmers, I rely on dealers to purchase my animals. That is a modern phenomenon of the farming business. There are several hundred people who are cattle agents. They go to the marts and purchase animals on behalf of farmers. These people are the professional agents at marts and they know the procedure. By and large, they conduct an honest business, but of course, there are cowboys involved.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the Bill could be very restrictive on the honest people in the business. It states that &lsquo;dealer' means a person who purchases an animal or poultry and sells and supplies the animal or poultry to another person. A definition is required for &ldquo;sell and supply&rdquo;. Subsection (3) of this section states:</P>
      <P>(3) Subject to this section, a person who purchases an animal shall not sell or supply that animal while it is alive for a period of not less than 30 days and, during that period, shall hold the animal on land in his or her ownership or under his or her control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An agent may purchase an animal at a mart on behalf of someone like myself. The farmer may choose five or six of the ten animals he is presented with. They are then delivered to the farm but the other unsuitable animals may have to be taken to the dealer's own farm. Must he <Col N="955" /> then keep those animals for 30 days? The Minister is shaking his head.</P>
    <P>This is emergency legislation and I appreciate the reasons it must be pushed through at great speed. We must be very careful with emergency legislation that we are not taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut. We could do an injustice to many people and could be standing in the way of legitimate business. I want to root out the cowboys but I want to protect the interests of the decent, honest agents who provide an excellent service for farmers. They are an essential element of modern farming. They are tax compliant and comply with the animal diseases regulations. In our attempt to get rid of the cowboys and those who break the law, the sins of a few may have a scattergun effect. I ask the Minister to be aware of that. We do not wish to destroy the livelihood of anyone carrying on a legitimate business. We do not wish to interfere with an important element of the cattle trade. These people are not what was described, rather amusingly I thought, on the television programme &ldquo;Ear to the Ground&rdquo; on RTÉ as &ldquo;blockers&rdquo;. They carry out their business legitimately and the Department know about them.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill in general. The country faces Armageddon if this disease arrives here. We are now in the happy position of being able to export our lamb to France and lamb producers are enjoying a huge boost in their prices because the British are no longer there. If a foot and mouth outbreak takes place in this country, that lamb export trade would cease. That is one immediate effect that can be seen. All consumers are inclined to criticise the price of lamb, but I will stand up for sheep producers. Many of them are my neighbours and I have seen them suffer from low income for years and a total uncertainty about the market. When the price goes up, the subsidy goes down, and they are locked into a no-win situation unless the market showed an improvement. One of the fortuitous outcomes of the ban on the export of all United Kingdom meat to its traditional markets is that we are the winners.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to make a contribution to the debate and I ask the Minister to ensure that the Bill does not interfere with the legitimate livestock agent who operates from mart to farmer and goes about his business in a fully legal way. We need instead to get rid of the blackguards and the cowboys.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill to the House. It is emergency legislation but is essential under the circumstances. I congratulate my colleague from west Cork, the Minister, Deputy <Col N="956" /> Walsh. He is doing a fantastic job in stymieing the threat of an epidemic in this country. I also congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Davern. They were thrown in at the deep end when the outbreak in Armagh came to light and they have done wonderful work. I applaud the public response throughout the country, although there are some exceptions. Every event, from bingo in west Cork to football matches, has been cancelled. I heard today that the District Court in my area will not sit while this threat remains, unless there is a serious need for it to do so.</P>
      <P>The increased penalties, including the ban on agriculture related business, where necessary, are welcome. The issue of illegal tampering and switching of tags and cards is a serious one, as the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, and his officials are aware. I received information about a dealer who was raided and found to have close to 1,600 tags and accompanying cards in his possession. These sell for £60 or £70 apiece and the case suggests serious racketeering which must be stamped out.</P>
      <P>I concur with Senator Connor that there are many genuine, tax compliant cattle dealers and jobbers in all areas. One of the country's most isolated marts at Skibbereen saw dealers arriving in spring, purchasing calves of several months of age and transporting them to different locations. Another practice in peripheral areas, where there are many small farmers who would not find it economical to go to mart, is to employ a genuine, tax compliant cattle agent to buy one's cattle and take them to mart. I hope the restrictions do not create difficulties for this trade, which is undertaken by honest people with families, who keep tax records.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that it was common before the closure of the Border for cattle over 30 months of age to be taken across the Border in a liberal fashion under the BSE scheme. This enabled dealers to avail of the £300 slaughter allowance which the Northern Ireland authorities allowed per animal. On the return leg, the same lorries often carried young cattle across the Border to the Republic and into our system where they were tagged again.</P>
      <P>The sincerity of and the methods used by some of the larger cattle slaughtering and beef companies have been called into question. Some companies must know that these animal imports do not comply with regulations. I am concerned that these practices continue and I hope that this legislation helps to curb the problem. This crisis is a wake-up call to the farming and the agri-food industries which should look at it in a serious light. One racketeer, one villain, one cowboy or criminal could destroy, or put at risk, our entire food and agriculture industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that there must be rules and regulations but in many instances these hit out at smaller operators in our community and not where the real problem lies. An example from west Cork, where a farmer with four suckler cows was deprived of his grants after one of his cows <Col N="957" /> died and he could not make his 80% quota, shows how the strict operation of regulations can adversely affect small farmers. Another farmer in west Cork who has 200 to 300 cattle had four calves born on his farm on a day when he was in hospital. Making a genuine mistake, the farmer's wife recorded the birth of three female and one male calf and not the reverse as was the case. This year that farmer suffered a 10% penalty despite his honesty. To see honest small farmers treated in this fashion makes my blood boil, while some of the major players in the industry nationwide are involved in racketeering and the irregular transporting of cattle and sheep.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that tagging will be extended to sheep and I welcome this proposal, but considering the threat to a multi-billion dollar industry, I ask the Minister for State, Deputy Davern, whether the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development would consider the use of silicon chips. I have limited experience of this technology, but I believe that, unlike removable tags, it would greatly enhance traceability and would allow animals to be traced, not just in Ireland, but across Europe.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned that growth promoters are still in use and it is a scandal if it continues. With the recent BSE problems and the current foot and mouth crisis there is a lack of consumer faith in the agriculture industry. It is no wonder the public and foreign beef markets show concern. This is a wake-up call for the industry and it does not come before time. We should look seriously at this legislation despite some having criticised it as emergency legislation. It is essential and is a step in the right direction, but in many ways it does not go far enough towards outlawing the operations of the professional clique racketeering across the Border and beyond.</P>
    <P>There are also questions surrounding imports from Britain and exports. People in high places in the agriculture industry know what is going on, although I am not referring to the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, or his officials. Some in the industry know where tags are stashed and who is likely to make most out of racketeering. This activity must be stamped out so that genuine farmers, agents and cattle buyers receive fair play. The Minister for State and his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, have done an excellent job so far. They should keep the hatches battened down fully as there is some time to go before we can breathe a sigh of relief. It is a very serious crisis but, so far, the Ministers, Deputies Walsh and Davern, have done an excellent job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Donovan for sharing his time and I hope his impassioned plea on this crisis was not curtailed by our prior agreement to share time. I could not but reflect on Senator O'Donovan's comment that one cowboy could be enough to put our entire agriculture industry at risk. It was one cowboy who introduced foot and mouth into the Armagh farm &ndash;<Col N="958" /> just one person. It may only have been that person's conscience that made him reveal the trail from Scotland. We would still be discussing traceability if he had not done so.</P>
      <P>I echo what has been said on all sides of the House about the outstanding contribution the public has made. It has responded to the political leadership shown by both the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, and the country has caught the mood of what both have said during the crisis.</P>
      <P>When we had the foot and mouth scare in 1967, a much higher proportion of our GNP related to agricultural production. In 1941, in excess of three quarters of the economy was agriculture based. The figure is closer to 10% today. The response to this crisis is an indication of the empathy of the non-farming community with the farming community. People have displayed what I can only describe as an Irish version of the Dunkirk spirit exhibited in Britain during World War II. I cannot help reflecting on the sacrifices people have made in response to the crisis. In my home town, a gentleman who was participating in a first aid course in Galway decided not to attend the course because he would have to travel via Athleague on his journey from Galway to Drumshanbo and he wanted to avoid even the most remote possibility of picking up infection. That is an example of the civic spirit which still prevails in this age of great cynicism. Not long ago, Irish people were accused of being selfish and inward-looking and failing to display the civic spirit exhibited by our forefathers. It is heartening to see people rallying round in response to strong, resolute and fair political leadership.</P>
      <P>In spite of the odd barb from the Opposition, the Minister and Minister of State have rightly expressed their appreciation of the support of Opposition spokespersons, Deputies Dukes and Penrose. That support has followed through in this House. We are all in this together. While it is only proper that the Opposition should criticise where criticism is warranted, its support for the Government's efforts to ensure this disease does not reach our shores should not go unrecorded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the wholesale smuggling which seems to be culturally endemic in a particular part of the island. A report in last Sunday's <i>Observer</i> alleges that former active members of the Provisional IRA had switched from a military to a smuggling campaign. A former quartermaster of the Provisional IRA was alleged to have been a leading smuggler who is now a multi-millionaire as a result of his illegal activities. I hope the legislation, particularly the sections dealing with the movement of livestock, will be enforced. The full resources of the State must be utilised to ensure we eliminate the cowboys and gangsters who appear to have no God, but their pocket. They do not care whether their neighbours must live in penury for the rest of their lives following the destruction of their animals. I hope similar resolution will be shown following the enactment of the legislation as was shown follow<Col N="959" /> ing the tragic murder of Veronica Guerin which mobilised the forces of the State as never before in an effort to ensure the mafia style gangsters who had operated for so long in this city, in spite of all the laws on our Statute Book, would be stamped out.</P>
    <P>This crisis may be a watershed for us all. The Government is to be commended on its actions in this area. Any Government, irrespective of its composition, must take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the economy is protected in every possible way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their widespread support for the legislation.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senator Connor, section 3 will not apply in normal circumstances. Its provisions will only apply in the circumstances which currently pertain in regard to foot and mouth disease. There is a huge brucellosis problem in County Monaghan and if we are of the view that there is a need to restrict the movement of herds there in an effort to prevent the spread of disease, the legislation will allow us to do so. I was at pains to emphasise that the Bill's provisions will not apply to normal agricultural practice. More than £2 billion has been spent on disease eradication, but we are no nearer now than we were ten years ago. We owe it to taxpayers to introduce legislation which will allow us to restrict and monitor movement in areas in which there is an outbreak of disease.</P>
      <P>Many Senators commented on the IRFU. If all other organisations were like the IRFU, we could be very happy. As part of its very considerable contribution to the cause of Irish agriculture and food industry, the IRFU today announced the postponement of the Ireland-England and Ireland-Scotland matches.</P>
      <P>Sheep tagging will be introduced. There was some resistance to it from certain elements within farming and certain meat factories. I welcome the IFA's decision last Saturday to facilitate the introduction of tagging and we will move forward with this initiative as soon as tags become available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Senator Gibbons, an authorised officer who requires the disposal of an animal will supervise that disposal. This is merely an operational matter which does not require specific legislative provision. The Senator asked about legitimate buyers acting on behalf of factories. Factory agents will not encounter any difficulties under section 3. Other buyers who wish to sell on to factories within 30 days can apply for permits in the normal fashion once section 3(3) is in force. Sections 4 and 5 were introduced on the advice of the Attorney General to underpin the various orders. The sections do not imply that the orders were not legitimate or that any convictions made under them are unsafe. The Attorney General wanted us to adopt a belt and braces approach to <Col N="960" /> the matter. Section 10 which deals with ear tags will only apply where a person is charged with an offence and will not interfere with the legitimate replacement of ear tags.</P>
    <P>Senator Callanan asked whether section 3(3) will only come into effect when an order is made under section 3(4). I confirm that will be the case. The issue of live exports must, of necessity, be dealt with by the permits provided for in section 3. It is not intended to interfere with the legitimate assembly of animals for export which do not pose a threat to our disease free status. In reply to the Senator's question about whether the penalties imposed in this section will apply to other provisions in the Bill, they will not. These penalties were recently updated in the beef assurance legislation. On livestock markets, I am happy to give Senator Callanan an undertaking that the Bill will not interfere with legitimate mart operations. Livestock marts must play their part in abiding by all aspects of the law in this area, including legislative provisions on disease control.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the role of factories. Important provisions such as those included in the Bill apply as much to factories as they do to farmers, dealers and others in this area. The powers in section 2, described as draconian, can be exercised in a variety of contexts. The Bill's provisions are not specifically aimed at farmers, rather they are aimed at wrongdoers in the industry, whoever they may be.</P>
    <P>The addition of the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; in section 7 means that, on enactment of the legislation, the Department may seek an order of forfeiture from the court in respect of any field, farm building or other premises, including a meat factory, which might have been involved in the commission of an offence under section 4 of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966. Vehicles, vessels, aircraft and containers can also be forfeited.</P>
    <P>The precise arrangements for the approval and registration of dealers provided in section 29A(5) as inserted by section 3 have yet to be settled. Once the legislation is enacted, the Department will quickly formulate these details which need to be carefully constructed to ensure that the measures do the job we want done. The Department will announce details shortly.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross referred to the late delivery of the Bill. This is unfair. Exceptional measures were taken to ensure Opposition spokespersons on agriculture were given drafts of the Bill last night and were briefed by officials this morning. The Labour Party was in a position to table amendments, which I welcome, and that disproves the Senator's point. I regret the short notice in providing the legislation, but I am sure everyone appreciates the position with the threat of foot and mouth disease.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross made allegations against the Department which effectively amount to allegations of corruption against it. He claims to have evidence to support these allegations. He should either withdraw his allegations or produce the <Col N="961" /> evidence. If they are true, we want them investigated immediately, either by the Department or another Department. If there is evidence to this effect, as opposed to loose allegations, it should be brought forward. Now is the time to do so when there is a national emergency. The matter will be investigated fully and any wrongdoers dealt with. I do not like accusations being made without proof to support them.</P>
    <P>The main concern in the debate was to ensure legitimate cattle dealers and others involved in the cattle trade are not affected by this legislation. I assure the House it will only be brought into effect when an outbreak of disease occurs in an area. It is essential that that is borne in mind. Areas which have been free of diseases such as brucellosis or TB are seeing signs of their return. That is either because of people bringing in infected livestock or because of wildlife. If we can identify the infected animals and confine them to the immediate area, it will ensure that the disease will be contained and not spread elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Tagging is widespread throughout Europe and it must be accepted that, for example, tags will fall out in the implementation of such a system. I am delighted we now have agreement on the tagging issue. Senator O'Donovan mentioned microchips as a form of tagging. We have had discussions with a number of interested companies. We would be able to trace animals by satellite, so it would be an expensive system. That said, we have yet to find a secure place in the animal in which to locate the tag so that it will not come loose and end up in meat or in new manure on fresh grass. If we find a place to locate it, we will examine implementation of the system.</P>

      <P>Section 2 provides that an authorised officer of the Department visiting a farm to conduct important business shall be supplied with a warrant. It also provides that if the warrant is demanded, the officer must produce it to the farmer for identification reasons. The amendment seeks the inclusion of a photograph of the officer on the warrant. This would remove any doubt about the identity of the officer exercising the warrant and enforcing serious regulations on behalf of the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Senator's idea, but it would not be practical to accept the amendment because the current authorisations do not include photographs and it would seriously delay the implementation of the legislation. I do not wish to imply any form of blackmail, but I remind the Senator that there are now 96 cases of foot and mouth disease in Britain, an increase of 15. My criticism on television on Sunday night was well placed. The introduction of the legislation is urgent. We will consider how its provisions can be improved. I agree that there should be photographs on all identification documents. An officer from the DVO is, however, usually well known locally.</P>

      <P>In page 11, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)Licensed meat factories and abattoirs are required to put in place an effective regime for checking the ears of animals and carcases. Where a licensed meat factory or abattoir has failed to discover a breach of <i>subsection (1) </i>of this section, where it could reasonably have been expected that they should have, its owners shall be individually or severally presumed, until the contrary is shown, to have been party or abettor to an unlawful act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is public outrage at what happened last week. It requires a political response. In a large factory where 30 vets were employed no one noticed that approximately 230 sheep had had their tags removed. In my student days I worked in quality control in meat factories. In my youth I worked in abattoirs and have skinned and dressed carcases. The idea that trained staff would not notice 230 animals passing through a factory with holes in their ears is beyond the bounds of credibility. It is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>There is a mood to ensure that those at the bottom of the line will not be the only ones to be implicated. The big operators had an involvement in what happened last week. Effective action is required. The acceptance by the Minister of State of amendment No. 19, tabled by the Labour Party, means that its implications would apply to this amendment. On Second Stage I said that it was dangerous to lift the presumption of innocence and I am much happier with the wording of amendment No. 19.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;11.&ndash;Within one month of the commencement of this legislation the Minister shall prescribe and introduce procedures for the mandatory ear tagging of all sheep.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My intention in this amendment is to give force to the Minister of State's hand in negotiations. I take it that the references in section 10 to the principal Act and to section 3 of the European Communities Act confer on the Minister the power, by the introduction of legislation, legislative order or statutory instrument, to introduce mandatory ear tagging. The Minister of State said that, on the advice of the Attorney General, section 4 has been drafted to give legislative effect to previous orders. I am taken by that novel approach. It is similar to what is suggested in the amendment which is drafted in such a way that it would not require ear tagging to commence in one month, rather it would require that the procedures be then introduced. They would outline the timescale for implementation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to the House. I am seeking to find out exactly what is happening regarding the restructuring of the community employment projects and what will happen to the participants and supervisors of those projects. As the Minister of State will be aware, under the Partnership for Prosperity and Fairness, it was agreed by the social partners that there would be a degree of restructuring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned this evening about what is happening in the area of school based projects. As I <Col N="975" /> understand it, there are possibly 5,000 participants in these projects and I do not know how many supervisors are involved. All these projects will be discontinued and the participants will be transferred from part-time community employment schemes to full-time employment. How can the Department do that and what will be the fall-out?</P>
    <P>I understand that the funds will be transferred from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the Department of Education and Science. What will happen regarding management of the scheme? Will responsibility for that be transferred from FÁS to the Department of Education and Science?</P>
    <P>Will the work of the people, who to date have been employed as participants on a 20 hour basis per week, be increased to 35 or 40 hours? If so, will that mean a diminution in the numbers by roughly 50%? In the context of schools, which are open for roughly six hours, which is shorter than the average working day, that would mean there would be about 30 hours work per week. Therefore, there are many logistical matters to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>My real worry is how the Department will deal logistically with the 5,000 participants. What does the future hold for them? Will each school be in a position to look at its needs and retain the people already employed or must schools tell a large number of them that owing to the restructuring, their employment has been discontinued? If that is the case, what will happen with the supervisors? Unless there is a certain number of people participating in the scheme, it will be difficult for the employment of supervisors to continue also.</P>
    <P>Many people are worried about this restructuring. As far as I can gather, there has not been consultation with the participants or the supervisors and they do not know what will happen. FÁS is not sure what will happen, nor is the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. My main concerns are as follows. What does the future hold for the participants and the supervisors? What level of consultation will take place? What does the Minister envisage for the future if he is to get rid of community employment schemes which have been in operation for the past 16 or 17 years?</P>

      <P>The community employment programme, or CE, as it is popularly known, is a work experience programme the primary role of which is to assist the progression of participants into jobs, further education and training. The programme was originally designed to provide temporary rather than ongoing permanent opportunities for persons unemployed for a minimum of 12 months. There are approximately 33,500 participants currently on the programme. Within the context of the overall number of places available FÁS has operational responsi<Col N="976" /> bility for the delivery of this programme on behalf of the Government and our Department.</P>
      <P>As a result of a Government decision in July 1999, a review of the programme by consultants and discussions with the social partners, the following restructuring changes were introduced. The eligibility age was increased from 21 to 25 with certain exceptions. Breaks between schemes were increased from six to 12 months. Participation on the programme will in future be limited to three full years. Dependent spouses of long-term unemployed persons and widows or widowers were given direct access to the programme. To facilitate the introduction of carers into the workforce persons previously in receipt of carer's allowance have also been given access to this programme.</P>
      <P>In addition to these changes, and in consultation with the social partners, a decision was taken to reduce the numbers employed on the community employment programme over a five year period, from an average provision of 37,500 in 1999 to 28,000 by the end of 2003. The reduction in absolute numbers participating, together with the changed eligibility criteria, are considered to be appropriate given the present economic climate and buoyancy in employment projections. The current unemployment rate is only 3.5%. As a result, changes are agreed through the PPF on the necessary adjustments to all schemes and programmes affecting the labour market.</P>
      <P>In the context of the commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure the community employment programme, consultations have been taking place with the social partners through the PPF standing committee on the labour market regarding the mainstreaming of essential services currently provided by the CEP. The modalities of mainstreaming those services are being discussed directly with relevant Departments before reporting to the standing committee on issues arising from these discussions. The initial focus in this regard is on the education and health sectors. It is proposed to fund the mainstreaming of essential services from within existing target participation levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is currently in discussions with the Department of Education and Science to transfer CEP funding to school schemes. The discussions relate to the transfer of funding equivalent to the amount spent on such schemes. The proposed transfer would provide an increase in funding for schools over and above the additional resources already allocated over the past year by the Department of Education and Science for schools support services. It would also provide a uniform and equitable system of funding for schools services which would be solely the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science. While there may be some short-term reduction in funding for schools due to the restructuring, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employ<Col N="977" /> ment intends that every effort will be made to ensure that the proposed mainstreaming of schools services will produce positive outcomes for community employment programme participants and for the education sector in general.</P>
    <P>Supervisors on CE projects are employed by the sponsors of the projects and funded by a grant from FÁS. This funding includes an amount towards the employment of a supervisor, including both a wage and employer PRSI element. Sponsors are advised by FÁS to issue contracts of employment to supervisors to cover the period for which the project has been sanctioned, usually for one year at a time.</P>
    <P>FÁS has advised the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment that a very limited number of supervisors are engaged solely in schools related projects. Many of these supervisors are highly competent individuals and will wish to move to other employment. Supervisors are continually leaving the programme to avail of opportunities that present themselves. Where possible, supervisors who may be affected by the mainstreaming of schools services will be accommodated on other projects as vacancies arise. In addition some social economy projects are likely to be in a position to offer employment when they are fully operational. It should be noted that it will be a matter for the social economy enterprise to choose the most suitable person for the position.</P>
    <P>CE participants currently working in schools take part for one year initially and, depending on their age and unemployment record, may work up to a maximum of three years. The Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment intends to ensure that due recognition is given to the experience of such participants in schools in the final proposals. As provided for in the PPF, consultations on the final proposals for the mainstreaming of CE schools services will take place with the social partners through the standing committee on the labour market. The nature of the scheme to be implemented is now at an advanced stage of consideration and we are confident that this matter will be finalised as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful that this matter is being taken on the Adjournment. I welcome the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, and I thank him for coming in to respond personally to the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sports complex in Ballina has the been in gestation for 11 years. The need for such a complex was first identified due to the existence in Ballina of a very successful basketball team. It has achieved national awards on many occasion and competed at the highest level here and internationally. There were no basketball facilities and when major matches were on hand the team would have to go to Killala, a small town eight miles away. A hard working committee set about <Col N="978" /> trying to put a sports complex in place. This was to be situated beside Moyne College, previously a vocational school, now a third level college. This college has no physical education facilities and there is an agreement with the committee that they will be tenants of the complex.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, even with the grant of £400,000 which the Minister's Department allocated some time ago, of which £380,000 has been drawn down, the project is unfinished due to serious overruns as a result of this matter going on for 11 years. This is one of those things that happen in a building project of this magnitude and is no fault of the committee. It is regrettable that the project has closed due to lack of funding. The contractor left the site last November or early December and to get a contractor back again requires a penalty clause. In the region of £400,000 is required to complete this very necessary and worthwhile sports complex which will be the only one of its kind in Ballina and the surrounding area.</P>
    <P>An application has been made under the sports capital programme for funding but due to the urgency of the situation it is imperative that this project is considered favourably. Whether the Minister can expedite the decisions on the programme I do not know, but I urge him to consider this matter seriously.</P>
    <P>It is very hard for people in Ballina to reconcile the fact that the Minister said on television recently that he could not spend £6 million under this programme with the fact that the project is being held up because of a lack of funding. That is the situation on the project which provides for very necessary and essential social infrastructure in Ballina in which there are three secondary schools, none of which has PE facilities. As PE will figure on the syllabus, it is very important that facilities are provided. I thank the Cathaoirleach for affording me the opportunity to make the case for this very worthwhile project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline the history of grant aid towards this project and to clarify the current position on the 2001 sports capital programme. I am aware of the project both from parliamentary questions in recent weeks and months and representations I have received from my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt.</P>
      <P>Funding was first allocated to this project way back in 1988 when £300,000, a very considerable sum at the time, was allocated under what was then known as the major facilities scheme administered by the Department of Education and Science. There was no progress on the project, however, and in October 1992 the grant had to be withdrawn. The group was advised to draw up specific proposals for the project, to raise more funds locally and to then reapply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grant was restored under the 1994 major facilities scheme and increased to £400,000. One of the requirements of the scheme was that at <Col N="979" /> least 30% of the project cost had to be raised by the applicants before the project could proceed. Because of their difficulties in meeting this requirement, the organisers were not in a position to invite tenders for construction until October 1998 and were subsequently not in a position to receive the first payment of the grant allocation until November 2000.</P>
    <P>Some 95%, or £380,000, of the £400,000 grant has now been drawn down. Under the terms and conditions of the programme, 5% of a total grant allocation is retained pending confirmation from the organisation's technical supervisor that work on the project has been completed satisfactorily. Once this confirmation is received, the remaining £20,000 will be paid.</P>
    <P>An application for funding has been received from Ballina Sports Conference and Leisure Centre under the 2001 sports capital programme. This application will be evaluated, as will all of the 1,450 applications received, in accordance with the assessment criteria outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce the grant allocations at the earliest possible date following completion of the assessment process.</P>
    <P>I cannot expedite any of the applications until they have been thoroughly gone through. I will <Col N="980" /> do this as soon as possible. As a word of explanation to those who do not understand the reason funds are handed back, as with this complex, the projects in question have not been completed and the money is literally tied up. Despite the voluntary efforts being made, I am assured that all the funds will be drawn down and that work will commence in two to three weeks, or certainly within two to three months, and that if funds are provided, they will be drawn down before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The greater the number of projects in the Department the greater the number of projects that will not be completed. I intend to provide more funds this year, but I am aware that come the end of next year, a large proportion will remain unspent. We must realise that there are not enough developers and contractors available to use up the money the Government has provided. It has nothing to do with the voluntary efforts being made, but with the fact that contractors cannot be employed. Contractors are off making their fortunes elsewhere. One cannot blame them for this. I want to have the projects completed. While Ballina is receiving priority, there is no point in funding something that has been barricaded. Every effort will be made to complete the project as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 8 March 2001.</P>
