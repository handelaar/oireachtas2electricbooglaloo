      <P>I have received notice from Senator Ó Fearghail that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minster for the Environment and Local Government to provide funding for a new sewage treatment system to service the Curragh Camp and its environs, together with the villages of Brownstown, Suncroft and Cutbush, County Kildare.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the reason for the delay in a heroin addict (details supplied) being received into a detoxification-treatment programme at the Mews Clinic, North Circular Road, and the reason waiting lists for treatment of addicts are growing.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>Before the Order of Business, I have just been informed that former Senator Eoin Ryan died during the night. It would be appropriate for the House to record its sympathy. We should have fuller expressions of sympathy next week. He was one of our distinguished Members from a very distinguished political family. Our sympathy goes to his son, the Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan, in particular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I will contribute more fully then. The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re Planning and Development Regulations, 2001, to be <Col N="1710" /> taken without debate; No. 2, Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Bill, 2001 [<i>Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil</i>] &ndash; Report and Final Stages; No. 3, statements on illegal dumping, to be taken from 11 a.m. until 1 p.m., with contributions of spokespersons to be ten minutes and all other Senators eight minutes; No. 4, statements on the Wexford tragedy, to be taken from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m., with contributions of spokespersons to be ten minutes and all other Senators eight minutes. There will then be a sos. We will also take the Referendum Bill, 2001, and the Horse Racing Ireland (Membership) Bill, 2001. These two Bills are still before the Dáil and will be circulated on a supplementary Order Paper later today. The Referendum Bill, 2001, will be taken not earlier than 3.15 p.m. The Horse Racing Ireland (Membership) Bill, 2001, will be taken not earlier than 4.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad we will have a full opportunity next week to pay tribute to the late Senator Ryan, who was one of the finest Senators ever to grace this House.</P>
      <P>The Deputy Leader has to be out of his mind with the Order of Business he is proposing today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Very possibly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the business I agreed with the Government Leader last Friday, even though that was a bit later than usual and was not very helpful to the Opposition. We are being asked to get through two Bills today on effectively the last day the Dáil is sitting, when these Bills have not yet been discussed by the Dáil. In my 20 years in politics, emergency legislation like this where a Bill has to go through both Houses of the Oireachtas on the same day generally happened if the country is invaded, if there is an army <i>coup d'état</i>, if the banks are collapsing, when the Goodman empire was about to put thousands of people out of work without payment or when PMPA was about to collapse and half the people would be driving uninsured. It is for matters of this moment that the Houses of the Oireachtas rush through legislation.</P>
      <P>I do not have any difficulty with the Horse Racing Ireland (Membership) Bill, a technical Bill on which I suspect there is broad consensus. However, the Referendum Bill which seeks, whether we agree or not, although there is probably wide agreement in the Houses, to overturn a Supreme Court judgment is fundamental. We were clearly warned in the Supreme Court that a referendum belongs to the people and anything to do with it should be approached in a careful, conservative and steady way. Instead of that, the Minister is rushing through the Bill on the last day without the possibility of proper discussion. That either shows the arrogance or stupidity of the Minister or there is something sinister behind it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>When such practice is engaged in by a Government, it is the job of everyone to suspect that something dodgy is happening. We will oppose the Order of Business today. I know the Deputy Leader, who is a reasonable person &ndash; it is nice to have him in the House today &ndash; will take on board the points we are making.</P>
      <P>Apparently the ghost of 1971 is back to haunt us. It is important we get the full story of what happened at that time. There are many people with different agendas. I was not persuaded by last night's programme. I would like to revisit the suggestion we made here that an independent group should examine the documents and try to treat this as a matter of history rather than of current political debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I strenuously oppose the Order of Business which is not good enough. Two of the most significant items do not appear on the Order Paper because they have not been dealt with in the other House. This seems to be an extraordinarily poor way to do business. My understanding, which the Deputy Leader could perhaps confirm, is that the House will meet again next Tuesday. It does not make sense to try to take two significant pieces of legislation today. I must declare an interest in the Horse Racing Ireland (Membership) Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only a technical Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Manning said, the other Bill is of crucial importance, a fact which I appeal to Members on the other side of the House to consider. The Government is deciding to do this without offering any important reason other than that it does not want to trouble a Minister by asking him or her to come in here next Tuesday to do some work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what it is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the only reason. The Leader and Deputy Leader must admit that any time they have had a difficulty we have met them and co-operated in any way possible. People on this side of the House have always been ready to solve the problems on the Government side. The Government's behaviour is disreputable and contemptible and is not an efficient way to do business. It stinks to high heaven. It is not right to take business which is not on the Order Paper. The matter should not be pressed to a vote. The Deputy Leader should accept the arguments, which I know will find resonance with Members on the other side of the House, and agree to deal with this business next Tuesday as people would then have time to examine and deal with it. This is a repeat of the day before yesterday. There is enough business to keep us going for the day without adding two further items. It is not important that we pass it before the weekend. A reasoned argument has not been given to us. I have asked senior people on the other side of the <Col N="1712" /> House why it is happening and no one knows. I am not trying to embarrass anyone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We have all been in the same boat. I ask people to take a stand. I am not criticising Members on the other side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much left to be said by this side of the House about the Order of Business presented by the Deputy Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should then sit down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We have enough business with which to deal without adding extraneous material which is not on the Order Paper. We should devote a certain amount of time to No. 1 rather than taking it without debate. There are sufficient items on the Order Paper to keep us busy. Standards seem to go out the door in December as totally unnecessary items are rushed through the House. I am worried that there is no respect in some Departments for the work of either House. They see the week prior to the recess as a way of getting items passed quickly without the debate required to tease them out. It is totally unnecessary and it should not happen. The Referendum Bill deals with the fundamental issue of how to conduct constitutional referenda. It is outrageous to include that on the Order of Business today and expect us to do it. It should be withdrawn and we should proceed with the business originally outlined. We can take Second Stage next week and the Remaining Stages after the recess.</P>
      <P>I ask for a debate on homelessness before Christmas. I understand we are sitting next week. Considering the deteriorating housing and homelessness situation, particularly in the city, it is an appropriate time to have a good debate on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all concerned about the Order of Business today, but we must address the deteriorating situation in the Middle East which must be resolved sooner rather than later. The people of Europe should be as worried as the people of the Middle East about the deteriorating situation in recent days. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, is working extremely hard on our behalf and on behalf of the people of the Middle East to restore rational discussion. Prime Minister Sharon said he has sidelined Arafat and will not discuss anything else with him. That is worrying. People are being killed every day. We must ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to continue his efforts because other people in Europe have a different agenda from us. I ask the Deputy Leader to convey our concerns to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose a change to the Order of Business as outlined by the Deputy Leader. I propose that we take Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 in what<Col N="1713" /> ever order the House decides, which is what was agreed previously, and not take the extraneous material. The Bill does not exist as it cannot be placed on the Order Paper because it has not been passed by the other House. That is why it is improper to put it on the Order Paper. Occam's razor, with which I am sure the Deputy Leader is familiar, forbids the hypothetical discussion of the non-existent. That is what we are doing with the Bill and I will oppose it.</P>
      <P>If we and all the staff of the House are working hard &ndash; we were here until 4 a.m. the other day &ndash; without any interest from any section of the media, at least we are entitled to lunch. Should we have a sos between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.? Are we entitled to that consideration? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have a late lunch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we have a brief discussion on nursing homes and the fact that they illegally obtained money from residents and pensioners? They forced relatives to pay a sum of money which they were subsequently required to repay. A decision was made some time ago. Money was provided from central funds, but the money was not reimbursed despite the clear wish of both Houses of the Oireachtas and central Government. Can we try to get this done by Christmas and give these people a lift for the Christmas period? </P>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Lanigan for a debate on the Middle East in which the current situation is extremely worrying and tragic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully endorse Senator Manning's comments on the business arranged for today. What is proposed is very bad practice and we have not engaged in it before except in circumstances of extreme urgency where items on the Dáil agenda had to be on the Seanad agenda on the same day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it has, but we should be extremely cautious in our approach to a matter that was touched on by a Supreme Court judgment. On a different but slightly related matter, when is it proposed to hold the referendum resulting from the passage of the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001? Perhaps it is more appropriate to ask when it will become apparent what is the will of the people. From this morning's papers it appears that is what will decide it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the proposal made by Senator Norris to change the Order of Business. Many Members of this House are, or have been, members of health boards and we constantly hear of problems with health boards. May we have a debate in the new year on the functions and the functioning of the boards, given that many Members would have very important comments to make during such a debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>As a humble member of a religious community, I will not annoy the Cathaoirleach by repeating what has already been said, other than that I agree totally with Senator Norris. Technically, it is ludicrous to consider legislating on something that has not yet happened. The old saying &ldquo;Marry in haste, repent at leisure&rdquo; is known to the House and I suggest that if we legislate in haste we shall repent forever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very dishonourable thing to do and it is no wonder people have no interest in referenda when they are treated in such a peremptory manner by the Government. Every democrat sitting opposite should agree that we do not proceed with the Order of Business as proposed. I am shocked, and that very rarely happens to me, except when I am called &ldquo;Sister&rdquo; of course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise unreservedly to the absent Member. The leaders of the Opposition groups and the leader of the Independents, as well as several other Senators, referred to the taking of the Referendum Bill, 2001, and the Horse Racing Ireland (Membership) Bill, 2001, today. The purpose of the Horse Racing Ireland (Membership) Bill, 2001, is to increase the membership of the Horse Racing Authority by one and I do not see that as being of any particular difficulty. The Referendum Bill, 2001, does not involve an attempt to overturn the McKenna <Col N="1715" /> judgment, but to legislate within that judgment. The Bill has to do with the Referendum Commission. Putting both sides of an argument in tandem in newspaper advertisements of two columns is not very sensible and it does not reflect the tenor of the debate, a view for which there is widespread support in all parties. I reject the accusation that there is anything dodgy about the Bill being brought before the House this afternoon.</P>
      <P>I was also acting as Leader when the 1971 issue last arose. I agree with Senator Manning that the full story should be told and his suggestion that historians analyse the matter is a good one. We will see what can be done about it and if we need to return to the matter later we should do so. The Planning and Development Bill has come from a committee, there has been plenty of opportunity to debate it already and there is no need to do so here. Next week will be busy and the Social Welfare Bill, 2001, which is extensive, will be before the House. Many Senators contribute when the Social Welfare Bill comes before the House every year and I am conscious of the time constraints involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Costello called for a debate on homelessness, which would be useful, and we will see what can be done to facilitate that. I agree very much with Senator Lanigan about the Middle East. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, made a very comprehensive statement in the Dáil on this matter yesterday in which he underlined the need to ensure that President <Col N="1716" /> Arafat remains in office because if he does not the vacuum created could be filled by extremists such as those in Hamas. We need to review constantly that issue and if time is available we will discuss it in the House.</P>
    <P>I note the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator Norris. A debate on nursing homes would be useful, but it will be after Christmas before we can consider having one. I do not know when the referendum arising from the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, will be held.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil. In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question, &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil. This is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. The only matters, therefore, that may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil. For the convenience of Senators I have arranged to have copies of those amendments made available this morning. Senators may speak only once on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;<Col N="1719" /></P>
    <P>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke): I am glad to be back here. We were here in May with this Bill on Second Stage. Indeed it got a very good hearing and debate in this Chamber. It then went to Second Stage in the Dáil but was delayed on account of the Mini-CTC inquiry. We have now had Committee, Report and Final Stages and are here now to report on what happened in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of the railway procurement agency, RPA, that will be given responsibility for procuring light railways and metro. The agency will be an independent, commercial State body with powers to enter into public private partnerships and joint ventures in carrying out its functions. The Bill also provides for a single statutory railway order procedure. Under the provisions of Part 3, the RPA will make application to the Minister of the day for approvals in relation to light rail and metro while CIE will apply in respect of heavy rail infrastructure. Part 4 provides for the operation of light rail when running on-street.</P>
    <P>Before referring to the amendments that have been made to the Bill since it was passed by this House in May, I would like to thank my colleagues in the Dáil and in particular the members of the Select Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport who worked very hard on this Bill over the past few days in order to facilitate its passage through that House. I am very appreciative of all their contributions.</P>
    <P>A total of 30 amendments to the Bill were passed on Committee Stage and a further seven on Report Stage. The majority of these were technical or drafting points and I do not propose to go into detail on those. I will be happy to elaborate on them if Members require clarification on any specific points. I will deal with the major amendments which, I feel, have improved the overall effectiveness of the Bill.</P>
    <P>An amendment to section 9 has the effect of reaffirming the independence of the railway procurement agency. It was always my intention, in setting up the agency, that it should be independent in the exercise of its functions, subject to the provisions of the Bill, and the amendment now reflects this intention in legislation. That amendment was proposed by Deputy Stanton of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>In section 20, a number of amendments were passed which have the effect of increasing the number of members of the agency from 7 to 8 and provides that the agency should include a member elected by its employees. That amendment was proposed jointly by Deputies Stagg and Stanton.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 39, on Committee Stage in this House, I agreed to an amendment to subsection 39(1) which resulted in the addition to the section of a requirement that the environmental impact statement, which must accompany an application for a railway order, must &ldquo;comply with the European Union directives regarding environmental impact assessment&rdquo;. On Commit<Col N="1720" /> tee Stage we received advice from parliamentary counsel and I had to move an amendment to delete this addition. I would like to explain why. Section 39(4) contains an exemption from the environmental impact assessment regulations. The relevant provisions arising from environmental protection directives are now contained in the Bill in sections 39(1) to 39(3). I assure Members that the provisions contained in the Bill mirror the EU Directives and an application to the Minister for a railway order must comply with the detailed requirements set out in section 39.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to another significant amendment concerned with safety. Since I took up office, the safety of railways has been a major concern of mine. As Senators may be aware, my Department will publish a railway safety Bill before the end of the year that will provide for the establishment of a railway safety commission which will be given responsibility for all safety aspects of railways whether they be light rail, heavy rail or metro. Pending the setting up of the commission, I was happy to accept an amendment that interim arrangements should be in place for the railway procurement agency to monitor and publish regular reports on the safety of light rail and metro infrastructure.</P>
    <P>We had an interesting discussion on both Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil on the issue of the office of the chief executive. I considered carefully the amendments proposed in this regard and was conscious of the need to maintain a balance between the freedom of the chief executive to carry out his normal management and administrative functions and the necesssity to have safeguards to enhance the smooth running of the agency. Having carefully reflected on the matter, I considered it worthwhile to accept an amendment which requires the chief executive to provide the agency with such information in relation to the performance of his or her functions, as the agency may from time to time require. It would be my desire that there would be a free flow of information from the chief executive in relation to his management functions to the agency but we now have a safeguard in case any difficulties arise in this relationship.</P>
    <P>A further useful addition to the Bill in this area is the incorporation of a provision in relation to the performance of the functions of the chief executive in his or her absence. Now the agency may designate a member of its staff to carry out those functions.</P>
    <P>I will be happy to elaborate on any other amendments but Members will see that the majority are technical drafting amendments which have little impact on the Bill. I take this opportunity to thank the Senators and the Members in the Dáil for their contributions to improving this legislation which will greatly facilitate progress on the development of Luas, other light railway works and the metro. I extend good wishes to the interim chairman of the railway procurement agency, Mr. Padraic White, whom I appointed last July along with the five other <Col N="1721" /> members to the agency. On enactment of this Bill, I propose to formally appoint the same chairman and members to the agency. Then there will be a ballot among the members of the RPA who will elect one of their members to the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the Minister and this Bill. The Minister has been innovative in many of the initiatives she has brought in during her tenure in the Department. The provision of public transportation, be it by road or rail, is a tremendous challenge facing the Government and it will face future Governments for a number of decades to come. The Railway Procurement Agency can play a significant role in this regard. It will operate independently and have powers to enter into public private partnerships and joint ventures. I appreciate that practicalities must be taken into account because in many cases there are economies of scale, but if some form of competition could be injected into the operations, it would be conducive to the provision of effective and cost efficient services in the years to come. I am not certain how that could be done, but it is something the agency might be asked to address.</P>
      <P>We have seen the converse of not doing that in terms of what has happened over the decades in Iarnród Éireann and CIE. A monolith such as that does not have the capacity for long-term efficiencies which are essential for the provision of public services. The Minister might consider and discuss that matter with the agency.</P>
      <P>Like Senator O'Dowd, I welcome the Minister's commitment to the introduction of the railway safety Bill. I am sure it will be another constructive Bill that will serve us well into the future. I compliment the Minister, wish her a happy Christmas and thank her for the effort she has put into her work in her Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, to the House and call on him to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the widespread concern at the recent cases of illegal dumping that have come to light. Senators will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the specific circumstances of any of the recent cases as these could be the subject of enforcement action, including legal proceedings, by the competent regulatory authorities. However, the Government's position is clear. Unauthorised dumping of waste is illegal and grossly irresponsible. Dumping of clinical waste or other potentially hazardous wastes, because of its nature, is particularly reprehensible. The full rigours of the law should apply to anyone found guilty of such activity.</P>
      <P>Functions in relation to waste regulation and its enforcement have been assigned, under the Waste Management Act, 1996, to local authorities, or in relation to licensing of major waste activities, to the Environmental Protection Agency. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has no direct function in relation to these matters.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, local authorities must deploy the necessary resources to ensure that they effectively oversee waste movements and activities within their functional areas and take determined action, utilising the very significant powers and remedies available to them, to counter unauthorised activity. Local authorities have very significant enforcement powers under the Waste Management Act, 1996. They can enter and inspect lands and premises, and stop and board vehicles. There are heavy penalties available under the Act in respect of illegal dumping activity. A person guilty of such an offence would be liable, upon conviction on indictment, to a fine of up to £10 million and/or up to ten years' imprisonment. Even on summary prosecution, significant penalties can arise. Only last week, a contractor was fined and jailed for a total of 18 months in respect of three offences under the 1996 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A landowner who is complicit in unauthorised dumping could also be liable to prosecution, in <Col N="1723" /> addition to the person who actually carried out such dumping. Furthermore, it is important to note that a landowner could be liable for the costs of removing and properly disposing of the wastes concerned. Where a person has held, recovered or disposed of waste in a manner that is causing or has caused environmental pollution, it is open to a local authority to seek a court order requiring that person, among other things, to mitigate or remedy any effects of the said activity.</P>
    <P>The Waste Management Act, 1996, also provides specifically for the recovery of clean-up costs incurred by regulatory authorities. Where a local authority takes measures in order to prevent or limit environmental pollution caused by the holding, recovery or disposal of waste, it may recover the costs of such measures from such persons as the courts determine to be a person whose act or omission necessitated such action on the part of the authority. I expect that local authorities will seek to recover clean-up and remediation costs arising from recently discovered unauthorised dumping activities using these available remedies.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and I are anxious that where a local authority uncovers evidence of systematic and large scale dumping, it should be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions to be prosecuted as the serious offence that it is rather than dealt with as a summary offence. To that end, my Department has consulted the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to prepare guidance for local authorities regarding relevant procedures and preparation of evidence. In addition, my Department has formally requested the Criminal Assets Bureau to consider whether, in the public interest, it should investigate the possibility that systematic and illegal profiteering was involved in unauthorised waste dumping.</P>
    <P>The law has recently been strengthened in relation to the collection and movement of waste. The Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations, 2001, will facilitate better control of waste movements and should prove valuable in combating illegal dumping of waste. Under these regulations, all commercial collectors of waste have been obliged to apply to local authorities for a waste collection permit. Under the new regulations, local authorities must require permit holders to ensure that the waste collected is transferred to a waste facility that has been licensed by the EPA or holds a permit from the relevant local authority. The system also provides for a documentation and tracking system for the movement of all wastes. A local authority would be entitled to refuse to grant a collection permit, or to revoke one that had been granted, in the event that an applicant or permittee is found guilty of any one of a number of specified waste offences.</P>
    <P>Clearly, it is important that adequate resources are deployed to counter unauthorised waste activities. The introduction next year of the proposed landfill levy is expected to generate signifi<Col N="1724" /> cant revenues for the new environment fund. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, intends to direct much of this funding to support additional local authority enforcement initiatives in respect of unauthorised waste activities and has requested the City and County Manager's Association to submit proposals in this regard.</P>
    <P>Without wishing in any way to diminish the seriousness of the unauthorised dumping cases currently known, or the possibility that other such cases will emerge, there is an element of misinformation and speculation in some recent media reports. For example, it was stated that some 2,000 sites nationally have been identified as potentially contaminated by hazardous waste. In fact, an EPA desktop study indicated that about 2,000 sites exist in Ireland that may, because of current or historical activities associated with them, be contaminated. These would largely comprise sites where certain trade and industrial activities took place, for example, gasworks, tanneries, etc. Most of these sites did not involve waste disposal <i>per se</i>. The EPA estimated that about 490 sites, including 84 operational facilities, may have been used for the disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes.</P>
    <P>The national hazardous waste management plan, published by the EPA last July, recommends the early establishment by local authorities of comprehensive registers of all sites known or suspected to have been used for the disposal of waste in the past. Such sites should then be prioritised by each local authority for the purpose of more detailed risk assessment procedures and the identification of any necessary remedial measures.</P>
    <P>The EPA is required to address similar considerations with respect to closed hazardous waste disposal sites. There are no quick-fix or easy solutions in addressing the waste management challenges that face us, but the Government has worked hard since coming into office to put in place a sound basis for addressing them. Building on the foundations of the Waste Management Act, we have provided the first comprehensive long-term waste management strategy with the publication of the Changing Our Ways policy document. We have introduced a comprehensive and modern regulatory regime. Through the Waste Management (Amendment) Act, 2001, we have facilitated the adoption of waste management plans in every local authority area in the country.</P>
    <P>Steady progress is being made in regard to waste recovery and recycling. There are currently an estimated 1,300 bring banks throughout the country, up from around 400 in 1995. Some 25% of Ireland's packaging waste will be recycled this year, amounting to approximately 200,000 tonnes, up from just under 15% in 1998, which means we will meet our EU packaging waste recycling target. Segregated collection of household waste is now being rolled out and is set to reach 170,000 households in the Dublin area by the end of the year. Pilot segregated collection services for <Col N="1725" /> household organic waste &ndash; biowaste &ndash; have been established in Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Nenagh and Tralee. Segregated collection has also been introduced in a number of other urban areas, such as Galway and Nenagh, and will be introduced before the end of the year in other centres, for example, in parts of Louth and Meath. The national waste database reported that there were 38 civic amenity facilities in 1998 and more have been opened in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the regional waste management plans will further facilitate the delivery of improved waste management infrastructure and services. The Minister will announce a major scheme of capital grants for waste recovery infrastructure within the coming weeks to underpin implementation of the plans. This grant assistance will be targeted to support the provision of recycling and recovery facilities provided for in the plans.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Government has put in place a solid framework that will allow us to move forward with the delivery of modernised waste management infrastructure and services. I believe that local authorities fully appreciate the seriousness of the cases of illegal dumping now coming to light. I am confident that, using the extensive powers available to them under the 1996 Act, they will rigorously pursue these cases to determine the identities of those responsible and that effective action will be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House to debate this important topic. On reading today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, it is clear this type of waste is coming from State hospitals or institutions. The amount of waste being dumped illegally is unacceptable. What other steps can the Government take to ensure it traces the waste from all hospitals over the last number of years? I presume all the contractors or sub-contractors who collect this type of waste do not dump it in this manner. I do not know the number of people involved in this type of activity but there needs to be a traceability study to ensure all this waste is found. It is shameful that people who have collected waste from health board hospitals and institutions have acted with such callous disregard for the health and safety of the population in general.</P>
      <P>I welcome in particular the action of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I also welcome the action of county managers, particularly the manager in Wicklow County Council where the issue first arose. I am not aware of the response of the health boards in this regard. It is very important that all health boards are written to and that they let us know their strategies. We need to know their strategies to ensure they can deal adequately with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to today's newspapers, the IDA bought one of the dump sites in County Dublin. Given that it did not dump the waste in the first instance and that it bought the site in good faith, it does not make sense to me that it should be <Col N="1726" /> responsible for cleaning it up and that taxpayers will have to foot the expected £1 million bill which will arise. A question was raised in today's newspaper about whether there is an absence of law in this area. It seems the person who sells on land where illegal dumping has taken place may not be pursued for the full cost of cleaning it up, but the person who subsequently buys the land may be responsible for the costs.</P>
    <P>Obviously, certain geographical areas lend themselves to illegal dumping on a large commercial scale such as this and clearly County Wicklow is one of the worst areas. I wonder what local authorities can do to keep a check on illegal dumping in their counties. I welcome the Minister's intention to spend part of the fund created by the landfill tax to investigate, pursue and follow up on all these sites. This must be a priority.</P>
    <P>While I have been a critic of the Government in relation to waste management, I welcome in particular the Minister of State's statement:</P>
    <P>The implementation of the regional waste management plans will further facilitate the delivery of improved waste management infrastructure and services. The Minister will announce a major scheme of capital grants for waste recovery infrastructure within the coming weeks to underpin implementation of the plans. This grant assistance will be targeted to support the provision of recycling and recovery facilities provided for in the plans.</P>
    <P>This is the most important initiative the Government could take. The reality is that if the infrastructure to recycle and recover waste is not grant aided, it will not be provided. One of the biggest problems in Drogheda, County Louth, is that there is no recycling facility but provisions are being put in place to purchase land in the next year.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State also referred to important waste disposal initiatives in Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Nenagh and Tralee. While local authorities may have a statutory obligation to deal with waste management, they do not have an equality of resources to deal with the issue. Some local authorities do not have the same funds available to them as others. While local authorities may wish to put in place adequate recycling facilities, including kerbside collections, many of them cannot afford to put these facilities in place. Perhaps the Minister will address the inequalities which are building up throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Charges for waste collection by local authorities throughout the country are not uniform. There can be major differences. One of the biggest problems we have is that the fixed household charge varies from one local authority to another. A fixed household charge is a charge levied on a household regardless of the volume of waste produced. It is a very bad system. The Minister and the Department should encourage household consumers to recycle and reduce waste by subsidising the recycling facilities and should <Col N="1727" /> also ensure that local authorities have adequate and proper funding. Local service charges should not used by local authorities as a source of income for other purposes.</P>
    <P>People are really shocked by what has been going on. All of the statutory bodies are now alert to the problem and are aware of what they must do but, at the end of the day, the law will prevail and these people will suffer. We must make sure that people are encouraged, through the use of recycling and recovery grants, to manage waste in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>A problem will arise following the recent Supreme Court decision in a case on refuse collection charges in Cork. This will have a very significant impact nationally because this morning, believe it or not, my local authority instructed its bin men to collect every bin put out for collection in the town, irrespective of whether it was tagged or the person has paid for it. If that is how the Act will be interpreted, it will turn on its head the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle and create untold havoc for local authorities throughout the country. In particular, it will discourage the consumer who wants to reduce the volume of waste he or she produces. There will be no incentive to do that because it will not result in a reduced charge.</P>
    <P>Generally, I welcome the thrust of what the Government and the statutory agencies are doing. However, I want to see more action from the health boards. This is an issue to which we must respond and we are doing so in the best possible way.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit chun an ábhar tábhachtach seo a phlé. Illegal dumping has come very much to the fore in recent weeks with reports emanating in Dublin and Wicklow, in particular, about serious contraventions of the environment legislation and regulations. The Minister and Senator O'Dowd clearly outlined that responsible people regard such activity as reprehensible.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, greater vigilance in this area will now need to be a priority. Over recent years we have seen that, due to greater awareness of the need to protect the environment and, in particular, the necessity for compliance with EU and domestic regulations, the cost of waste disposal has escalated considerably and has become a fairly significant factor in the accounts of local authorities and private collection companies.</P>
      <P>Vigilance in enforcement is absolutely essential because human nature leads people to be inventive in finding ways to save money. Where there are significant savings to be made, some people will go the criminal route, as is obvious from the use of illegal dumps. The Minister correctly pointed out the need not only for vigilance but for much greater enforcement by local government in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important that we do not confine our response to illegal dumps which are located accidentally. We must search for areas of land, quar<Col N="1728" /> ries, etc., which people use to dispose of waste illegally. Some of the local authorities, in whose areas these dumps have been found, have undertaken fairly comprehensive investigations and it is hoped that the perpetrators will be brought to justice in due course. As the Minister correctly pointed out, it is also important that the local authorities not only use the full rigours of the law in ensuring enforcement but also avail of existing legislation and regulations to recover the costs of remedying those sites, which obviously will be quite extensive. That would be the intent of the local authorities with which I have spoken in this regard.</P>
    <P>The £10 million fine should act as a deterrent. In addition, as the Minister pointed out, the recent case where a contractor was jailed for 18 months should focus the minds of those who might have a tendency to profit from such activity.</P>
    <P>The approach adopted by the Minister with the Criminal Assets Bureau is probably well worth exploring in this context. It would be remiss not to mention that body without complimenting it on the effective work it has done in recent years in many areas of criminal activity. It has proven quite effective and many European countries have examined its <i>modus operandi</i> with a view to establishing similar bodies in their own jurisdictions to counter different types of criminal activity.</P>
    <P>One would also hope that the Judiciary, in dealing with cases which come before it, will use the legislative provisions in this area not only to penalise people found guilty of this activity but also as a deterrent. In that regard I, and indeed many people involved in local government, would be particularly disappointed at the very lenient approach adopted by the Judiciary to litter legislation. One would hope that a similar approach would not apply in this instance but that the penalties imposed would be commensurate with the serious nature of the crime.</P>
    <P>The type of waste discovered in some of the illegal dumps presents a threat not only to the environment but also to human health. This cannot be tolerated in any civilised society. The fact that large quantities of hazardous hospital waste were found in some of these locations indicates the mentality of the people involved. Penalties should be commensurate with the seriousness of the offences being committed.</P>
    <P>There is a need to monitor private operators to ensure that licensing provisions are fully complied with. Irish people, perhaps because of our history, tend not to show the same commitment to legislation and regulations which is evident in other jurisdictions. In this regard, it is imperative that the letter, as well as the spirit, of the law is fully enforced and complied with. Local authorities are responsible for ensuring there is such compliance and it is important that they are properly resourced. I welcome today's statement by the Minister that environmental levies, such as <Col N="1729" /> the landfill levies, will be used to tackle the particular difficulty we now encounter.</P>
    <P>Legislation may need to be looked at. While much in the Statute Book deals with indiscriminate dumping of any kind of waste there may be a need to legislate for land that is already contaminated. I understand that legislation may not be effective in that regard. Some of these activities have been going on for a number of decades. If we are serious about protecting our environment, steps must be taken to clean up such areas &ndash; no matter how long the materials are there &ndash; so that water courses and even open areas do not put people's health at risk.</P>
    <P>It is essential to have competition. We spoke about it earlier during the debate on the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Bill, 2001. I am concerned that local authorities are the main operators of landfill sites. Cost efficiencies are not best protected when there is no competition. The necessary regulations and disciplines are brought to bear with competition. That does not mean that people would sacrifice any of the standards which must be met. The corporate policy group system which is now in operation should function rigorously at Estimates time in assessing all areas of expenditure. It should also ensure that cost effectiveness is applied and has the back-up of outside expertise. Some private operators involved in the waste disposal sector have complained that this is not happening. They feel competition is often skewed as they are competing with local authorities.</P>
    <P>Ultimately this is about people acting responsibly and the regulatory authorities rigorously enforcing the legislation and requirements. It also calls for the Judiciary to recognise the seriousness of the offences. That would indicate to those who are inclined to break these laws that it would be a totally unproductive and unprofitable activity.</P>

      <P>When the first such dump was discovered we thought it might have been atypical. Regrettably it seems to be fairly representative and is being repeated all over the country. A large number of further sites may yet be disclosed. This displays a kind of attitude which I think we ought to have got away from a long time ago. It is the attitude of a cavalier cowboy who is interested in profit only and is unconcerned about the health and welfare of his or her fellow citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We discussed a dump which was uncovered at Whitestown near Donard in west Wicklow. This is a classic representative sample. The gentleman who ran the business was running an unlicensed quarrying and dumping business. He claimed that he was approached by people with a view to using this dump. When it became clear to the authorities that this was going on they investigated it and found samples from a hospital theatre, patients' records and all kinds of materials that were either physically problematic or problematic from the point of view of patient confidentiality. <Col N="1730" /> There were a number of worrying aspects to it. There is also a suggestion that rogue skip operators are involved in this. It appears these skip owners are contracted by hospitals to dispose of general hospital waste including certain foods, unused dressings and decontaminated material. Much of this is problematic and it is on a very wide scale.</P>
    <P>The dump at Belcamp in County Dublin which we learnt of recently &ndash; on which a report features in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times &ndash;</i> is very worrying indeed. The authorities should have been aware of it much sooner because local residents who objected to this dump attempted to alert the authorities but it appears nothing was done. There was a general awareness that this was going on but the authorities failed to respond as immediately and effectively as they could.</P>
    <P>The material involved in very worrying. Blood bags, hypodermic syringes, urinals and bed pans are among materials uncovered at Belcamp. It is estimated the dump contains 40,000 tonnes of contaminated waste. The material covers an area of 250 metres by 40 metres to a depth of five metres and is adjacent to a GAA pitch. There is an extraordinary opposition between health and sport on the one hand and this contaminated material on the other. One thinks of vials of blood which have been dumped. When further materials are dumped on top of them they will smash and their contents will be released into the water table. It is very worrying indeed.</P>
    <P>As legislators we may unwittingly have complicated this. I managed to locate an interesting brief from a company called Celtic Waste. I know nothing about it and have no interest it; I am neither a shareholder nor a director in the company. I was struck by the clarity of the information it presented:</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Noel Dempsey passed the Waste Management Amendment Bill in July 2001. The Bill allows for the imposition of a landfill levy of up to £15 per tonne, a plastic bag levy of 10p per bag charged at the point of sale and the development of an Environmental Fund from the money raised by the levies.</P>
    <P>That appears to be ideal. Unfortunately, human nature being what it is this Bill creates an opening for profiteering by some of rogue operators. It has been indicated to Celtic Waste that rogue operators and those involved in unofficial dumps have been involved. Elements of the black economy are already involved. The Celtic Waste brief continues:</P>
    <P>The Environmental Fund will provide for a pool of resources for environmental endeavours such as education programmes, capital grants for recycling campaigns, and other areas yet to be determined by the Department. One of the objectives in introducing the landfill levy is to change behaviour by making people use alternative waste disposal methods such as recycling, reuse or incineration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1731" /> We do not have an incinerator. I am a strong advocate of the environmental lobby but we can no longer bury our heads in the sand. We must have incinerators in this country, otherwise these problems will multiply. I know there will be objections in any area that is selected and the local representatives will come under great pressure. We will be burying our heads in the sand if we do not build incinerators. I would support the introduction of a properly balanced programme of incineration for dangerous materials. It is much better to incinerate such material than bury it when it is still active.</P>
    <P>The brief continues:</P>
    <P>In early 2002 when the new landfill levy is imposed the cost of waste disposal at legal landfill sites will rise. This will have the following implications:</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Increased costs of disposal will encourage rogue traders to illegally enter the business.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;This will increase the incentives to illegally dump in fields, bogs, disused quarries and anywhere else it can be disposed of without detection.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;The cost of being caught is minuscule compared to the profits to be gained.</P>
    <P>This is a very effective point. We are creating circumstances which open up a possibility of profiteering, the consequences of which are so light as to indicate they may be disregarded. The statement continues:</P>
    <P>Further to the Waste Management Amendment Bill, the Minister signed the Waste Collection Permit Regulations on August 31, 2001. This means that waste contractors will have to apply for a permit by November 30, 2001 to be considered legitimate operators.</P>
    <P>Raising the cost of waste disposal to legal landfill sites by £10 per tonne creates an attractive opportunity for a rogue trader who decides to enter the business.</P>
    <P>Assume the cost of waste disposal to legal landfill sites will rise by £10 per tonne creating an attractive opportunity to a rogue trader who decides to enter the business:</P>
    <P>Reward: the financial benefits of illegal dumping are already very substantial. Assuming one load equals 18 tonnes of waste and EPA licensed landfill gate fees equal £60 per tonne, then this implies that up to £1,080 per load can currently be saved by diverting waste from legal licensed landfill to illegal sites. The landfill levy will increase this saving by £180 per load (i.e., LFL = £10 pt.) to £1,260 per load. With medium sized illegal waste contractors handling 100 loads per week the savings involved could be up to £126,000 every week. [This is motivation and it is the reason it is happening all over the countryside.]</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1732" />Penalties: when this is compared to the provisions in relation to offences associated with the 1996 Waste Management Act, &ldquo;allowing a maximum of £1,500 or 12 months imprisonment or both,&rdquo; the severity of the deterrent is put in context.</P>
    <P>This is one of the reasons we, as legislators, will have to return to the matter and increase enormously the potential penalties. When one has an opportunity to make £126,000 a week and the potential fine is about £1,500, one can walk into one's bank, having paid the fine, with £124,500 in one's back pocket. Many people will give in to that kind of temptation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in welcoming the Minister to the House and extending a broad welcome for the action he is taking on a very major, if somewhat hidden, problem that has been around for a long time. It is only now coming to the surface &ndash; no pun intended &ndash; in the most unfortunate circumstances.</P>
      <P>If ever a policy document was appropriately titled, Changing our Ways, to which the Minister referred, is it. This is a question of a change of culture. Everybody, from private individuals to large corporate entities, must change their ways of dealing with and their attitudes to waste and its disposal and management. This will not happen overnight. Awareness of waste and waste management is a product of the past 20 years. Following a lengthy and necessary lead in period, we are now beginning to see progress on the ground.</P>
      <P>The longer we continue the current approach, the better. It is constructive and positive and very much medium to long-term. My only slight word of caution is that, too often, on this issue and many others, the private citizen has tended to leave the resolution of problems to the famous &ldquo;they&rdquo;, the third party which is invariably some State body, local authority or Government institution. The reality is that the resolution of this problem is in the hands of every citizen. Until every individual changes his or her way of dealing with waste when it comes into his or her hands, be it a mere cigarette butt or a piece of paper, we will not have mastered the problem.</P>
      <P>This morning, while driving into Dublin, having listened to the radio and the reports of the dumps found in north County Dublin, I noticed the number of drivers in traffic ahead of me who, rather than put their finished cigarette in the car ashtray, rolled down the window and tossed it out. While this behaviour is a minuscule drop in the ocean, at the same time it is indicative of our overall attitude to waste. Our ultimate target must be to sort out such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another unfortunate aspect of this, about which we hear a great deal, is the user pays principle. The premise that the end user is ultimately liable for where his or her waste ends up is correct and appropriate. If, however, as indicated in <i>The Irish Times</i> today, it is very much the responsibility of the user or producer of the waste to ensure it has been appropriately dealt with, <Col N="1733" /> this must mean disposing of it safely and in a manner acceptable not only to the producer, but also to the population at large.</P>
    <P>It is deeply ironic that the institutions of the State charged with the task of ensuring the health of citizens, namely, the health boards and hospitals, are responsible, perhaps inadvertently through ignorance or otherwise, for creating potentially huge health hazards arising from the disposal of materials in various areas. This is a matter of grave concern which needs to be examined. While I have no doubt the institutions are also gravely concerned, it is not enough to sit back and let somebody else sort out the problem. It is their waste. Regardless of to whom it was contracted or subcontracted, they are responsible for ensuring its safe disposal. They will have to re-examine their role in light of recent findings.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that the Criminal Assets Bureau will be involved in dealing with the problem. For a long time &ndash; certainly long before my involvement in public life &ndash; there has been an awareness in the greater Dublin area that criminal elements were involved in the disposal of waste. In common with all other spheres of activity, it is probably only a minority. I look forward to the progress of the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda in investigating the precise nature of this involvement. Over the years there have been all kinds of stories about trucks driving around the roads in the outer Dublin area, dumping at all hours of the day and night, and of gates being surreptitiously opened at these sites to facilitate entry and disposal by these cowboys. Unfortunately, this is the reality. I am delighted the appropriate authorities are involved. I hope their participation proves successful and appropriate action is taken in due course.</P>
    <P>I turn to some of the issues addressed in <i>The Irish Times</i> today, particularly the report on the dump at the M50, with which I am familiar because it is in my area. A question immediately jumps off the page. Would this dump have been permitted if it had been located in a more prosperous area? It was not referred to earlier, but the three areas immediately adjoining the dump are Darndale, Clonshaugh and Coolock, and Senators might not be aware that there is a fairly large Traveller settlement near the site. If this dump had been in a more fashionable area, perhaps on the other side of the Liffey, it would not have laid undiscovered for so long. That is indicative of our culture. If it is somebody else's problem, particularly the least privileged, we will keep our hands clean. That is grossly unfair. This question should be put to the individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>I want to raise some questions about the site at the M50. How long was the local authority aware of its existence? It is unbelievable &ndash; I use the word deliberately &ndash; that one of the largest road projects in the country, the M50 development, was carried out in the vicinity of this site, with an extension of the M50 developed over the site, yet nothing was discovered. That raises questions about the quality of the construction of our roads <Col N="1734" /> and depending on the answer to my question, it may lead to other questions being raised.</P>
    <P>This problem has come to the surface in an unfortunate way &ndash; no pun intended &ndash; and must be addressed. I hope we learn from the lessons of County Wicklow and north Dublin in recent weeks and proceed to deal with problems in other areas on a proactive rather than a reactive basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm some of the points made by Senator Glennon because reading the report in the newspaper this morning, it was obvious that this site is located beside some seriously disadvantaged areas in which communities of Travellers live. There are a number of schools in the area, including a section of a school for Travellers, and it is amazing that this dump could have existed beside one of the busiest arteries in the country.</P>
      <P>In the early 1980s, before the land was developed, Clonshaugh was a rural area where I knew a number of the farmers at the time. We need to examine various aspects of what is happening here. This is not an imported problem. It is our waste. We created it. It raises the question of our <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude to disposing of waste and dirt. For the past 30 years those of us who live in the rural areas close to the capital have had the experience of people dumping their waste, including refrigerators, beds and trailers, in the by-roads of north County Dublin. Senator Glennon will be well aware of this problem. That is an appalling attitude on the part of one level of society.</P>
      <P>We are now talking about institutionalised criminalisation. We need to take various steps to deal with this problem. Perhaps the Minister will confirm to the House that the European Union is processing a complaint against the Government on the issue of waste and the environment. That is even before the emergence of the problems in County Wicklow and north Dublin. Does it reflect in any way the change in some areas in regard to who collects waste? In north Wicklow the system changed in that instead of the local authority collecting waste, it was done by groups. I am not suggesting that all private operators are in any way corrupt, but some are. I want the Minister to reassure the House that none of the groups officially collecting waste on behalf of councils and local authorities is involved in or connected with any of the dumps identified to date. We need that reassurance because we are talking about taxpayer's money and it is taxpayers who are at risk.</P>
      <P>The health risk should be clearly identified and articulated. We do not want to read about it in <i>The Irish Times</i>. We need the Minister, the authorities and the Department to make clear the levels of danger. Will it affect the water supply? The Minister will be aware that in areas like County Wicklow and north Dublin, many have their own private water supply and would be at risk from seepage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1735" />What system is in place for the licensing of waste operators? How do people get into the business? Can anybody buy a truck and start collecting waste or are there regulations governing the licensing of those who take over that responsibility? In that event, what inspection system is in place to evaluate the way in which they do their work? </P>
    <P>We need to identify those areas which create hazardous waste. We also need to ensure all waste is sorted and ensure the traceability of waste from the point at which it is created and collected to the point at which it is finally dumped. We must ensure also there is a follow-up inspection system to create a sense of security. We need to know how traceability works.</P>
    <P>There must be some way of identifying the authors of our problems. I would also like to know what crimes are being committed by them about which, as a legislator, I am not clear. Which laws have been broken and what are the possible penalties? It is clear that many made a lot of money. Most ordinary people were taken aback by the profits to be made from the industry. The profit per truck load of waste was extraordinary, with many millions of pounds being made. If such money has been made, the Criminal Assets Bureau should investigate the way the people concerned dispose of their money. We are talking about criminal assets. If people created a fortune for themselves through criminal means, we need to examine this and the Criminal Assets Bureau should take a serious interest in it. We have to be seen to be taking action, ensuring there is redress and taking people to book. We also need to clear the names of the landowners who, perhaps in good faith, came to some contractual arrangement with those involved in waste disposal. We must get to the bottom of this problem and find out who is responsible.</P>
    <P>How do we dispose of the waste in the illegal dumps? What options are available? Are more chemicals required to break it down or can it be disposed of through incineration? Is it more dangerous to remove it than leave it there? I do not know the answers to these questions. Is there a continuing danger to public health as a result of toxins in the dumps which could contaminate the atmosphere and water supply? Answers are needed to those questions because we are not experts. The plan to dispose of the waste needs to be outlined.</P>
    <P>The question of blaming a member of Government does not arise because this dumping took place during the lifetime of successive Governments. However, somebody must take responsibility for cleaning up the mess, which will not be easy. The House and the public want to ensure strict and severe measures are taken quickly. We want to know the strategy and tactics that will be adopted to bring those responsible to justice.</P>
    <P>There may be one positive aspect to this issue. At last it might begin to generate a change in the attitude of the public towards waste and the <Col N="1736" /> environment. Middle ground might be found between so-called environmentalists and real environmentalists. Real environmentalists are those who love the environment, nature and the countryside but who also recognise certain compromises must be made to accommodate housing, transport and so on. It is a realistic approach. It is good that people might be woken up to the fact that these problems affect us. We need to ensure our environment is kept clean, otherwise it will not be safe and will become hazardous and dangerous to public health. Anybody could suffer and it is in our interest to address this issue.</P>
    <P>As more illegal dumping is discovered and the size of the problem is appreciated by the public, the more likely it is that people will seek answers. It is our responsibility, as public representatives, to ensure we come up with the answers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State for these important statements. Many points have been raised regarding the problems we face. No matter where one goes in Ireland, there are problems that must be tackled. I am a local authority member and the Minister has supported local authorities in the past in addressing the waste issue but they have failed to do anything about illegal dumping. Tourists are amazed at the level of dumping and littering in our towns and villages, despite the number of refuse bins that have been provided. We do not use them. Something must be done. The Government allocates plenty of money but local authorities spend it on provisions that do not matter.</P>
      <P>How many litter wardens have been appointed? Their hours must be flexible because there is not much use in appointing a warden to work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Much of the dumping in rural areas happens later than that. Old cars are dumped on the side of the road and the owners must be pursued, given that all cars are registered. A scrappage scheme was introduced a number of years ago to cater for people who wanted to scrap their old cars but this issue must be addressed further.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have done good work in regard to the disposal of household effects. The Minister makes an allocation available annually, which local authorities use to provide skips in towns and villages so that people can dispose of old televisions, refrigerators and so on. Some people are too lazy to transport such effects in a small trailer to the skips and prefer to sneak out at night and dump them on the roadside.</P>
      <P>The dumping of dead animals in rivers is still prevalent despite the introduction of tagging and registration which would allow for the identification of the owners. I live in the Shannon basin and when there is flooding during the winter dead animals are carried down river and not disposed of, which is a disgrace. This also results in more expenditure for local authorities as they must dispose of the animals, involving the expenditure of money which could be better utilised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1737" />The disposal of plastic bags is also a problem. The Department has proposed to levy the use of bags. They are to be seen in hedges throughout the countryside. Road users are not the only people responsible for dumping bags as the farming community also has a great deal to answer for in this regard with plastic thrown in fields after baling has been completed. This leaves a lot to be desired.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have introduced recycling banks. Old batteries are returned in my local school and home composting has been encouraged. A recycling week is proposed to be held annually to educate people and get young people involved. Work needs to be done on plastic recovery. Dumps are bursting at the seams and approval is awaited from the EPA to extend their use. What will happen if the EPA rejects these requests?</P>
    <P>There are major problems in the area of waste. I do not know the background to the cases in Wicklow. Perhaps the farmer involved was told different products were being dumped but what happened was scandalous. There is an onus on the registered contractors to use recognised tip heads. Illegal dumping must stop but there is substantial money to be made by those who engage in it.</P>
    <P>The day is fast coming, whether we like it, when this country will have to have incinerators. More research should be founded on the health risks associated with incinerators and, if there are no problems with them, we must move in that direction. It is not enough for health boards to take on contractors to dispose of their waste, rather the boards should be obliged to monitor where the waste goes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement, in particular the proposed landfill levy. However, the fee should not be an executive function of the manager but should be decided by the elected members. I compliment the Department on its work on this measure. The onus is on us all to reduce the problems, and people who dump illegally should receive severe fines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. This issue has been raised almost daily recently in this House and we see almost daily reports of the discovery of illegal dumps of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. Most of these occur in the Dublin and Wicklow area. The Environmental Protection Agency figures, quoted by the Minister, indicate that there are 490 sites and 84 operational facilities where hazardous and non-hazardous waste is disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is out of hand. It is as though something on a colossal scale was happening under our noses without anyone knowing anything about it. What were the local authorities doing? What checks did the health boards carry out? What complicity occurred between landowners and the companies who disposed of waste? Why was no significant action taken? This is a scandal involving the contamination of water <Col N="1738" /> and damage to the environment, while enormous profits were made by rogues. There appears to have been more illegal than legal waste disposal. How could that exist for so long? Suddenly after the tip of the iceberg emerged, we find that it is a huge problem. There ought to be an inquiry.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not give us the figures on it, but I am not aware of any conviction for over 18 months and there has only been one imprisonment. As he stated, there is legislative provision for fines of up to £10 million or ten years in prison, but they have not been imposed. Has there even been an attempt to impose them? Has the Director of Public Prosecutions taken any cases in a higher court? We do not have the information even though we have long sought a debate on this issue. We must know what is being done. How many enforcement officers are there? When will prosecutions take place? We ought not to send in the Criminal Assets Bureau to investigate illegal profiteering. That is for the future.</P>

      <P>&mdash;to ensure that the local authorities report such cases to the Director of Public Prosecutions? He has spoken to all the local authorities but has he told them to take this issue seriously? The local authorities issue final reminders to people who have not paid their waste charges. In Dublin, that is £65, or £95 with a bin, although, as the Minister must be aware, half of Dublin is still without bins. They are threatened with dire legal action over a service that has no element of waste management. Court cases are being taken against households and there is no recycling plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's is a non-plan. What is he doing to get the local authorities to fulfil their functions over illegal dumping? Nothing. The Minister is a disaster and this is a great scandal. I am disappointed with the address <Col N="1739" /> of the Minister of State and the lack of action. The local authorities have considerable responsibilities but the Minister, as the boss, must ensure that policies established by legislation are implemented, yet the Department has taken no action, good, bad or indifferent, on this matter.</P>
      <P>Recently, I raised the issue of the Dublin Waste Company which operates in the Sheriff Street and East Wall area and has been in breach of just about every regulation. It stores waste in an area set aside for empty trucks. Its noise levels at all times are too high. Waste is brought in and out at all hours contrary to its licence. The company was convicted on a number of charges recently, yet £15,000 was the maximum fine despite this not being a first offence. They were also convicted of dumping hazardous and non-hazardous waste in Wicklow.</P>
      <P>Offences of this nature should always be dealt with firmly. It conveys the impression that those who run a business can get away with anything while the ordinary person who commits a petty offence ends up in prison. There is latitude and flexibility in enforcing the law where a large operator is concerned. Why are their licences not revoked? Why is the law not enforced effectively? The profits are huge but if the fine is only £15,000, why not abuse the law? Why not engage in illegal dumping and why not destroy the environment when there is a fortune to be made? That is what the cowboy operators are doing and they seem to be the norm rather than the exception. I am sure we will return to this issue in the new year. Those of us who are local councillors will be taking it up with our local authorities and looking very closely at the issue of licensing in the future. I am disappointed the Department does not provide leadership on this issue.</P>

      <P>It is time local authority members instructed their county manager and adopted a hands-on approach to running the authority. Local authority members should not run away from the problem. That is what is happening in this country, it is too easy to blame somebody else.</P>
      <P>We all know that there are three systems of waste disposal: recycling, dumping and incineration. There is not enough recycling taking place. There is far too much packaging on goods. Sausages are now packaged in three or four cellophane wrappers where two were sufficient in the past. These wrappings do not disintegrate.</P>
      <P>I was on holidays recently in Playa de las Americas in the Canary Islands. The island of Tenerife has two small incinerators and one big one just to service a small island. People were lying out in the sun and on the beaches within 50 yards of an incinerator and nobody complained. We are not able to have an incinerator here. In Japan, there is an incinerator is almost every village and the Japanese are healthier and have a longer life expectancy than we do.</P>
      <P>It is time we stopped objecting to everything. We had incinerators for generations in this country. Every household in this city burned its waste in the fire, as did every house in the country. Every creamery had a big boiler into which all the rubbish went. Every hospital had a boiler house which burned bandages and other waste.</P>

      <P>Was the recent court case ever sorted out? The rate payers of this country will not be able to shoulder the total cost of refuse collection if some people do not pay for these services. The business community is over-taxed. If local authorities ran pubs, we would expect them to give out free drink. That is the way it is today. Local authorities cannot do everything for free; they must receive payment. County councillors who tell people that they should not pay waste charges act irresponsibly. I supported the introduction of water charges although some people said there was no need for them.</P>
      <P>I know of a recent case where a lady who threw away a cigarette butt, a biodegradable substance, was fined £1,000. Big businesses are dumping rubbish but are not being charged for doing so. What are the county councils doing to bring those people to court? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Members should ask their county manager what actions have been taken to bring those people to justice. How many litter wardens are to be seen at two o'clock and four o'clock in the morning when people come out of discos and pubs, go into takeaways and throw all their rubbish on the street? It is very easy to catch some poor old lady throwing a cigarette butt out the window and charge her £1,000. That is not justice. I am a non-smoker and am not in favour of smoking but fair is fair. Too many officials take the line of least resistance by making an example of an old lady. This country must adopt a hands-on attitude and stop passing on responsibility. We must be prepared to make decisions and realise that whether or not we like it, incineration is the only realistic way to dispose of toxic waste. There is no other way. It is becoming impossible to find landfill sites. When the county council chooses a site on which to locate a dump or build a road, some rare snail, archaeological feature or tourist <Col N="1742" /> attraction usually stands in the way. There are places in my county where I never saw a sinner going and if the council decided to take action, it suddenly became a huge tourist amenity.</P>
      <P>We must be realistic and stop trying to blame other people. We are all to blame. We all have to play our part and as public representatives we must give a lead. We cannot be hail-fellow-well-met with everyone. We must say we have a problem, which must be solved, and we must introduce a system whereby we can dump or burn our waste to get rid of it. I again congratulate the Minister on his very positive approach. I ask the councils and local authorities to take a hands-on approach and not to blame the Minister. The ball is in their court and they need to play it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to update Senators on the current position in relation to the shocking events of last weekend when eight unfortunate people were found dead in a container in County Wexford. The deep sadness of the event came home to us earlier this week when it became clear that among the deceased two families had been devastated, with four out of the eight deceased being children, aged four, nine, ten and 16 years. Our deepest sympathy goes to the relatives and friends of the deceased. Our thoughts and best wishes go to the five survivors who are recovering in Wexford General Hospital from this unspeakable ordeal.</P>
      <P>All eight deceased have now been identified as Turkish nationals. The five survivors are believed to include three Turkish, one Albanian and one Algerian national. One of the Turkish nationals is a 15 year old boy. A number of relatives of the persons concerned have travelled to Ireland and are being assisted by the authorities at what is a very difficult time for them. It is a priority at this time to ensure the complete recovery of the five survivors and that their needs are catered for. It is important to pay tribute to all in Wexford associated with their care.</P>
      <P>The question of asylum or humanitarian leave has been raised. The Minister has already said that when the people concerned are in a position to consider their future, it will be open to them to make such an application. He has made it clear they will receive sympathetic consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The detailed movements of the container were outlined earlier this week. It left Italy loaded with furniture on Friday, 30 November and travelled via Cologne, Germany to Zeebrugge, Belgium, arriving on Tuesday, 4 December. It was loaded onto a ship which departed from Zeebrugge at 6 p.m. that evening. The ship arrived in Bellview Port, Waterford on the evening of Thursday, 6 <Col N="1743" /> December. On Friday, 7 December the container was loaded onto a truck and stored overnight at the port. On Saturday, 8 December the truck was driven to Drinagh Business Park, Wexford where the discovery was made shortly after its arrival at 9.10 a.m.</P>
    <P>All the indications from the investigation so far are that the people concerned were not attempting to travel to Ireland, but to the United Kingdom, a shorter journey from the port of Zeebrugge. The Garda, including the Garda National Immigration Bureau, is undertaking a major investigation into the matter, involving contacts with the UK, French, Belgian and German authorities. Europol and Interpol have also been involved in the investigation. A lot of progress has been made in recent days. I express gratitude for and acknowledge the full and timely co-operation of all these authorities. A number of persons have been interviewed regarding various stages of the container's journey to Ireland. Particular progress has been made in Belgium with regard to a premises which seems likely to have been used as a staging post as part of the trafficking operation. Charges have already been brought against an individual in Belgium.</P>
    <P>This tragedy represents the first such incident in Ireland. Sadly, such occurrences are becoming a familiar feature internationally. On Tuesday a similar tragedy occurred in Italy. We also recall with horror the Dover tragedy of last year when 58 people lost their lives in similar circumstances. This tragedy shows the callous disregard for human life of traffickers and smugglers of human beings. They have no interest in their victims, only in the money they can extort from them. International law and criminal justice systems must target criminals who exploit and abuse the human rights of migrants through human trafficking and smuggling. Any perceived lack of coherence in the approach adopted by border control agencies throughout the European Union serves to encourage rather than deter such activities. In the light of the Dover tragedy last year governments across Europe reaffirmed their commitment to take action to counter those smuggling and trafficking. The Wexford tragedy underlines the need for concerted action across Europe and for continued effective co-operation throughout Europe to combat those who seek to profit from the trade in human beings.</P>
    <P>People smuggling and trafficking is an international problem and one country cannot operate alone to successfully combat it. It is clear that these challenges require the building of partnerships at all levels between European states at a policy and operational level. It poses challenges for the European Union, governments and policy makers generally in terms of the vision of Europe that we seek to support through immigration policy.</P>
    <P>The United Nations has recognised the involvement of organised criminals in trafficking and smuggling of persons in the Palermo Conven<Col N="1744" /> tion Against Transnational Organised Crime, signed at the end of last year. It contained two protocols against migrant smuggling and trafficking. The focus is on criminalising the smugglers and traffickers. The protocols also take proper account of the need to treat migrants humanely and safeguard their human rights, particularly where persons have been the victims of trafficking for exploitation.</P>
    <P>Our immigration system must achieve the correct balance in ensuring, on the one hand, the integrity and security of the State and its residents are protected and, on the other, that the rights and interests of immigrants are upheld. In addition, Ireland must afford protection to refugees and fair consideration and care for those claiming protection from persecution while those claims are being determined. The Government's policy regarding asylum and immigration matters is that it is committed to providing protection for refugees and the application of fair procedures in accordance with law to all immigrants, both legal and illegal. We have a fair and balanced asylum system as well as strong legal channels for legal migration in the work permit and working visa scheme. More than 3,000 have availed of these schemes so far this year. By the end of the year it is anticipated that approximately 10,000 persons will have entered the State this year to make asylum applications here.</P>
    <P>It is well recognised that our immigration system, like those of our EU partners, is being abused by traffickers and people smugglers. This has implications for the integrity and effectiveness of the asylum system as it operates in Ireland for those genuinely in fear of persecution. However, as a member of the family of civilised nations, we must continue to respect the dignity and human rights of all persons who claim asylum here, irrespective of what the eventual outcome of their claim may be.</P>
    <P>It is clear that a policy of control of the external borders alone will not work. There is a need to work with the countries of origin of migrants to try to tackle the root causes of illegal migration. In many cases it is the result of poverty and lack of opportunity in the countries concerned, rather than persecution. There is a need to help those countries to address the issues which give rise to this. There is an onus on the international community to encourage the economic development of countries which are the source of migration and assist them in providing for the needs of their people. The European Union's approach of encouraging partnership with countries of origin as part of its wider migration and asylum policy must be encouraged. Ireland's development aid programme also has a role to play.</P>
    <P>Action has been taken to deal with people traffickers and smugglers in Ireland. The Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000, came into effect on 5 September 2000. The purpose of the Act is to target the profiteer or professional smuggler in human beings by creating an offence of trafficking in illegal immigrants and providing <Col N="1745" /> a framework by which those engaging in such smuggling can be dealt with under the law. Under the Act any person who for profit intentionally assists illegal immigrants to enter the State may be punishable by unlimited fines or up to ten years imprisonment or both. The Act covers offences committed outside the State as well as those committed in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Garda National Immigration Bureau established last year has had a focus on countering trafficking and smuggling activity and developed strong operational international liaison which has been evidenced by the progress in this investigation. The first successful prosecution was taken earlier this year and a number of other investigations are pending with as many as 20 cases currently with the Director of Public Prosecutions. The bureau is also deploying at ports around the country equipment to detect the presence of people concealed in vehicles. In addition, earlier this year the Irish Road Haulage Association agreed a voluntary code of practice with the aim of encouraging greater vigilance to ensure covert passengers were not present in vehicles arriving in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The lesson we must learn from the tragedy is that we cannot lessen our vigilance in the fight against criminals who exploit vulnerable people. As a member of the European Union, Ireland must and will play a full part in and encourage concerted action at EU level to counter trafficking and smuggling activity internationally. It is also important to acknowledge that large-scale population movements throughout the world have in recent years, and to an extent unknown in the past, become a fact of life. It raises issues of a fundamental nature, not just for this country or for the European Union, but for the world as a whole. These issues need to be addressed seriously and urgently at international level.</P>
    <P>We must not pretend there are simple solutions. This is a subject where there are genuine complexities. Arguments that these problems arise because there are not any lawful means of entering the State, that applicants for refugee status do not have their cases heard, that the issue can be dealt with by setting quotas, that trafficking is a side issue and that immigrants do not abuse the system to the detriment of others are just as futile and wrong headed in terms of genuinely finding solutions as is the pretence that legal solutions and law enforcement measures alone will suffice. We need to work seriously and honestly together, not only here, but across the world, to address the underlying causes and attempt to evolve at international level a means of addressing the fact that the large-scale movement of people is now part of reality for all of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased we have the opportunity to discuss this very tragic affair because it allows us to address fundamental issues relating to our immigration laws, the position of migrants and the treatment of asylum seekers. It is regrettable, horrifying and sad that four chil<Col N="1746" /> dren died aged four, nine, ten and 16 years. They were vulnerable young people who should have been the responsibility of mature, dutiful adults and should have had a future in European society. It is unfortunate that they came from greater Europe and were the victims of such tragedy. They more than likely travelled from Turkey to Italy, where they boarded a container which travelled through three EU member states, Italy, Germany and Belgium, and arrived here where the discovery was made. It is an indictment, not of us specifically, but of refugee policy throughout the European Union.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State acknowledged the lesson to be learned that we cannot lessen our vigilance in the fight against criminals who exploit vulnerable people. I fully concur with her on that point, but I also hope we learn wider lessons and that the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform learn of the need for a common European asylum policy. It is unfortunate that there is no common definition of what constitutes an asylum seeker across EU member states. There is a wide variation in definitions, some of which are quite restrictive, a matter that needs to be resolved. Germany and Austria are adjacent to eastern European countries which are home to serious infringements of human rights, torture and a lack of democracy. I understand the reason they are rather rigid in their approach. However, they are also members of the United Nations and have signed up to a number of conventions, as well as being member states of the European Union. Under the Treaty of Amsterdam they have signed up to a common asylum seekers policy that I hope the Minister will soon implement here.</P>
      <P>It is the responsibility of the European Union to address this issue, but the lack of policy and co-ordination at that level leaves a gateway for mafiosi and those of that ilk to illegally traffic persons. The longer that gateway is left open, the more gangs will emerge. It is commendable that Interpol and Europol are addressing the issue with the Garda, but all member states of the European Union must approach this individually, as sovereign states, and as part of the Union and have the moral courage to take on the responsibility of making clear definitions.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to the control of borders, but control of borders is never successful because in most cases the people concerned are fleeing very difficult circumstances and in some cases are in fear of their lives. They will do anything to get out of their countries of origin and the idea of preventing them from crossing borders is not reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent policy has been based on a belief that greater border regulation, tighter visa systems, more airport liaison officers to prevent boarding of aircraft and more severe carrier sanctions will control the problem. Despite the introduction of such measures, the number coming continues to increase. An emphasis on control is not the way to solve the problem. Canada and the United <Col N="1747" /> States of America have a very good and sophisticated system, the positive elements of which the European Union would do well to examine and implement.</P>
    <P>We are a member of a prosperous economic union and have, therefore, a moral responsibility to share the burdens of our fellow human beings and accommodate their needs rather than discriminate against them. It is not so distant in our history that coffin ships left during the Famine containing desperate, fearful people who were prepared to risk boarding those substandard vessels because they knew that if they stayed, they would die. For many there was no life across the sea. We should remember this when negative comments are made about the people who now surface in our communities. We have only to look back to the penal laws to be able to empathise with them. We should take a very strong stand to get the European Union to open its heart and mind to a far greater degree than is the case at present considering the control systems it is putting in place.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of transparency in the discussions and negotiations that take place at EU level. Although much of it is not a matter of record, I understand policy in Germany and Austria prevents family reunification. Any person over the age of 14 years does not have the right to be united with their family. That is a serious matter. What does the Government have to state to its German and Austrian counterparts on the subject? If it is true that there is not an automatic right of family unification, particularly in relation to those over 14 years old, there is a fundamental human rights issue to be addressed. Article 41 of the Constitution clearly defines the position of the family and a question may arise of whether it supersedes European Union treaty law. Article 42.1.1º states:</P>
    <P>The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    <P>Article 42.1.2º states:</P>
    <P>The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.</P>
    <P>If that is so &ndash; and it is &ndash; surely we have a duty as a member state to convey that fundamental principle to the European Union. Is it not important that we raise this issue in the course of discussions and actively promote the concept of keeping families together and accommodating them?</P>
    <P>There is a need for more consultation in parliamentary discussions at national and European level because it is important the handling of this issue becomes more transparent. It is important <Col N="1748" /> we know what position will be taken on our behalf at European level. Our position should be to insist on a legal route being provided for all migrants and asylum seekers, especially those from countries where terrorist regimes and dictatorships are in place. It should be made simple for people to apply and, because they will seek asylum in any event, they should be allowed enter the country and then apply. Despite controls, applications for asylum within the EU have increased in recent years.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a common definition of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; and it needs to be as broad and inclusive as possible. For example, France does not entertain applications for asylum from women who have been subject to genital mutilation or other such abuse in their home countries. That is unacceptable and we, as a fellow member state, should say that.</P>
    <P>There is a negative trend in attitudes towards the basic principles of human rights in the EU. We, as a member state, should be vigilant in this regard. We should be to the forefront in ensuring this trend does not continue. We should take note of best practice throughout the world and facilitate rather than discriminate. More than 700 children came as asylum seekers to this country last year. While many were 16 or 17, many were also very young. The Minister of State has confirmed that by stating that four of the eight refugees who died in Wexford were children.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State and her Department take a strong view and strong action, not just against criminals. The EU is in deficit on this issue and needs to take moral responsibility for it.</P>

      <P>This tragedy a week ago shocked the country. While we have seen this happen before in other countries, it is new to Ireland. Like other Members, I sympathise with the families and survivors. It will be very difficult for them to cope with this. The Minister of State said they can remain in the country until their applications have been decided.</P>
      <P>I do not know how events such as this happen. The refugees came from Turkey which would be a holiday destination for a good number of Irish people. I do not understand why these people would have been prohibited from leaving that country. It is another matter to try to come to live in Ireland, but if they had passports, surely they would have been entitled to come as far as our borders. Why did they have to hide in a lorry? Now that they have been discovered, their cases will be considered.</P>
      <P>In the past hundred years or more, many Irish people went to America. Many of them were illegal immigrants, but they never hid in lorries or anything like that. They went by boat, entered the country and produced their passports or whatever documentation they had which meant the American Government would treat them humanely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1749" />The powers that be in Europe must come together on this. It would make a huge difference if the EU were expanded because many of the countries from which asylum seekers come would be included. It would ease the problem greatly because these people would then be free to travel within the EU. Some who were critical of what happened in Wexford voted against the Nice treaty. If that treaty had been ratified or even if enlargement had taken place by now, it would have greatly eased the problem.</P>
    <P>I travel a bit and I know that Croatia has 1,000 miles of coastline. On most days, Italy can be seen at the narrowest points where it is only about 40 miles away. The sea between Italy and Croatia is not tidal. There is no rise or fall of tides and this means it is very safe for small boats or speed boats to cross from Croatia to Italy. Let us imagine that Ireland is in a similar position to Italy. There are thousands of places in Croatia from which people can leave undetected and, as with Italy, there are thousands of places around our coast where people can land undetected.</P>
    <P>From my travels I have found that there are stricter controls within the EU than outside it. I had no problem driving from Croatia to Bosnia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I drove to Dubrovnik and into Montenegro. I was hardly ever asked a question or to produce a passport. The controls are very lax.</P>
      <P>There is one aspect to this unfortunate case which I do not understand. Like other Members, I have received requests from foreign doctors working in hospitals in this country to help them bring over their wives and families. It appears in the case of the Turkish people in Wexford that half their families already lived in England and that they were supposed to go to them. I do not understand in that context why the people had to hide in the back of a lorry. Surely they were entitled, if not to stay in England, at least to visit their families. It appears one man lost his wife and children while a husband and wife also died. Their relatives were already in England and have come here to visit. I would hope that if there are people living here they are legally entitled to so. I do not care what part of the world they come from, even if it is from Timbuktu. Their families should be entitled to visit, whatever about remaining.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn touched on an important point that the family should not be broken up. If one member of a family lives here legally, such as the father or the breadwinner, there is an onus on us to allow his wife and children to come and stay with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were all caught napping. I do not blame anyone. In the past ten years, this Government and the previous Government have had problems regardless of the numbers. During those years the country became prosperous. Perhaps we were the <Col N="1750" /> cause of the problem to some extent because we boasted throughout Europe and the world that this was a good country, the economy was right, money was rolling in and the social welfare benefits were good. The amount of money which people on social welfare were entitled to here was more than they could earn in a good job in their own country. I was amazed when travelling to some of these countries to learn what people earn. In Croatia, for example, the equivalent of £100 or £120 is a fabulous week's wage.</P>
    <P>This unfortunate incident in Wexford brought home many facts to us. Following the growth in the economy, suddenly people started to come here. In fairness to the Department and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Reform, everyone acted as quickly as possible. Much of the criticism about people queuing up for their money was unfair. Radio and television is taken over by people who have to begin queuing at three o'clock. Let us be fair, all one has to do is go down the street at the back of Leinster House and one will see people queuing for buses for two and three hours. These are our own people.</P>
    <P>We have seen on television the war-torn countries and tragedies from which these people have come. When they arrive here they should be thankful for what we give them with open arms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. We are discussing an extremely tragic incident. When eight people die collectively in any circumstance it is tragic. These people, half of whom were adults and half children, died in particularly sad circumstances. We should offer our condolences to their families and try to ensure that such an event does not happen again. That is the more difficult part.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald expressed surprise they did not use passports. It is very difficult for people in countries such as Turkey, Romania, Albania or Morocco to get passports and travel visas and more difficult still to get a work permit. Given the number of obstacles in their way it would not be worth their while to apply since they would not get them. Therefore, they have to use surreptitious and clandestine methods if they are to have any hope of getting away from the circumstances in which they live.</P>
      <P>The survivors and those who died in the container had relatives in Britain whom they were hoping to join. That raises questions about the whole family situation and how policy can separate one member of a family from the other. Where somebody has the right to live in a particular country the question will have to be addressed as to whether a spouse, child or grandparent can be allowed to come and join them. It is a serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the people we are discussing are economic refugees, although the Minister of State's speech dealt mainly with asylum seekers fleeing persecution. Economic refugees are the order of the day. The number of Irish people who were economic refugees is colossal. There is not a fam<Col N="1751" /> ily in Ireland that did not have an economic refugee. On 11 September one of the major concerns was that so many illegal Irish were working in the Twin Towers and for that reason we will never know the number of fatalities there. Of all people we should be sympathetic to the plight of economic refugees and try to see what can be done.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn referred to a number of important points, as did Senator Fitzgerald. While many anti-trafficking measures have been passed and many controls put in place the numbers coming here are growing. The reason is that Ireland is a wealthy country. In the past if one was an economic refugee there was no point in coming here. All the economic refugees went in the opposite direction. They left this country and went to New York and England, as our people have done for generations and even centuries.</P>
    <P>We have been lucky as a nation that there were countries to which we could go. In the early days when &ldquo;No Irish need apply&rdquo; was the rule either in Britain or New York, our forbears had to endure incredible difficulties when crossing the Atlantic, and suffered many fatalities.</P>
    <P>Numbers coming here are increasing, yet the Minister of State can tell us that 35,000 applied successfully for work permits to come to this country this year and that there are 10,000 applications from asylum seekers on grounds of persecution. Some 35,000 persons came into Ireland legally. As the Minister said, we are operating a fair and balanced system. However, the problem is that the 35,000 people who came here legally and were recruited do not come from the same background as those who come illegally. They who came legally have skills, training, education and qualifications to do work here on a selective basis. If one lives in a disadvantaged area with absolute poverty there is not a hope in hell of any recruitment agency asking one to go to work in Ireland or England or any of the European countries. If one lives in a rural area, is impoverished, unskilled and disadvantaged, one does not have the mechanism to do any of the things seen on television or to participate in the wealth of the western world or the success of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The world is a global village and people are travelling and taking chances in greater numbers than ever. As Senator Fitzgerald said, many of them are coming from war-ravaged countries or from countries that were recently devastated. Turkey is not the wealthiest of countries. People who holiday there see the bright side along the coast but they do not see the numbers of people dying in prison on hunger strikes or the suppression of human rights. That suppression of rights is the major reason for the European Union's difficulty with admitting Turkey to its ranks.</P>
    <P>We have to look at this broadly. Despite the best intentions of the Government in terms of controlling the situation it must be looked at in the broader context of enlargement of the Euro<Col N="1752" /> pean Union. Enlargement of the Union would cover a large number of people coming to this country, whether from Romania or Poland and ultimately Turkey. In general, not many come here from Turkey because Turkish emigration has been traditionally to Germany where millions of Turkish people live. It is unusual that they would come to Ireland because of that tradition. That enlargement would be desirable and it would certainly reduce the intake from a number of countries.</P>
    <P>We need to look again at our Third World aid. We provide a certain amount of aid to the Third World while exploiting it at the same time. The result is that there is no significant improvement in those African countries we are talking about. We need to develop a better policy rather than provide agencies to deliver aid in the country. We need a more significant and well-founded basis for linking directly with countries. Perhaps we could twin with countries, provide skills and be responsible for development of a country instead of simply dumping our aid on it. While that is done with the best intentions it does not make a significant infrastructural difference. On the other hand, we exploit the resources of Third World countries.</P>
    <P>The third issue I wish to mention is the common European Union policy on economic refugees. This policy can help us deal with the issue in a coherent fashion rather than using the split approach we appear to have. We are reluctant to even recognise the concept of economic refugees and want refugees termed as asylum seekers. We do not want to deal with economic refugees but say that is out and send them back home. We tell them we have a system in place and give work permits, but we give work permits at a particular level only to the people we want rather than those who want to come to us.</P>
    <P>I want to mention the case of an eight months pregnant Nigerian woman detained at present in Mountjoy Prison. Her name is Kedirat Balogun. She is subject to a deportation order. I understand that no pregnant woman is supposed to travel by air after the sixth month, but yet the Department intends to send her back to Nigeria. Considering civil rights issues in northern Nigeria where unmarried mothers are subject to stoning &ndash; a recent case was raised in this House &ndash; that would be dangerous.</P>
    <P>Constitutional support for the family was referred to by both Senators Taylor-Quinn and Tom Fitzgerald. The humanitarian aspect also needs to be considered and I ask the Minister to look into the case. Legal action was to be taken in the case either today or yesterday. This type of case is not isolated and I ask the Minister to address it sympathetically.</P>

I have great sympathy for the Deputy Leader and Senator Fitzgerald because they have been placed in an impossible position. A Supplementary Order Paper, setting out the arrangements for the remainder of the day, has not yet been presented to the House. We are being asked to take a Bill hot foot from the Dáil without any period of reflection. This is not a routine Bill but a highly contentious one. The Lower House divided on it on a number of occasions. It is a constitutional Bill and one that deserves to be treated in a calm way.</P>
      <P>In an effort to be helpful, I suggest what is at issue is a question of ministerial convenience or of dealing with the Bill properly. The House is sitting on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week. We can take the Bill on either of those days. Only one item of business, according to the information relayed to my office, has been ordered for Wednesday. There would be no difficulty taking this Bill then. We could give it priority. The only item ordered for that day is Committee Stage of the Social Welfare Bill. Therefore, there would be no difficulty taking this Bill on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>My advice to the Deputy Leader is to take his courage in his hands and, with the support of the House, tell the Minister that the House will receive the Minister to take the Bill next Tuesday or Wednesday. I will not agree to an adjournment of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 23 June 1999, Seanad Éireann considered a Private Members' motion on the provision of information at referendums. The motion, tabled by Senator Quinn, was discussed in the aftermath of the referendum campaign on local government recognition which was characterised by a lack lustre debate, a disappointing turnout and a large number &ndash; over 100,000 &ndash; of spoilt referendum ballot papers. The volume of spoilt ballot papers, in particular, appeared to send a strong message to legislators that the provision of information and the facilitation of debate at referendums required examination.</P>
      <P>In response to the Private Members' motion, the Government gave a commitment to examine the various methods of providing information at referendums, having regard to the experience and work undertaken in this area including, in particular, the work of the three <i>ad hoc</i> commissions, the Referendum Commissions, the McKenna, Hanafin and Coughlan cases and the reports and recommendations of the Constitution Review Group and the all-party Oireachtas committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution has now reported and its sixth pro<Col N="1755" /> gress report, entitled The Referendum, makes a number of recommendations on the provision of information at referendums. Principal among these are proposals to amend the functions of a Referendum Commission, including removing the role of presenting the arguments for and against a proposal; providing a new power to allocate finance equally among &ldquo;pro&rdquo; and &ldquo;anti&rdquo; sides and a recommendation to provide additional functions to promote voter participation. These and other matters have been considered by the Government which has decided to bring forward this short Bill to implement a number of the recommendations contained in the all-party Oireachtas committee's report.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with the provisions of the Bill, I want to make a number of general points on the conduct of referendums. Referendums are important. They provide a mechanism to change the fundamental law of the State and the electorate, as guardians of that law, have a crucial role to play. The fact that any amendment to the Constitution requires a referendum offers the electorate the opportunity to express its opinion on political and constitutional issues. Since 1937, the Constitution has been amended following a referendum on 19 different proposals. Six proposals have been rejected &ndash; the most recent proposal was on the Nice Treaty &ndash; demonstrating that the electorate can be discerning on issues put before them. Apathy, low turnouts and an under-informed electorate, perhaps leading to a large number of spoilt votes, serve only to devalue the primacy of the Constitution. The arrangements for referendums must, in some way, provide for the information needs of voters and at the same time encourage voter participation to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>There have been changes in the conduct of referendum campaigns over the years, most noticeably in terms of the tendency for cross-party support for proposals and an increase in interest group participation. At a statutory level, there also have been developments. In terms of the statutory provision of information, the Referendum Act, 1994, provides for the following: copies of the constitutional amendment Bill may be inspected or obtained, free of charge, at any post office; a statement, prescribed by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas, is printed on polling cards, sent to every elector and displayed on posters at polling stations; the order of the Minister appointing polling day must be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>; public notice must be given by the local returning officer for each constituency stating the date and hours of polling and indicating that copies of the constitutional amendment Bill may be inspected or obtained free at any post office; and a polling card must be sent to each elector, other than postal and special voters, indicating the elector's number on the register, the location of the polling station and the date and hours of voting.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1756" />The provisions under the 1994 Act are, in a sense, the formal statutory requirements on informing the public about the polling day and hours of polling together with the terms of the proposed amendment. They could probably be best characterised as basic information provisions which, although necessary, are unlikely to impact decisively in terms of informing the public.</P>
    <P>The provision of information was developed at the divorce, bail and Cabinet confidentiality referendums. <i>Ad hoc</i> commissions, which comprised the Ombudsman, the Clerk of the Dáil and the Clerk of the Seanad, were established to oversee the preparation of statements setting out the arguments for and against the proposal at each referendum.</P>
    <P>Against the legal backdrop of the McKenna judgments the Referendum Act, 1998, was enacted. It was designed to put the <i>ad hoc</i> commissions on a statutory footing and to further advance the issue of providing information to the electorate. Specifically, the Act provided for the establishment of an independent statutory Referendum Commission whose primary role is to explain the subject matter of the referendum to the population at large as simply and effectively as possible, while ensuring that the arguments of those against the proposed amendment and those in favour are put forward in a way that is fair to all interests concerned.</P>
    <P>The question that needs to be addressed following the developments I have outlined is whether the operation of referendum information campaigns, especially of informing the electorate of the proposal and motivating them to express their opinion at the ballot box, has improved. The answer, or at least part of it, is that despite the endeavours of <i>ad hoc</i> commissions and the Referendum Commissions, turnout and participation have been disappointing and there is now a consensus that the manner in which referendum information campaigns are conducted is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Clearly there is no perfect solution to this problem. During the debate on the Referendum Act, 1998, the point was made that each change was an attempt to improve matters and if the changes were found wanting, then the issue would be revisited. Different types of solutions are provided for internationally but again none is perfect. In Ireland we must also have regard to the Constitution and Supreme Court judgments in considering possible solutions.</P>
    <P>The Referendum Commission, in its report on the referendums on the Amsterdam Treaty and Northern Ireland Agreement, referred to the difficulty in getting the message across to the electorate, as the following passage from the report indicates:</P>
    <P>There was a clear pattern which suggested that the average person has become quite lazy when it means reading or helping oneself to information and there is a high level of reliance on media broadcasts rather than the written word. The effect of television and radio cover<Col N="1757" /> age made them at least feel informed and exposed them to the issues. Those who did take the trouble to read the written material scored it highly in terms of balance and fairness (62%) and for its usefulness in decision making (53%). It was also felt to be easy to read and understand and gave an unbiased view of the issues.</P>
    <P>I want to state here on behalf of the Government that the amendments proposed in the Bill are not a reflection on the commission members or their staff, who have carried out their functions in a satisfactory manner for the six referendums for which they have been established. This is especially true when one has regard to the complexity of the referendum proposals relating to the EU and the subject matter of the other proposals where engaging the electorate was always likely to be difficult.</P>
    <P>In summary, the impact of the statutory provision of information under the Referendum Act, 1994, is small. The McKenna judgment has narrowed the parameters within which Government can promote, with public funds its views on a proposal. The rationale of the Coughlan judgment is that RTÉ breaches its statutory duty of objectivity and impartiality if it allows political parties and other bodies, which support a particular referendum outcome, a considerable advantage in the broadcasting of partisan material. The format of information provision via the work of the <i>ad hoc</i> commissions and the Referendum Commissions has been criticised as anodyne and ineffective, notwithstanding the valuable work undertaken by these bodies in accordance with their non-statutory and statutory briefs.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House addresses a number of these issues and I would now like to outline the changes proposed. The Bill amends the Referendum Act, 1998, and contains two sections. Section 2 is a standard provision dealing with the short Title and construction, while section 1 provides for the substantive change.</P>
    <P>Section 1(<i>a</i>) replaces the existing subsection (1) of section 3 of the Referendum Act, 1998, which sets out the functions of a Referendum Commission. This section does two things: it removes the current functions available to Referendum Commissions to prepare statements setting out the arguments for and against a proposal and also to foster and promote debate; and it provides a new function of promoting awareness of the referendum, including encouraging the electorate to vote.</P>
    <P>One of the aspects of the work of the Referendum Commission which has been subject to most criticism has been its function to present arguments for and against a proposal. This provision was drafted in consequence of the McKenna judgment and sought to bring equity of approach in terms of the balanced provision of information. However, there is general agreement that the provision has not been a total success. The alignment of arguments for and against a proposal in <Col N="1758" /> an almost sterilised format has not encouraged debate and can result in seemingly equal weightings being given to alternative arguments which do not merit equivalent comparison in any rational assessment.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution refers to this in its report in the following terms:</P>
    <P>The committee agrees that the commission should provide information but does not believe that it should have any direct responsibility for putting the arguments for and against a referendum proposal. It is understandable that such a function should have been given to the commission in response to the McKenna judgment. However, the political needs of a referendum cannot be met by setting before the electorate two lists of arguments, all of them detached from the contexts that give them sense and weight, in an effort to be even-handed. That leads to leaden rather than lively presentation. It also leads to confusion because while the voter must arrive at a summative judgment, he or she has no means of measuring the weight to be given to each of the arguments presented in this way. The engagement of the commission directly in the campaign tends to weaken the sense that the political parties and the interest groups should be the protagonists in the debate.</P>
    <P>It has been decided, therefore, to remove this function from future commissions, who will nonetheless retain their powers to prepare statements containing a general explanation of the subject matter of the proposal and the power to publish and distribute such information as they see fit.</P>
    <P>The second amendment provides for a new power for referendum commissions to promote public awareness of the referendum and to encourage as many people as possible to vote. It is difficult to examine the problem of referendum information and turnout in isolation from the wider problem of voter turnout and indifference towards the political system. Political participation generally has been declining and the downturn in interest in referendums cannot be seen separately from the more general trend. An independent body such as a referendum commission is ideally placed to undertake these additional functions. The format of the information campaigns will be a matter for each commission, which will continue to have all the powers it considers necessary for the performance of its functions under the Referendum Act, 1998.</P>
    <P>The amendments to section 1(<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) are consequential on the change of functions proposed in paragraph (<i>a</i>). Paragraph (<i>b</i>) repeals section 6 of the Referendum Act, 1998, which provides that a person may make a submission to the commission about the proposal of the subject of the referendum. This section is directly related to the function of preparing a statement of arguments for and against the proposal in the existing <Col N="1759" /> subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) and it will not be required following the earlier amendment. Paragraph (<i>c</i>) makes consequential amendments to section 8 of the 1998 Act, which concerns the publication of notices by a referendum commission. Paragraph (<i>a</i>) of the existing section 8 refers to notices informing people that they can make submissions to a commission. The other two amendments are consequential.</P>
    <P>I refer to the proposal in the Oireachtas all-party committee report recommending the allocation of funds to campaign groups promoting both sides during a referendum. The Government has decided not to proceed with the recommendation at this stage. It is a radical proposal which has been raised before, but it requires careful examination in the context of the relevant Supreme Court judgments and the difficulties with the practical application of such a scheme in the context of those judgments. These difficulties were acknowledged by the 1998 Referendum Commission in its report on the Amsterdam and Northern Ireland referendums. In that report the commission commented on the introduction of such a scheme as follows:</P>
    <P>From its experience, the commission would see considerable difficulties in ensuring compliance with the McKenna [judgment] and avoiding litigation.</P>
    <P>Many matters need to be addressed. How should the funds be divided? Should both sides be funded equally or at the discretion of the commission based on statutory criteria? What would be the information role of the referendum commission? Should a commission with a function of funding both sides be activated in all referendums? What conditions should be attached to such funding without interfering with a group's advocacy strategy? Would political parties be able to avail of finance? Could an individual get funding? How large would a group have to be to receive funding? How is the taxpayers' money to be accounted for? Are there different levels of information and public debate requirements?</P>
    <P>We might ask even more fundamental questions. Would the electorate be any wiser after being deluged with conflicting information? Would more information prove to be a greater turn-off for the electorate? Would the taxpayer be in favour of the use of their money by the Government, political parties, pressure groups and individuals to persuade them to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;? I raise these questions not to be obstructive, but to highlight some of the complexities that would require careful consideration if such a scheme was to be adopted. I note also that the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution had difficulty with this matter. A minority of the committee took the view that funds should be divided equally between the two sides as a matter of principle, while a majority were of the view that the division should be on <Col N="1760" /> the basis of what was equitable rather than what was equal.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis, the quality of the judgment that the electorate expresses at a referendum is, among other things, a function of the quality of the information available to them. This Bill will allow referendum commissions to focus on the provision of information in an objective way rather than an approach based on arguments for and against, which has proved problematic. The Bill will also seek to encourage awareness and political participation by providing future referendum commissions with a specific remit in this area. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>He may return and I might have the opportunity to say it again. I am sure the Deputy Leader is highly embarrassed at the procedures adopted today. I see the Leader has arrived. Last afternoon I was informed that this Bill was to come before the House today. I had to find out exactly what were the details of the Bill. Since last afternoon I have tried to speak to people who were on the all-party committee but, unfortunately, I was only able to contact one or two of them. I would like to have heard a balanced account of the details and views they had, not just those of members of my party but members of the Government parties as well. I wanted to establish if there was a consensus in the committee or if it was just what the Cabinet wanted to extract.</P>
      <P>It is most unfortunate that a Bill like this has been brought before the House so quickly. I am concerned about the public's perception of what is happening here today. It will be another sleight of hand as far as they are concerned. We have spoken about 100,000 spoiled votes and low turnout. Given the way we conduct business here, people very often wonder why they should bother voting. They may feel that politicians are playing tricks or using mirrors. Legislation that may influence their decision in the future is suddenly passed and it is out of their hands. This is the cynicism that has been created. Some of the reason for that lies with how procedures are being conducted here today. People will ask why we did not get the opportunity to debate, analyse and explore the outcome of legislation that came before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said, in reference to the second amendment, that the commission will be the <Col N="1761" /> appropriate body to encourage people to vote. People do not see a relationship between what happens in this House and what affects their lives. That is the reality. People did not get more information when the commission established itself and sought to give a balanced view. They got too much information. They got information that was unbalanced because some minor aspect was dealt with on the same basis as a major aspect. That served only to confuse. It was not that the people did not know what was going on. The more information they got, the more confusion was created. That 100,000 votes were spoiled was not a comment on the way matters were being handled, or the issue itself, but because people do not know how to fill out ballot papers when there is a multiplicity of them. It is not the job of the commission to tell them how to do that either. This or future Governments should consider formulating a compulsory subject in schools where ballot papers are used on a continual basis and students come to understand the relationship between the decisions that are made by them on the ballot paper and the likely outcomes. That will not happen as long as we indulge in sleights of hand.</P>
    <P>Conclusions about absenteeism were drawn in the committee's report. It stated that the major factor accounting for the extraordinarily high level of absenteeism was the electorate's sense of not understanding the issues involved. This comes across very strongly in subjective accounts given by those who abstained and is confirmed by statistical analysis that assessed the impacts on abstention of a wide range of variables and identifies a sense of a lack of understanding as a key factor.</P>
    <P>If this is true, it is the commission or the Government's fault because the time to find out if people were confused was before the election, not afterwards. There was enough debate and sufficient opportunities for people to find out what was going on. It was a failure, perhaps of all major parties. <i>The Irish Times </i>indicated that this legislation was introduced because the major parties failed to get across an understanding of what was involved in the Nice treaty. While I accept some responsibility as a member of a major party, the Government must accept primary responsibility. The Government, not just the commission, failed.</P>
    <P>This legislation and the way in which it was introduced will not help to improve the relationship between people's perceptions of what is going on in these Houses, or indeed in Europe, and their daily lives. That is the saddest part of it and I fear the Leader of the House and the Minister of State do not realise this. I cannot understand why we were not given the opportunity to put the legislation back until next Tuesday to allow a full and free debate on the vital issues involved. They should have been treated with the weight they deserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Coogan for sharing his time. Normally, I would welcome the <Col N="1762" /> Minister of State to the House, but since he kept us waiting for half an hour and did not have the manners even to indicate that he had caused some inconvenience to Members, my welcome is muted.</P>
      <P>It is the job of oppositions to be suspicious of governments. The way in which the Bill is being rushed through, not necessarily the Bill itself, gives off a bad smell. It is very unusual to seek to push legislation through both Houses on the same day. It usually happens only in the case of a major emergency which requires immediate attention, yet it is being steamrolled through both Houses today. Why? Is it a Bill of great intrinsic importance? It is not.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has hidden behind the shield of the all-party committee. The truth is he cherry-picked from its report. He took two items from it, leaving behind a whole range of other important items which do not form part of legislation. Why did this happen? We are right to be suspicious because we are not being told the full truth. We received notice only last night. Why did the Government choose to tag the Bill on at the tail end of the busiest week of the year? The Minister of State has brushed aside with contempt the arguments in favour of our offer to take the Bill on Tuesday or Wednesday to allow time. It was the old jackboot stuff we knew in the past which I thought had gone forever from these Houses.</P>
      <P>The referendum is a central instrument of democracy. In the McKenna case the Supreme Court reprimanded all the political parties for taking the referendum for granted and the sense we were using it to our advantage against the interests of the wider population. From that point on, everything associated with referenda must take place with care, detailed consideration and with great reflection. It is out of small Bills like this and rushed Bills taken in late night sittings that great problems come. These matters come back to haunt governments, sometimes years later. They must then carry the responsibility for them.</P>
      <P>We asked for the Bill to be deferred to allow us to consult our people over the weekend, read up on the documentation and literature and put forward amendments where necessary. By rushing it through today and taking all Stages in both Houses there is no chance of that. It was guillotined in the Dáil so there is no time for tabling or taking amendments. I see no point in getting into the farce in which we are now involved or helping the designs of the Government, whatever they may be. I am deeply suspicious, not just of the Bill but also of the way in which the Government has breached all normal procedures to get this legislation through without giving a single reason. I am sure we will find out soon enough. At least if the Minster of State gave us an honest reason for the rush, we could begin to believe the Government had a case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire anseo um thráthnóna chun an Bill seo a phlé. Bille simplí ach Bille an-thábhachtach atá ann. I welcome the Minister of State. Leaving aside the argument as to whether we should be debating the Bill today or next Tuesday, the legislation, though brief and simple, is nonetheless very important.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State reminded us that we recently held a debate which clearly crystallised the difficulties being encountered because of the commission's interpretation of how referenda should be conducted on the basis of the McKenna judgment. I have no doubt that anybody reading the advertisements would conclude that the commission interpreted the judgment in a way which best met its requirements. Those of us involved in practical politics provided clear examples from recent referenda of attending polling stations and receiving the consistent message that people had difficulty understanding the content and purpose of the referendum. This was certainly the case with the Nice treaty, which is understandable given that the treaty was quite difficult to understand.</P>
      <P>The commission should be commended for widely advertising the arguments for and against. However, having conscientiously read the pros and cons of the argument, even people who were informed about the issues would have had difficulty coming to a decision. The practical effect of the conduct of the campaign was to sow confusion among people about whether to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are very fortunate to have a Constitution which has stood the test of time for 64 years. On various social matter and other issues, it has been a cornerstone of how we conduct our democracy. One could not but take a certain amount of pride in the fact that, of all the European Union states, we were the only one which held a plebiscite, thus allowing the people to make a decision on the treaty. While we may not always like the outcome of these decisions, the supremacy of the people in a democracy is a great reminder that democracy is a tender flower which we serve and ours differs from the parliamentary supremacy of other jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>We had a long debate the other evening on the twenty-fifth amendment of the Constitution, the referendum on which will be held, I presume, some time early in the new year. Regardless of one's views on its content, there is no better way to deal with the decision on the protection of human life and pregnancy than allowing the people to take it. I have a firm conviction that it is superior to legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was incumbent on this House in our debate to prompt and encourage the Government to take steps to address what was becoming an information deficit in this area in order to protect the structure and, as the Minister of State has rightly pointed out, primacy of the Constitution. The confusion not only caused a certain degree of apathy &ndash; it certainly contributed to a low turn-<Col N="1764" /> out &ndash; but was also very definitely a factor in the large number of spoilt votes which characterised the last referendum and previous referenda.</P>
    <P>That will not happen in the future due to the measures contained in the Bill. An explanation of the arguments for and against will be given in future referenda. The Referendum Commission, as an independent body, will undertake this function in a fair and impartial way. That should lead to a more enlightened approach on the part of the electorate and will allow the media and various bodies, be they political parties, the Government or other voluntary organisations, to freely articulate their viewpoint. That will help the process and create a greater interest among the public which, in turn, will lead to a greater turnout in elections.</P>
    <P>I had difficulty in the past, regardless of who was in government, with the manner in which referenda were controlled as a result of the McKenna judgment, which led to a sterilisation of debate. I hope under the new system we can debate the issues more freely because if a Government holds a referendum, it should be in a position to actively canvass support for it and if the Opposition opposes it, it should be in a position to do so also. The recommendations of the all-party committee on equal funding have not been accepted by the Minister at this stage, but as we gain more experience in the changed system, resources could be made available to those bodies which will then have the responsibility to make the arguments as they perceive them.</P>
    <P>The Bill should lead to a significant improvement in the climate in which referenda are held in the future, something about which many were becoming concerned. Those who were closer to the issues or involved in politics expressed concern about the effects of the McKenna judgment. We must respect the decision of the Supreme Court. I am sure it was not its intention to curtail the position to the extent that there would be a deficit in terms of the people understanding and being informed of the issues.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and look forward to its implementation. I hope in the future this House will have an opportunity to discuss the practical benefits that will accrue from the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with two issues: first, the manner in which the Bill is passing through these Houses and, second, the nature of the Bill. I am fairly sure that but for the fact that there is a time imperative involved, there would be widespread support on all sides of the House for the legislation and that it would be passed in an non-contentious way. From my membership of the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution, I am aware there was widespread consensus &ndash; it would be wrong to use the words &ldquo;unanimous agreement&rdquo; because the Minister has already referred to the majority and the minority view in the committee &ndash; that something should be done to deal with these issues and that <Col N="1765" /> the Referendum Bill before us accords with the general view of the committee.</P>
      <P>I would not accept Senator Manning's remark about cherry-picking in terms of the Minister's quotations from the all-party committee's report. The references to the report in the Minister's contribution accurately reflect the tone of the report. In common with the Minister, I salute the work of the Referendum Commission and the way it has approached its job. In particular, it is appropriate that the Clerk of the Seanad should be thanked for her work in regard to these matters because it is evident that there is an increasingly onerous burden being put on the shoulders of the Clerk and the staff of the office. They are becoming increasingly involved in these matters, ethics and similar issues, a matter somebody in the Administration should examine with a view to relieving the burden placed upon the staff. I say that with reasonable forcefulness.</P>
      <P>The other matter concerns what emerges from the commission. It is evident that the system whereby one picks up one's Sunday newspaper and sees a full page advertisement with closely spaced type and turgid prose, with an equality, not just of ideas, but of words for and against an argument, is a wholly unreal way of dealing with constitutional matters in the real world. We all realise that this is a consequence of the McKenna judgment, which stands.</P>
      <P>It has been represented that what is being done here in some way subverts the McKenna judgment. It does not. There is one aspect of the report that would require a referendum, and that is to do with funding by equitable rather than equal means the campaigns in the referendum. I share the view, which the Minister said was the majority view in the committee, that it be equitable rather than equal. If one is to pursue that line of thought, inevitably it will lead to a constitutional amendment. It is the view of the majority, reported in the all-party committee report, that a referendum should not be proceeded with at this stage.</P>
      <P>Several experts told the all-party committee about models in other countries, the way the Referendum Commission does its work and so on. I am strongly of the view that if we were to continue the system of the one page advertisement with the equal arguments, the turgid prose and the phrases more appropriate to the Law Library than the real world, the advertisements should be drafted by a practising journalist, perhaps Colm Toibin or Maeve Binchey. At least they would be written in a language that might engage the population, which might then read what was contained in the documents. Some progress has been made in that respect. Some of the television advertisements encouraging people to vote have been quite good by advertising standards in that they are professional and engaging, but if we are to continue in the normal way, these debates will become increasingly unreal on whatever issue, even very non-contentious ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1766" />Despite the intention of the McKenna judgment, it has led to an increasing amount of confusion among the electorate. Perhaps that is one of the reasons the turnouts have been low. I have always taken the view that low turnouts are not something about which one should become very concerned. I do not deny that it is important in a democracy to value and exercise the right to vote, but perhaps it is a measure of the stability of our democracy that the turnouts are low. I had the privilege of monitoring the first Palestinian election in the Gaza Strip, and Senator Lanigan will confirm that there were turnouts in excess of 95%. That was because it was such an important issue for the Palestinian people. If there were such divergences in our society &ndash; I am not saying they should be of the violent nature as that witnessed in Palestine &ndash; I am confident that election turnouts would be higher than they are currently.</P>
    <P>Middle aged people who inhabit these Houses also have a tendency to lecture young people as to their responsibilities and in regard to the reason they do not vote. Recent generations have all voted in the same manner. It is a characteristic of young people that they do not vote and perhaps the reason the turnout was higher in the past was because people were not as mobile and many did not avail of third level education which would have resulted in them leaving home. However, it is correct that we should try to increase voter turnout.</P>
    <P>I do not regard the Bill as contentious. There was widespread support for it in the Dáil and, other than the manner of its passage through the Houses, I doubt very much if it would attract a great deal of attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, whom we did not expect to see today because the Bill was not on the Order Paper. However, in addition, we were informed that we would have to deal with all Stages, although it had not even been passed in the Dáil. Naturally, the House is not impressed by the manner in which the Government is conducting business. It is totally unsatisfactory that a Bill which changes a Supreme Court decision that provided for a constitutional prerogative should be processed in such a manner. There has been a great deal of comment already regarding the way in which the legislation has been presented to us and it is not good enough. We have always objected to all Stages of a Bill being taken in one fell swoop without an opportunity for reflection for at least 24 hours. The manner in which the Bill has been proposed is totally unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation has been introduced as a result of the debacle surrounding the Nice treaty referendum. There was a low turnout and it was rejected. The reason was that neither the Minister's party nor the other Government party made the slightest effort to promote the referendum. There was no political involvement. The Taoiseach, with his much vaunted electoral machine, did not lift his little finger to distribute a leaflet or erect posters, other than standard party <Col N="1767" /> posters, in our constituency. He normally puts up personalised posters during such campaigns to indicate quite clearly where he stands on an issue.</P>
    <P>As a result, Dublin Central had the second largest anti-Nice treaty vote. The Taoiseach indicated to the electorate that the referendum would succeed through a nod and a wink because he would not become embroiled or involved in the debate. The Government then blamed the Referendum Commission for not getting the message across. There is an always attempt to blame somebody else and find a scapegoat, but if the Minister looked at the beam in his own eyes, he would find it very close to him.</P>
    <P>The legislation clears the way for the abortion referendum due in the new year. The Government does not intend to lose this time round. It was embarrassed by the result of the Nice treaty referendum as it thought it would be passed and did not get involved in promoting an issue for which there was no great enthusiasm among the electorate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I campaigned in support of the Nice treaty in my constituency, but was the only politician to do so. I do not want to be spoken about in derogatory terms by the Government in regard to this matter. The Taoiseach represents the same constituency and did not lift a finger and now the Minister of State knows the reason the referendum did not succeed.</P>
      <P>It is intended through this legislation to clear the way for the abortion referendum by eliminating any obstacles to ensure it is passed. I would like to tease out whether this is the correct approach. I am not happy with the way in which the Referendum Commission conducts its business, but I am equally unhappy with the proposal to virtually eliminate its role in order that it would merely provide a general explanation of the subject matter of a referendum, when it will be held and so on. That is not acceptable and a substantial provision should be put in place to address the matter. I am not sure it can be dealt with in this fashion.</P>
      <P>I also suspect there is a considerable question over the constitutionality of the legislation. Can the role of the commission be diluted to the extent proposed? The Minister has gone from one extreme to the other with the commission changing its role from fulfilling its duty to the letter of the law in making the case for both sides in a referendum to providing only a general description of the referendum proposal. That is not in keeping with the spirit or the letter of the McKenna judgment. The legislation will be struck down if it is passed in its current form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is bad form for a Parliament to propose legislation relating to a constitutional matter without providing sufficient time in both Houses to process it. The main recommendations of the all-party committee established to examine refer<Col N="1768" /> enda have been left out in the cold. It was recommended that there should be State funding for political parties to promote the arguments in a referendum and for lobby groups to allow them to pursue a campaign. That recommendation should have been examined in terms of incorporating it in legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been cobbled together with the intention of knocking the Referendum Commission out of the loop and reducing its role in order that the Government can plough ahead with a massive propaganda campaign to promote the abortion referendum before the general election because it cannot afford to lose a referendum in the run-up to it. This is bad legislation which has been introduced through a negative use of procedures and I will vote against it.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.

The legislation reflects the debate in the House on the issue earlier this year.</P>
      <P>I cannot be associated with Senator Costello's strong remarks about the Taoiseach. Everyone throughout the country knows the Taoiseach fully supported the previous referendum.</P>

      <P>I reiterate that there is an absence of Opposition Members for this important debate. I would welcome it if someone from the Opposition was present for my contribution.</P>
      <P>We all know the main reason for the low turnout at election time. Years ago election day was an event in Ireland, especially in rural Ireland. It is fair to say that the erection of posters and the activities which took place in every village and polling booth throughout the country, from Cork to Donegal to Clare to Westmeath, played a major part in creating the normal turnout of 65% to 80%.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is a rural Deputy from a part of the country accustomed to the participation of a large number of people in every parish in activities on behalf of political parties. His most senior departmental officials are in attendance and perhaps they could examine this in terms of getting people out to vote on election day. It is a complete non-event at present. One no longer knows where the polling booth is located. It appears the aim is to keep it a secret and all that needs to be done is to continue with the current practice and turnout will soon fall to 40% on election day. There is no atmosphere apart from people calling door to door. I understand even this is dying out because we are in the era of television canvassing.</P>
      <P>Not everyone has the opportunity to participate in television debates and, unless one moves in certain circles, one certainly will not be invited to participate. Taking all this into account and all the matters which may arise with the 1,000 or more candidates who could stand at a general election, it is unfair for a select few who have television contacts and are television friendly to be given a considerable advantage in being returned or elected. Will the Minister of State ensure this is examined and addressed before the next general election?</P>

      <Col N="1770" />Perhaps those of us who have been fortunate enough to be nominated after all these years, as Patrick Farrell, the poet, said, can have a level playing pitch and a fair opportunity to serve our country in the other House with all the experience we have gained in the Upper House. Perhaps one could enhance proceedings in the other House, if one was fortunate to be the choice of the people. I feel very strongly about this because the greatest honour any member of any team can be given is to be appointed captain. When an election is called, everyone should have an opportunity of being captain.</P>

      <P>I have always admired the Senator's role in politics. I would not like him to think I did not respect the traditions and importance of the House.</P>
      <P>The legislation is unique in that all the spokespersons of parties on the Oireachtas all-party committee which examined the Referendum Commission and published a report on it &ndash; Report No. 6 &ndash; were of one mind that the existing arrangements, whereby the commission is obliged to inform the public of arguments both for and against the proposal on which it is being asked to vote, were, in the words of the Fine Gael spokesperson in the other House, farcical. The comments and criticism on all sides in the other House and in the Seanad make it clear that the Oireachtas committee represents the views of Members in saying that this must be changed. It made proposals in this regard and they are contained in the Bill which has only one section of any substance. There cannot be a shorter Bill; it is the shortest one possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition parties have made the point that this is being rushed through and that they are suspicious that there must be some ulterior motive. I do not know why they would come to that conclusion. My party and I participated in the decision regarding the proposals in the Bill. I am not aware of any other motivation other than to implement the wishes of the Members who represented their fellow members on the Oireachtas Committee and to try to remove the ridiculous situation which obtained and which became so farcical, as was evident in the Nice ref<Col N="1771" /> erendum. That is the only motivation behind the proposal.</P>
    <P>According to Government announcements, several referendums will be held. It is the intention to hold a referendum on the Nice treaty, on which a forum has been set up. A referendum is due arising out of the recent Department of Health and Children legislation. If action is not taken now we could have a situation whereby the existing arrangements regarding referendums would have to come into effect. The referendum commission would have to be established and there would have to be advertisements arguing for and against the position. The Government did not expect an outcry because there was agreement across the political spectrum in both Houses.</P>
    <P>The Bill was published on Wednesday and all the spokespersons had the same amount of time to consider it. If one considers the number of times the issue has been discussed, it would be rather farfetched to claim the proposal has come out of the blue and that it is being rushed through. The subject matter of referendums was considerably reported on in the 1996 report of the review group on the Constitution, in the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution's first progress report published in 1997 and in the sixth progress report published last month. This House debated the Referendum Act in 1998 and Senator Quinn tabled a special motion in June 1999 to which I referred in my opening remarks. The Seanad highlighted in those debates the need for this change which the Government is facilitating.</P>
    <P>Senator Coogan referred to the new function being assigned to the referendum commission. Voting is the responsibility of every individual. If a Government Department became involved in placing notices asking the electorate to vote there could be claims that the Minister in charge was trying to influence voters to vote for his or her party. The commission could not be accused of being biased. It is an independent group and its independence has been accepted by all parties. It has acted very honourably and respectfully which has been referred to in all the discussions. The manner in which it undertook its duties given to it by this House has been commented on and complimented. In doing so it has performed a very important national duty. It is important that an independent group should have that responsibility which is one of the functions assigned to the commission. It can use the funds made available to it to help to disseminate the information and to give a general explanation but it will not be asked to put arguments for and against the proposal. It will be asked to make a general statement as outlined in the original 1998 Act.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello made some unusual references. He said we were changing the Supreme Court decision and diluting the role of the referendum commission which would be unconstitutional and that it would be challenged. He <Col N="1772" /> should read the McKenna judgment again because its main point is that the Government cannot expend public money advocating one side of an argument prior to a referendum. The Government will provide funding to the referendum commission to issue a general statement on the proposal. This is in line with the reference in the judgment that the electorate should be informed on the subject matter of the referendum. The political debate on the merits or otherwise of the referendum proposal will be a matter for the Government, political parties, politicians and groups interested in the referendum proposal.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening remarks, referendums are an exercise in direct democracy. They are important and the question as to how we conduct them and inform the electorate about them is crucial to their effectiveness and the operation of democracy. To a certain extent, we are working in different times. Political participation and voter turnout generally have been declining and referendums inevitably have not escaped that general trend. Reference was made to that fact in the contributions of Senators. It seems the electorate are less willing to inform themselves about proposals put before them. This, in turn, puts an onus on politicians to deliver the message and to examine, change, improve and re-examine, if necessary, how that same electorate are informed and motivated to register their opinion in referendums.</P>
    <P>This is a short Bill which seeks to correct what is generally accepted to be a weakness in the current arrangement by removing the function of a referendum commission to present arguments for and against a proposal. However, it also seeks to develop the commission's responsibilities by giving it the new remit to which I have referred as a promoter of participation. The Bill is not about rowing back on the McKenna judgment. That judgment is not a restraining factor on any party, Government or interest group engaging in robust campaigning in a referendum. It does, however, prevent the use of Government funds to promote one side of a referendum argument, which the Bill fully respects.</P>
    <P>While the Bill implements two of the recommendations in the all-party Oireachtas committee report, it does not provide for a scheme to dispense funds among the pro and anti sides of a referendum, as recommended in the report. I believe the House will accept that the introduction of such a scheme would require detailed examination of the statutory criteria for the allocation of the fund, who the recipients will be, the conditions which should be attached to the funding and arrange for the auditing of expenditure. If the Government brought a Bill to this House today which proposed the allocation of funding for referendums, Senators would have a legitimate complaint that it would need long and careful consideration. There will be time for such a debate if it is decided to try to find a way around the situation. Finding a way around this while <Col N="1773" /> meeting the constitutional requirements in the McKenna judgment and being seen by all sides to be fair is certainly a big challenge.</P>
    <P>The Bill as presented is necessary to eliminate the ridiculous and farcical situation which obtains under the current legislation. Any scheme will, of course, have to comply with the legal judgments which have been made. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Joe Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a <Col N="1774" /> Chathaoirligh. I am pleased to be here to debate the Horse Racing Ireland (Membership) Bill, 2001, which, essentially, proposes to amend the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001, in order to increase the number of ordinary members of the board of Horse Racing Ireland from 12 to 13.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001, was enacted in July last. It provided, among other matters, for the establishment of a new body, Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, to replace the Irish Horse Racing Authority and take over certain functions from the Racing Regulatory Body.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say that since the legislation was passed it has been widely welcomed across all sectors of the industry. However, one problem has arisen in relation to the detailed provisions of paragraph 16 of the Schedule to the Act relating to the composition of the board of HRI.</P>
      <P>Under the Act, the Racing Regulatory Body has five seats on the board of Horse Racing Ireland while the racecourses, racehorse owners, trainers, breeders, bookmakers, employees and the sector in Northern Ireland have one seat each. This composition was decided on to reflect fair representation for all major sectors in the industry which depend on horse racing for their livelihoods.</P>
      <P>The ICTU has been the nominating body for the representative of persons employed in the horse racing industry on the board of the Irish Horse Racing Authority since its establishment in 1994 and its nominee has served the industry very well during the years. However, I was anxious this time, especially in the light of representations made to me, to give an opportunity to those who work directly with horses but might not be affiliated to that organisation to serve on the board. Stable staff had not previously been represented on any of the decision-making fora in Irish racing and given their important and essential, although often forgotten, role in this business, I believed the time was right to give them such representation and appointed a representative of theirs to the HRI interim board.</P>
      <P>I have since received strong representations from the ICTU, MANDATE and SIPTU that a nominee of theirs should have been appointed to represent the persons employed in the industry on the basis that they represent the majority of employees in the sector. They have indicated that they are prepared to take legal action in pursuit of their case on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trade unions represent thousands of administrative, technical, official and professional staff directly employed in the horse racing industry whose work is fundamental to the success that Irish racing has achieved in recent years. I pay tribute again to their representative on the IHA who has served with dedication and made a tremendous contribution to the work of the board. In consideration of this and as a reflection of the value the Government places on partnership with trade unions I wish to accede to their request. However, I remain strongly of the view <Col N="1775" /> that there should be a place on the board for key people like stable staff who make a particularly unique contribution to the horse racing industry. We should give them a well deserved say in the future of Irish racing and I am satisfied the sector would be better off for it.</P>
    <P>In order to resolve this issue I propose to regard the ICTU as the nominating body for the persons employed in the industry. I propose to amend the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001, by increasing the number of board members by one to allow a representative of those employed directly in the horse racing industry, on this occasion stable staff, to be appointed to the board also. I am proposing that this should be done by direct ministerial appointment.</P>
    <P>We had a very useful debate on the Bill in the Dáil earlier today and also earlier this year in both in the Dáil and Seanad. As always on this subject, the statements and points made in the House were not only interesting but were constructive and furthermore showed a great depth of knowledge of and commitment to the future of Irish racing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes tabled an amendment seeking to have a place on the board for a representative of racegoers. I opposed the amendment for two main reasons. First, the greatest representation racegoers could get on the board would be one seat out of 14 or 15. In 1994, when the IHA was established, this did not satisfy either punters or racegoers clubs. Furthermore, HRI is required under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001, to establish and maintain a racegoers consultative forum to cater for the needs of those who would not have direct representation on the board. This will allow for a wide selection of the different groupings and views involved among racegoers to come together to debate issues of direct relevance to them and make recommendations on them. Under section 9(5) of the Act HRI is required to have regard to any opinions expressed by the forum. On that basis I expect that the interests of racegoers will be given wider and better overall representation in discussions on the matters which most affect them than if they had a seat on the board.</P>
    <P>Turning to the detailed provisions of the Bill, as it stands, the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001, provides for the appointment of a board consisting of a chairman and 12 ordinary members. The Bill proposes to increase the number of ordinary members of the board of Horse Racing Ireland from 12 to 13, with the additional member to be appointed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There are some other minor amendments. As the establishment day order for HRI has not yet been made, it is necessary, in order to give effect to these changes, to replace paragraph 16 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001, in its entirety. It contained all the amendments in the 2001 Act to the original Schedule of the Irish Horseracing Industry Act, 1994. The Bill is proposing to restate those amendments with pro<Col N="1776" /> vision this time for an extra board member and some further associated changes. However, most of the provisions of the Schedule to the 1994 Act, as amended by paragraph 16 of the 2001 Act, remain unchanged.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) of section 1 of the Bill increases the number of ordinary members of HRI from 12 to 13. The main changes consequential on the increase in board membership are contained in subparagraphs (1)(<i>c</i>), (<i>d</i>) and (<i>e</i>) of a new paragraph 7 to the 1994 Act Schedule to be inserted by subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) of section 1 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (1)(<i>c</i>) of the new paragraph 7 removes the nomination of the trade union's representative from the requirement that such nominee had to be elected in similar fashion to the other industry interests. The new provision will allow a nominee to be selected using a consultative process within the ICTU involving all the unions rather than an electoral one.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (1)(<i>d</i>) provides for the direct appointment by the Minister of one person from persons employed directly in the horse racing industry, thereby allowing employees such as stable staff, who play a key role in the industry, to be represented on HRI.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (1)(<i>e</i>) also removes the nomination of the representative of horse racing in Northern Ireland from the election requirement and provides that such member of HRI will be appointed directly by the Minister after consultation with horse racing interests in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are no other changes of substance. Subsections (1)(<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) of section 1 contain provisions which remain unchanged from the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001. Subsection (2) of section 1 repeals paragraph 16 of the Schedule to the Act of 2001. Subsection (3) of section 1 provides that subsection (1) shall come into operation &ndash; if Members are not confused at this stage, they have a tremendous degree of concentration &ndash; on the same establishment day as provided for in the 2001 Act in order that the provisions of that Act relating to the establishment of HRI and the Bill will come into effect at the same time. Subsection (4) of section 1 provides a definition and section 2 provides a short title for the Bill when enacted.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and echo what Senator Manning said with regard to the Bill, that we have no difficulty with it and know that everything is above board. When the Leader offered the opportunity to speak for ten or 12 minutes I was not quite sure whether we were going to use the proper parlance, whether this was a five furlong or a three miles and four furlong race. I, therefore, intend to try to keep it as a sprint if I can. I noted the rate at which the Minister went through his speech. If he <Col N="1777" /> was a horse, no doubt he would have come in first.</P>

      <P>I welcome the changes the Minister is providing for in the Bill to ensure there is representation as requested by the ICTU, MANDATE and SIPTU, for the basic and essential element of horse racing. I am glad that the Minister has acceded to their request, even if under pressure of threatened legal action by the trade unions.</P>
      <P>The people concerned are the unsung heroes. Having some knowledge about the work stable staff must do, their hours of work and the weather in which they must do it, I know they are extraordinary people who are dedicated to their sport and generally have a great affection and love for the horse. Otherwise one would not get anybody to do it, considering their rates of pay and the conditions under which they work, but for them to have a representative on the newly established board is worthwhile.</P>
      <P>I also echo what Deputy Dukes stated in the Lower House, that there should be a member on the board representing the ordinary citizen who likes to go racing. The racing industry would not survive without these ordinary punters who attend meetings like the Galway Races, which I highly recommend. People should go there and spend as much as they can.</P>

It is not politically correct to refer to housewives putting a pin on a name, but ladies who have no interest in racing for most of the year like to go to a course with good facilities where they can relax and not get soaked. It is great to see racecourses around the country improving their facilities to provide for those who are not as hardy as those of us who go on a bad day and back bad horses.</P>
      <P>I echo the Minister's praise for the IHRA's work over many years. We wish the new board well and hope to see it in its new headquarters in a few years and we look forward to a better industry at the end of this process. Ireland is at the forefront of the worldwide racing industry with its high quality horses and trainers. Horses are being kept at home which previously might have been exported because we could not afford to keep them. It is great to see us on that main stage, not merely challenging richer countries but coming out continuously as winners. I commend the Bill and thank the Minister.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Brian Kavanagh on being appointed chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland. His record in the Curragh racecourse is very good and he will bring fine qualities to bear in his new position. I also welcome the provision including stable staff on the board. It would not be inaccurate to say they are at the manure end of the business. They work long hours and, in the past, were not very well paid. Their pay is still modest by relative standards in other industries. They obviously do the job for the love of the game and for love of being with horses. Many of them are young people from towns like Newbridge, Kildare and other areas around the Curragh, where I live.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leader for reminding me. I could go on and mention Monasterevin and other places but I will resist the temptation. It is extraordinary that some of those young people will get out of bed very early in the morning at difficult times of the year to work very hard for long hours. They are a vital element in the industry and it is good to see that recognised by their proposed inclusion on the board. The nominating procedure for which the Minister has provided in the Bill is a reasonable and equitable way of achieving this.</P>
      <P>While it is desirable that people would become members by election, the practicalities involved make this impossible. It is an attractive proposition but its practical operation would prove very difficult. The type of model we have in other agricultural boards, such as the IFA sending a panel of names to the Minister for selection, is reasonable and quite democratic, as the organisations themselves are quite democratic. This is a sensible proposal, particularly in terms of the Northern Ireland nomination as the election there could make matters difficult. There may not be a great number of people involved and it is reasonable that the Minister would have the power of direct appointment following consultation with horseracing interests. That consultation is the important aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would address the adverse publicity, notably in <i>The Phoenix</i>, which has been carrying ongoing coverage of what it perceives as a row between the Turf Club and what was then the IHRA. There was a suggestion <Col N="1779" /> that the increase in the board's membership disturbed the balance of the agreement the Minister had reached with the Turf Club. I do not have a view one way or the other but perhaps the Minister will comment on it.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of issues regarding some small errors in the original Bill. We seemed to have a horseracing Bill on an annual basis which I welcomed but now it appears to be a six-monthly occurrence. I hope the Minister or whoever may succeed him in the current Administration will be back to introduce the next Bill.</P>

      <P>In keeping with the spirit that has settled on the House, I welcome the Minister. One must acknowledge the good the Minister has done for racing since taking office. His direction is recognised throughout the country and I commend him for that.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a welcome change and it is right to have stable boys and girls represented on the board. Trade unions have sought representation but that purpose is met, by and large. We support what the Minister is doing there.</P>
      <P>The Minister uses his good offices well, no matter what the challenge. Senator Dardis referred to Ireland's achievements in racing and RTÉ could devote more coverage to both horseracing and greyhound racing in Ireland. Some 1 million people go to the dogs during the year and approximately 1.5 million go to race meetings but many people at home, particularly the elderly, would enjoy seeing the events. The Minister should do what he can to get RTÉ to give more coverage to those sports.</P>
      <P>I wish the Cathaoirleach, the Minister and the staff a happy Christmas. We were here until 4 a.m. the other night and we will not do that now.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister the compliments of the season and congratulate him on his work in this and other fields during the year. I am pleased the Minister has been able to recognise the importance of maintaining links with the horse racing industry in Northern Ireland. There has never been a Border in any real sense as far as this group is concerned. These people have a contribution to make and it is important to keep <Col N="1780" /> them in the main stream. The Minister has proposed an appropriate method for securing that representation and it is right that he should consult with these interests and make his own appointment or nomination. This approach, for which I thank the Minister, will be very gratifying to my friends in the horse racing business in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and support the Bill. I agree with previous speakers as regards the acknowledgement of the sector proposed in the legislation. I commend the Minister and the Government for their work in creating a major tourism attraction and state-of-the-art facility at Kilbeggan racecourse. The midlands is the hidden Ireland as far as tourism is concerned. However, the planning, foresight, work and personal interest which the Minister has taken in Kilbeggan has brought a new brand of tourism to the midlands from April until October. This facility is a new experience for what had been a quiet area and has generated thousands of pounds for those involved in the tourism industry in the region.</P>
      <P>I also commend the Minister and the Department for their wonderful work regarding the foot and mouth disease which placed a massive burden on their shoulders. Hundreds of families acknowledged and prayed for the decisions made by the Minister and his special committee. These decisions protected the country which would have gone to rack and ruin if foot and mouth disease had taken hold.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Aidan O'Brien who is a wonderful example to young people thinking of becoming involved in a difficult, risky industry. He has become a national and international figure and is a great ambassador for the young, new Ireland.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Callanan's comments on better coverage and compliment TG4 on its decision to broadcast items of local interest. We all watched its coverage of the all-Ireland series and its programmes on past all-Ireland champions. The station is also doing good work regarding the GAA county and provincial championships and its broadcasts of rugby matches and other sports have been magnificent. It is now possible to view horse and dog racing on a Saturday night. A new deal has been agreed with a large organisation to enhance this coverage.</P>
      <P>I also thank the Minister for his assistance regarding Mullingar greyhound stadium which is a magnificent facility. Senator Coogan pointed out that one does not have to be interested in the sport to enjoy race meetings as one can visit the state-of-the-art restaurant and other facilities on offer. This is a family attraction and long may it continue. I congratulate all concerned.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and support this Bill. The main provision of the Bill concerns the nominees of the trade union movement and those who work in the industry, partic<Col N="1781" /> ularly the stable staff association which has been represented on the interim HRI.</P>
      <P>The commitment of those who work in stables is almost without equal. I came across proof of this almost 30 years ago when Black and Decker established operations on the edge of the Curragh. At that time those employed in stables in the area could earn about £50 per week, but Black and Decker was offering £150 per week. A number of stable workers took employment with Black and Decker, but within six months they had all returned to the industry they loved. This was concrete proof of their commitment to the horse racing industry.</P>
      <P>I salute the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, for their work in this area. There is great enthusiasm for the future in the thoroughbred county. The racing and bloodstock industries have never been as enthusiastic about the future as they are after four years of this Government and the major initiatives it has taken in this sector.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for his outstanding leadership during the foot and mouth disease crisis. We have seldom faced such a major challenge and rarely have we seen such effective, practical leadership as was shown by the Minister. As a practising farmer, though I do not get much opportunity to do so since becoming a Member of this House, I express personal appreciation to the Minister and the staff of the Department for their exceptional work on our behalf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Joe Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their constructive, positive and helpful contributions to this debate. It is fitting for Ireland that we have such a knowledgeable debate as the horse and greyhound racing industries are part of what we are. Every parish has experience of these industries. Many of those involved are relatively small operators, though those at the upper echelons might receive more publicity.</P>
      <P>A total of 1.35 million people attend horse racing meetings every year and one million attend greyhound racing meetings. Senator Maurice Hayes pointed out that there are no borders or boundaries in this industry. For quite a number of years I have been engaged with the RDS in Dublin and with Balmoral, Down Royal and Downpatrick in Northern Ireland, all of which are attended by people who love the sport and the industry.</P>
      <P>On the old IHRA I was happy to ensure that the industry in Northern Ireland was represented, as it will be on the new body. This will take place in consultation with the Department and the industry in Northern Ireland. The current representative is John Kidd who is chairman of the industry in Northern Ireland and he is an appropriate appointee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greyhound industry is represented by someone from Bord na gCon. The name of that body may have thrown a few people from time to time &ndash; the Irish Greyhound Board might have <Col N="1782" /> been a more suitable name. However, things have worked out well. People in Northern Ireland are also very interested in dogs.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what has been said about foot and mouth disease. The racing industry, the IRFU, the GAA and many voluntary bodies informed me that they would cease activities if I wanted them to do so. The racing industry put a stop to all activities and its members did not travel to Cheltenham.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

      <P>The Senator is 100% correct. I appreciate what has been done by those involved in the horse and greyhound industries. Many individuals gave up on disinfectant mats but they are still in place at the Curragh, Harold's Cross, Shelbourne Park and the RDS. There are no divisions among those involved in these industries.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to hear positive arguments being put forward in respect of stable staff. I have visited many racecourses over the years and I know that these people were neglected. On many occasions, they would leave Kildare early in the morning to travel to Listowel, Galway and other racecourses and be there on time. When they arrived, they would invariably be obliged to change their clothes in horse boxes. If they went to get a hot bowl of soup or something to eat, they would find that the restaurant was unfortunately occupied by people who believed themselves to be more important than stable staff or the people who handle horses. When the race they were attending was over, they had to return to the trainer's establishment and prepare a group of horses for the following day. Representatives of the stable staff have been appointed to the interim board at the new facility in Punchestown and also at Limerick. I am aware that the situation has been improved at the Curragh by the provision of a small canteen where people can get a hot bowl of soup or something to eat. Up to now, such facilities were not provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have introduced this technical amendment because the unions &ndash; SIPTU and MANDATE &ndash; and congress wanted a representative on the board of Horse Racing Ireland. Representations were made to me because they felt they were entitled to a place on the board, regardless of the fact that there was a representative of the lowest grade of worker in the industry on it. In the interests of partnership &ndash; which is the way Governments, in tandem with the unions, the workers and everyone else, have been operating for the past decade &ndash; and goodwill I <Col N="1783" /> acceded to their request to have a representative of congress on the board. That is the purpose of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan referred to racegoers, who keep the industry going and create an enjoyable atmosphere at race meetings. I have put in place a racegoers consultative forum, which is the appropriate way to give them a voice. HRI will be appointed in the very near future. I hope the people appointed to it will become the board of directors for the industry and that they will not take the approach that they will only speak for the sector they represent. That is the wrong way to proceed. The members of the board must take a more universal approach. Horseracing is a valuable industry and is responsible for promoting a positive image of Ireland overseas. I was at a race meeting at Belmont Park recently and it was great to see Irish horses performing so well there.</P>
      <P>Aidan O'Brien, who was mentioned by a number of speakers, has won 23 group one races which is a world record. He is recognised as a world-class practitioner in his particular field. There are few enough areas in which we have such performers. In greyhound racing, we have Paul Hennessy whose achievements are recognised across the globe.</P>
      <P>HRI should be given the opportunity to draw up development plans for the next five and ten years. When horses and dogs are finished racing they should be looked after properly. Animal welfare is extremely important and I have made that known to both bodies. I am sure action will be taken in this regard.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis referred to adverse publicity, to which I am almost immune at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would describe it as being a little unhelpful. Senator Callanan referred to RTÉ coverage, etc. General coverage of sport in Ireland is extremely good. However, coverage of horseracing is minimal. I often listen to races from Hungry Hill on the Beara Peninsula or, if I am at home, I watch them on Channel 4. RTÉ is not covering as many races as I would like it to cover. If the station showed a highlights programme at weekends, it would be a start. RTÉ must take account of the number of people who attend race meetings, the number employed in the industry and the fact that horseracing is an international sport.</P>
      <P>I recently welcomed Senator Hayes to University College Cork, which is situated in the real capital of Ireland. UCC is a beautiful institution and I know the Senator had an opportunity to view the tremendous gothic architecture of some of the buildings. He and I had a delightful discussion about black pudding.</P>

      <P>Senator Hayes blinded me with the science involved in the making of black pudding. I appreciate the Senator's contribution to the debate, particularly in view of the fact that this is an all-Ireland sport and industry.</P>
      <P>Senator Cassidy referred to Kilbeggan, which is unique in that only national hunt races are run there. I will tell Members a funny story about flat racing and national hunt racing. I launched a book recently on Martin Maloney who was a very good jockey. He began racing in 1939 and in 1951, when only 26 years of age, he was forced to retire when he was seriously injured. We should appreciate the great sacrifices made by jockeys who take their lives in their hands each time they ride and are sometimes badly injured. At the launch of the book, I was lauding Martin's prowess in the sport and noting the fact that on one occasion he was champion jockey in Ireland and only five wins short of being champion jockey in England. When one realises that he used to travel across the Irish Sea on the mail boat because there were no private jets or helicopters in those days, one can appreciate his marvellous achievement. However, what intrigued me was that he rode on in both flat and national hunt races.</P>
      <P>Members will be aware that a flat jockey weighs between eight stone seven pounds and eight stone 12 pounds, while a national hunt jockey weighs about 12 stone seven pounds. I asked him how he managed to cope and he said: &ldquo;The scales were a bit different in our day. We did not have digitalisation in those days.&rdquo; I informed him that I knew exactly what he was talking about because I used to be involved in the creamery business where the old scales were also employed. The needle on the scale used to wave around a little and in case a farmer's produce might tip the upper end of it, it was always turned sideways to give the creamery the advantage. I apologise if I have strayed somewhat from the substance of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, is the Minister in a position to inform me whether Kilbeggan is the only racecourse in Ireland at which a horse actually drowned or is it the case, as some people say, that it committed suicide?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am now going to stray down to Dingle. Senator Tom Fitzgerald informed me about certain happenings at the racecourse there. Races are held close to the seashore in Dingle. I do not know about drownings, but there have been a number of very interesting incidents there. Some of the activities there include getting rid of the excess polish used to disguise the markings on horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Kilbeggan is a wonderful racecourse facility where record national hunt meetings take place. <Col N="1785" /> The operation is crowned by the local directors who attract great sponsorship. I am glad the Senator mentioned Mullingar where a wonderful job has been done for greyhound racing. The track is a great centre for the sport and I understand that since its refurbishment it is outpacing all other tracks as regards the percentage increase in Tote takings and attendances. It goes to show that if such facilities are improved, a wider attendance will be attracted.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Fearghail made a constructive contribution, as would be expected from a Kildare-based Member. He commented on the experience of foot and mouth disease which, thankfully, was kept at bay. We were lucky because the one outbreak we had happened to be in a peninsula which could be contained there. If we had been unfortunate enough to experience an outbreak of foot and mouth in Tipperary or another central area of the country, it would have been far more difficult to contain the disease. Nonetheless, we were tried well enough with stray calves and various other matters in some parts of the country but, thank God, we escaped the worst effects.</P>
    <P>I much appreciate the constructive contributions of Senators and the seasonal spirit in which they were made. Senator Dardis mentioned our revisitation of horse and dog legislation every six or 12 months, but it is not my intention to revisit this particular Bill at any time in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Government, I wish you, a Chathaoirligh, and all the other Members of the House, and the staff of Seanad Éireann, a happy, holy, peaceful and accident-free Christmas. I hope they will enjoy good racing, either in Leopardstown or Limerick.</P>

      <P>Earlier in the debate, I did not mention Vincent or Val O'Brien because I thought that if they were not in the House I was not allowed to do so. I wish to mention them, however, and others who have given the racing industry some great times.</P>
      <P>As I do not want anybody to think that I am churlish, I also wish to commend the role played by the Minister and his staff in preventing the spread of foot and mouth disease. I have an abiding memory of one Saturday when, at 6.45 a.m., the Minister was heading back to work after a meeting with me. He told me he would be doing the same thing the following day also. His dedication is to be highly recommended.</P>

      <P>The issue of sewage treatment at the Curragh might appear to some to be a purely local matter. The major controversy that surrounded the design of the Kildare town bypass and its possible impact on the Curragh aquifer, however, has raised the Curragh's environment to national prominence in recent times. The system that currently serves the Curragh Camp is antiquated and typical of what one might expect to find in a Third World country. This out of date, trickling filter system, which has a heavy dependency on evaporation, taken together with the proliferation of septic tanks in the area stretching from the Curragh Camp to Cutbush and Suncroft, represents a real and unacceptable threat to the Curragh aquifer. There has been a stony silence on this matter from many of those who campaigned so vociferously on the issue of the Curragh aquifer and its relationship with Pollardstown Fen and the controversy over the famous snails which caused a delay in the construction of the Kildare bypass.</P>
      <P>The current combined population figure, based on the 1996 census, for the Curragh Camp, Brownstown, Cutbush, Maddenstown and Suncroft areas is 5,872 with a projected population for the year 2020 well in excess of 7,000. We have seen an unprecedented level of investment by the Minister for Defence in Army installations in the Curragh Camp, which I welcome. I am additionally pleased that the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, is willing to make a substantial financial contribution towards the costs of the proposed new sewerage works at this location. Having campaigned on this issue for more than a decade as a local representative, I would be pleased to hear some positive news of progress from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ó Fearghail for having raised this matter on the Adjournment. The provision of modern environmental infrastructure to support economic objectives has been a major focus of Government investment over the past four and a half years. Total planned spending on water services infrastructure over the period of the current national development plan amounts to almost &euro;4.4 billion. This investment is aimed at supporting economic and social development, employment creation and the achievement of high environmental standards. In the first year of the NDP alone, the increase produced in wastewater treatment capacity was sufficient to meet the needs of a population equivalent to 180,000 people, almost half the total increase for the entire 1994 to 1999 period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The water services investment programme, 2000-02, is the first phase of a rolling programme <Col N="1788" /> to give effect to planned spending on water services under the national development plan up to 2006. Funding is being provided for new water scheme projects in every county. The total investment proposed for County Kildare under the first phase of the programme amounts to almost &euro;80 million in respect of 20 schemes around the county. Among the more significant schemes are Osberstown and Leixlip sewerage schemes, both of which were completed in the first year of the programme. The next stage of the upper Liffey valley sewerage scheme is currently going through planning.</P>
    <P>Other smaller but nonetheless important projects included in the programme are Castledermot water and sewerage schemes and the sewerage schemes at Monasterevin and Allenwood. These are being progressed under the rural towns and villages initiative. Also approved to proceed through planning is the south Kildare water supply scheme. A further eight serviced land initiative schemes have also been approved to ensure that new housing can be made available in the areas of greatest demand.</P>
    <P>The current water services investment programme for County Kildare, announced in July 2000, took into account the list of water and sewerage schemes adopted as priorities by Kildare County Council. Like other councils, Kildare County Council was asked at the time by the Department of the Environment and Local Government to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital water services works in its areas and to prioritise its proposals on the basis of the assessments. The upgrading and expansion of the sewerage network and the provision of a new treatment plant to service the Curragh Camp and the villages of Brownstown, Suncroft and Cutbush was included in the Kildare needs assessment and estimated at the time to cost approximately &euro;3.8 million. It was, however, described as a scheme with a 2005 horizon in accordance with the objectives of the county development plan.</P>
    <P>Given the timescales envisaged for the schemes by the council, the fact that it was then at an early stage of planning and having regard to the level of competing national demands and funding available, it was not possible to include it in the programme last year. In the meantime, a revised proposal including details of possible joint funding arrangements between Kildare County Council and the Department of Defence for the Curragh element of the scheme has been received by the Department from the council.</P>
    <P>The current programme of schemes announced for Kildare is only the first phase of the investment strategy that will be progressively rolled forward up to the end of the NDP in 2006. The Curragh, Brownstown, Cutbush and Suncroft scheme will be considered in the context of the next phase of the programme in light of prevailing priorities identified by the council at that time. The Senator can be assured that the points he made this evening will also be taken into account at that stage.</P>

The waiting list for the Mews Clinic in January this year was six but there are now 18 people on the list. The waiting list in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area was 390 in January and it has now increased to 529. We seem to be going backwards.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan, trumpeted the new national drugs programme which was to be delivered on a local and regional basis. It was to be decentralised in terms of delivery. The purpose of establishing local clinics was that each area would take care of its local population of drug addicts. That policy does not appear to be working. When I contact the Department of Health and Children, I am told there are no waiting lists but I have now received the official figures which indicate that not only are there waiting lists, but that they are growing &ndash; they have trebled in the case of my local clinic &ndash; in the space of 12 months.</P>
      <P>This case involves a young man waiting to detox. He has made the decision and is committed to it. A heroin addict cannot wait forever because they go back to drugs very quickly. This young man has reduced his intake, although he is still an illegal consumer of heroin. He is now trying to get on a programme which will assist him to get off heroin. He is trying to get a job and build a stable life with a companion. However, when he presents himself at the clinic, he is told that the waiting list has trebled and that the length of time he must be living in the locality has doubled from six to 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are supposed to be getting to grips with the biggest drug problem, heroin, in the country and particularly in Dublin where the problem is mainly concentrated. I do not know what is happening. I thought the resources, personnel and programmes had been put in place. I am a member of the local drugs task force where I raise the issue of the lengthening queues at every meeting. All I hear is the Minister clapping himself on the back for his wonderful strategy. He claims treatment is now provided on a community basis and that the community is participating in its implementation. However, although that is useful in terms of capital expenditure on the provision of youth facilities, it is not doing anything at the coal face, where people who are anxious to kick the habit and to leave the illegal activity in which they are engaged are prevented from doing so. I <Col N="1790" /> would have expected the Department to be desperately inviting people to participate on a programme and to be overjoyed to encounter somebody who is prepared to commit themselves to it, rather than closing the door and shunning them. He is told to return in another six months but at that time he might be told there will be a further six month wait.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that the situation appears to have deteriorated despite all the tragedies that have happened. Yesterday, I was in Buckingham Street for the switching on of the Christmas lights for the people in the area who have died from drug abuse. Nearly 200 young people from that little locality, many of whom I knew to be fine young people, got into the drugs habit and died extremely young as a result. We still have not learned the lesson that we must provide a decent treatment service for them.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State's reply will allow me to assure this young man that he will be received into a detoxification and maintenance programme and that it will provide hope for the hundreds more people who are waiting to get onto such programmes.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Costello for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to explain the position in relation to drug treatment services.</P>
      <P>The provision of drug treatment is the statutory responsibility of the health boards but the person the Senator refers to has been on the waiting list for methadone maintenance treatment since 1 August this year. He is currently eighth on the list and it is expected that the first three on this waiting list will be offered treatment places shortly. Normal procedures for acceptance onto a treatment programme at a clinic are that the individual requesting treatment must reside in the catchment area of the treatment clinic for at least one year. I understand that in this case the person concerned has not yet produced evidence that he has lived in the area for this period of time, despite requests to provide this information.</P>
      <P>The overall objective of the Government's strategy in relation to drug misuse is to reduce significantly the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research. With regard to treatment, the objective is to provide a range of options to encourage and enable drug misusers to avail of treatment with the aim of reducing dependency and improving overall health and social well-being, with the ultimate aim of leading a drug free lifestyle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national drugs strategy, 2001 to 2008, published in May 2001 by the Taoiseach, is the result of a comprehensive review initiated by my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for the strategy, Deputy Eoin Ryan. The strategy has been developed around the four pillars of supply, prevention, treatment, including rehabilitation and <Col N="1791" /> risk reduction, and research. This approach incorporates, more or less, the full range of activities which are the hallmarks of modern drug strategies in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>The strategy provides that there should be 6,000 people on methadone treatment by the end of 2001. At the end of November there were 5,888 people receiving methadone nationally. Of this number, 5,435 were receiving treatment in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area. This shows an increase since the beginning of the year when there was a total of 5,084 people in treatment nationally, with 4,961 of those in the eastern region.</P>
    <P>In September 2001 there were 529 people waiting for treatment. This figure represents a decrease on the previous month when the list was at 561. Figures for the Mews Clinic also show a decrease, with ten people awaiting treatment in September compared with 16 in August. Another target of the national drugs strategy is that drug misusers have immediate access to professional assessment and counselling, followed by commencement of treatment as deemed appropriate not later than one month after assessment. Ideally, we would wish to see a situation where there was no waiting lists, but our ability to expand services are constrained.</P>
    <P>The methadone protocol was introduced in October 1998. Since that time 169 general prac<Col N="1792" /> titioners and 241 pharmacists have joined the scheme. The participation of these professionals is crucial to the successful operation of the scheme. However, the number of new general practitioners and pharmacists coming into the scheme is very low. That makes it difficult to transfer stable patients from clinics to general practice, thus freeing up spaces in the clinics. Health board officials are working with the Irish College of General Practitioners to explore ways of encouraging GPs to become more involved in methadone treatment. The difficulties which the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards experience in gaining acceptance for the provision of local drug services are well known and, in some instances, are severely limiting the capacity to respond to actual need in these areas.</P>
    <P>Health boards will continue to work to develop effective responses to the problem and, through regular monitoring of the overall implementation of the strategy, I am confident that the actions undertaken will have a positive impact on the health and well-being of all the population, but particularly on those misusing drugs.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to wish everyone, including Senators and staff, season's greetings.</P>
