    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No.1, referral motion regarding the Standards in Public Office Act, 2001, to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, to be taken without debate; No. 2, Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes and on which Senators may share time; No. 22, motion No. 20, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and business, if not previously concluded, will resume thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, when will we see the amendments to the Pensions (Amendment) Bill and publication of its second half? Is it possible to allow a short debate on No. 1? It is a welcome development. We particularly welcome the fact that a former senior politician is now a member of the Standards in Public Office Commission, which, the Leader might remember, was originally a suggestion of the House. I am happy that Mr. Liam Kavanagh was chosen. A short debate on the matter would be a good idea.</P>
      <P>The main issue I wish to raise &ndash; I am conscious of what the Cathaoirleach might say &ndash; is the matter of the High Court judgment and whether it is <i>sub judice.</i> Standing Orders state clearly that it is possible to debate a matter so long as it is related to public policy, will not be referred to a jury, and is raised in a manner which does not encroach on the courts' functions. Last week's High Court judgment has thrown the working of our committee system into chaos and we are uncertain about the rights of committees and how they may function. There are other serious questions about the rights of Parliament and our procedures. The latter can be sorted out and, if wrong, can be put right, but there are other more serious questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current general debate would be assisted if time was made available to debate the matter <Col N="942" /> in the House. We have a right to reflect on it and express our views, as is happening in every other medium in the State. I wrote to the Leader on Monday about it, and if he cannot make time available today, I hope he may do so tomorrow or soon after in order that we can, in a calm, reflective manner, make our contribution to the debate on the most serious High Court decision affecting Parliament since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The House may remember that about one week ago I raised the matter of people queuing for work permit stamps from increasingly early times, 4 a.m. or 5 a.m., for example. Since then it has been drawn to my attention that there is the same problem for the many thousands of foreign students in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick. They, too, must queue. This causes much aggravation in universities and for the students who pay a higher fee than Irish students. While here, they do good work, in the medical field, for example, and it is insulting for them to be treated thus. The universities informed me that students might queue from 5 a.m. only for them not to be taken on that day. They are then forced to return, resulting in their missing two or three academic days. May we have a debate on this matter, or would the Leader of the House use his good offices with the Minister?</P>
      <P>May we have a debate on our involvement in the war in Afghanistan? Military aircraft pass through Shannon Airport with increasing frequency, as reported on Joe Duffy's radio show. How comfortable are we with this? A debate would enable us to make the point again to the Minister that there should be guarantees given, particularly in the light of their behaviour in Afghanistan where they appear to have bombed a prison killing several hundred people. That certainly is a way to put out a riot, but it is not a humane way.</P>
      <P>Then there is the question of the violations of the Hague and Geneva conventions by the Americans. As far as one can see, Mr. Rumsfeld has given an order to take no prisoners. This could not be a clearer violation of both the Hague and the Geneva conventions. If we are implicit in it, we ought to raise these moral questions and I hope we may do so. As friends of the Americans perhaps we could advise them it is not a good idea to use closed military tribunals.</P>

      <P>Thank you, Senator Norris. I think you have made the case for a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to pass on congratulations to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, on the compulsory acquisition of two Georgian houses in Henrietta Street. It is a very important development. The landlords were people who created devastation in Dublin. I sued them in one <Col N="943" /> case because the corporation proved incapable of doing it. As the Leader knows the area very well, he might communicate my congratulations to the Minister and ask him to take the remaining house in North Great George's Street, which I did not get around to doing. As I do not want to spend any more of my own money on it, perhaps he will arrange for that to be compulsorily acquired as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the call by Senator Manning for a debate on the High Court judgment in relation to the Abbeylara affair, which of course has much wider implications for the role of this House and the other House. There is a window of opportunity in that no appeal has been made to the Supreme Court. I understand that will be made next week. In any case, there are serious matters of public policy that can be discussed. It is appropriate for us to discuss these matters prior to further action being taken because they may significantly impact on how the work of this House and the Dáil proceeds. In recent months we have been very effectively expanding the roles of the sub-committees. If all that work is to now be undone by one decision of the High Court and we cannot proceed, it will have a very serious impact on how the Oireachtas can develop.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Norris in calling for a debate on Afghanistan. Now that the war is coming to a close, it is very important that we win the peace. This can only be done by having proper principles underlying whatever political structure is put in place. We should have a discussion to ensure atrocities that took place under the previous regime do not take place under whatever forthcoming regime may be established.</P>
      <P>I again ask for the Minister for Finance to come into the House for a pre-budget discussion on the economy. Already we have heard the announcement that 200,000 poorer families will lose the medical card because of a downturn in the economy and other proposed health measures. These are the important issues to be discussed. The poor did poorly while the Celtic tiger was doing very well. Now it seems they will continue to do poorly when things&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>These are points that can be made in the debate the Senator is seeking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the general concerns expressed by Senators Manning and Costello with regard to the High Court decision on the Abbeylara sub-committee. I am aware that we should not go into the detail of that and I understand the decision is to be appealed to the Supreme Court. I am sure the Leader can clarify that particular aspect of it. There are wider issues, to which Senator Manning referred, with regard to the rights and role of Parliament within our <Col N="944" /> democracy and also the right of Parliament to set up investigations. While it may be the case that the Abbeylara sub-committee may be struck down or may on appeal be upheld, nevertheless there are issues surrounding that decision which would be appropriate to discuss, either immediately or after the Supreme Court has made its decision when the appeal takes place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to refer the Minister for Health and Children to the glaring gaps in the health strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week a debate was sought and the Leader indicated he would give consideration to such a debate. That would be a more appropriate time at which to discuss the detail of the health strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, but it might help if the Leader pointed out these glaring omissions to the Minister so he can deal with them. I refer particularly to the screening programmes for breast and cervical cancer. We are all concerned about preventative measures and the best use of resources. Surely the best way to use scarce resources is to introduce programmes which prevent loss of life and which aim to prevent illnesses in the first place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Leader to arrange for an early debate on Northern Ireland. There have been many significant developments recently which need to be addressed. The Pat Finucane case, for example, is urgent and the family is now seeking a public inquiry. That is important to the family following the collapse of the murder trial. It is also important to sustain confidence in the judicial system. While we have had debates on Northern Ireland in the past, it is timely and appropriate to have one now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move an amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 13 be taken before No. 1. The Mental Health Act was one of the most important Bills to go through the Houses last year &ndash; it was passed by the House in July this year. During an Adjournment debate last week I asked what progress had been made on the Bill and I found out that the agencies which will form the commission have not yet been contacted. The 1981 Bill on the same subject was not implemented and I am concerned that may happen with this Bill. Some of the topics we addressed in the Mental Health Bill are not due to come into force under the health strategy until 2008. My Bill seeks to insert a date, namely, 7 April 2002, by which the Minister should make orders to implement the Mental Health Act. I <Col N="945" /> chose that date because it is world health day and last year the focus was on mental health. I ask for leave to have the Bill printed. I am not asking for a discussion on or commitments in relation to the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, the urgent need for a debate on the city's transport problems, particularly the absence of park and ride facilities for people who travel by car into the city. The queues are getting longer and people must get up earlier to drive into the city. If park and ride facilities were provided, people would avail of them. Because such facilities are not available and because of work on the Dublin Port tunnel, trains to and from Drogheda and Dundalk are overcrowded. People have to stand on these trains and the crush in Pearse Street every evening is shameful and unacceptable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, I have raised on a number of occasions in recent weeks the need to invite the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to the House to explain in more detail his excellent initiative, CLÁR, to help regenerate areas of social and economic disadvantage in selected environments around the country. While reiterating my call for that debate, I ask the Leader to expand it to include all those agencies which currently operate in the west. It has come to my attention that one of these agencies, in particular, is acting against the best interests of local and voluntary communities operating in the areas it was established to help. The amount of red tape and bureaucracy it is employing would do justice to even the most hard-hearted of banks.</P>
      <P>I never thought I would have to say it, but the banks are proving to be much more amenable, as are other State agencies involved in a variety of voluntary projects. As all these voluntary groups expect, the banks and other State agencies have taken a leap of faith in order to have projects completed. I am afraid the problem with one of these agencies, which I will not name, which was established specifically to help&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the latitude. I might have made the case more emphatically than I had intended, but I feel so angry about this. Here is an agency which was established specifically to <Col N="946" /> help the west and it is actually proving to be inimical to the best interests of those working towards improving infrastructure and social disadvantage there. I appreciate that time is at a premium before Christmas, but I ask the Leader to consider not only inviting the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, on the CLÁR initiative, but using it as an opportunity for the Minister of State and all sides of the House to expand on the role and future viability of some of the agencies established under this well worn cliché of trying to save the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator Henry. I ask the Leader of the House to reconsider the reply he gave me last week on the debate in the House on the health strategy. It is quite clear from what the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has stated that he intends to move quickly on the proposals contained in the strategy. It is not acceptable that this House should have to wait until next February to give its views on the strategy. We should do so as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>On a related matter, the Deloitte &amp; Touche report on the health boards, which seems to have been published and then withdrawn with great speed this week, should be laid before the Houses as soon as possible. I ask the Leader of the House to ask the Minister for Health and Children to publish this very important report as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I also ask that the Minister for Health and Children give a response as soon as possible on the issue of human cloning in the light of the news which has come to us from the United States this week of breakthroughs there, particularly on the fact that there is no legal or statutory inhibition to such cloning in Ireland should the technology become available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>A few months ago I congratulated the Government on its allocation of £85 million for Cork Airport. There has been a misunderstanding or the impression has been given that it is now not forthcoming from the Minister. The Minister is saying one thing and the board of Aer Rianta is saying something else. Priority seems to be given to Dublin Airport. It is sad to think that while the plans for Cork Airport were given the go-ahead, the impression of the board is that this is not the case. Can we seek clarification from the Minister? Senator O'Dowd raised another question relevant to the same Minister. Perhaps both questions could be answered at the same time if the Minister was available to speak to the House on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the dispute between beet farmers and Greencore which has been ongoing for three weeks. I wish the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy <Col N="947" /> Harney, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, every success in trying to bring about a solution to the dispute and also commend the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, for the efforts he has made to date.</P>
      <P>Greencore is being very unfair, not only to beet farmers, but to all farmers. The prices of commodities one buys from Greencore have increased in the past year by about 25% and still the company cannot see its way to give a paltry 3.5% increase to beet farmers.</P>
      <P>Farmers are also treated unjustly when they must take action. Their strike record is very weak. When they do take strike action, they are hauled before the courts while other sections of the community such as train drivers, who were represented by the ILDA which was not even a recognised trade union, can hold the country to ransom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I requested the Leader four times to allow us to have a debate on the livestock industry &ndash; this is the fifth time. Senator Rory Kiely and I, of course, are elected to the agricultural panel. I would be delighted to broaden that debate to include the sugar industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that will happen next week. I support the call by Senator Costello for a debate on Afghanistan. It is very important to have such a debate as the shape of post-Taliban Afghanistan comes sharply into focus. It is vital that what happens now does not resemble what happened ten years ago when the Russian's withdrew leaving chaos behind them. The world turned its back resulting in a Taliban Afghanistan. We are a member of one of the world's great economic blocks, the European Union, which, with the United States and others, will have a major role to play in the reconstruction of that country. A debate in this House would be a timely way to influence policy in the context of our membership of the EU as what happened ten years ago cannot be allowed to happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also support the call for a pre-budget debate <Col N="948" /> on the economy. Those who saw the figures issued today by the Central Statistics Office on GDP growth in the first two quarters of this year will have been surprised at how flat economic performance has become. The extent to which profits by overseas companies are now being repatriated is obviously having an effect on employment. I realise that this House does not have power over the public purse, but great contributions have been made here on budgetary matters and that aspect of the running of the country. In light of recent events, it is a great idea to bring the Minister of Finance to the House to listen to a debate on the economy. I hope that can be organised before the budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding Senator Connor's mention of Afghanistan, there will be a meeting of the Sub-Committee on Development Co-operation of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs at 4 p.m. today. At that meeting the chief executive of UNICEF will attend to discuss the matter of children's rights in Afghanistan. Oxfam Ireland will discuss the matter also. We invite anybody who has an interest in the operation of aid or development in the wake of 11 September to attend.</P>
      <P>During Lent this year Trócaire ran a major programme to alert the world to the issue of slavery, particularly child slavery. The World Cup, the world's biggest sporting event, will take place shortly &ndash; the draws will take place this weekend. One of the problems many parents have, in common with many concerned people, is that of the origin of the kits used by national and international teams. It is absolutely true that 90% of the jerseys, the boots and the rest of the gear for which parents pay a huge amount is manufactured by slave labour in Asia. It is time to ask the Leader to have a debate on the matter before the World Cup and before the contracts are signed for the jerseys and badges. There is a rip-off when teams change their kits. Slavery is involved in the supply of those jerseys and boots. I might as well mention the bodies involved such as Adidas, Nike and all these sporting organisations&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should have an urgent debate on the matter which is of international concern.</P>
      <P>On many occasions I have asked for a debate on the present circumstances in Palestine and I keep asking. Today is the international day of solidarity with the people of Palestine and I ask, as a matter of urgency, that the Leader request the Minster for Foreign Affairs to continue his great efforts to resolve the problems in the Middle East. We offer the people of Palestine and the Middle East every good wish and hope the latest initiative by the United Nations succeeds.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Mooney's proposal for a discussion on the advancement and progress of the CLÁR programme and the need to discuss the co-ordination of the different agencies, especially in the regions affected, in order that there is effective and good use of the moneys and facilities within the programme for the benefit of the people.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister for Public Enterprise outline progress on the provision of fibre optic and broadband services throughout the regions? We have seen many items in newspapers relating to contracts being offered. It would be in the interests of the House and the regions to see how matters are advancing in this area. I would appreciate that opportunity being given to Senators.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support Senator Mooney's call for a debate on the CLÁR programme. May we also have a debate on a progress report on and funding for the Border, midlands and western, BMW, region, which the Leader has promised on a number of occasions? It is high time in the light of the slowdown in the economy that he held an urgent debate on the funding for the BMW region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support Senator Mooney's call for the Minister of State with responsibility for rural development to come to the House to discuss the CLÁR programme. When the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, was in the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands he did a tremendous job and rejuvenated the offshore islands. It began on a small scale and developed into something substantial. The Minister of State was in County Donegal on Friday last discussing the CLÁR programme. It would be of benefit to the House if he were to attend a debate on it here. He has visions for the programme which could be of tremendous help in bringing life back to depopulated areas. If we must rely on other Departments, such areas will never be brought back to life.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Ó Murchú's call for a debate on Northern Ireland. As with the Pat Finucane case, I am most anxious to hear from the Minister what developments are taking place in the Robert Hamill case, which is similar. I would appreciate if the Minister could come to the House to outline the up-to-date position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the points made by Senator Bonner, especially regarding the two cases he mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constitutional review committee has done very good work. Will the Leader consider having a debate in the House on the defined role within <Col N="950" /> the Constitution of the Executive and the Judiciary? I raise this matter not in any reference to the recent case mentioned in the House, but because in the past two years there has been a steady intrusion into policy from decisions of the courts. If this continues, it will create difficulties for both sides. It might be opportune to have a debate in order that the issue is discussed and redefined to avoid the possibility I mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning and Ross inquired about the Pensions (Amendment) Bill which I understand will be taken next week.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning sought time for No. 1 and congratulated the long-standing former Member of the Oireachtas, Liam Kavanagh, on being appointed. I join the Senator in wishing him well. It is wonderful to see him as a member of the commission given the experience and knowledge he has gained during the years. If we need an hour to discuss No. 1 when it comes back from committee, we could do so next week.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, Costello and Dardis mentioned the effects of last Friday's High Court decision on the challenge to the powers and procedures of the Oireachtas sub-committee considering the Garda report on the fatal shooting of Mr. John Carty in Abbeylara. Effectively, this means the sub-committee cannot continue on the course upon which it had embarked. The decision of the High Court is being appealed to the Supreme Court and the outcome of that appeal will have significance not only for the work of the sub-committee but also for the committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas in general.</P>
      <P>In a statement yesterday, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made it clear that, in the event that the sub-committee cannot proceed with its work on legal grounds, he is prepared to recommend to the Houses of the Oireachtas that Mr. Carty's death be the subject of a public inquiry under the Tribunal of Inquiries Act. With that reassurance in mind, however, we must await the outcome of the appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>Senators Norris, Costello, Connor and Lanigan called for a debate on Afghanistan, and I will certainly leave time for that. The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs will meet today at 4 p.m. and Senators who are members of that committee should avail of the opportunity to attend it.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello, Keogh and O'Meara expressed various opinions on the new health strategy. I welcome the strategy which is a positive move. Some £10 billion will be invested in the health services in the coming years, which must be welcomed. No matter what Government will be in office, the implementation of this plan is something to which we can look forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the items pointed out by Senator Costello, his party leader held the Finance portfolio in the previous Administration, for the first time. The current president of the Labour Party, Deputy De Rossa, allocated only £1.50 to old age pensioners at a time of economic boom. The <Col N="951" /> Celtic tiger was created, and handed over to the rainbow coalition Government, by the majority party in power in the present Administration, Fianna Fáil.</P>

I spoke to Senator Henry before the Order of Business about this matter and I will inform the House about it tomorrow morning. I would ask Senator Henry to raise the matter again on the Order of Business tomorrow morning. Personally, I have no objection to the matter being discussed and I will come back to it tomorrow, if that is acceptable to Senators.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Dowd called on the Minster for Public Enterprise to attend the House to provide an update on the new transport strategy, including the millions that are being spent under the national development plan. I will have time allowed to debate this matter at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
      <P>If Senators are serious about debating the matters they have raised, between now and 19 December, however, the House will have to consider sitting on 20 and 21 December to facilitate the genuine requests for debates on various matters.</P>

The plan is not just for the west, and I accept Senator Mooney's point about agencies. In the years ahead, there will be a major <Col N="952" /> depopulation problem in the midlands, so calls for such a debate should include the BMW area.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara called for a debate on cloning. I think everyone in the House would like to see the Government bring in a Bill immediately as a matter of urgency. If the Government wants to initiate it in this House we will afford it the opportunity before Christmas. I commend the British Government for bringining in legislation in its jurisdiction and I hope we will follow suit here immediately.</P>
      <P>Senator Dino Cregan, who as I have said previously is a Senator of long standing, raised the right of Cork Airport to have its fair and just allocation.

Hopefully they will get a just reward for their endeavours.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor asked for a debate on the livestock industry. As I said last week, I can have time allowed for such a debate. On the question of a debate on the economy, the budget will be announced to the nation on 5 December. I propose the House should have a sos as usual during the budget. Perhaps we can then discuss with the leaders and the Whips when time can be allocated to discuss the merits of the budget.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan asked me to convey his strong views to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Government in regard to the manufacture of international label products, in view of the forthcoming World Cup.

He did not answer that question. He said it would be taken next week. As the Leader is aware, this is major legislation. Half of the Bill is being published for the first time. There is no way this side of the House will agree to take it next week if it appears on Monday and has about 28 or 30 new sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader totally misunderstood what I said about a debate on the constitutional position arising from the High Court decision.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.</P>
      <P>There can be a temptation when introducing new legislation to use words such as &ldquo;ground breaking&rdquo;, &ldquo;innovative&rdquo; or even &ldquo;radical&rdquo; to describe the proposals in a Bill. I have done so in relation to some of the many Bills which I have brought before this House since I became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Be that as it may, I do not think that it would be a great exaggeration to use any of these words to describe the Bill we are debating here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It could be described as ground breaking in that it does away with legal concepts which, though they have been with us for a long time, have served their time and are, perhaps, less relevant to today's world. It could be considered <Col N="956" /> innovative when one looks at its provisions dealing with making a gain or causing a loss by deception or the provision dealing with unlawful use of a computer. The Bill is certainly radical in those areas concerning criminal procedure.</P>
    <P>This Bill will be seen as a major advance in tackling crimes of dishonesty and fraud. It sweeps away a large amount of common law and statutory offences which often, because of the peculiar definitions applied to such offences, caused confusion or, at worst, did not adequately address the problems encountered and replaces them with a modern code designed to meet current needs in this area.</P>
    <P>The Bill follows on a number of examinations of the law relating to dishonesty which recommended significant changes. These are the Law Reform Commission report on the law relating to dishonesty and the report of the Government advisory committee on fraud.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission recommended that the law relating to fraud and dishonesty should be consolidated in a single Act and that it should also include new offences to cover situations not covered at present. Its aim was to simplify and modernise the law in this area. The need for such simplification is quite evident when one considers the large number of offences dealing with theft and dishonesty in the Larceny Acts. Not least of the problems at present is the definition of larceny which requires that the thing stolen should be carried away and that at the time of stealing the person should have the intention to permanently deprive the owner of it. This can be difficult to prove and may be inconsistent with certain behaviour which should properly be classed as stealing. The Bill before the House will eliminate such inconsistencies.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the Bill is also based on the recommendations of the advisory committee on fraud, whose chairman was Mr. Peter Maguire, SC. Among the recommendations in that report were reform of the substantive law on fraud as well as powers of investigation and related matters. These matters are covered in the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the Bill is a comprehensive measure aimed at all forms of dishonesty and fraud. There will be no hiding place from its provisions. It targets both small time dishonesty, which should nevertheless be punished appropriately, and large scale fraud and will render the real culprits liable for their crimes. I would mention in this regard section 58 of the Bill which deals with a situation where an offence is committed by a company with the consent or connivance of, for example, a director or manager of the company. In those circumstances the person as well as the company will be guilty of an offence. Assistance in detecting and investigating such offences is provided for in section 59 which requires certain persons such as auditors to report <Col N="957" /> to the Garda matters which indicate that the company or those responsible for its operation may have committed an offence under the Bill. Further assistance in the investigation of offences of dishonesty and changes in trial procedure will tighten the net around those engaged in these forms of crime. I will outline these in more detail shortly.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the primary aim of the Bill is to consolidate the law relating to dishonesty and to make it reflect present day realities. Such reform is necessary even at a time when crime rates are falling as was evident from the most recent annual report of the Garda Síochána. I expect this trend to continue. This reduction is the result of the Government's commitment to investment in the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>That investment is clearly evident in a number of related areas. Under the programme for Government there is a commitment to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 12,000, the highest in the history of the State. The Government decided to recruit 550 trainees in each of the years 1998 and 1999. In 2000 a further 500 were recruited. In October 2000 it was decided to recruit 500 trainees in 2001. This additional recruitment will enable the Government to meet the target of 12,000 gardaí. As of 1 November of this year Garda strength stood at 11,579. This means that there are now an additional 791 gardaí when compared with 31 December, 1997. A further 119 gardaí are due to be attested at Templemore next week.</P>
    <P>Garda CCTV systems are currently in operation in Dublin and Tralee. A CCTV system is also being installed in Cork city and a number of the cameras there are already operational. As part of the Garda CCTV expansion programme, a total of £12 million has been allocated towards the installation of CCTV systems nationwide over the next three years, with £4 million being allocated in 2001. In the initial phase Garda CCTV systems are to be installed in the following ten locations: Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. At least a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course. It is anticipated that the ten CCTV systems referred to above will be installed by the end of 2002.</P>
    <P>Garda CCTV systems act as an overt deterrent to criminals. They allay the fears of local communities in which they operate and help create a safer environment in which people may go about their business. Garda authorities have confirmed to me that assaults, drug dealing and &ldquo;on-street crime&rdquo; generally have dropped where the cameras are in place. Some benefits of CCTV systems to the Garda Síochána include more effective management of resources, detection of events as they occur and filmed evidence of events. Video <Col N="958" /> evidence may also lead to guilty pleas and consequent reduction in court costs.</P>
    <P>The prisons building programme, which is proceeding on target, is an important element in the Government's strategy to combat crime. I have met the long-standing need to address prison overcrowding by bringing on stream over 1,200 additional prison places since 1998. This was done by opening three new prisons &ndash; Cloverhill, the Dóchas centre for women and the Midlands Prison &ndash; by adapting existing State properties &ndash; Castlerea and the Curragh &ndash; and by extending existing prisons.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has also been made in upgrading existing accommodation. By July of this year more than seven out of every ten prisoners in closed institutions had access to in-cell sanitation. There have also been widespread improvements in kitchen, visiting, education and library facilities. Indeed, the kitchen at Wheatfield prison was the joint overall winner of the supreme hygiene award in this year's National Hygiene Awards. Such positive developments deserve appropriate recognition.</P>
    <P>Even with these developments, there can be no room for complacency and I will continue to invest in the improving situation to prevent a slide backwards. I will endeavour at this stage to outline for the benefit of the House the central provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part 1 contains standard provisions dealing with the title of the Bill, necessary definitions and repeals. Part 2 deals with theft and related offences. Section 4 creates a new offence of theft which will cover those situations currently covered by a wide range of offences, including larceny, embezzlement, obtaining by false pretences and fraudulent conversion. The new offence will consist of dishonestly appropriating property without the owner's consent, and with the intention of depriving the owner of it, either temporarily or permanently. It also provides for situations where property is held on trust for or on behalf of more than one person by another person acting in the course of business and where some of the property is appropriated for the latter's benefit without the consent of the owner or owners. Where it is proved that there is a deficiency in the property without a proper explanation there is a presumption that it was appropriated without the owner's consent. The maximum penalty to be imposed following a conviction on indictment under the Bill is an unlimited fine or up to ten years in prison or both.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for certain exceptions to the offence of theft, for example, where a person has obtained property for value and in good faith, even if the property in question subsequently transpires to be stolen property. The section also provides that land, or things forming part of it, cannot in general be stolen, except in specified circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="959" />Sections 6 and 7 deal with aspects of deception. Section 6 provides for an offence of making a gain or causing a loss where a person dishonestly, by means of deception, induces a person to do, or refrain from doing, something. Section 7 makes it an offence to obtain services by deception. This includes, for example, obtaining a loan, where the person has been led to believe that the loan has been, or will be, repaid. Under both sections, a penalty of an unlimited fine or imprisonment for up to five years, or both, may be imposed following conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for a new offence of dishonestly making off without payment for goods or services where the person knows that payment on the spot is required or expected and where he or she intends to avoid making payment. The penalty for an offence under the section is a fine of up to £3,000 or imprisonment for up to two years or both following conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>Section 9 relates to the unlawful use of a computer in the State with the intention of making a gain or causing a loss. The person committing the offence may be either inside or outside the State at the time of the offence. Section 10 deals with false accounting and encompasses such actions as destroying, concealing or otherwise falsifying an account or document; failing to complete it; making a misleading, false or deceptive entry, or using any account or document knowing it to be false, for the purpose of furnishing false information. Section 11 provides that a person who dishonestly alters or suppresses certain types of document in order to make a gain or cause a loss is guilty of an offence. Actions covered by the section include destroying, defacing or concealing certain documents, or procuring the execution of a valuable security. The penalty for offences under sections 9, 10 and 11 is an unlimited fine or imprisonment for up to ten years or both following conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with burglary and provides that a person is guilty of burglary if he or she enters a building as a trespasser intending to commit an arrestable offence or, while there, commits or attempts to commit such an offence. The penalty is an unlimited fine or imprisonment for up to 14 years or both following conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>Section 13 deals with aggravated burglary, in other words, the commission of a burglary by a person who has a firearm, imitation firearm, weapon or explosive. Section 14 deals with robbery and provides that a person who steals and, either at the time of or immediately before the stealing, and in order to do the stealing, uses or threatens to use force against any person is guilty of the offence of robbery. The penalty for conviction on indictment for aggravated burglary and robbery will be imprisonment for up to life. Section 15 relates to the possession of certain articles by a <Col N="960" /> person for use in certain offences such as theft or burglary. An offence under the section carries a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine or imprisonment for up to five years or both following conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>Part 3 of the Bill deals with the handling of stolen property and other proceeds of crime and related matters. Section 16 sets out key definitions for use within this part of the Bill, including the meaning of &ldquo;reckless,&rdquo; that is, disregarding a substantial risk that property was stolen. Section 17 creates an offence of handling stolen property, that is, where a person, knowing or being reckless as to whether property was stolen, dishonestly receives it or makes arrangements to do so, or retains, removes or disposes of it. A penalty of an unlimited fine or imprisonment for up to ten years or both may be imposed following conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>Section 18 creates a new offence of possession of stolen property and addresses difficulties under existing legislation which arise when a person is found in possession of stolen property, but the question of whether that person has stolen such property or is handling it remains unclear. The offence created is to the effect that the person, without lawful authority or excuse, possesses stolen property knowing or being reckless as to whether it was stolen. The penalty for conviction on indictment is imprisonment for up to five years or an unlimited fine or both.</P>
    <P>Section 19 sets out certain circumstances under which a garda may require a person to give him or her an explanation of how stolen property, or the proceeds from it, came into that person's possession. Failure to give a truthful account of how this property or proceeds came into the person's possession carries a maximum penalty of a fine of up to £1,500 or imprisonment for up to 12 months or both on summary conviction. Section 20 provides clarifications concerning the preceding sections by providing that references to stolen property include property, whether it had been stolen before or after the Bill commenced, or had been stolen outside the State.</P>
    <P>The events of 11 September have far reaching consequences. One issue which has emerged as a key element of the fight against terrorism is the range of mechanisms by which terrorists finance their activities, particularly their use of money laundering. In this context, I draw the House's attention to sections 21, 22 and 23 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 21 and 22 amend aspects of the money laundering provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act, 1994. Section 21 substitutes a new section for section 31 of that Act which revises the definition of the offence of money laundering by introducing the concept of recklessness. The new offence provides that being reckless as to whether the property is or represents the proceeds of crime is now a sufficient level of culpability to warrant conviction. Section 22 is associ<Col N="961" /> ated with this substitution in that it provides for a technical amendment to section 56(<i>a</i>) of that Act as inserted by section 15 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>Section 23 of the Bill provides that I, as Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, may designate countries or territories for the purpose of requiring banks and other institutions to report to the Garda authorities transactions connected with those countries or territories. This provision will enable Ireland to meet obligations arising from international developments to fight money laundering. The Financial Action Task Force, an international body of which Ireland is a member, in order to address deficiencies in the anti-money laundering legislation of certain countries or territories, has identified a range of countermeasures to be enforced by its members. The European Union has agreed to support this initiative by requiring member states to have necessary legislative provisions in place before January 2002.</P>
    <P>Part 4 of the Bill deals with forgery and enacts offences in a modern form currently covered by the Forgery Acts, 1861 and 1913, which are being repealed in full. Section 24 contains some necessary definitions. In particular, it defines an instrument as any document, whether of a formal or informal character, other than a currency note. Among the instruments named in the section are money orders, stamps, cheques, credit cards, share certificates, tickets, passports and other documents permitting entry to the State. Sections 25 to 28, inclusive, deal with the making and use of false instruments or copies of false instruments intending their use in order that another person will accept them as genuine. Offences under these sections carry a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine or imprisonment for up to ten years or both following conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>Section 29 deals with the custody or control of certain false instruments. It provides for an offence of having control or custody of any of the specified false instruments, knowing or believing that it is false, with a view to inducing another person to accept it as genuine and of having a false instrument in one's custody or control without lawful excuse. It will also be an offence to have custody or control of a machine, or of material, suitable for use in the making of a false instrument, or with the intention of passing it off as genuine. The maximum penalty of an unlimited fine or imprisonment for up to five years or both will apply to offences related to possession, while the maximum penalty applicable to offences relating to the intention to use such instruments will be an unlimited fine or up to ten years imprisonment or both.</P>
    <P>Sections 30 and 31 provide further definitions of key terms for the purposes of that part of the Bill dealing with currency counterfeiting. At present counterfeiting of currency is only an <Col N="962" /> offence if the currency is legal tender, and hence a new currency, such as the euro, requires protection prior to being lawfully issued. This part will provide protection for the euro currency prior to issue. The measures necessary to protect a currency from counterfeiting once it has been issued are also being strengthened fulfilling Ireland's commitments to the European Union in this regard. Following the definitions in section 32, section 33 provides for an offence of counterfeiting where a person makes a counterfeit note or coin with a view to passing it as genuine. This offence carries a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine or imprisonment for a term of up to ten years or both following conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>Section 34 makes it an offence to pass or tender a counterfeit as genuine, whether directly or via a third party, and also makes it an offence even to knowingly deliver a counterfeit to another person, without lawful authority. Section 35 provides that a person who has a counterfeit note or coin in his or her custody or control with the intention of passing or tendering it as genuine is committing an offence. It also makes it an offence even to have such a counterfeit in one's custody or control, without lawful authority. Section 36 deals with materials and implements for counterfeiting and makes it an offence to make or have custody or control of any thing to be used for the purpose of counterfeiting, or to have any thing, without lawful authority, which is designed or adapted for counterfeiting. Offences under sections 34, 35 and 36 carry maximum penalties of an unlimited fine or either five years imprisonment or ten years imprisonment or both a fine and imprisonment, depending on the circumstances of the offence.</P>
    <P>Under section 37, a person who, without lawful authority, imports a counterfeit note or coin into a member state of the European Union, or exports such a note or coin from a member state, is guilty of an offence, the penalty for which is an unlimited fine or imprisonment for a term of up to ten years or both.</P>
    <P>Section 38 arises from a requirement of the European Union that member states provide full and proper protection of the euro currency. It is necessary to provide that counterfeiting of the euro and related offences are punishable under Irish law even when they are committed abroad. Due to the nature of such offences and to the fact that evidence of their commission is to be found in another state, provision is made that proceedings will only be taken by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Section 39 obliges credit institutions and other cash handlers to retain and hand over to the competent authorities, that is the Garda Síochána and Central Bank of Ireland, all counterfeit euro notes and coins received by them. While informal arrangements were already in place for this purpose, the European Union requires member states to put such arrangements on a statutory <Col N="963" /> footing, for the protection of the euro. The section includes provisions for a code of practice to deal with issues such as staff training, and detecting and reporting procedures. Offences under the section carry a maximum penalty, following conviction on indictment, of an unlimited fine or up to five years imprisonment or both. Section 39 also provides a defence for such institutions where they have complied with a recognised code of practice, and for individuals where they had acted in accordance with an internal reporting procedure.</P>
    <P>Part 6 of the Bill provides that the provisions of the EU Convention on the Protection of the European Community's Financial Interests, and the three protocols to that convention, will have the force of law in the State. The convention requires each member state to provide for criminal penalties against the use or presentation of false, incorrect or incomplete statements or documentation, resulting in the misappropriation or misapplication of Community funds and the illegal reduction of the Community's general budget. The protocols deal with such matters as corruption by or against national and Community officials, which damages or is likely to damage the Community's financial interests, jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Community and co-operation between member states and the Commission. For the sake of convenience the convention and protocols are set out in schedules to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part 7 of the Bill deals with the investigation of offences. It provides for the issue of search warrants and makes it an offence to obstruct a garda acting under a warrant. It also aims to protect documents, which may be relevant to an investigation and provides that evidential material must, where ordered by a district judge, either be produced to a garda or the garda allowed access to it.</P>
    <P>Part 8 of the Bill deals with the trial of offences. It provides for the summary trial of indictable offences under the Act where all parties agree to this. It also deals with a number of aspects of trial procedures, in particular giving assistance to juries in complex cases. There is also a provision for flexibility in relation to charges of theft, handling or possession, in that a person charged with theft may, if the facts so prove, be found guilty of handling or possession and vice versa.</P>
    <P>Part 9 of the Bill deals with a range of miscellaneous issues such as the liability of companies or their directors for offences. It also places an obligation on certain persons, such as auditors, to report suspected offences, while providing immunity from civil suit where this is done in good faith. There are also provisions dealing with the admissibility of certain types of evidence in proceedings, for example documentation, including translations, provided by an overseas lawyer <Col N="964" /> about comparable offences under that state's legal system and documentation provided by an officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs to the effect that a person is an Irish citizen.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Bill is a comprehensive measure. To go into any greater detail than I have just done would require considerably more time than is available to me. However, if there are particular matters, which Senators would like to have clarified, I will endeavour to do this in my reply to the debate.</P>
    <P>I will bring forward two amendments on Committee Stage. The first will be an amendment to the commencement provision. At present section 1(2) of the Bill provides that the Act will be brought into operation by orders to be made by me as Minister. In view of the urgency in commencing certain provisions, notably those dealing with the obligation on banks, etc. to report transactions having a connection with certain countries, which do not have adequate anti-money laundering legislation, and those dealing with protection of the euro, I will be proposing that these sections will come into operation upon enactment.</P>
    <P>The second amendment will correct an error, which resulted in a number of words being omitted from the amended section 31 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 that is being made by section 21 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have consistently stated that anyone who engages in crime will face the full rigours of the law. Where necessary, I have brought forward legislation to provide for appropriate penalties for those guilty of serious crimes. The law must be kept under constant review and where shortcomings are identified these should be remedied. Sometimes, such a review points to the need for fundamental change requiring a root and branch reform of the law in a particular area. That is the position with the law on fraud and dishonesty and that is the reason the Bill is necessary.</P>
    <P>I look forward to listening to the contributions of Senators to the debate and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I welcome his last announcement that he will introduce two amendments, particularly the first one relating to commencement. There are obligations on banks to report on transactions with other countries and in relation to money laundering. When the Bill goes through this House, I am delighted that section will become law immediately. This is overdue and I compliment the Minister on announcing that today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Minister and his staff on the fine work done in drafting this Bill. This Bill is urgently required and should have been brought forward by this or a previous Government long <Col N="965" /> before now. The legislation governing all aspects of this matter goes back to the Forgery Acts, 1861 and 1913 and the Larceny Acts, 1861, 1916 and 1990. The modern types of crimes relating to forgery, fraud and larceny, and the sophisticated manner in which many of these acts have been committed in recent years, particularly money laundering, make it vital that we have modern legislation to deal with these offences.</P>
    <P>I should have said at the outset that I wish to share my time with Senator Burke.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is highly commendable and it is very important that the specific aspects of the Bill are dealt with in detail. I welcome in particular section 6 relating to making gain or causing loss by deception. People are increasingly making gains for themselves by being deceptive. In many cases they are clearly and deliberately doing this in their own interest. In some cases it could arise that somebody is making gain, but not deliberately. Such concerns were raised during the Dáil debate. It is usually professional, skilled competent criminals who carry out these acts. This is something upon which we should elaborate in much greater detail during the debate.</P>
      <P>False accounting is very much a white-collar crime and this is an important section. Certain difficulties may arise in cases where somebody does not have the details at the time of going to court. This may be in the course of a financial dispute between companies, between partners in a partnership or in a family law case where all the evidence and documentation may not be available. A presentation may be made to the court or documentation may be put on file in the course of court hearings stating all these details are not available. In those cases it is important that an exemption be made. It should apply only where somebody wilfully and knowingly does this.</P>
      <P>Aggravated burglary is becoming factor in rural and urban Ireland and it must be taken seriously. I am pleased that section 13 deals specifically with that issue. It is important that the Minister and the courts are seen to take a strong line in relation to aggravated burglary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Burglary is one of the most common crimes committed throughout the country, particularly against old people in rural areas. It is important that section 12 is put on the Statute Book. The person who steals will be guilty of robbery either at the time of or immediately before the stealing and if he or she uses or threatens to use force against any person in order to carry out the crime. It is frequently the case, particularly in isolated rural areas, that the homes of old people are broken into, they are tied up and their property <Col N="966" /> stolen. That should be condemned and the full rigour of the law should apply.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 17 which deals with the handling of stolen property. Too many people claim to be innocent about the fact that property is stolen when the world and its mother know it is the case. It is important that section 17 is applied and that people do not claim innocence and lack of knowledge about stolen property.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about section 18 which deals with the possession of stolen property. As the Minister is from a rural constituency, I am sure he appreciates that there are cases where sophisticated criminals break into premises, steal certain goods and leave them on someone else's property. If the stolen property is in someone's house or old farmyard in an isolated area, it can be deemed to be in his or her possession. I would like section 18 to be teased out in greater detail. I know of instances where the person was oblivious to what had happened and did not have any connection with the stolen property on the premises. If the gardaí have good sense, which most of them have in a local area, they will know that. However, I fear that section 18 could be misused.</P>
    <P>I am sharing time with Senator Burke because I must attend another important meeting. I am sorry I must conclude my contribution, but I will be back for the remainder of the debate and for Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>We will miss the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Taylor-Quinn for agreeing to share time. I welcome the Bill which deals with closed circuit television systems, which have been put in place in various towns and cities, the prison building programme, theft, embezzlement, etc. The Minister has many ideas about these matters. He said that closed circuit television systems will be put in place in Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght and that a further six systems will come on stream in 2003. Castlebar made a strong case for inclusion in the scheme. It was sure it would be included in the first round, but it will appreciate inclusion in 2003.</P>
      <P>The closed circuit television system is welcome. It provides gardaí with an opportunity to carry out surveillance in a town. A monitoring station should be set up in every region because it is expensive to set one up for each town in which the system is placed. Such a station would monitor a number of towns or cities in a region and report to the local Garda station about activities in the area. Perhaps the Minister could consider that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of towns have set up taxi ranks. Castlebar applied to the Garda Síochána to set up taxi ranks in the town and this request was forwarded to the Garda Commissioner. However, <Col N="967" /> it is taking a considerable length of time to put things in place. There are taxis in the town but there are not any taxi ranks. This means gardaí must spend time moving taxis which are illegally parked. The Minister might find out the reason for the delay in making a decision on this matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recruitment of additional gardaí which will bring the number up to 12,000, the highest it has been in the history of the State. The Minister said there are now an additional 791 gardaí compared to December 1997. I do not know the significance of that statement, other than the fact we were in Government in 1997. I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the Organisation of Working Time Act came into operation in 1997. If there are 12,000 gardaí, each one must reduce his or her working hours from 40 hours to 39 hours a week. We would need at least 300 more gardaí to make up that time. While the Minister said there are now an additional 791 gardaí on the streets compared to the end of December 1997, the additional number is 400 because the extra hour must be made up. The figures are distorted.</P>
    <P>We need more gardaí on the beat in major towns. Every local authority is clamouring for extra gardaí. The Garda will admit it does not have enough manpower on some occasions. While I welcome the increase to 12,000, every effort should be made to increase this number further, particularly when shorter working hours are taken into consideration. I am sure the working hours will get shorter, not longer, in the future.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to my attention that crime is on the increase, particularly among young people. My local gardaí told me recently that the number of offences committed by young people under the age of 17 is frightening. Last Friday night my local Garda station took approximately ten or 12 people between the ages of 14 to 16 into custody. These crimes are not statistically recorded because the people are under the age of 17. Something must be done about this issue. I do not know if the gardaí know how to combat this problem. The gardaí contacted many of the parents who, in some cases, criticised the gardaí for taking their children into custody. I do not know how we will get the message across to parents and to society that crime is being committed by people under the age of 17.</P>
    <P>The majority of cases are related to drink and drugs. All the cases last Friday night were drink related. There was not a single incident which involved a young person who had not taken alcohol. I know that people who sell alcohol get a bad name, but in the majority of cases it is not the proprietor of the premises who is the real offender but the person who buys alcohol and gives it to the young person.</P>
    <P>Bringing this problem under control will be a <Col N="968" /> huge task for parents and society in general, in co-operation with the Garda Síochána. No doubt it is getting out of hand. The hands of gardaí are tied in many instances. In the case of young offenders, the local gardaí can take no action because the files are sent up to headquarters and it is dealt with on a national basis. I believe a certain amount of them should be dealt with locally. This is something which the Minister should look at also.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the CCTV systems are being allocated in 2003 there will be a new Government in place. We will probably have our own Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform at that stage and no doubt the system will be put in place then.</P>

If it is taking so long for Castlebar, I am sure it is taking just as long in other towns. I welcome the legislation and wish the Minister well with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister to the House. It is important to put on record again that more justice legislation has been introduced in this House in the past four and a half years than was ever introduced previously. As spokesman on justice in opposition and since he assumed office as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue has always said that anybody who committed crime should pay the price. It is difficult to ensure people pay the price if one is dealing with outdated Acts and laws enacted in the earlier part of the last century. This Bill, in particular, is necessary to ensure that those laws are updated.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a consolidation measure. It repeals earlier legislation dealing with stealing, fraud, forgery etc., including the Larceny Acts and Forgery Acts. It also updates the law relating to theft and dishonesty and provides for matters not adequately covered at present in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer briefly to the main features of the Bill. The Bill provides for a new offence of theft to replace the existing offence of larceny and other offences of dishonesty such as embezzlement. It updates existing offences of burglary, aggravated burglary and robbery, possession of articles in connection with certain offences and handling stolen property, and creates a new offence of possession of stolen property. The Bill provides for new offences to deal with dishonest behaviour such as obtaining services by deception, making off without payment and unlawful use of a computer. The Bill amends the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, concerning money laundering <Col N="969" /> and provides for the reporting of financial transactions having a connection with certain countries. There are new offences of forgery and counterfeiting, including counterfeiting of the euro even before it is issued, and measures to detect counterfeiting.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains provisions to enable Ireland to adopt the convention and protocols on the protection of the European Union financial interests. There are provisions providing for search warrants, production orders and alternative verdicts in relation to offences of theft, handling or possession of stolen property and restitution of stolen property, making companies and their directors liable for offences under the Bill and requiring auditors to report indications of offences under the Bill. There are provisions for making information available to juries to assist in their deliberations.</P>
    <P>As the Minister stated, there is of course a certain urgency in ensuring the safe passage of this Bill. The measures in the Bill concerning the implementation of anti-money laundering provisions contained in section 23 and also the measures dealing with the protection of the euro in Part V need to be enacted urgently in view of our obligations and the introduction of the euro in January 2002.</P>
    <P>The Minister need not be a bit shy about using the words ground breaking, innovative and radical because they are fitting words to describe this Bill. It certainly deserves praise from all of us because it is necessary.</P>
    <P>It would be difficult to fulfil the promises which the Minister and my party made on doorsteps at the last election at a time when people were living in fear in their homes if we did not have the laws in place. At that time the homes of vulnerable elderly people were being broken into. The culprits were not satisfied with taking their belongings because they went on to beat the occupants, and they beat some people to death in their homes. Thankfully such break-ins have ceased because the Minister has ensured that we introduced the necessary legislation and used the full rigours of the law on these offenders.</P>
    <P>We must have the laws in place and therefore this Bill is necessary. Not least of the problems at present is the definition of simple larceny, which requires that the object stolen should be carried away and that at the time of stealing the person should have the intention permanently to deprive the owner of it. Of course this can be very difficult to prove and may be inconsistent with certain behaviour which should properly be classed as stealing. The Bill will eliminate such inconsistencies.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by Senator Burke and Senator Quinn to the fact that we are now approaching a situation where we will have fulfilled another promise made to the electorate in 1997. At that time we promised that there would <Col N="970" /> be 12,000 gardaí patrolling our streets and enforcing law and order in an effort to reduce the instance of crime from the pre-1997 level. In fairness, we have arrived at a stage where there are 11,579 gardaí and there are others in training and about to come on stream.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke referred to the 39 hour week. I know very few gardaí who work a 39 hour week and the Minister can verify this by referring to the fact that £50 million was paid in overtime to gardaí in the past year. That nails the lie about the 39 hour week. I am sure most gardaí are working much longer hours than that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is about to civilianise 500 posts. That is a move we have all sought for a long time because it did not make sense to us to have gardaí sitting at desks carrying out clerical duties which could be done adequately by civil servants. Those 500 gardaí coming on stream are separate from the figure of 12,000 which we have almost reached.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made also to the installation of CCTV cameras in many of our cities. We are about to embark on the installation of such systems in many towns throughout the country also. First, as the Minister said, they are a great deterrent and, second, they are invaluable in that video evidence can be used subsequently where crime takes place and it can speed up proceedings in the court.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the fact that Limerick has been included in the scheme to install these cameras. Some people might say that it must be so because of the reputation of Limerick. Anybody who studies statistics on crime will find Limerick well down the league table. Limerick was in seventh or eighth place when I last looked at these statistics and it is terribly unfair that many people describe Limerick as &ldquo;stab city&rdquo;. There is crime in Limerick as there is in every other city and town, but it is no worse than in any other city. Recently I saw in a Bord Fáilte publication that Limerick was described as not being a very loveable city to visit. Remarks like that should not be allowed to go uncontested. However, I welcome the fact that the CCTV cameras are being installed in Limerick and I sincerely hope they will bring our crime figures down further.</P>
    <P>Mention has also been made of the additional prison spaces that have been made available. The Minister has told us exactly how he accomplished that despite the fact that some felt it could not be done. Our prisons had revolving doors prior to 1997 and for some time thereafter while the Minister was setting about ensuring that would cease to be the case. He has been quite successful. Some may disagree, but standards have been improved in our prisons. Various programmes that have been discussed in this House on a number of occasions when dealing with legislation on prisons have been put in place. An additional 1,200 prison spaces have been created since 1998. <Col N="971" /> That has been accomplished by opening the three new prisons, Clover Hill, the Dóchas centre and the Midlands Prison, as well as by adapting existing State properties at Castlerea and the Curragh while extending existing prisons. That is very welcome.</P>
    <P>In an age when there is such huge growth in the IT sector, section 9 is extremely important. It relates to the unlawful use of computers in the State with the intention of making a gain or causing a loss. The person committing the offence may be within or outside the State when the offence is committed. When this Bill is enacted we will have vital legislation covering the offence of the unlawful use of computers.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 and 13 cover the most common forms of crime. They have been referred to by previous speakers and I wish to refer to them also. Section 12 deals with burglary and provides that a person is guilty of burglary if he or she enters a building as a trespasser intending to commit an arrestable offence or who, having entered a building, attempts to commit such an offence. The penalty is an unlimited fine or imprisonment for up to 14 years, or both, following conviction or indictment. Section 13 deals with aggravated burglary. Whether aggravated or otherwise, it is a terrible crime to commit. In many instances the victims are less concerned about the goods that have been stolen than they are about their own health. It is a very traumatic experience for anybody to realise that someone has invaded the privacy of their house and has been in their kitchen or their bedroom. Culprits should be subjected to the full rigour of the law when they are caught. We have had much more of that sort of crime in the past and there have been cases where people were beaten and killed in their homes. Thankfully that has been stopped and not before time, but there are still cases of break-ins and burglaries. However, they are not happening to the same extent. The penalties that can be imposed under this legislation will be a great deterrent and will help to bring this form of crime under control.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is important as it provides for certain exceptions to the offence of theft. Such an exception occurs where a person has obtained property for value and in good faith, even if it transpires subsequently that the property in question is stolen. People can, on occasion, end up with property they bought in good faith, perhaps believing it to be a bargain. They then realise their mistake. I welcome that aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to 11 September in his address. A key matter that has emerged during the fight against terrorism is the range of mechanisms by which terrorists finance their activities, in particular through money laundering. Any effort we in the Oireachtas can make to cut off the <Col N="972" /> avenues these people have to launder their money is welcome.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and look forward to its passing safely through the House. It is being dealt with in a spirit of goodwill and co-operation by all sides of the House and I welcome the amendments mentioned by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, to the House. I very much welcome this legislation. It is based on solid research carried out by members of the Law Reform Commission. We tend to commend the Minister alone when he comes to the House, but we should also commend the commission on its ongoing input, made over many years, into upgrading and updating legislation. The Minister has had to leave for another engagement, but even in his absence I say that he has been a true reformer. The amount of new legislation and updated, upgraded and amended legislation he has put on the Statute Book since his appointment is very impressive. To seek to deny that is to seek to deny the truth and we are talking about honesty this evening. The Minister has been tremendously intelligent, hardworking and reforming in respect of legislation.</P>
      <P>Given the genesis of the crimes dealt with in this Bill, the legislation it is to replace is extremely old, having been on the Statute Book for over 100 years. That is how much time it has taken successive Ministers to examine existing legislation in terms of how it responds and corresponds to rapidly changing times. This Bill is very welcome. It is high time we sought to bring our legislation into line with new technology and practices and with a vastly changed world. If the law and those who frame, administer and enforce it are not ahead of the criminals, the criminals will certainly win. In many cases of theft, burglary and larceny the criminals have been winning well. Crime pays and has paid handsomely. We all know people who have greatly extended their wealth through theft, burglary and dishonesty. It is time that practice was brought to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many ways these are vastly changed times. For 30 years of bank robberies, money laundering and terrorist related activity certain people grew fat on the proceeds of crime and did so under a political banner. That was widespread and for reasons I am unprepared to go into right now a great many people got away with it. I hope that we have emerged from that era, though that does not mean that new forms of terrorism are not emerging. The atrocities of that awful day, 11 September, remind us how all-pervasive terrorism can be on a worldwide stage. Anti-fraud and anti-theft laws can be framed to attempt to at least reduce that kind of terrorism, if not to defeat it. We are entering an era of very complex technology, of very sophisticated money-laun<Col N="973" /> dering practices, and we have seen what people can do with other people's visa cards. They can be used to obtain money under false pretences. Cunning and clever people can use new technology to defraud others on a large scale. We must have the most up-to-date legislation we can possibly create to defeat such money laundering and fraud, as well as to defeat the more usual and equally corrosive crimes of burglary and larceny.</P>
    <P>White collar criminals have got away with murder and they have got away with a lot of money. Our track record in dealing with those who have feathered their nests through such crime has been very poor. However, there has been a huge improvement in this respect since the Criminal Assets Bureau was founded. My second tribute is to the CAB and how it has gone about its business and scientifically tackled white collar crime with resultant gains for the Exchequer and the taxpayer. I pay tribute to the CAB and those who have worked skilfully for it.</P>
    <P>As well as referring to the vastly updated law, some Members referred to an increase in the number of gardaí and an extension of the number of closed circuit television cameras, all of which are happening at the same time and which would lead us to be optimistic about the outcome of this type of legislation. The additional gardaí are welcome. I endorse what was said by the Senator from Limerick about the civilianisation of posts previously occupied by gardaí. It is high time that was done. Gardaí are trained to do a given type of work and they should do that work and no other. I welcome the intensification of the civilianisation programme which is due.</P>
    <P>We should seek to train more specialists in the Garda to deal with specific types of crime. When dealing with money laundering and fraud and crimes at that level people trained in accountancy are needed because they understand the practices and how the crime can be made to happen. For this reason, we need specialist task forces to deal with such crime and other types also. The day of the general practitioner is gone in many areas. For example, in education teachers are used who have the expertise to deal with certain areas of activity. Specially trained teachers are employed in given areas of activity to boost overall educational objectives. It is also done in medicine and many other areas.</P>
    <P>More like this should be done in the Garda. We will be fighting a losing battle if the criminal has more tricks up his sleeve than the Garda. This is happening in many cases. We must train specialist units to deal with different types of crime. When dealing with fraud and white collar crime one is dealing with very cunning, sophisticated and technologically very advanced individuals, and a unit within the Garda which is one step ahead of them is needed. It must also be borne in mind that we need more specialist task <Col N="974" /> forces to make the provisions of the Bill happen and enforce them. Enforcement is everything.</P>
    <P>Coming back to general, day-to-day crime such as burglaries and aggravated burglaries and their impact, a previous Member referred to the trauma they cause older people, in particular. What is inflicted on the people concerned is sub-human and deserving of punishment far in excess of that often meted out. The major damage is to their self-confidence. They are stripped of their feeling of independence. They are also often stripped of their life savings, the few bob they put away to bury themselves. We often hear of assaults, but do not often hear of the money stolen being recovered and returned.</P>
    <P>Justice is not done until stolen goods and money are recovered and returned to the person from whom they are stolen. It may not happen 100% of the time, but as matters stand, people will say that, if their houses are broken into&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I was born and raised in County Kerry, but at a time when people left their doors open and, when they got cars, never locked them. I was raised in County Kerry in those days and God be with them.</P>
      <P>It is a terrible injustice for stolen goods or money not to be returned. In Cork city, where I have lived all my adult life and practise politically, I know of widows, neighbours of mine, who had their televisions, jewellery and every possession stolen which could be flogged and converted to cash. While in all cases the burglaries were reported, in few cases were the stolen goods returned. That is wrong and justice is not done until stronger efforts are made to return stolen goods. For that reason, I am glad new offences are created in the Bill such as the handling of stolen property in section 17 and the possession of stolen property in section 18. These two new provisions should assist in the recovery of stolen goods and their return to their rightful owners. This is terribly important. It is also important the Garda is reminded that we require its members to put more effort into ensuring these two provisions are fully implemented.</P>
      <P>I am glad we have more gardaí. I would like to see a stronger Garda presence on the streets. Our main objective should be crime prevention. Once a crime is committed irreversible damage has been done. The uniformed garda seen to be walking the beat is a great prevention mechanism. I want to see gardaí visible on the streets as a crime prevention measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are crimes specified in the legislation for which the Minister has said fines unlimited will apply. I suppose that is a good thing because money values change so rapidly these days. In the context of this measure being enacted, I would like the Judiciary to support the idea of not just <Col N="975" /> imposing the minimum fine. Judges should first be consistent in their judgments in order that a fellow does not get away with something in County Mayo for which another fellow in north Kerry is prosecuted. We need consistent judgments from the Judiciary. As well as that, we need judges who will not hesitate to apply the maximum where it is warranted. This is important.</P>
    <P>I am not sure I agree with imprisonment, although it is important. There should be a much stronger emphasis on fines when dealing with burglary and fraud. Money and gain are the game for those who engage in this type of crime. The one place to hit them is where their gain is meant to be: in their pockets. I would like to see fairly extensive use of money fines. If we could get to the point where crime would not pay, this legislation would have served citizens well.</P>
    <P>In as much as I have studied it, this is promising legislation. It is encouraging that so much effort has been put into bringing legislation into line with modern conditions, the challenges of new technologies, the open society in which we live and international terrorism as it operates. It is also encouraging that so much effort has been put into acknowledging that money laundering is a substantial international crime in the times in which we live. In acknowledging this, there must be the type of co-operation between and among states which will at least play its part in defeating international terrorism by seeking to ensure it does not line the pockets of those who practise it. Provision for this is made in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcome and support the Bill. I look forward to understanding it in greater detail when it comes to Committee Stage and pledge the support of my party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>A Bill such as this is to be welcomed, given what its provisions attempt to achieve. I welcome the Minister's statement but I wonder if there is to be any follow up to the neighbourhood watch scheme introduced some years ago. The Minister announced an extension of the CCTV monitoring system to various areas, which I particularly welcome. Up to now, it has been operational in Dublin, Tralee and parts of Cork city. Has the Minister received any feedback concerning the achievements of the CCTV programme to date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago, I raised the possibility of extending the CCTV system to Dún Laoghaire, but its introduction was put on the back burner. It is due for installation in Dún Laoghaire next year, along with another nine areas. Will the Minister indicate when exactly the system will be installed? I would like to hear from the Minister how well the system has worked in Dublin. I know that both the senior Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, and the Minister of State, Deputy <Col N="976" /> Mary Wallace, have examined the system in operation. We have also seen CCTV in use in Britain, particularly at carnivals, festivals and at football matches, where it has worked well.</P>
    <P>A horrific murder occurred in Dún Laoghaire a few years ago, which remains unsolved. There is hope, however, that some CCTV footage may lead to the person responsible being brought to justice. Does the Minister have any specific information about the timescale for introducing the CCTV system in the proposed ten locations that have been mentioned, including Dún Laoghaire? </P>
    <P>The Minister's speech dealt with the Bill's sections in detail, as well as outlining a variety of new offences envisaged by the legislation What implications does the Bill have for the various protocols concerning legislation on extradition and our co-operation with other EU member states in this regard? The last 25 sections of the Bill appear to have been skimmed through rather succinctly by the Minister in his speech. A relatively small part of his speech was devoted to them. Section 40, for example, deals with the First and Second Protocols, and refers to Members of this House, the Dáil, and various other office holders.</P>
    <P>In light of recent comments from the Director of Public Prosecutions, will the Minister indicate what, if any, further changes will be recommended by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform concerning the operation of the DPP's Office? In recent times, the DPP has been very clear about difficulties that have arisen concerning certain cases. I presume the DPP brings proceedings unless there is a likelihood that a conviction will not be obtained. Problems have arisen where the DPP blandly states that because of certain factors his office is not proceeding with a case, yet there has been no explanation. The DPP has made it clear that he is not there to respond to the victims' appeals or the concerns of victims' families. If we are trying to ensure that justice is seen to be done, however, some explanation should be made available when the DPP decides not to proceeed with a case. Given the DPP's recent report and comments, does the Minister envisage any changes concerning these pronouncements?</P>
    <P>Sometimes, a solicitor representing the Office of the Chief State Solicitor announces in court that it is not intended to offer any evidence, so the proceedings are stuck out and the summons is not proceeded with. I would suggest to the Minister that there is some public concern about this. There may be valid reasons not to proceed with a case but if they are not made clear the public perception is that a cop-out has occurred.</P>
    <P>In principle, Fine Gael broadly supports this legislation. Section 12(1) states:</P>
    <P>A person is guilty of burglary if he or she&ndash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;enters any building or part of a build<Col N="977" /> ing as a trespasser and with intent to commit an arrestable offence, or</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;having entered any building or part of a building as a trespasser, commits or attempts to commit any such offence therein.</P>
    <P>There have been ongoing difficulties in various parts of the country, particularly where groups, including Travellers, enter upon lands, although they may not be entering a building, as such. If a person has a farm building on a couple of adjacent acres I would contend that if one enters all or part of the property &ndash; whether one goes upstairs to the attic or one is in the front or back garden &ndash; one is trespassing within the curtilage of the building. In light of complaints about trespassing in certain areas, section 12 should place an onus on the trespasser and provide that, technically or otherwise, they have no rights to be there because they are neither welcome nor an invitee. Will the Minister comment on how this section relates to people causing problems by encroaching upon land? </P>
    <P>It is now clear that the quickest way to get trespassers out is literally to give them money to leave. I am sure the Minister is aware it is common practice that moneys are demanded and paid. Given the current delays in the legal system, the quickest way to get them out is to offer them £1,000 or £2,000 to get off the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Senators who have contributed to the debate and, as usual, it has been constructive. As the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, said, the intention of the Bill is clear. It is a modern form of the law of dishonesty to replace the often confused distinctions in the existing law relating to larceny which derives from the common law and the Larceny Act dating back to 1861. This new clarity will benefit everyone involved in the criminal justice system. I have no doubt it will be seen by those engaged in crimes of dishonesty as removing the opportunities which may currently exist for sowing confusion about such matters as to whether larceny has been committed or <Col N="978" /> whether any particular person may be guilty of larceny or handling. Bringing clarity to the law will also help to ensure continued confidence in its operation.  </P>
      <P>The Bill includes new offences to replace existing offences, including larceny and embezzlement, as well as matters not properly covered at present. There are also measures to assist in the investigation and prosecution of such offences. The new offence of theft will replace the current range of offences in this area. Under the Bill theft will consist of dishonestly appropriating property without the owner's consent and with the intention of depriving the owner of it, whether temporarily or permanently. This differs significantly from the current law relating to larceny which requires the physical taking away of the property with the intention to permanently deprive the owner of it. This has presented evidential difficulties for the prosecution in proving the various elements of the offence and, in addition, gives rise to the requirement to specify separate offences for different types of stealing. Thus we have such offences as embezzlement, obtaining by false pretences, larceny by trick and fraudulent conversion to mention a few.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains other offences to deal with dishonest behaviour not covered adequately by existing law, including making a gain or causing a loss by deception, obtaining services by deception, making off without payment, unlawful use of a computer with the intention of making a gain or loss and false accounting. These are aimed at types of behaviour which may have become more common in modern society.</P>
      <P>The Bill re-enacts in an updated form the existing offences of burglary, aggravated burglary and robbery. The offence of handling stolen property is also largely a re-enactment of the current position. Under the Bill a person will be guilty of handling, whether he or she received stolen property or undertakes to assist in its retention, removal, disposal or realisation knowing or being reckless as to whether it is stolen. In cases where it may not be clear whether a person has stolen property or whether he or she has handled stolen property the Bill includes a new offence of possession of stolen property. This is an important distinction because of the fact that the offences of stealing and handling are mutually exclusive. The real difficulty in such situations is that the Garda knows the property is stolen, knows it was in the possession of the individual, but has difficulty determining whether he or she stole or received it. The creation of a new offence of possession of stolen property will remedy the situation by providing that a person will be guilty of possession where he or she, without lawful authority or excuse, possesses stolen property knowing or being reckless as to whether it was stolen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, as an additional aid in the fight against theft and possessing stolen goods, the Bill <Col N="979" /> contains provision for alternative verdicts. This will ensure the Garda is not hamstrung in its choice of charge.</P>
    <P>Amendments to the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, designed to strengthen anti-money laundering measures have assumed added significance since the events of 11 September in the US. Those Parts of the Bill dealing with forgery and counterfeiting re-enact in modern form the current offences contained in earlier Acts which are being repealed. The counterfeiting provisions also provide for protection against counterfeiting of euro notes and coins even before these are issued and contain measures to detect and prevent counterfeiting. The new provisions are contained in the Part of the Bill relating to the protection of the European Communities financial interest which are mainly designed to tackle fraud and corruption in relation to Community funds.</P>
    <P>In addition to the provision for the granting of search warrants, the Bill contains a number of innovative measures to assist in the detection of offences of dishonesty. One of these is a section allowing the court to make orders for the production of evidential material, which is a less intrusive way of obtaining evidence than the use of search warrants in terms of trial offences. The new provision will allow a judge to provide the information for the jury in the form of documents, charts and transcripts to assist it in its deliberations. This will be especially helpful to a jury in complex cases, particularly those involving fraud.</P>
    <P>Members raised many interesting issues during the debate. I thank them for their general support for the measures contained in the Bill and the compliments to the Minister in regard to the legislation. A feature of modern life is that criminals are constantly inventing new ways to get around the law, but the Bill gives the Garda the edge in so far as crimes involving dishonesty are concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn is right to point out that the area of law covered by the Bill was in need of modernisation. There had been piecemeal changes up to now, but the Government has decided that the time is appropriate to sweep away the earlier legislation and replace it with what will be a modern code dealing with dishonesty and fraud.</P>
    <P>Senators Burke and Cosgrave raised the issue of CCTV. Senator Burke pointed out that CCTV systems are proving beneficial in the fight against urban crime. The Government is committed to enhancing this aid to crime prevention and detection. In the long-term the benefits will repay the investment. The installation of CCTV was part of the Government's response to on-street crime. The Minister outlined the proposed locations for the extension of the system. The precise timetable for implementation in each area will depend on <Col N="980" /> the examination of suitable locations &ndash; Senator Cosgrave was interested particularly in Dún Laoghaire &ndash; in terms of installation, training programmes and provision of links to monitoring centres. The Government is committed to the programme of expansion. I reiterate what the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, said that systems will be installed at the ten locations referred to, including Dún Laoghaire, by the end of 2002.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

However, the Senator can be assured that the system will be installed in Dún Laoghaire and in the other nine locations during 2002.</P>

      <P>We will do our best to have it installed before June. The important commitment is that it will be provided in 2002.</P>
      <P>Senators Cregan, Quill and others expressed concerns about the effect of crime on victims. In particular, aggravated burglary and robbery not only deprived the victim of their property, but also their feelings of security and the inviolability of their homes. We recognise this. That is the reason the penalties are so severe. In the case of aggravated burglary and robbery, the sentence can be up to life imprisonment on conviction.</P>
      <P>The sophisticated nature of many modern crimes, particularly fraud, requires, as suggested by Senators, a sophisticated response. The Garda is increasingly developing the expertise to detect and prevent this form of crime. There are specialised units within the Garda and qualified accountants working with them. This will lead to better detection. The provision in the Bill concerning the giving of assistance to juries will also help in this regard.</P>
      <P>In response to Senator Cosgrave, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has no role or function in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions or its decisions. This independence is essential if the integrity and independence of the office is to be protected and confidence is to be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator referred to section 12 in the context of trespass by certain groups of individuals. Section 12 creates the offence of entering a building as a trespasser with the intention of committing an arrestable offence. The Bill does not address trespass as such; that is a matter for <Col N="981" /> another day. The intention of creating the offence under the Bill is the link with section 12.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately it is not possible at this Stage to go into the Bill in more detail. The Minister went into extensive detail when introducing it. There will be an opportunity on Committee Stage to consider matters in greater detail. I look forward to being involved in that.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for studying the Bill and putting forward suggestions at this Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the Government for its gross mismanagement of the flotation of Eircom which resulted in financial hardship for hundreds of thousands of small investors who were misled by the Government's statements and exhortations.</P>
      <P>I move this motion not from the point of view of condemning the commercial activity of Eircom or running down the company in its current format, but to highlight the Government's performance in this episode. Small shareholders, many of whom had never dealt in stocks and shares, have lost most of their savings in this flotation. The public relations people, spin doctors and consultants essentially cajoled them out of their money.</P>
      <P>September of this year will go down in the annals of history for the one cataclysmic event that occurred on 11 September. The dreams of many thousands of people ended forever in New York and Washington on that day, but at 3 p.m. on Friday, 28 September, the financial dreams and hopes of hundreds of thousands of Irish investors ended with the announcement that Valentia had gained more than the 80% acceptance level needed to gain control of Eircom. The statement added that the offer was unconditional and represented 1,868,132,494 of the Eircom shares sold to the public. The chairman of Valentia went on to say that he looked forward to being able to pay the accepting Eircom shareholders their money. That was cold, clinical language for the chief mourners at this corporate funeral, namely, the thousands of Eircom shareholders, some of whom lost their life savings while others lost substantial sums of money as a result of the outrageous marketing ploys the Government undertook to encourage the unsuspecting public to part with their money at the height of a bull market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few wise guys who got out early made money <Col N="982" /> in the flotation, but the majority of small investors waited and held on to their shares, to their own misfortune. The majority of shareholders were cajoled by the spin doctors and the PR people to part with their money. In return for the great job they did in the flotation, those PR gurus received the handsome figure of £74 million. The image they manufactured was of a gold-mine for sale, Ireland's own national gold-mine going for a song, as the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, described it. Unfortunately, for the majority of shareholders, the national gold-mine turned out to be nothing more than corporate quicksand in which they got bogged down and badly burned. Many investors will never return to the stock market and, consequently, they will miss out on many genuine opportunities to make some real money in stocks and shares.</P>
    <P>The Government has to take responsibility for the debacle of the Eircom flotation. It cajoled small investors to part with their money through a massive publicity campaign. The Minister for Finance should make some restitution in the forthcoming budget and Finance Bill whereby those small investors can offset their losses against income tax. Currently those losses can only be offset against capital gains tax, but, unfortunately, many small investors affected never held shares previously and, as a result, will not be able to offset their losses against capital gains tax. I call on the Minister for Finance to consider these investors when presenting his budget this day week and make some allowance whereby those who have lost substantial sums of money can offset that loss against their income tax.</P>
    <P>It behoves the Government to make some amends for what happened in this flotation. Many people have suffered major financial hardship as a result of the publicity that surrounded it. The Government and the marketing gurus interfered with the market and created a false market which did not exist previously. Instead of letting the banks and institutions get burnt if the market fell, they inveigled small shareholders into the market. It is very doubtful if the banks, had the flotation been underwritten entirely or to a large extent by the financial institutions, would have accumulated the type of losses small investors suffered.</P>
    <P>This motion has nothing to do with the commercial viability of this company or its current commercial operation. I am not impressed by the fact that this private company is now owned by a consortium of American venture capitalists who will relaunch the company on the stock exchange in a few years, having sold many of its valuable assets and properties. In my home town, Ballina, a new building which was constructed by Eircom in the past few years at a cost of millions of pounds is now lying idle. I am sure it will appear in the property pages of the national press in the <Col N="983" /> next six months. This is only one small example of what will happen with the company.</P>
    <P>On 28 September the chairman of Valentia announced that the group had received more than 80% of the acceptance level it needed. He did not say anything about the people who did not accept the offer or did not return their forms, many of whom are sitting on their shares in the mistaken belief that they possess a valuable asset which will, at some stage, increase in value if they hold to it. They need to be told that, even if they hold on to their certificates for the next 99 years, the value will not increase by one penny. The Government shows no urgency to inform these investors of the position. There is an ongoing argument about whether Valentia can acquire these shares compulsorily. I have been informed it can.</P>
    <P>That this company is now owned by a consortium with no public service obligation to this country, whose sole interest is commercial and which will require the company to make substantial profits in the years ahead, makes me extremely worried about peripheral rural areas such as north Mayo where it will it not be economically viable to roll out broadband and other facilities needed in the telecommunications business.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that telecommunications is a vital cog in a modern economy. It is expanding from year to year and its value to an expanding economy cannot be underestimated. In the past ten years alone our telecommunications system has been brought to a remarkable point. We all remember when one had to phone the local post office for a connection to America and half the village knew what one had talked about by the end of the night. That is not so long ago. There is much for which to be thankful in terms of our telecommunications system.</P>
    <P>This House deplores the fact that the Government got it badly wrong with this flotation. It should take responsibility for its error and make amends with the small investor for the shortfall.</P>

      <P>It is always good to have the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, in the House. He is very generous with his time. However, while I welcome him, I regret we do not have the Minister responsible for the Eircom debacle before us. It is unfortunate, though I am sure there is a good reason for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State will deliver to her the message we wish to send and I hope she listens. The Minister, who is still essentially the Minster responsible for monopolies, has presided, in Eircom, over a saga with disastrous choreography from beginning to end.</P>
      <P>We have moved from State ownership to public ownership and now to private ownership. Unfortunately, the Minister has lost control of Eircom at the most crucial juncture in our economic development. The economy is moving from loss making assembly and production manufacturing to high added value jobs in the knowledge industry. To support these jobs the country needs high quality telecoms and affordable access to the Internet.</P>
      <P>We have arrived at a most unfortunate and peculiar position with Eircom, in which nothing new has been developed. Despite the progress that has been made, there has been a marked slowdown with regard to new lines. ISDN lines are not available in 20% of the country, delivery of leased lines, especially to competitors, is slow and there is no delivery of affordable Internet access. We are using the same tired old 1891 service based on a price per minute charge which is monopolistic in that no revenue is shared with other providers. Given that Eircom has basically cut its margin to get all the business, we have a monopoly and no competition.</P>
      <P>Eircom has delayed the introduction of affordable access to the Internet both for residential and business users. In contrast, Deutsche Telekom has an always on service via ISDN lines for only DM10 per month which is about &euro;5, and in the UK flat rate access services are widely available over the normal dial-up network for between £20 and £40 per month.</P>
      <P>Eircom will not tolerate a reduction in current revenues for dial up 1891 services and for expensive leased line circuits, both of which would be immediately reduced if flat rate services were introduced. It has also delayed the introduction of ADSL for three years because it would suffer a loss of leased line revenue, which deprives homes and businesses of an always on high speed service which can piggyback on the ordinary phone line. Why is it delaying these new services?</P>
      <P>ADSL is a new technology which offers up to two megabytes per second speeds on an ordinary phone line. It has been tested successfully by Eircom for over two years, yet there is no sign of its being introduced. It is offered in many countries across Europe for around £40 per month. Eircom is now arguing with the regulator to get approval for a price of £108 per month which does not include phone line rental of some £14. This is absolutely ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company's approach to strangling competition is directly analogous to another of the Minister's monopolies, Aer Lingus, which for years refused to allow competition on the Dublin-Lon<Col N="985" /> don line. We all know what competition achieved after Ryanair entered the market &ndash; an increase in overall traffic and a significant reduction in prices for the travelling public. We desperately need the same in telecoms.</P>
    <P>Since Eircom currently provides 96% of the leased lines in the country and 92% of the phone lines, we are now stuck with Sir Anthony's notion of when to offer affordable services to the citizen. This all comes back to the Minister. She is responsible for this debacle. It is arguable that the significant cost to the State is not just the huge loss suffered by the army of small investors who were suckered into investing in Eircom by the Minister but the loss to the economy arising from the Minister's allowing our most significant national asset to fall into private hands. It is a double whammy as far as I am concerned. The State cannot now influence the introduction of necessary services to support e-business and the Minister's delay in bringing about the communications Bill is compounding her disastrous handling of this brief.</P>
    <P>We need a stronger influence over the telecommunications providers in this country, and especially over Eircom. What stage of production has the communications Bill reached? Why has it not yet left the Department and where do we stand in relation to Eircom? We are stuck in the hands of venture capital companies who will sweat the Eircom business to remunerate their investments. The likely consequence is that Eircom will not introduce new cheaper technologies when it can keep the current profitable monopoly going. This is utterly scandalous.</P>
    <P>What is even more scandalous, and we have included a further amendment to our motion to condemn it, is that the board of Eircom has paid itself large bonuses despite the massive losses of small shareholders. It was incredible to read of the directors awarding themselves such enormous bonuses. There is nothing illegal in that but it was morally wrong for them to do this on foot of the extensive losses suffered by mainly small shareholders. The investments of small shareholders might not amount to much but those who, for example, invested their pensions into the company must suffer great pain to see the people who presided over this debacle take enormous sums of money from it while they are left at a considerable loss. At the very least they should see that it is morally wrong. It is a disgrace and they should be ashamed of themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister has presided over a debacle and I hope that there is some way we can compensate the small investors in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann notes that all legal requirements associated with the flotation of Telecom <Col N="986" /> Éireann stock were met in full by the Government and its advisers in the offer and that the price of the shares represented the market value of the company at the time, was within the range recommended by the Government's advisers and, most importantly, represented fair value for the taxpayer in the transaction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When I read this motion, three concepts came to mind &ndash; insight, foresight and hindsight. Insight is a much desired commodity, foresight is a valued prize but hindsight is a commonly held commodity and not too highly valued in serious economic debate.</P>
    <P>When we read the Opposition motion we initially felt we should perhaps be overcome with guilt at our failure to have the insight and the foresight that the Opposition presumes was there at the time. We were green with envy that those gifts were denied us when they seemed to be flourishing in the Opposition. They are wonderful gifts. If we had them we would have played our part shoulder to shoulder with the Opposition in cautioning and restraining what would seem to have been a gullible and naive public from being swept away by the rush to buy shares in Telecom, now Eircom.</P>
    <P>The general mood around the country at the time was described by some scribes as &ldquo;Ireland's answer to the Klondike gold rush&rdquo;. I do not say that to be cynical or sarcastic regarding the hundreds of thousands of investors who now find themselves at a loss. I assure the House that we on the Government side are equally concerned and can empathise fully with the feelings, anxieties and grief of the shareholders who find themselves with their shares halved in value. Many invested their life savings while others borrowed money. They are all at a loss.</P>
    <P>If I were a betting man I would wager that every Member of this House and of the Dáil took an investment in this company. Sorry &ndash; all but one. Deputy Spring did not because he could not afford it, poor Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from that, why did all the Members so enthusiastically embrace the opportunity to participate in the flotation of Eircom? That raises a number of questions.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that recent experiences have chastened the ardour and enthusiasm of the public to participate in future ventures. I agree with the Opposition there. The Government, the Minister and their consultants were deemed to be the pilots who guided the process through to privatisation and, given that situation, it is politically expedient that the Opposition should come looking for a scapegoat to demonstrate its empathy publicly with the sense of grievance and loss experienced by the hundreds of thousands of small investors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" />The Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, will demonstrate clearly, from the history of what happened over that period, that the Government acted responsibly at each juncture in carefully managing and guiding the process from the beginning to privatisation. We support the amendment tabled by the Government because it represents a true and accurate position in the context of the economic climate at the time, the then state of the telecommunications industry globally and decisions in the national interest given EU competition laws. None of these factors has been addressed by the Opposition. The Minister and the Government were determined to ensure that the maximum number of people possible would have the right and the opportunity to participate in the flotation. Most importantly, they tried to ensure that the taxpayer and the public would not be sold short and there would be a fair return to the public purse and through the public purse to the public at large from the sale of the shares.</P>
    <P>I have a question fundamental to this whole issue. Is there anybody who can cite an example from recent decades of a company offering a gilt-edged guarantee to all potential investors that their money is safe and sound?</P>

      <P>If there is, then let the example be cited and we will all rush to become millionaires. If there is not, we must ask what is the real motive of the motion proposed by the Opposition.

      <P>The Opposition, individually or collectively, seems fortunate to be blessed with the wonderful insight and foresight implicit in the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alternatively, was it simply a monstrous deception foisted on the public by the Minister and the Government? It has to be one of these. I cannot think of other questions but these questions spring to mind when pondering on the motive for the tabling of this motion.  Mindful of the sensitivity required towards members of the public <Col N="988" /> who suffered financial loss as a result of investing all or part of their life savings, I dug out from the media of the time these nuggets of knowledge and foresight. I found not so much nuggets as carrots, which I did not expect to find. The main Opposition party was mostly concerned that the Minister be fair in facilitating the maximum number of people to avail of the opportunity to participate in the process. Deputy Yates, Fine Gael's spokesman, on radio with Richard Crowley, challenged the Minister to ensure that this would be so. He did not want the &ldquo;big boys&rdquo; of the financial world to scoop up the shares and make a quick killing. The Minister assured him that she would go further in addressing his concerns and she did.</P>
    <P>Labour exercised its conscience in public, as it is wont to do, and on 11 July 1999, in <i>The Irish Times,</i> its spokesman expressed&mdash;</P>

I rest my case there. The market has decided for good or ill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a more complicated issue than the way the Opposition put it, which is why I and Senator Norris have proposed an amendment. While the Eircom saga has been an unmitigated disaster for the small investors in particular, I regret that there is an effort to make political capital out of it. There are sorry lessons to be learned from the story but to attribute the blame exclusively to the Government is disingenuous</P>
      <P>Senator Caffrey wants to see, in next week's budget, restitution to the small shareholders for their losses. I declare an interest as one of those small shareholders &ndash; I wish I were a smaller one &ndash; but the idea that the Minister for Finance should put money back into the pockets of those who suffered losses on the Stock Exchange is barmy. I can understand its case against anyone in this saga. However, to suggest that it is the Government's duty to bail out people who lost money in a public company is out of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is this Fine Gael policy? Will that party come into power with a Minister for Finance who will <Col N="989" /> say that he will return money to anyone who lost it on the Stock Exchange? This is too serious a subject to be treated in this way. It is wrong for anyone in this House to give the impression to small shareholders that any party would do that. It cannot and will not happen. Restitution for those who risked their own money in a public company, whatever the circumstances, is not the way the market economy works. That is the kind of semi-State mentality from which we are trying to escape.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Government. Senator Caffrey spoke of false markets, but I see no false markets. The blame for this debacle rests with the board and the management. We should point the finger at them, which is what public companies are about. The real problem is not the share price but that the board and the top executives made so much money while the small shareholders were being bled dry. Anything else, such as blaming the Government, is a red herring. Losses would be acceptable if salt were not rubbed daily into our wounds. Bonuses of up to £1 million were paid to chief executives when the share price was in free fall and some people were losing their life savings, perhaps having irresponsibly borrowed money or been seduced by the blandishments of the sale. We cannot sell a public company without blandishments. Nevertheless, success bonuses were paid out to top executives. People were rewarded for failure, not success. It was an appalling case of the unacceptable face of capitalism and of the market economy going wrong.</P>
    <P>If those of us who had shares are honest we must admit that we could have taken our money out at a profit for many months after the sale. Not only did I not sell mine, I bought more. I made a fool of myself, but I did not know that the board was helping itself to money, albeit legally, and that they were about to propose that they get outrageous options at the AGM. I also did not know that it was making extraordinary decisions about the company's future which would land us in more trouble. The company never left the semi-State sanatorium even after it became a public company. The markets began to realise it, took fright and started to sell it. At the same time the board and management were getting incredibly well paid.</P>
    <P>The big problem was one that cannot be blamed on the Government. An amazing deal was done whereby the best possible asset in the company, Eircell, was sold in the worst possible circumstances. If there is anything on which it should be judged it is that deal. It agreed the sale of Eircell with Vodafone when Vodafone shares stood at £2.40. Today they stand at £1.90. So confident was it about it, it said if they went below £2.20, it could walk away. It never expected it to happen. They went way below £2.20 long before the deal was consummated and it did not walk <Col N="990" /> away. It landed us in the most appalling trouble and with devalued shares. That is an awful indictment on the board and management of that company.</P>
    <P>The final indictment on that board was that not one of them bought a significant number of shares. We know the case of the former Tánaiste, who did not buy any. That was bad enough. Even up to the top, including the managing director, they only bought a few thousand, which represents a couple of weeks' salary or less than a week's salary in some cases. They showed no confidence in the company which they &ndash; not the Government &ndash; were promoting for so long. When we saw that these very rich men were prepared to pay themselves vast sums out of the company but put nothing into it, we should have realised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for giving me the opportunity of speaking here this evening on the issue of the management of the flotation of Eircom by the Government. The flotation was a uniquely complex and extensive financial transaction in the history of the Irish public sector. It has continued to generate comment, both positive and negative, from the public and media over the past two years. The company, which has just passed out of public ownership, continues to have an important role in the future of Irish telecommunications and the economy generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the criticism of the Government in the period since flotation has been based on the myth that the State can offer a one-way bet on privatisation to the public. Of course, nobody in any country can make a commitment that the shares of a floated company will not drop in price, and <Col N="991" /> no such commitment was made at the time of the Eircom float. The opposition motion seeks to censure the Government on the grounds of alleged mismanagement of the Eircom flotation.</P>
    <P>Eircom has been a private company for almost two and a half years. Senators will know in that period the Government has had no responsibility in relation to either its commercial operations or its capital structure. Senators will be aware there have been major changes in the sector in this period. There has been a major global downturn in the sector. Jobs have been lost internationally. Companies have failed. Share prices, particularly those with exposure to the dotcom operations, have tumbled.</P>
    <P>Senators will also know that, in the initial nine months after its flotation, the Eircom share traded at or above its flotation price on all but 12 out of 194 trading days. The motion is an opportunistic exercise driven by current weakness in the sector globally almost two and a half years after the offering. The motion is driven by the absurd logic that the Government is somehow responsible for share price weakness after flotation or that it could have reasonably foreseen it taking place and failed to warn potential shareholders of its likelihood.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to find a single independent observer outside this House who can support this ludicrous proposition. The prospectus in connection with the sale contained all information relevant to the share transaction. The mini-prospectus was distributed to all the 1.2 million people who registered their interest in purchasing shares.</P>
    <P>The offer documentation set out fairly the risks associated with investment in the Eircom stock. The mini-prospectus contained the following statement, addressed to all potential investors in the company:</P>
    <P>You should carefully consider the risks described below and information in the prospectus before purchasing shares. The value of your shares may be adversely affected by general market conditions and/or the possibility of further stock market offerings of the shares by, among others, KPN Telecom and Telia. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the shares will trade in the stock market subsequent to the offers at or above the price at which those shares are sold in the offers by the Ministers. In addition, if any of the risks summarised below actually occurs, the company's business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of its shares could decline.</P>
    <P>The mini-prospectus goes on to set out these risks as follows.</P>
    <P>Increasing competition in the fixed line services market is likely to result in material share loss and declining tariffs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" />The entrance of a third mobile operator will increase competition in the mobile communications services market and is likely to result in market share loss and declining mobile tariffs.</P>
    <P>The company's changing regulatory environment could limit its business opportunities and profitability.</P>
    <P>If the company does not successfully implement its transformation programme its ability to compete effectively in a liberalised market may be impaired.</P>
    <P>Rapidly changing technologies could require the company to make substantial additional investments and could increase competition.</P>
    <P>The company's revenues, profitability and growth rate could decline if growth in the Irish telecommunications market slows.</P>
    <P>The company's investments in new business areas and markets could require substantial capital investments and resources and may not succeed.</P>
    <P>The company's computer systems and the systems of third parties upon whom it relies may malfunction and interrupt its operations and services if they do not achieve year 2000 readiness.</P>
    <P>The company needs to hire and retain skilled personnel to remain competitive and implement its growth strategies.</P>
    <P>The company may be influenced by significant shareholders whose interests may not be aligned with yours.</P>
    <P>An adverse decision in legal proceedings could require the company to pay damages or fines or change its business practices.</P>
    <P>The company is dependent on its continuing good relationship with its employees and their trade unions.</P>
    <P>Actual or perceived health risks or other problems relating to mobile handsets or transmission masts could lead to litigation or decreased mobile communications usage.</P>
    <P>This is a comprehensive and sober list of risk factors associated with investing in Eircom. It demolishes the implications of the motion regarding lack of disclosure by the selling shareholder. It must also be recognised that all publicity material issued in connection with the sale stated that share values could go down as well as up.</P>
    <P>The prospectus dealing with the sale of shares in Eircom was cleared by the New York, London and Dublin stock exchanges in advance of the issue of the document in mid-June 1999. This involved an arduous process of clearance of texts lasting over a period of months. All the exchanges involved have testing standards in terms of the representation of all material relevant to a company being floated.</P>
    <P>The price range, which was set prior to the flotation, was agreed by both Government and the company. The final price of £3.07 was within this price range and just above the mid-point of the <Col N="993" /> range. Let us be quite clear about this. The prospectus is in its totality the responsibility of the board. The prospectus contained a price range and that price range was approved by the board.</P>
    <P>The balance sheet of the company at the time of the flotation was strong. The price set by the Government for Eircom at the flotation date was set on the basis of what the market was prepared to pay and based on the advice of expert advisers. The pricing of the shares in July 1999 involved balancing the need for a fair price for taxpayers and the need for a fair return for retail and institutional investors. Criticism was expressed in the immediate aftermath of the flotation from certain quarters that the price of the Eircom shares was set too low by the Government. It is worth remembering that the institutional offer was no less than 16 times oversubscribed even at the top of the price range. The views of these commentators, many of whom are the most respected and reputable journalists in the State, are best expressed by the following quotation from the press immediately after flotation: &ldquo;The obligation of the State as owner &ndash; since the State is the guardian of the public finances &ndash; was to sell Telecom at the highest price the market would bear.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government could have chosen to float the company at a higher price than it did, but chose not to do so. It received advice from one of the joint global co-ordinators to the offering, Merrill Lynch, to float the shares at £3.27. As the House knows, the launch price was £3.07. In the immediate aftermath of the flotation, the shares rose in price by 20%. The share traded well above flotation price for most of the initial year after the flotation. In the first three months of 2000, for example, the share price was not below the issue price and reached a high of £3.78 on a number of occasions in that period, a premium of 23% on the flotation price. In addition, bonus shares equivalent to 4% of their original investment were paid to investors who retained their shares up to 7 July 2000 and interim and final dividends have also been paid.</P>
    <P>This motion is not about the fundamentals underlying the Eircom flotation. It is seeking to use market conditions which developed well after the flotation for cynical ends. When the Government floated the company, it did so acting in the interests of all parties to the offer. There was a full and fair disclosure of information.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House, although someone else should be in the firing line. It is not fair to the Minister of State, who was not involved, that he has to come into the House to make such a case which will bring little comfort to the people who have lost a lot of money in the past couple of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one net issue in this debate tonight, namely, the accountability of the Mini<Col N="994" /> ster, Deputy O'Rourke, and of the Government for the unmitigated debacle which has cost many people a lot of money. No one who buys stocks or shares has a guarantee or a right to a guarantee. They have no more guarantee or right to be rewarded than the punter who puts his shirt on the 3.30 race at Navan. When 340,000 small shareholders, which is probably one out of every three or four households in the country, lost money on Eircom shares, why were they different? Why did they have a sense of grievance? Why had they a right to feel safe? The answer is simple. The Government told them they would be safe. Governments do not normally tell citizens to gamble with their hard earned money or, worse still, to borrow money with which to gamble.</P>
    <P>Through all the hype and oversell we experienced at that time, people were told this was an offer too good to be missed. They were told they could not afford to be left out. People queued up and vied with their neighbours because they did not want to be the ones who were not part of what they were told was the greatest national opportunity of all time. This was the time when three Ministers, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, vied with each other to bring the largesse to the people. They presented themselves at different times as the sole architects, the lords and lady bountiful who, out of their own largesse, would make us all rich capitalists. Who remembers the balloons, the hype, the champagne and the crass oversell? </P>
    <P>What made this different was that it was a Government promotion. In the past Governments urged people to invest in national bonds, national loans and prize bonds which were rock solid and were seen to be in the national interest. However, sadly for themselves, more than 380,000 people believed the brouhaha and propaganda floated. Good luck to some people who made money because they sold quickly and took their profits. Perhaps more of us wish we had been among them. However, the bulk of the people took the Government's advice and stayed in for what they believed would be the long haul.</P>
    <P>Was it a safe investment? The Minister's words answer that. When questioned in the other House on 18 February 1999 about whether this investment would sustain the difficulties ahead, she said:</P>
    <P>The power of telecommunications shares to withstand even the most volatile of market environments was evident recently. . . . . . I know my advisers are following the market trends closely so that we have the best advice available at the time when the price range needs to be set.</P>
    <P>Later on, she said:</P>
    <P>It is a personal objective of mine . . . . . that <Col N="995" /> the Irish people should be a significant beneficiary of this flotation. It is, after all, they who have contributed so much to the company's development and success over the years.</P>
    <P>If that point was not enough, she continued, &ldquo;The main benefit, as I see it, is the opportunity for the public to be part of the future of the company, to be able to share in its successes.&rdquo;  Some future and some success. How sour and hollow those words are in a few short years.</P>
    <P>The people who borrowed money and, in some cases invested their redundancy payments, believed this was a guarantee of their children's education or of their security in the years ahead. There were such people on every street in every village and town in this country. Where now are the promises that they would be part of the future of the company and that they would be able to share in its success? Those words ring hollow, particularly in recent weeks when people's shares were compulsorily acquired by Valentia in a smash and grab raid virtually unequalled in our history.</P>
    <P>It was not as if the Minister was not aware that privatisations could go wrong and that there were perils in the process. In a speech in this House on 31 March 1999 she said:</P>
    <P>It is not because of a blind desire to follow current international trends. There were highly misguided and misdirected privatisations within the UK in the 1980s, especially in the early 1980s, which did not result in better services to consumers but resulted in big fat cat salaries for groups of people at the top of such companies.</P>
    <P>That prophecy was borne out by the eloquent and powerful contribution of Senator Ross earlier this evening. The Minister knew what could happen because she was warned in advance. Yet she helped to create exactly the type of hype she had warned against. She could not forgo the appeal of the bountiful Mary, the populist. She also said on that occasion:</P>
    <P>People have slightly more money now &ndash; perhaps not enough &ndash; and I would like to think that ordinary people, perhaps in their kitchen at night, while talking about their children, their lives and so on would say there is a lot going on about Telecom shares and think about purchasing a share or two. . . . . . There is a mystique about shares. . . . . . Many speakers said we came late to all the processes. The fact that we came late is good because it enables us to learn from the mistakes of others and we can decide to do it in a more beneficial way.</P>
    <P>Some learning process. Perhaps it might have been better if the mystique had remained or if the Minister had not set out to persuade people that <Col N="996" /> their investment was safe, that Eircom was a Government scheme which could not fail and that the only losers would be those who did not take part. However, that is exactly what the Minister did not do.</P>
    <P>Is it the case that all those who invested in Eircom are losers? Far from it. There were some winners. There were those who sold early and took their profits &ndash; good luck to them. There are some Eircom employees, who will eventually be part of the new Valentia company, who will be winners, but there will be very many other employees of Eircom who will be without jobs when that time comes and who will not necessarily see themselves as winners.</P>
    <P>Sir Anthony O'Reilly is a winner. He and his backers have got a stranglehold on the Irish telecommunications industry and a company which had enormous potential for the public and which will now be a rich cash cow for the few in the years ahead. Good for them. The top managers of Eircom were winners, getting huge bonuses for losing so much of their investors' money. Some of them like Mr. Kane are now getting golden handshakes for having failed disastrously to meet already modest targets. The board of Eircom was a winner, as Senator Ross pointed out, as were the advisers. Some £78 million was spent on advice on how to get the flotation right &ndash; some advice. That is an enormous sum of money.</P>
    <P>The losers were the plain people of Ireland who believed the Minister and borrowed money on which they are now paying back interest. They are the people who invested because they believed that the Government told them the truth. They invested in the hope of securing their future or looking after the education of their children, or simply because they were told that this was a good investment because the Government said so and they could not lose. They did lose, however, and I can tell the Minister that they are waiting out there in the long grass and for many the election cannot come quick enough.</P>

      <P>I compliment the speakers from the Fine Gael Party. I was particularly impressed with the performances, if not the content of the contributions. I watched with interest as Senator Caffrey and subsequently Senator Manning made their contributions. I know that my party has been sending us to Carr Communications for courses, but obviously Deputy Noonan is sending Fine Gael Senators to the Abbey Theatre.</P>
      <P>I want to go back to the time of the launch. I happen to have with me a transcript of the debate on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on Thursday, 22 July 1999. Mr. Richard Crowley was in the chair and said:</P>
      <P>Spokesman Ivan Yates says it's politically unacceptable that, as he puts it, wealthy institutional investors will make a windfall profit ahead of Irish citizens. Ivan Yates is with us now. Good morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" /> Deputy Yates said &ldquo;Good morning, Richard&rdquo; and later added:</P>
    <P>Now, what I am calling for in very simple terms is that everyone who registers should be guaranteed up to £3,000 worth of shares. Now if they only want £500, that's fine and only after that should we decide what the institutions get. This is not Sherry Fitzgerald or Norwich Union we're selling, this is already a public asset.</P>
    <P>Mr. Crowley asked, &ldquo;Where did you get the £3,000 figure from?&rdquo; and Deputy Yates replied:</P>
    <P>The £3,000 figure, according to brokers that I've spoken to, that is a reasonable figure . . .  I asked yesterday, if you sign up what are you entitled to? You're entitled to absolutely nothing only preference to those who don't register, so you might only get £200 worth of shares.</P>
    <P>Mr. Crowley asked, &ldquo;That's all a lot of people will want though, isn't it?&rdquo; and Deputy Yates replied:</P>
    <P>No, I disagree. This is not a risky investment, this is a sure bet. The price at which it's selling is actually going to be, when it starts trading, this happened in the UK, you see huge windfall profits. You sell at one price, we'll say £1.60 and they suddenly, once they start trading at £2, there's already a built in mark up of 17%. I'm telling people this is money for old rope and in fact to help Telecom.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There was the spokesman for the main Opposition party at the time telling the people of Ireland on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this was money for old rope. However, two and a half years later I regret I did not have the wisdom then that I have now because, like Senator Ross, I must declare a certain interest. In fact, if the motion had condemned Senator Ross, I might well have supported it given that I sometimes read his column and perhaps was induced to gamble a little more money on it. There is a serious side to this also, however, that is, that it did present an opportunity for wider share ownership and at a time when people in Ireland are more affluent than at any stage in our history, the manner in which the shares declined mitigates against this.</P>
      <P>It was not just the spokesman for the main Opposition party who held such views. The spokesperson for the Labour Party, Deputy Rabbitte, wrote an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> at the time which was basically along the same lines, accusing the Government of unrivalled populism in pitching the price too low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The editorials in many of the newspapers did likewise. <i>The Irish Times,</i> in July 1999, stated &ldquo;By any objective criteria, the floatation of Telecom has been an outstanding success&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Government appears to have pitched the flotation price . . .  at precisely the right level; any<Col N="998" /> thing less and it would have been vulnerable to the charge that the company was being sold off too cheaply.&rdquo;  At the same time, in <i>The Sunday Tribune,</i> Matt Cooper wrote in similar terms, &ldquo;If they had been priced at 30p cheaper than the 307p level chosen, they still would have reached Thursday's closing price.&rdquo;  He went on to say that it would have been a dereliction of duty by the Government if, in fact, it had done so.</P>
    <P>If we want to be realistic and reasonable about this, we must accept that, while one invests in the stock market in the hope that one will gain, there is an equal risk of losing. The stock market is the one area where traditionally there have been higher returns than in other financial sectors. The reason the returns are higher is the risks are higher.</P>
    <P>In this case, as Senator Ross rightly pointed out, there was an issue for management and some of the ire must be directed in that quarter. There were initiatives which could have been taken. The disposal of Eircell was highly questionable. It was undoubtedly the largest asset of the company and it seems that in time it will prove to be a good investment by the purchasers. Once sold, it left the rest of the company open to a decline in the share price.</P>
    <P>In addition, the technology sector suffered a significant downturn and decline on a global scale during 2000. As has been said, many, myself included, were sitting on very handsome profits for almost 12 months, but I suppose the temptation was to look at these as long-term investments. Unfortunately the sale of Eircell and then the sale of the company did not allow people to recoup their losses.</P>
    <P>Senator Caffrey made a suggestion. While I might not subscribe to it, it is important to encourage people to participate in investing in the stock market with small amounts of money. It is interesting that many in the United States became extremely well off in the last decade through investing in the mutual funds in operation there. If we want to promote economic development and participation on a national basis in wealth creation, it behoves us to create a climate which encourages people to invest. Perhaps one way of dealing with this might be that instead of people being subject to capital gains tax on profits or carrying forward losses to off-set against future capital gains, up to a certain level there might well be a benefit in allowing them declare for income tax rather than capital gains tax. That is a two way process. It would mean that losses could be off-set against normal income tax and other earned income, but equally profits would be subject to income tax, which could be charged at a higher rate than capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>The exercise should be looked at to encourage people to participate more in the development of the financial sector. We saw, through the issue of the shares in Eircom, that a significant portion of the population was willing to pursue that line. It would be a pity if this exercise mitigates against that in the future. Our making light of it or our <Col N="999" /> making a political issue of it here does not help that process. That is one regret I have with regard to the debate tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>You are very kind. My understanding is that if you make a loss on the sale of shares you can write it off against tax. I have been so advised, but it could have been misinformation. There are a lot of misnomers flying around. Surely it is a misnomer to call the Eircom mess a flotation. The one thing the company did not do was float. It sank fairly dramatically and fairly rapidly, even though in the beginning there was a dazzling increase in the value of shares of 23%.</P>
      <P>That is the nature of the stock market. It is a kind of gamble and it is foolish to borrow large sums of money if you do not have the necessary wherewithal to punt it on what is essentially a gamble. If you are in the stock market you have to learn the psychology of when to buy and when to sell. If you want to make money you have to sell as high as possible and buy at the lowest. People are too greedy and they hold on to shares. They miss the correct point at which it is most advantageous for them to sell, but that is a matter of their judgment. The Government should not be required to compensate people for poor financial judgment. I regret their losses and I am not criticising the people. I feel deeply sorry for them, but it is a question of judgment and there was an opportunity for people to reap the profit and exit from the shareholding. Had I held shares, that is precisely what I would have done. I correct Senator Fitzgerald's contention that every single Member of both Houses bought shares. I did not. There was a time when I regretted it and I was rather jealous of those who had them.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a total lack of judgment, which is my usual form, I am sorry to say. I defend Deputy Yates. It has been put on the record that he said the flotation was money for old rope. Was he not right? That is precisely what it was. People paid in good money and all they got was a lot of old, useless rope. It was a very ropy deal indeed and the Deputy is to be congratulated on his foresight in pointing that out.</P>
      <P>My colleagues, Senators Ross and Manning, referred to one of the most significant abuses of the saga. One of them used the phrase &ldquo;rub salt in the wounds&rdquo; to refer to the extraction of very large sums of money by the directors from the company in direct receipts and bonuses. I do not understand the financial world and I do not understand how people can get rewarded for making a bags of things, but it seems to happen. It does not just happen here. One need only look at Marconi, which has gone down the tubes dramatically. Jobs have been lost there, yet the head of the company walked off with a million or two as well as a golden handshake to get rid of him. I simply do not understand it. Employees lose their jobs, investors lose their money, yet the people at the top of the pile keep creaming it off. There is something morally unappealing about that.</P>
      <P>I address the following to the House generally, not to one particular side &ndash; Senator Manning referred briefly to it. Persons were compelled to sell their shares to Valentia once their value got up to 80%. I do not see why that should be the case. I have only just started getting into this area as I have just inherited a small portfolio of shares. I never had them before. I went to see the stockbroker and we discussed the whole question. With my usual luck, having had to wait 18 months for the portfolio to be wormed out of the probate, my shares arrived just at the moment when the stock market had gone through the floor. I was comforted by the broker who told me that is how the stock market goes, but it will come back. At a time like this it is all a question of holding on. That is the advice of a professional stockbroker. However, in this case the small investors were not permitted to stay in the game to see if they could recoup their losses. They were compelled to sell to Valentia, thereby creating a monopoly, and that is wrong. It is unfair.</P>
      <P>I do not see why somebody should not be allowed to hold on and I wonder if what happened is constitutional. There are very significant protections for property under the Constitution. They are so significant that they have been used to bolster the rights of certain people in very unfair circumstances. A holding of shares constitutes property, therefore, what happened should not be legal. It may be that some amendment to the legislation is necessary and I call on the Government to look into that to see if something can be done to ensure that the merchant princes, financial tsars and overlords in the financial world cannot abuse their positions in these circumstances as they habitually do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" />Mention was made of restitution. That is absurd because you cannot provide restitution to those who lose money as a result of bad judgment. You cannot provide it to an individual, though seemingly you can to a bank. There have been several instances in recent history of banks making disastrous financial moves and the taxpayer has had to rescue them. However, it is not the kind of thing any Government should get into. Advice and warnings were given. Health warnings are put on packets of cigarettes and people like me still go out and buy them. They just hope they will not get cancer. There is no doubt that a legally adequate warning was attached to these shares. The Minister put it on the record and the words &ldquo;You should carefully consider the risks described below&rdquo; appeared on the prospectus. A list of all the things that could go wrong followed. People did not really believe them and perhaps there was a certain amount of hype, but you are hardly going to begin an attempt to float a company by saying, &ldquo;I really would not touch these shares with a barge pole, because I think they are absolutely rotten; we all know that the management is incompetent and there is going to be a decline in all technology stocks.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Nobody will do that, but there is a legal and a moral requirement to give a warning, and it was there in black and white. Those who have ears, let them hear; those who have eyes, let them read. People read it and they heard it, but they did not take it in. I feel a great deal of sympathy with those who lost money in this investment. It is sad, particularly for those who invested parts of pensions and money they could ill afford, money they were holding for their future. It is sad, but it is a tough old world. The one thing we can do is look at the law to see if it can be amended to ensure that in future the small investor is not bullied and penalised by large corporations and forced to sell shares against his or her will. Surely, this is the most undemocratic thing that can be done, yet it comes from sources that are always talking about the free market and the liberalisation of the global economy. That is all very well unless you are a small investor. If you are, alas, you are vulnerable and in trouble.</P>

      <P>I compliment Senator Walsh on rallying valiantly to the cause.</P>
      <P>The case has been made by Senator Ross and Members from the Government side that this was a straightforward case of investing in the stock market. It was anything but. It was the first time a State-owned company was floated and the public got an opportunity to invest. People who never spoke about shares and had never had shares in any other company began for the first time to speak about them. Why did they do so? Why was there such curiosity and interest? This was because the company was State owned and there was almost a State guarantee.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Government engaged in a major promotional and public relations exercise. There were advertisements on television and in the national media. This major promotion was repeated consistently and people were exhorted, coaxed and cajoled to invest because it was a sound and good investment. That is the reality. More than £78 million was spent by the Minister on PR companies and advisers to get innocent people to invest.</P>
      <P>That should be compared with a normal company floated on the stock market. What other listed company would engage in such major promotion to get people to invest in it? That does not happen; it is not normal practice. The normal rules of engagement did not apply when it came to investing in Eircom. That is why it is different. People were exhorted and coaxed to invest and they did so. Unfortunately, a large number lost heavily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the case put forward by Senator Walsh that it would be wise to offset losses against income tax. Unfortunately, many of these investors do not have a taxable income. Many of them are retired people, pensioners or people with young families who hoped to gain a little money to put aside to educate their children. Many people invested hoping to make a few pounds to extend their houses or invest in their small farms. The result for many of them was that they were seriously let down and suffered a serious loss which is a major hardship for a number of them. I know this and Senator Walsh and <Col N="1003" /> the Minister know and recognise it. There would be many more Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Members on the Government benches if this had been a success. The fact that so few of them are present is evidence that it was a downright disaster.</P>
    <P>Some 20% of people still hold out who do not want to sell to Valentia. They have no choice but to sell at the going rate and lose a great deal of money in the process. These people should have a right to choose whether to sell their shares at this stage but they have no choice. They are being forced to sell at a certain price and suffer major losses. As was said previously, they may wish to hold out for a future opportunity where they could make a profit, but they are not even left that choice. That is unacceptable and is an issue which should and must be addressed in a democracy because it does not equate with fair play and practice. Will the Minister examine that?</P>
    <P>We witnessed the various annual general meetings of Eircom where small shareholders turned up and created a considerable degree of noise. We also witnessed the board of the company and its senior executives being very smooth and being well able to manage the crowd. Only a few people had major investments and they made the decisions. The majority of shareholders did not receive a hearing. At the same time, the board and the senior executives have been paid massive salaries for mismanaging the company. All the board members and the people at the top did extraordinarily well at a time when investors were losing dramatically.</P>

      <P>That is constitutionally unacceptable where a State company is concerned. A publicly quoted company on the stock market is different from a State company. For the State and the Government to preside over this scenario is unacceptable. How can the Minister justify giving Mr. Kane a large salary and a handsome pay-off to vacate his position? How could the Government have allowed the board to be so handsomely compensated on the one hand, while at the same time allowing the ordinary, plain people to suffer what was to them a dramatic loss? The proportions might be small, relatively speaking, but the reality is that it has created huge hardship. There is a fundamental issue of natural justice which the Government needs to address for future flotations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, is very adept at flitting between the crises which arise in her Department. While we love to see the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, present, it is time the Minister came to the House and became accountable to it. I hope we will not see the Minister of State tomorrow when I hope to raise a matter on the Adjournment. I hope the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, deals with it and that I do not see the Minister of State's nice face. It is unacceptable <Col N="1004" /> that she should consistently avoid coming to the House when matters become a little tetchy.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear Senator Ross's contribution. He may have forgotten, but if he checks the various contributions he wrote as financial editor in the business section of the <i>Sunday Independent,</i> he will see that he can be thrown in with the other outfits which actively, consistently and strongly encouraged investment.</P>

      <P>He spoke this evening in such a haughty way as if to say that he could not understand the tenor and tone of the Fine Gael motion. He is one of the people at whom the finger can be pointed for actively encouraging ordinary people to invest. I hope he will draw a comparison between normal stock market flotations and this one. This was unique. It stood apart in every aspect from anything else. People who did not normally involve themselves in any type of investment or stocks suddenly became interested.</P>
      <P>I am sure all of us as public representatives had people approach us asking what we thought. I advised them to forget about it or to be very careful. The reality is that people who did not have a clue invested on the word of the Minister and the almost certain guarantee of the Department and the State. It was seen as an absolutely guaranteed asset. Unfortunately, the bottom has fallen out of that. These people deserve to have their case stated and to have a hearing. The Government has a responsibility to address the fundamental issues of natural justice which have been contravened in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and feel sorry for him that he must listen to this debate when the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, should do it. We have been given the reason she is not present, which is that she is at a very important meeting. The Minister must have many important meetings to attend because she has not faced up to this matter. She will shortly have to face up to it, however, because the people will be waiting in the long grass for the Government following this flotation debacle. Senator Norris said it could not be called a flotation because the whole thing sank, and we all agree with that.</P>
      <P>I feel sorry for private individuals who have lost a fortune in this affair. They were misled by the Government and the banks. They were invited in by bank managers who assured them that this flotation was the best thing since the sliced pan and that they could not lose on it. The majority borrowed a fortune on the strength of those assurances and now they have to repay the loans. In a couple of weeks' time when they have sold their shares they will receive a note informing them of how much they owe the bank manager. That is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Caffrey is right to propose that some <Col N="1005" /> form of restitution should be made through tax relief or some other method. Those people were led up the garden path and they have lost a fortune. I have no sympathy for the institutions who invested in Telecom shares, but I have great sympathy for private individuals who invested their life savings and others who borrowed on the strength of making a few pounds. They now find that the whole lot has gone down the Swanee.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan said that this House allowed an extra 5% of the shares to be made available to Telecom workers at the time of the flotation. Company employees got 15% of the shares which they were able to sell in a block, thus making it easier for Valentia to take control of the company. It was a disaster for private individuals and small investors who lost their savings.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, has much to answer for. She has responsibility for Aer Lingus, Luas, the ESB and all the public utilities, none of which is working out. They are all in a disastrous position at present. We should have a debate on the sale of State assets. This was the first flotation of a semi-State company and it looks like being the last. If the rest of them are privatised on the same basis as Telecom, it will be a total disaster. If one asks them, ordinary people say that the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, has been a disaster regarding this matter. The truth is that she is afraid to come into this House and is even afraid to answer for her deeds in the Lower House.</P>
    <P>Earlier, in his speech, the Minister of State said:</P>
    <P>The price range, which was set prior to the flotation, was agreed by both Government and the company. The final price of £3.07 was within this price range and just above the mid-point of the range. Let us be quite clear about this. The prospectus is in its totality the responsibility of the board. The prospectus contained a price range and that price range was approved by the board.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is right to say that the board is responsible for the prospectus but the Government should also accept the blame. As previous speakers pointed out, the company's board members made a fortune from bonuses but, as Senator Ross said, very few of them bought shares in the company. None of them showed confidence in the company. One would think that people earning large sums of money from Telecom would have shown some confidence in the company by investing in it, but they did not. The Government and the board members got it completely wrong and the ordinary person who borrowed heavily to buy Telcom shares must now pay the piper. Some of them put up their houses and other property to purchase shares. In some cases, those houses will have to be sold to pay debts arising from the bad judgment of the Government and the banks.</P>
    <P>Banks are partly to blame for what happened because money was made too freely available to people to buy those shares. The banks, Merrill <Col N="1006" /> Lynch and the Government were in collusion in advertising the shares. I agree with Senator Caffrey's call for some form of restitution for those who lost heavily on the Telecom shares deal. The public will be waiting in the long grass for the Government when it goes to the country in the coming months. There is no doubt about that.</P>

      <P>I admire the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, for his guts and commitment in being here tonight, unlike the senior Minister who has once again funked the issue. I am delighted, however, to see her two trusty lieutenants, Senator Walsh and Senator Liam Fitzgerald. The latter is normally here when the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, attends the House. I am disappointed the Leader of the House is not here because he hopes to enter the Dáil on the Minister's coat-tails. Given his close relationship with the Minister in the Westmeath constituency, I would have thought he would be here.</P>

Recently, however, she was prominent during a promotion for the shortest-running Luas in history, outside the front gates of Leinster House. The Minister is rarely shy of photocall opportunities but she has allowed the Minister of State to attend the House on her behalf. Perhaps she is sheltering in one of the Minister of State's bunkers. It is not proper, particularly given the fanfare of the promotion, that she has neither the honesty nor respect for the House to attend it.</P>

      <P>Given the history of what has occurred, this issue warrants close scrutiny. It has involved financial hardship for many thousands <Col N="1007" /> who, it is fair to say, were misled by the Government's statements, promises, exhortations and projections in regard to what was going to happen. I appeal to the Minister, on behalf of the many, particularly pensioners who probably invested some of their hard earned savings on the basis of getting an extra return over and above interest rates, that they be looked at favourably in regard to whatever relief can be granted. That is all we are asking. We are not appealing on behalf of institutional investors.</P>
      <P>I would be happy to support amendment No. 1 in the names of Senators Ross and Norris who referred to the many officials who claimed large bonuses, extra remuneration and who possibly sold off at the right time. I suggest that some of the people concerned and some aspects of this debacle be looked at because there is no doubt many have lost a large amount. Some invested their savings, others invested lump sums while others borrowed. It is a valid criticism that no more than borrowing money to gamble on the Stock Exchange or any form of sport, it is not advised. For our part, I hope some restitution can be made, in particular, to the small shareholder. In supporting the motion I ask the Minister when matters are being looked at that some compassion be shown to these shareholders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be associated with previous speakers. I express strong views in regard to the sale of Telecom. While there is a Government amendment to the motion, few have spoken on it. Are they embarrassed or is there a question of whether it is wrong? It states:</P>
      <P>Seanad Éireann notes that all legal requirements associated with the flotation of Telecom Éireann stock were met in full by the Government and its advisers in the offer and that the price of the shares represented the market value of the company at the time, was within the range recommended by the Government's advisers and, most importantly, represented fair value for the taxpayer in the transaction.</P>
      <P>In theory, that is a fine reply and a good amendment. However, what we are talking about is realism, money spent by every second household in the country. We allowed this to happen, yet we do not apologise for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first time any of our semi-State companies was sold off and it will certainly be the last. Irrespective of what will happen, nobody except those who know they will benefit, such as management and middle management in the particular companies concerned, will make for many of our companies. I always believed we should not have sold Telecom. We pushed very hard here to ensure the workers of Telecom would get a fair share for the contribution they made to the company. The Government of the day &ndash; Govern<Col N="1008" /> ments from all sides were involved &ndash; proposed a 9.9% shareholding for the individual employees.</P>
    <P>I am of the strong view that employees should get a proper share of a company if they are seen to have improved it. An example in the private sector would be a Cork company, Musgraves, which was the first to suggest the idea of an employee shareholding for its employees. It is an excellent idea. I never thought I would see the day when employees, as a share group, could sell off a company to eliminate other employees. That is not the idea behind a shareholding. The idea is that an individual employee could use it for his or her benefit for future days. One cannot do this in the private sector and it should not have been allowed in the public sector.</P>
    <P>We had a situation where the employees as a group who held 14.9% shares were allowed to dictate. That should never have been allowed to happen. That was not what was intended when Senators tried to ensure employees would get a shareholding. If that was the position, 51% of a group of employees could tell the other 49% they want to sell. That is exactly what happened with Sir Anthony. The Valentia Group was buying because it had control of the employees. The Government should not have allowed this to happen. No Government should have allowed it to happen, yet the Government amendment states that everything is above board and correct. Everthing is not above board and correct. It is not above board and correct that even mothers and fathers of employees who worked in Telecom lost money and that those, to whom we, as legislators, gave a shareholding were responsible for selling it off to those who would make massive amounts of money. How can the Minister say that with an amendment like this and yet make no apology to the people? </P>
    <P>I understand what stocks and shares are about, one can have losses and gains. We never thought it would move to such an extent. It was probably set up in that way by management in Telecom. It could easily have been done in that way in order that the people concerned would make more money. Management was paid and we are not even given an apology. Management is getting and has got massive increases, even when the stocks were dropping. No apology was made by the Government or for that matter by this or the other House. An apology should be made. We should apologise and say we got it wrong. We should not be afraid to say so.</P>
    <P>As a transport union member, I readily admit I am one of those who got it wrong when I said we should give shares to individuals. Little did I think the shares would be given to a group of employees. Some 14.9% of the total structure of the company was able to set up and nobody could get inside Sir Anthony, because it was done on the first day with the help of the Government. The Government should not have tabled an <Col N="1009" /> amendment. We should be broadminded enough to stand up and say we got it wrong. Not alone did we get it wrong, once we said shares could be sold by the employees as a group it meant 51% of the employees in the company could sell off shares to the Valentia Group to eliminate more workers. That is not the idea in giving shares. The idea is to ensure the company is improved and enhanced and that everybody gains accordingly. That is what happens in the private sector. In Musgraves, for example, the shares started 22 or 23 years ago and every year there is an enhancement. One can imagine how Musgraves has progressed since the shareholdings were given to workers. It is the opposite in this case. Let us ensure the same does not happen in Aer Lingus where the workers might get a share and act as a group and sell it off. That would present a problem for us.</P>
    <P>We have no objection to employees as individuals getting shares, but they were certainly set up in such a way that Sir Anthony would do well. We blew it and there should be no amendment stating that everything is above board. Everything is not above aboard. A public apology should be made by the relevant Minister to those who were wronged. I am not saying they were bought at an excessive price. The advice was well set by the so-called great advisers, but the fact is that there were ten or 12, as other speakers have said.</P>
    <P>It is dreadful that I, as a trades unionist, have to stand up and say in this House that the fault lies with the 14.9% of the shareholders who did not sell their shares or give anybody else an option. No group, other than the Valentia Group, got an option on the sale of Eircom. No other group who tried hard to offer a price, irrespective of whether it was Denis O'Brien's group or any other group, got an option on the sale. I do not know who they were nor do I want to, but it should have been an open market and under no circumstances should any group have control over the workforce. That is exactly what they had. It is a shame.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>Due to unforeseen circumstances, I apologise for not being able to be here for the entire debate, as I would have liked to have heard all the contributions. I forgot to welcome the Minister of State earlier and to sympathise with him for having to sit through this debate, given he was not one of those initially responsible for what has turned out to be a disaster for many shareholders.</P>
      <P>The central point I tried to make in my contribution seems to have been overlooked or ignored. The Minister of State said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The balance sheet of the company at the time of the flotation was very strong. The price set by the Government for Eircom at the flotation date was set on the basis of what the <Col N="1010" /> market was prepared to pay and based on the advice of expert advisers.</P>
    <P>The central tenet of my argument is that the Government created an artificial market with the use of £74 million worth of public money to entice people to buy shares. There was no question of whether the shares were priced at the correct level. If the Government had not embarked on that PR exercise and media hype that allowed a false image to be created, the public would have looked more realistically at what was before them. They would view the prospectus, as they would any other prospectus published in the national newspapers, on the basis of what they see in front of them, but they relied on the Government's assessment of this flotation. Its official assessment was that this was a share to buy. That is the central point of my argument. It is not that the share price was set too low or too high, but given the state of the market at the time it was probably set too high.</P>
    <P>In relation to the privatisation philosophy, this flotation was probably the death knell of privatisation. I am glad the Government did not sell Aer Lingus because if it did, Oscar Wilde's famous saying, &ldquo;To lose one parent . . .  may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness,&rdquo; would be very apt. That is what would have happened in that situation. I am glad people were not cajoled into buying shares in Aer Lingus. Luckily or unluckily things went the wrong way.</P>
    <P>The Government owes it to the small investors to make recompense for the fact that it was on its assessment of the value of this share that they bought in the first place. If the Government had kept its hands out of this, the public would probably have left it to the banks and other institutions to underwrite the flotation. It did not do that because it thought the flotation might have collapsed. Senator Norris referred to it sinking rather than floating. That is what happened. The Government and the Minister, who is not here to take the flak for this, must accept responsibility for their involvement in this exercise.</P>
    <P>As Senator Burke said, the public will be waiting to give their response to this when the general election is called. Let us not forget that 500,000 plus investors invested in this company. Fortunately I was not one of them. That has all to be reckoned with.</P>
    <P>I met a lady on the stairs on the way up to this Chamber half an hour ago who showed me a cheque for &euro;465 that she got this morning for her £1,000 investment plus a few Vodafone shares thrown in for luck. That is the reality. That is what small investors are facing. The Government must acknowledge its contribution in this exercise.</P>
