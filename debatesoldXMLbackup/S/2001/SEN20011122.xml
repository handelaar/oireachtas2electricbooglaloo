    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 2000 [<i>Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil</i>]  &ndash; Report and Final Stages; No. 2, Youth Work Bill, 2000 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two items on the Order of Business. The Leader will be aware that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in the Lower House and the Government Chief Whip have finalised a major package of Dáil reform which I believe will be published next week. Has the Leader plans to have such a procedure adopted in this House to examine the functioning of the House with a view to reform? I do not want him to say that we have had a review of Standing Orders. That is not what I am talking about; I am talking about a major package of reforms.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Leader indicated that he would have no difficulty in having a debate on the Eircom debacle. Will he make time available next week for such a debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is to my satisfaction. I ask the Leader of the House to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to speak to the House regarding the appointment earlier this year by the Courts Service of a barrister to report on <i>in camera</i> cases within the family courts. This appointment was much welcomed by those who feel that we have very little knowledge of what goes on in the family courts. Senator Norris and I have put down motions and we are supported by the Independent Senators on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is considerable unease that there is very little information about what happens there. Unfortunately, the Courts Service was apparently told that the <i>in camera</i> rule meant that not even a barrister appointed by it to report anonymously could be present. I ask that the Minister for Jus<Col N="918" /> tice, Equality and Law Reform come to the House to explain what he thinks should be done about the situation because there is much public concern about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to invite the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to the House. The Estimates are being dealt with at present but the rates support grant has not been paid and the local authorities do not know what will be their allocation. There are serious questions in relation to waste management. Clinical and hazardous waste is being dumped in County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>The Minister is proposing to allow the erection of mobile phone masts without the need for planning permission. These are all current serious issues within the brief of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I also ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to the House to discuss waste management. This morning we hear again about the discovery of another illegal dump in County Wicklow which contains human tissue and medical files. This must be addressed urgently. This debate could be widened to include the disposal of animal waste on farms and the proposed regulations regarding its application on land as well as artificial fertilisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That was precisely the point I had intended to raise and I would like to back it up. It is quite extraordinary that there should be this dumping of medical waste. This is the second time this has happened within a matter of six weeks. The first site covered about two acres but this one is ten acres of hospital waste including human tissue, bandages and the personal records of hospital patients.</P>
      <P>There is a really serious need for a debate on this issue because it simply cannot be allowed to continue. It is a health hazard as well as an invasion of privacy. People would feel very unhappy with the notion that private documentation about their medical condition is flying around all over the countryside and we need an explanation for this from the responsible authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for an early debate on the situation in Afghanistan because it seems that it is not as newsworthy as it was and the dramatic war pictures are disappearing. We should remember that at the end of the camera we also have a human tragedy and in the vacuum that now exists there is a very grave danger that the normal international rules of war will not apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The humanitarian issue could take second place to the question of what regime or administration will be put in place there. While there may be a victory where the war is concerned, at <Col N="919" /> the same time we have to think long term and I would be afraid that in this vacuum many things might happen that we would not agree with. We should have the opportunity in this House to debate that and hopefully make a helpful contribution as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the Leader informed me that the Government health strategy will be published next Monday. In light of that, will the Leader allocate time next week for a debate and statements to give the response of the Upper House to that health strategy? This will be one of the more important documents that the Government will publish in its entire lifetime and one which will elicit much debate in the coming months.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Government to ensure that the task force report on autism which has been leaked to the newspapers, and is widely reported this morning, be circulated as soon as possible, particularly to Members of the Oireachtas? I understood that it was the Government's intention to publish it after Christmas but clearly this now needs to be brought forward. This is a hugely important issue which appears to have revealed serious neglect of a substantial number of people and their families. It is urgent that it be published at this stage.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader inquire of the Government when it is likely that the issue of compensation for those affected by the Government's road plans will be finalised? We have heard many conflicting reports as to the time &ndash; that it is two weeks away, it is nearly there, documents are about to be signed and agreement is about to be signed off in the Department of the Environment and Local Government. There are so many people affected that it is urgent that we know where the issue stands and when we can expect to hear details of the compensation package which the Government intends to put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I know we had a debate on this before but it is important that we have another debate on alcohol abuse. Our chief superintendent, speaking to Sligo Corporation, told us that 100% of arrests for public disorder result from alcohol abuse which takes place between 11 p.m. and 4 a.m. At least 50 more people will be killed as a result of alcohol between now and the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any other substance caused such havoc in our society there would be uproar. Why do we have such a lenient approach to the terrible scourge of alcohol? The superintendent also said that the Garda never arrest a sober person or a pioneer. Is that not a significant statement for a superintendent to make? Is it not a clear indication that all of us should think of those statistics and think of what our young people are getting involved in. <Col N="920" /> We need a serious debate so as not to allow more heartbreak into homes before Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on the Eircom debacle. Will the Leader indicate on the Order of Business when he will allocate time for this next week? </P>
      <P>I also support the calls for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come into the House. There are currently five or six areas in relation to the environment that urgently need to be debated. These include matters such as the housing strategies being adopted by local authorities, the issue of waste management to which several speakers have referred, the rate support grant which is not indicated by the Minister to the local authorities at the moment when they are in the middle of finalising their estimates, in addition to the shortage of local authority housing. The entire housing area is in crisis and needs urgent debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe we have sunk so low we have allowed such disrespect for the law. I am incensed over what has happened with illegal waste disposal in County Wicklow. It is not the first time it has happened and it is over a wide area. It must have been evident to the public that this was taking place.</P>
      <P>I gather this has only arisen since the privatisation of waste disposal. If so, did we allow it to take place at a time when we had not put laws into operation that would prevent such abuses? What really aggravates me is that I gather the penalties imposed by the courts have been puny. Is that our fault as legislators or is it the fault of the courts? </P>
      <P>We need the Minister to tell us what is happening and what he intends to do about it. I really do not want another debate, I want action. It is time there was some action in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Education and Science on the setting up of the task force to investigate the needs of people with disability, particularly those with autism. Will the Leader invite the Minister to the House now that their findings have been produced to allow us to discuss them? I believe there are some 150 recommendations in all. This House has a major contribution to make in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>A few weeks ago some of my colleagues asked for a further debate on the banking system and I ask the Leader today if that would be possible. I was shocked when I recently went into my local bank to get a replacement for my deposit book and this was refused. Since then I have had calls from at least four elderly constituents who are in a similar position. This is the only record small depositors have of where they stand on a daily basis. I believe they may be issued with a bank statement every six months and that is tot<Col N="921" /> ally unacceptable. The next step will be to tell them they are not wanted in the bank. We have had many changes in the banking system and it appears that the bigger their profits get the less well they treat their customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning referred to the Dáil reform that will be announced next week. It is my intention to set up a sub-committee in the coming weeks to advance our position in regard to Seanad reform.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning and Burke called again for an urgent debate on Eircom and as I said yesterday I am endeavouring to have this debate. I have no difficulty whatsoever in allocating time for this as soon as it is convenient for the Minister. It is of the utmost importance that the Minister should be present to put the facts on the record of the House.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry referred to appointment by the Courts Service of a barrister to review<i> in camera</i> proceedings in the family courts and I will pass on her views to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Senators Costello, Norris, Burke and Quinn called on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to the House to debate various local authority matters, especially the scandalous dumping of medical waste over the past number of months. It is shocking and horrifying and should not be allowed to continue. I will endeavour to have that issue debated in the House next week.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Murchú called on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to update the House on the Afghan conflict. All of us concur that normal international wartime standards should be adhered to and I will seek such a debate.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara raised a number of issues, including the Minister for Health and Children's health strategy which is due to be published next week. I intend to schedule an all day debate on the strategy after Christmas. As I outlined on the Order of Business yesterday, quite a number of Bills are due before the House on which we want to make progress. However, I will schedule an all day debate during the first week after the Christmas recess. This will give Members plenty of time to read the strategy which will transform our health service.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara also called for the report of the task force on autism to be published and I will pass on her views to the Minister for Education and Science. I will also pass on her views to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government regarding the compensation package for landowners affected the Government's road building plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Farrell called for a further debate on alcohol abuse. This is timely and I thank Members who contributed to the Private Members' debate last night, although I regret that it was not televised. The Minister of State at the <Col N="922" /> Department of Environment and Local Government launched a national anti-drink driving campaign yesterday while Senator Quinn's motion on road safety was debated last night, yet neither received any television coverage.</P>
    <P>The European Communities and Swiss Confederation Bill, 2001, was initiated in the House yesterday by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and that also was not covered by &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;. I understood that 25% of the programme would be devoted to the Seanad and I will make the strongest possible written submission later to the Director General of RTÉ in regard to the broadcasting of the work of the House in future. The Minister for Foreign Affairs spent three hours here yesterday and the Bill should at least have been referred to during &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;. It is of the utmost importance that all Bills initiated in the House are covered and the public, to whom RTÉ has a responsibility as the national broadcaster, should be informed that progress is being made in various areas.</P>
    <P>I will pass on Senator Kett's congratulations to the Minister for Education and Science. It is also appropriate that we should review the report of the task force. Senator Bonner called for a debate on banking, which is timely in the context of the upcoming budget. I agree with the sentiments he expressed and with the view of the public in general that the banks are holding their fire until the general election has been held before closing many rural branches. Various other requests have been made in regard to banking over the past number of weeks and these can be addressed in the debate.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil. In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question, &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil. This is looked upon as the Report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. The only matters, therefore, which may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil. For Senators' convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments. Senators may speak only once on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" />Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is mian liom na leasaithe a rinne Dáil Éireann sa Bhille seo a mholadh don Teach seo.</P>
      <P>Essentially, the Bill as passed by the Seanad last year ensures that the independent statutory Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board will automatically explain all decisions made by it after this Bill becomes law and, on request, past decisions also. The Bill clarifies inspection powers of the board and of any consultants or advisers appointed by it.</P>
      <P>Since the Bill was passed by the Seanad last year, the Attorney General advised that the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board could not recruit or employ staff directly. That could be a serious impediment to the effective and efficient operation of the board. I reviewed the statutory provisions for An Bord Pleanála on which the appeals board is modelled and sponsored a group of amendments to the Bill to allow the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board to recruit and employ staff directly, subject to standard ministerial controls, as An Bord Pleanála can.</P>
      <P>The principal amendment of that group is amendment No. 5, which inserted new sections 35A to D in the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, modelled on sections 120 to 123, inclusive, of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, for staff in An Bord Pleanála. Consequential amendments Nos. 6 to 13, inclusive, arise from amendment No. 5.  </P>
      <P>A review of the legislation for An Bord Pleanála also pointed to the need to mirror statutory provisions designed to avoid conflict of interest, by disqualifying a Member of the Dáil, Seanad, European Parliament or local authority from being the chairperson or member of the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board at the same time. Amendments Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, refer.</P>
      <P>The opportunity was also taken to copperfasten licence fees determined administratively for licences granted for aquaculture purposes under legislation replaced by the comprehensive Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997. Amendments Nos. 1 and 14 refer.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General's office has advised that express statutory provision as proposed is the only way to remove doubt about the validity of licence fees imposed administratively, that is other than by way of regulations provided for in section 15 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, for fish culture licences or section 54 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, for aquaculture licences. Both sections 15 and 54 have been repealed as provided for in sections 5 and 4 respectively of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with licence fee rates determined administratively in 1987, over £1.5 million <Col N="924" /> in fees has been collected in respect of the licences concerned, with a further £600,000 or so due for payment during the remainder of their currency. Licence fees at the rates determined administratively in 1987 were agreed to by the licensees and therefore where the licences in question have some time yet to run before they expire, those licence fees at those rates will apply for the remainder of the licence period. The proposed statutory provision copperfastens that fees position.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about the validity of any fees imposed under the foreshore Acts in respect of foreshore licences granted for aquaculture purposes on State-owned foreshore. Those Acts do not require the making of regulations to impose licence fees. The Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997 made comprehensive new provision for new aquaculture licensing and replaced all previous aquaculture licensing legislation. It also expressly provided for the imposition of licence fees by ministerial regulations and such regulations were made in 1998. Those regulations provided for increased rates of licence fees in respect of licences granted under that Act or earlier ones renewed under that Act. Those regulations also provided for a new fee to be charged for applications to renew licences granted, as well as a new fee to be charged for applications for licences or reviews of licences, to take account of increased administrative costs.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 15 is a technical amendment to the collective citation of the Fisheries Acts in the last section of the Bill, so as to take account of enactment of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 2000 since this Bill was initiated in Seanad Éireann in June 2000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I also welcome the conclusion of this Bill for a number of reasons. I see that all the amendments were agreed in the Dáil. The Bill is amended, rightly, to ensure that the licences appeals board will automatically explain all decisions made by it after the Bill becomes law. Every decision the appeals board makes in relation to the granting of licences should be accompanied by an explanation as to why the decision was made. The Bill also clarifies the inspection powers. A Bill that was with the House in the late 1990s gave us some concern in relation to the inspection powers of various boards or consultants acting on their behalf. This Bill goes some way to clarifying that and putting it on an even footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill was also amended to disbar members of local authorities from participating on the board. This is frequently becoming the case in relation to a range of boards. On wonders why this is, because local authority members can bring much expertise, coming as they do from various walks of life. I disagree with this amendement. <Col N="925" /> However, it was agreed in the Dáil and I do not want to hold up the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the other amendments and the Department and the fisheries board are to be complimented. They have done great work over the years. Mayo County Council has recently had difficulties with the North Western Fisheries Board in relation to planning. It has great concerns, as does the council, about planning issues and I hope that all boards and local authorities can work together because it is very important that the fisheries industry be put on a good footing. I welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House, particularly as he is the one who, over the past few years, has pushed this area forward into working operation. I welcome the amendments made in the Dáil, in particular amendment No. 1 which allows the board to employ people. Since the Minister of State first got his hands on this there have been many changes and a plethora of objections to certain applications and to operations that had been granted permission. All kinds of objections have been raised recently. I am glad that staff will be available to the board to enable them to examine all aspects in relation to licences because we want to see openness, public consultation and the public view considered where reasonable.</P>
      <P>I have to agree with some of Senator Burke's sentiments in relation to local authority members. There are a number of members I know who would bring much experience to this area. Many of them are from the local communities and know the local history and traditions that pertain to coastal areas. The major change here, apart from copperfastening the licensing structure, is that there has been a significant amount of money received in recent years and I hope that much of this money will be used to improve aquaculture.</P>
      <P>The significant change implemented in the Dáil is to the powers of the inspectorate and the board in making decisions open to scrutiny. This is based on the same structure that applies in Bord Pleanála. There is one area that I have difficulty with in Bord Pleanála which is the system by which inspectors examine objections and appeals and furnish a report to the applicant or objectors. For a fee the public, the applicant or objector can get not just the decision but also a full copy of the inspector's report. This explains clearly the inspector's rationale. There is considerably more information there than in a normal application through the local authority. While it is possible to read the file in the local authority, it is not possible to understand the thinking of the person who made the decision because that remains in that person's head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reports of the inspectors from An Bord Pleanála that I have read have been very thorough and explanatory. On at least two occasions <Col N="926" /> in the past four years I have seen inspectors' reports that have either gone with or against the planning authority's decision. The reasoning is very exact and it is easy to understand from where the inspector came. However, the board gave a decision totally contrary to the inspector's report. Nothing in the documentation clarifies why the board overruled the inspector's decision. That gives reason to believe that something underhand went on in the board's decision.</P>
    <P>Knowing the landscape and the circumstances that pertain to both cases, I agreed totally with the inspector's report, which went with the local authority decision. Everybody with common sense saw the reasoning behind the inspector's report and the decision of the council in the first place. However, somewhere along the line somebody in the board or the board in general overruled that inspector's decision.</P>
    <P>The situation here would not be as thorough. Will the employee of the appeals board that goes out to look at the case again review it as thoroughly as the inspector from An Bord Pleanála or will he or she basically look at the decision of the Minister and the documents that are on file? Maybe it does not apply here and it is not investigated thoroughly. I would like to see it done as thoroughly as An Bord Pleanála but maybe ultimately if the board reverses the inspector's decision, it should have to explain why it made that decision.</P>
    <P>I hope we can pass this Bill. Aquaculture will be of huge benefit to many coastal communities in the future. I know the Government is anxious to get many aquaculture projects operational. Unfortunately, there are many objectors &ndash; some people feel they must object to everything. The Minister was in Donegal recently launching the CLAMS report and he is aware that there are significant difficulties. I have been at meetings of the Donegal county council fisheries and coastal committee and people have come in to make accusations. Many of the objectors have vested interests. Some areas are yet to be examined and we are at our infancy in this area. However, some of the objectors go overboard. With the effort the Minister and his officials are putting in, I know we will get it right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the Bill. Aquaculture has been an extraordinarily important part of our economy over the past three decades. The improvements in licensing brought forward by the Minister are important. Licensing is important because improper development will certainly not be of benefit to anyone. Ireland is one of the countries that can benefit most from the huge demand for fish within the European Union. I recently heard that about one third of the fish consumed in the world is eaten in the European Union. Although this is hard to <Col N="927" /> believe, apparently we are very big fish consumers. In view of the decrease in beef consumption, we should boost aquaculture.</P>
      <P>Proper licensing is essential. While I understand Senator Bonner's concerns about objectors in some cases, I prefer to see them coming forward. It is preferable for things to be looked at properly because there may be very reasonable objections and in some areas, fish farms have been set up in unsuitable places.</P>
      <P>Much more species of fish are now being farmed. Some pelagic and demersal fish that I never thought would be farmed are being brought forward. I am talking not only about mussel, oyster and scallop farms or even the huge salmon farms. There is a big increase in the numbers and type of farms setting up. We should not be too concerned about objectors because I expect the licensing authorities will deal with them very fairly.</P>
      <P>When looking at aquaculture, we also depend on wild fish. Brown trout and wild salmon are particularly important to the tourism industry and they are fished in exactly the same places where most of the aquaculture occurs. We need to be sure they can co-exist and become symbiotic if possible.</P>
      <P>As a doctor, I am aware of the public health aspect to this. We must ensure that fish farms are in suitable areas. A friend of mine working in public health dealt with a mussel farmer in the good old days, at least 20 years ago, and there was a serious problem regarding pollution of the mussels with e.coli. The legislation precluded them from sale on the domestic market, but there was a loophole, which allowed them to be exported. The farmer was extremely annoyed with the public health doctor who insisted that the mussels could not be exported to Paris. He felt he had a responsibility regardless of the legislation for avoiding an outbreak of gastroenteritis in Paris. I am glad those sorts of loopholes have long been closed.</P>
      <P>However, it is important to remember that there are aspects other than economic ones such as public health. The Minister has made a great job of the Bill and I am sure it will be a great help to all those involved in the industry and living in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their indulgence and their interesting remarks. As we are collecting fees in relation to two kinds of licences, those before the 1997 Act and those under the 1997 Act, to which the regulations apply, it is necessary that pre-1997 Act licence fees are legally secured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The independent statutory Aquaculture Licence Appeals Board was established in June 1998 under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, and comprises a chairperson, Conor Mag<Col N="928" /> uire SC, and six ordinary members. Dr. Ann Quinn was appointed deputy chairperson on 12 November to fill a vacancy created by the resignation of Ms Berna Grist.</P>
    <P>The Aquaculture Licence Appeals Board has dealt with a substantial caseload in a commendable way. To date it has determined appeals against 96 ministerial decisions, 94 to license and two to refuse to license aquaculture operations. The board only overturned three ministerial decisions, two to license and one to refuse a licence. Appeals against a further 25 ministerial decisions to license await determination by the board. Some 121 out of a total of 460 ministerial decisions were appealed. It is fairly clear that people are taking this appeals board seriously.</P>
    <P>The appeals board came about because a particular application for a licence, which was granted by me, was appealed and the appeal determined against me. The offended person felt that he should have had access to the reasons for that decision by the appeals board. He could not get the decision but under this new legislation he will be provided with the reasons because this is to be applied retrospectively. The appeals board is working well but that was one weakness in it which we have now cleared up.</P>
    <P>I know that what Senators Burke and Bonner have said has been much discussed at county council meetings and indeed by Members of the Dáil who feel they are being excluded from membership of the board because of membership of the Oireachtas, the European Parliament or county councils. It is also felt that because such people are accountable to the public and face re-election by the public from time to time, it might be unconstitutional to disbar such people from membership or chairmanship of the board. County councils are consultees and as such there could well be a conflict of interests. Consequently we felt that consultees should not sit on the board as they might have to deal with business discussed earlier at their county council meetings. It is solely for that reason that they are excluded. Having been a member of a county council for 23 years, I gained expertise and knowledge in this area. Nevertheless, being a consultee, I feel that were I to sit on such a board, I might be in conflict with the overall plan.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the fine work that all public representatives do. This is in no way to denigrate such work but to increase transparency and accountability. People accept that they would not want it said that a county councillor sat on the board while being a consultee. Above all, I want to ensure that when a decision is made no one can come back and point out a flaw. Members are aware of how much publicity a consultee might get if he or she were on the board.</P>
    <P>Senator Bonner asked how the appeals board would deal with any aspect appealed to An Bord Pleanála. He said that he could not understand <Col N="929" /> why an inspector's report gave an indication one way while the decision of the board was entirely different. I have told the appeals board that it must listen to all sides and produce a balanced finding which takes account of the greater good. An inspector may say one thing but three others, maybe from different areas, could say something entirely different.</P>
    <P>Senators Bonner and Burke spoke about jobs in coastal communities. Senator Henry mentioned the effect aquaculture has had in such areas. I am from a coastal community, the Hook Peninsula, where there is quite a lot of aquaculture. My neighbours and friends work in the business and would not have been able to secure jobs in their home parish near their families and friends were it not for aquaculture. Jobs might not otherwise be created in such remote communities were it not for the aquaculture industry. The Taoiseach asked me to ensure that sustainable jobs were created in coastal communities when he gave me this job. I am pleased to say that is happening and there is room for growth.</P>
    <P>People in particular bays are unhappy with salmon farms and shellfish cultivation. It is my intention that all people within a community around a bay are satisfied &ndash; not necessarily happy &ndash; with what is going on. There is plenty for everyone in bays, whether they are inshore fishermen, deep sea fishermen, people involved in shipping, environmentalists or people involved in tourism or aquaculture. Two years ago I introduced the co-ordinated local aquaculture management systems &ndash; CLAMS &ndash; where all interests around a bay meet and voice their views with a view to achieving a consensus that is not driven by aquaculture alone. Everyone can have a say in the matter. I am happy it has worked out quite well. I was courageous in that I introduced the first CLAMS programme in my parish and it has worked well. Those involved in the various spheres can all live happily with decisions taken. I intend to provide a CLAMS programme in every bay.</P>
    <P>Senator Bonner referred to the CLAMS programme in Lough Swilly which is the second most recent programme introduced. There are still arguments in Lough Swilly and there probably still will be arguments there. I invited everyone in that area to be part of the CLAMS programme, but unfortunately one group declined. Today I ask it to embrace the plan because it can have a voice which it would not have had heretofore. I want to see that everyone, whatever their views, has an opportunity to express them. Consultation and consensus is vitally important. I call on all groups to consider others, let us live and let live on the basis that there is enough there for everyone. We have set a good programme in place.</P>
    <P>I got some information on Lough Swilly recently and less than 2% of the area of the lough <Col N="930" /> is under aquaculture. I was told by an eminent authority that the entire lough flushes within two days. In other countries, like Norway and Scotland, where aquaculture is widespread, it can take weeks or months to flush the fjords. Ireland is the most regulated country. It is also keenest on quality and allows for most consultation. We are right in doing that. No matter what a person's view is it should be heard but a balance should be struck. That is precisely what I intend doing.</P>
    <P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 2000, is an important enhancement of the independent appeal arrangement at the heart of the comprehensive and transparent aquaculture licensing legislation enacted in 1997. I acknowledge the work done by my predecessor in another Government, Deputy Gilmore, in relation to this Act. The Bill ensures that the statutory aquaculture licence appeal board will explain its decisions and have the power to recruit staff directly to meet its needs. I commend the appeals board on dealing with a substantial caseload since its establishment in 1998 and I wish it well in its endeavours. I say so knowing that obviously it would have great difficulties from time to time.</P>
    <P>The Bill also removes doubt about long-standing licence fees, which were imposed administratively in 1987. This is an important safeguard for the licensees in question and the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>This Bill was initiated in this House and went through the House on an amicable basis, which indicates the interest all sides have in good legislation. I thank all those who participated in the debate from day one, particularly those here this morning. I also thank the officials of the House. The Seanad is important and this is a clear example of how important it is.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Representations have been made to me about the use of the word &ldquo;other&rdquo; in this section. It has been suggested that the use of this word means that a second category has been described here and otherwise there are two mutually discrete <Col N="931" /> groups of young people, those aged between ten and 21 years and those young people aged under ten and over 21 who are socially or economically disadvantaged and who should be given special regard concerning the provision of youth work. I do not know if this is the intention of the Bill, to describe two discrete groups, those between ten and 21 and those under ten and over 21, but if that is the case it is not a good idea. We should remove &ldquo;other&rdquo; from section 2 and describe them as young people who are socially or economically disadvantaged.</P>

      <P>I appreciate and understand that Senators Henry and Burke had representations made to them. Deputy Creed put forward a similar amendment in the Lower House and we discussed it, but I decided it was not necessary.</P>
      <P>The basis for my rejection of the amendment was that young people who are socially or economically disadvantaged and aged between ten and 21 are automatically included in section 8(3)(<i>b</i>)(i), as that subsection covers all young persons in this age range. Section 8(3)(<i>b</i>)(ii) covers all other young persons out of that age group who are socially or economically disadvantaged, so there is no good reason the amendment should be accepted.</P>
      <P>I will put it in simpler terms. I am trying to prioritise certain categories of young people and give them the same priority, young people of any age who are socially or economically disadvantaged and young people whether socially or economically disadvantaged between the ages of ten and 21. If one looks at the wording of the two subparagraphs of subsection (3), that is precisely what is achieved in that wording.</P>
      <P>I looked carefully at Deputy Creed's arguments on Committee and Report Stages and I am satisfied that our objective, as I have outlined, is met by the words as I have used them in the text.</P>

      <P>This Bill has done very well in making the statutory and voluntary sectors equal partners, but this section is of concern to me. I have received representations from the National Youth Council that the vice-chairperson as well as the chairperson of a youth work committee must be a member of a VEC. Would it not be better if, let us say, the vice-chairperson could come from the voluntary sector rather than having to be a member of the VEC? It goes against the principle and ethos of partnership which is within this legislation. Given that there would be statutory representatives, including VEC members, and people from the voluntary youth work sector on these committees, I suggest we amend the Bill so that the vice-chairperson does not have to be a member of the VEC.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept the amendment. I understand from where Senator Henry is coming and I would be surprised if representations had not been made to her. However, my position is clear. If I accepted Senator Henry's amendment, the Bill essentially would revert to its original form. It changed because I accepted an amendment from Deputy Creed on Committee Stage in the other House. The effect of accepting Senator Henry's amendment would be to undo what I did by accepting Deputy Creed's amendment.</P>
      <P>I accepted Deputy Creed's amendment because it found a middle way between what the National Youth Council of Ireland and the IVEA wanted in relation to this matter. Regarding the chairmanship and vice-chairmanship of the youth work committee, I received representations from the NYCI that the chairman and vice-chairman of the national youth work committee should be selected by the committee and it should be possible for them to come from either the voluntary side or the VEC side. This was the proposal in the original Bill. The IVEA wanted the chairman and vice-chairman to come from the VEC side and it only wanted the VEC members of the national youth work committee to be empowered to select them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Creed's amendment was to the effect that the chairman and vice-chairman should come from among the VEC members, but they should be selected by the committee as a whole. This is the position. It may not be very satisfactory or a neat compromise, but I am not agreeing totally with either side on this matter. Strong representations were made to me by both sides. I am not going 100% of the way with either side, I am going a certain distance with each. This is as far as I want and am prepared to go.</P>

      <P>I understand the Minister of State received representations from many people. However, I thought the National Youth Council's proposal was reasonable because it does not preclude the two coming from the vocational education committee. I have received nothing but help from the Dublin Vocational Education Committee on anything I have ever had to do with it. It is not that I oppose what it does. However, it would have been good to loosen it up and create a situation where representatives of the voluntary sector would be eligible for those positions.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister of State must be like Solomon in terms of dividing babies in two, but I wish he could have taken this measure on board. We cannot underestimate the amount of work done by people in the voluntary sector. I do not think the Minister of State underestimates it, but I am sorry he cannot accept the amendment. I do not intend to call a division on this because he obviously considered it carefully. I have nothing against vocational education committees. As Senator Burke said, they are diverse bodies. However, I favour the promotion of the voluntary sector because it is so difficult to get people to work in it, particularly these days. It should be given as much status as possible so that people recognise the value of the work it does.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State is as aware as I am, because of work I have done in the voluntary sector, of the amount of time and effort put in by many people. Senator Kett is also aware of it. We should do all we can to recognise the value of their contribution. We should also try to make them understand that we realise their importance.

Will the Minister of State describe what is a young person because everybody feels young? To me, a young person is somebody who is aged less than 20 years. The council members are elected for a period. Does the provision mean that somebody who was under the age of 20 years would be excluded because, by the time the elections took place, he or she was over the age of 20 years?

      <P>This section allows the Minister to make a grant available to vocational education committees or voluntary groups. It would be much better if the Minister said that a youth grant would be given to vocational education committees annually. Youth organisations could then ask vocational education committees for money rather than all organisations having to apply to the Department. This Bill dilutes local power because if the Government was serious about devolving power at local level, funds would be given to vocational education committees. Youth organisations could then apply to the vocational education committees for grants.</P>

      <P>I am advised that this is a standard wording used in Bills when speaking of accessing money from the Department of Finance. Details of how funding will be made available have yet to be determined but will be clarified soon following discussions between the National Youth Work Advisory Committee and the Department. The fact that the wording is in this form does not mean there is a specific procedure to be followed. The wording of this section is standard, but details of how funding is to flow have yet to be worked out. The Bill allows flexibility in determining funding procedures.</P>

      <P>Yes, but is this not the type of red tape found in every Department? Would it not be much simpler if the Bill stated that grants would be sent to the vocational education committees? Various groups could then apply to the vocational education committees. Why is there so much red tape, meaning that both vocational education committees and other organisations have <Col N="936" /> to apply to the Department and the Department then has to write to all the groups involved?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view, it creates red tape. It also means that the Department can distribute funds in any direction it desires. The removal of part of this section to enable grants to be paid to vocational education committees is the best way to devolve funds on a local basis, if that is our intention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure it is not the Minister's wish, but the fact that funding has to be given in each financial year means that it is difficult for voluntary organisations to plan ahead. I have raised this problem on other occasions. It would be splendid if anything could be done to assure voluntary organisations that they can make plans, although I do not think it is within the power of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea. He should relate to the Department of Finance the serious difficulties that are encountered by voluntary organisations. It is not fair to expect organisations to plan for a year at a time and to wonder what is to happen the following year. Three or five year plans are needed if progress is to be made. As Senator Burke has said, the bureaucracy involved in continually having to apply for additional grants makes life difficult for voluntary groups. We owe a debt of gratitude to such organisations and I ask the Minister of State to highlight the difficulties they face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Senator Henry's comments, I am aware of the difficulties faced by organisations when grants are not paid within a reasonable period of time. The situation has improved and the Government hopes to improve it further. This Bill will bring certainty to the distribution of grants and certain practices will emerge which will be adhered to by all organisations.</P>
      <P>I profoundly disagree with Senator Burke's interpretation of section 34 as it is not a question of creating more red tape but of allowing maximum flexibility in the distribution of funding. Discussions are under way with many interest groups, including voluntary organisations which will be the main beneficiaries, regarding the allocation of funds. Rather than pre-empting the discussions by saying the funding is to go to a certain body, the Bill says that the Minister may decide to allocate funds to various groups. There will not be more red tape as a result of this Bill but there will be the flexibility to enable all parties, particularly voluntary organisations, to agree a system of funding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This section may allow a Minister to create a slush fund. Various groups will have to bypass the vocational education committee and apply directly to the Minister. I am not speaking of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, when I <Col N="937" /> say that Ministers may decide to allocate funds to groups with which they are familiar rather than allowing vocational education committees to decide. This Bill provides a golden opportunity to put into law a provision to allow local statutory bodies to determine where funds should go. The Minister will have to tolerate many organisations from all parts of the country making representations. The same problem is found in the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation which receives letters from every voluntary organisation seeking grant aid. Local statutory authorities should be allowed to disperse funds locally. I agree with the point made by Senator Henry in relation to the fact that organisations receive grants annually as such groups face a precarious financial situation. We should do whatever needs to be done to support such organisations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make three brief points in reply. I think the distribution of sporting funds from the national lottery has worked very well. I am glad the Government has increased substantially the amount of money available for sporting organisations. Criticism cannot be directed at the Government, given that numerous sporting organisations have availed successfully of sports lottery grants. I have not heard the Minister, Deputy McDaid, complaining that too many organisations are writing to him, as he knows they are entitled to do so. Fianna Fáil respects the right of all organisations to apply for funding regardless of their size or location.</P>
      <P>I have no intention of amending this section to say that money should go directly to vocational education committees as that would preclude the possibility of direct ministerial dealings with youth organisations, such as the National Youth Council of Ireland or local groups. It may be that Ministers will not deal directly with organisations, but I have no intention of impeding such a possibility by changing this Bill.</P>
      <P>The final thing I wish to say is that youth work legislation introduced by the Rainbow Government contained a section that was practically identical to that currently under discussion. I am sorry if I am incorrect, but I think my memory serves me correctly. If it was good enough for the previous Government, I do not see why Senator Burke finds it unacceptable now.</P>

      <P>I do not know if we can say, after four years, that we are in a different era as regards grants. This Government has given more money to youth organisations than the previous Administration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right that that should be the case as this Government has more money in its coffers.</P>

      <P>I do not think the shibboleth that <Col N="938" /> the passing of four years constitutes a different era is a coherent argument. I am not hidebound by tradition as there is no quicker person to change something if the need exists. I have no reverence for the traditions of parliamentary draftsmen and the style of writing legislation. I am interested in improving matters that can be improved. When talking of the distribution of public moneys to youth organisations, it is important that there is consultation with all involved, including the distributing bodies, such as vocational education committees. A system that is acceptable to all has to be found. In that context, it is important that this section be drafted in as flexible a form as possible. I have no intention of pre-empting the discussions by legislating that money will only go to vocational education committees without the possibility that the Department can deal directly with youth organisations, whether national or local.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for introducing this legislation. It is long overdue. I wish him well with it. It is good legislation and it puts all the youth organisations on a proper footing. I compliment the Minister, the Department and his staff on the Bill.</P>

      <P>I echo what Deputy Burke has said. It is a good day's work. I am sure the Minister of State and his officials put a great deal of work into getting this together. The criticisms I have heard in representations made to me have been minor. Most people are delighted that this has been brought forward. The Bill has been a long time in gestation, as the Minister said, not only with this Government but also with the previous Government. It is good to see that we have passed it in this House today.</P>

      <P>I too want to thank the Minister of State and his officials. As my colleagues have stated, it is a Bill which has been in gestation for quite some time. All voluntary organisations and vocational education committees have welcomed it with open arms.</P>

      <P>I sincerely thank the Members of this House for their positive con<Col N="939" /> tributions. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the organisations, both statutory and voluntary, which contributed towards the finalisation of this Bill. As my colleague, Senator Kett, and others stated, it has been a long time in gestation but it will prove worth the wait. The debates in this House and the Lower House have helped us to make it the best Bill possible. Its effect will be seen in the very near future.</P>
