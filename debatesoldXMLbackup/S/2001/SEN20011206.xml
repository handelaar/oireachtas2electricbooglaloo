      <P>I have received notice from Senator Jackman that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minster for Health and Children to appoint immediately a senior speech and language therapist at Catherine McAuley special school, Limerick.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, referral motion regarding third country nationals to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, to be taken without debate; No. 2, the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, motions on the Standards in Public Office Act, 2001, to be taken together for the purpose of debate; and No. 6, Asset Covered Securities Bill, 2001 &ndash; Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes. Senators may share time. Business will be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2.15 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader did not indicate whether Nos. 3, 4 and 5 will be taken with or without debate and, if with debate, the time allocations. I suspect five minutes would be sufficient for most Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 17 be taken before No. 1. If Members on the other side think I am being difficult on this, I am not. I am simply asking that the Bill be published. We are not asking the Leader for time or for him to vote for it. We will make <Col N="1226" /> our own time available. He has the numbers to vote it down if he wishes. We are asking for the simple right of Opposition Members to print a Bill. I do not know why the Leader has turned down our request on three occasions. Apparently the Minister has not seen the Bill. In any event it is not his concern what is placed before the House, that is a matter for the House. With reluctance and increasing irritation, I propose this change to the Order of Business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the proposed amendment. The Minister's office contacted me this morning requesting that I forward the Bill. I faxed it to his office because nobody in the office nor in his Department has seen it.</P>
      <P>A woman who abducted a baby from a hospital in Cork was last week sentenced to five years in prison. It was suggested by the judge that she should serve her sentence in the Central Mental Hospital. This is one of the reasons I am anxious to promote the Mental Health Bill. The Minister promised that, as soon as the Bill was enacted, he would bring forward legislation to deal with the mentally ill before the courts and in custody. However, there has been no progress on that matter in the past five months. Judges have been reduced to suggesting that ill patients should serve prison sentences in the Central Mental Hospital. I do not believe the Government is showing any sense of urgency in respect of mental health legislation and, for this reason, I ask that the Bill be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calls made by Senator Manning and Senator Henry in respect of this Bill. I cannot understand why the Government is afraid to print it. We are making a simple request which would not require any great level of activity. A decision is all that is needed. I hope the Leader will be able to provide a positive response to our request, otherwise we will be forced to put the matter to a vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to again request that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government come before the House. I do not know if this can be arranged before Christmas, but requests have been made on a weekly basis to have him appear before us to discuss waste management. The situation seems to be deteriorating at present because every few days a new illegal dump containing hazardous and other waste is discovered. A number of these dumps have been found in Wicklow and the latest was uncovered in Dublin. It is inconceivable that this type of practice could have been happening for so many years without the owners of the land knowing about it and without prosecutions taking place. When a prosecution does take place, the Environmental Protection Agency usually brings its case to the District Court which is only empowered to impose a maximum fine of £1,500. There is, there<Col N="1227" /> fore, no real penalty or deterrent. It is time the Minister for the Environment and Local Government intervened and came before the House to inform us about the action he proposes to take.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the findings in the coroner's report on the tragic death of a young handicapped child earlier this year, will the Leader invite the Minister for Health and Children to the House to debate the issue of risk assessment as it relates to the purchase of equipment, aids and appliances? There is a notion abroad that health boards carry out assessments in conjunction with suppliers, who have a vested interest. This is despite the fact that there are many highly trained and motivated people working for agencies that deal with the area of risk assessment. Action must be taken because it should not be the case that those who supply the equipment also have the opportunity to assess its effectiveness. This matter must be debated with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's request, which is fast becoming a demand, that the Mental Health Bill should be taken. It seems extraordinary that, as Senator Henry stated, the Department had no knowledge of this matter. This indicates that there has been a failure of communication. This House is part of the Parliament and Members of it are attempting to have a Bill printed. Surely the Department has some view on the matter and if there is some reason for the delay, it ought to be apprised of that fact. One can only suspect that sleight of hand was practised here and that in order to comply with European regulations, the Government passed legislation but put in place a time delay in order that it could have the Bill in print but do nothing about it. That is regrettable.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Costello's request for a debate on illegal dumps. It is important that such a debate is held because these dumps are being found throughout the country. A number of them are located close to water and sewerage facilities and represent a clear danger to people's health. There seems to be a general slovenly practice and unless people are prosecuted this behaviour will continue, to the detriment of the nation's health.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader make time available before Christmas for a debate on fishing? I make this request because the once rich waters around this island are being fished out, quotas are being imposed and Irish fishermen are being placed at a disadvantage. We must take action about the super trawlers being built in this country which are not permitted to fish in European Union waters and which are raiding the resources of people living in western Africa.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>The supplement with today's <i>Irish Independent</i> states that RTE has won a vic<Col N="1228" /> tory by clinching a deal to transmit its channels on the Sky satellite network without paying for the privilege. I do not know why that is a victory. I wish to protest about the scant coverage of sporting events on RTE at present. A major racing event is taking place at Punchestown on Sunday next but RTE will not be televising it. Many old people who cannot attend racecourses are anxious to watch horseracing on television. Will it be the case that other sporting events, such as soccer, Gaelic football and hurling matches, will not be televised later in the year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange, before Christmas, a debate on the future of tourism in Ireland in light of the atrocities of 11 September and other difficulties that have arisen? In my opinion the time is apt for a general debate on tourism. In that context, the position of Farranfore Airport in County Kerry should be considered. I compliment Aer Arann for taking up the slack at the airport. I compliment the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, on coming to the aid of the Rose of Tralee festival yesterday. I have lobbied for such action to be taken for a long period because the festival has a contribution to make to the tourism industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to make Senator Kiely a judge at the festival?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calls made by Senators Manning, Henry and Costello in respect of the Mental Health Bill. I am not suspicious by <Col N="1229" /> nature and, therefore, I assumed the fact the Bill had not appeared was as a result of lethargy. I have discovered, however, that by passing the original Mental Health Bill the State is no longer in trouble with the Court of Human Rights. All it had to do was pass the Bill; it did not have to enact it. The Bill referred to on the Order Paper is necessary because it suggests the action that should be taken. It came about as a result of pressure at home rather than on foot of pressure from the Court of Human Rights. I support the request to publish the Bill immediately.</P>
      <P>When I read the OECD report on education standards across the globe, I criticised Ireland because I do not believe it is acceptable that we should seem complacent. However, within 24 hours somebody had put a spin on the issue and said we were doing very well because we are in sixteenth, ninth and fifth places in particular areas. If we sent a team to the Olympic Games and stated that we did well because our athletes finished sixteenth, ninth or fifth, people would not be pleased. If the success of the economy is to continue it must be because we are aiming for the top; we must be in the medals. In my opinion there is an air of complacency in terms of how high we aim. If that is true, we will not succeed.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Costello's request for a debate on dumping. I was surprised to discover the other day that the Department of the Environment and Local Government has called on the Criminal Assets Bureau to become involved in this matter. That should not happen until later. We are seeking immediate action by the Garda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>These points can be made in the debate which has been sought. We should not pre-empt that debate on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate should be taken now rather than next year because immediate action is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate RTE on media reports this morning about a fantastic commercial deal it seems to have struck with Sky.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Shame. Down with Murdoch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask that the Minister come into the House because, from the point of view of the public, I am concerned about whether this means that RTE will no longer be involved in providing digital services to Digico as was purported to be the case for over two years. It is a very serious matter that total monopoly control on digital service here could now be through Sky.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also support yesterday's call by my colleague, Senator O'Donovan, for a debate on the difficulties our fishing industry is about to encounter as a result of the cutbacks being sought by Commissioner Fischler. A debate would be well <Col N="1230" /> worthwhile and would enable us to support the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, who next Monday week will no doubt be making a great effort on our behalf in relation to those huge cutbacks. Conservation is necessary. Ordinary fishing trawlers are in difficulty. However, I am slightly confused on the point expressed by Senator Norris. Some are super-trawlers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>These are points which can be dealt with in detail in the debate that is sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important matter. Senator Norris muddied the waters by some of his comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the Disabilities (Education and Training) Bill be introduced? It was promised many months ago that it would be not just published but taken before Christmas. It is disappointing it has not yet been introduced. It shows the Government's lack of compassion for the most vulnerable in our society, and this is carried through in its reluctance to take Senator Henry's Mental Health (Amendment) Bill. The case she made this morning points to the vulnerability of the people in our society who need and deserve to be attended to. I ask the Leader to allow the Bill at least to be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Coghlan's call for a debate on housing. We should specifically discuss the &euro;989 million allocated for housing, which is just &euro;11 million short of &euro;1 billion, which would make a significant difference given that it is four and a half times the sum allocated in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the call by Senator Costello and others for a debate on waste management, particularly the recent illegal dumping in Wicklow and Dublin. It is a real threat to the environment at a time when we must comply with EU standards. There is obviously a cost tag attached and it is, therefore, imperative that there is good enforcement. A debate on the issue would be useful and very timely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senators Walsh and Coghlan in calling for a debate on waste management. It is some time since the Minister for the Environment and Local Government spoke here, and I would like to know what progress has been made in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I specifically request the Leader to ask for a debate on social welfare. Yesterday afternoon many speakers from the Government side spoke about the wonderful Utopia that has been created in Ireland. However, today there is a report which indicates that mothers with young children are starving because they are taking the food out of <Col N="1231" /> their own mouths to give to their children. What kind of Utopia is that? I ask that the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs come in here to explain how people like that could fall through the net. It is not good enough in these times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning, Henry, Costello, Norris and Quinn called for No. 17 on the Order of Business to be taken before No. 1. Senator Henry has correctly pointed out to the House the up-to-date position in relation to the Minister's office. I endeavoured to have this dealt with by this morning. I hope to have it dealt with by late this evening and will inform the House first thing in the morning. I have no difficulty whatsoever in publishing this Bill if it is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Take it then. The Leader should take his courage in his hands and take it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Costello, Norris, Quinn, Walsh and Coogan called for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to the House for a debate on waste management. Yesterday an additional &euro;16 million was provided in grants to radically improve the country's recycling infrastructure. This brings the amount in 2002 to &euro;30 million, which is seven times greater than the £4.3 million provided by the previous Government in 1997. That is the up-to-date position. I have no difficulty in allowing time for this debate.</P>
      <P>Senators Kett and Keogh called for the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House following the coroner's report in relation to a particular unfortunate tragedy. Senator Keogh spoke on disability. I hope to have a two-hour debate on disability in Fianna Fáil Private Members' time next week which will include both the Senators' views. I will also endeavour to have the Disabilities (Education and Training) Bill introduced as soon as possible, but it will not be before the Christmas recess &ndash; I had hoped it would be introduced before the recess. However, it is very high on the Government's priority list and it is hoped to introduce it soon after the Christmas recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Norris and Bonner called for a debate <Col N="1232" /> on the fishing industry in light of the reported new quotas. I have given a commitment to Senator O'Donovan and I am endeavouring to have time allocated for statements on this next week.</P>
    <P>I will pass to the Minister Senator Rory Kiely's strong views on the RTE sports programme on Sunday afternoon.</P>
    <P>Senators Coghlan and Walsh called for a debate on housing. Senator Walsh gave an up-to-date reply, which was commendable, particularly in relation to the &euro;989 million which is an enormous amount of money. A sum of &euro;146 million was added yesterday to bring it up to that figure, which is four and a half times the allocation of the 1997 budget of &euro;214 million.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Coogan, I have no difficulty in having a debate here on social welfare. There is a special information pack available in Senators' pigeonholes in relation to yesterday's allocations. I noted the number of Senators asking questions of me this morning on budgetary matters and the early closing of the Dáil Chamber yesterday. I welcome the budget, even though there were very few questions put to me on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister for Finance was responsible for the budget, not the Leader of the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 10 to 17, to delete subsection (4) and substitute the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)&nbsp;In the case of a part-time employee placed by a temporary work agency at the disposition of a user enterprise, the comparator worker shall be a comparable full-time employee in the user enterprise.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister discussed this in considerable detail on Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil but I urge him, given that there is still time to bring the Bill back before the Dáil, to reconsider this serious flaw in the Bill. I doubt that the directive intended agency workers to be excluded. Senator Cox said on Second Stage that she has an agency and I am sure she would not like the people she puts forward for employment to be in a more invidious situation than the people directly employed by an enterprise.</P>
      <P>The amendment is simple. Rather than have agency workers who are temporary compared to agency workers who are permanent, it provides that agency workers who are temporarily employed by an enterprise should be compared to full-time employees of that enterprise. People who may be employed through agencies are in a fragile position when it comes to enforcing their rights because some agencies may not be as good as others.</P>
      <P>The reason I feel so strongly about this issue is that I work in the medical services area where a considerable number of agency workers are employed. A large number of nurses, hospital helps, paramedical staff and even medical staff are employed on an agency basis and I believe I must speak up for them. They will not have the same rights unless the Minister accepts the amendment. I am also anxious about this matter because many of these workers are women. With the downturn in the economy, agency workers will be increasingly employed in everything from the retail trade and manufacturing to schools because enterprises might not be anxious to take on the full responsibilities this Bill, rightly, imposes with regard to part-time workers.</P>
      <P>It is a good Bill; nobody is criticising the Minister for it. However, there is a loophole in this area and with the downturn in the economy many enterprises might feel it is wiser to employ people on an agency basis rather than directly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. Most contributors to the debate on Second Stage focused on this apparent loophole which would allow the thrust of the Bill to be derailed. The <Col N="1235" /> purpose of the Bill is to prevent and remove discrimination against part-time workers where such exists. However, if one confines the comparison to agency workers, one is creating a new category of worker which could have the effect of allowing the discrimination to continue. The Minister must ensure that the comparator is other workers within the enterprise or comparative enterprises.</P>
      <P>During the debate on Second Stage the Minister gave figures for the number of part-time workers. There had been an increase in the numbers between then and when he originally introduced the Bill. I believe the increase was between 5,000 and 6,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure I gave for full-time part-time workers was 291,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but that was already an increase since the Minister originally&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>It was an increase of 7,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That increase occurred in a short space of time. With the downturn in the economy, the likelihood is that there will be a further increase in the number of part-time workers and in the number of agency workers coming on stream. This is a major and increasing area.</P>
      <P>If the existence of potential loopholes is a serious concern in the Dáil and in this House, the Minister should respond. It is not difficult to put together an amendment that would protect against discrimination. I am sure the Minister wishes to ensure that discrimination does not take place. When this legislation is passed, we may find that workers lose out because we allowed the comparison to take place purely with agency workers. If the equivalent of a black economy for part-time workers is created and if the purpose and principle of the legislation is defeated, we have done a bad day's work. I am concerned that agencies would look at this legislation and see what we have been pointing out, and that they would act in that regard. It is cheaper for employers and agencies to act in such a way.</P>
      <P>We need to look carefully at the legislation before allowing it to go through this forum. The Minister has indicated that he knew that European Union proposals would come up in the short-term to deal with this matter. Should we wait for European directives? We do not know if there will be a directive. Why not deal with the matter now? It is no skin off anybody's nose to put in an amendment that covers the concerns. This legislation is one year in gestation so we can, if necessary, wait a few more weeks. If not, let us introduce the amendment now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I declare my interest in this area. The company that I manage in Galway, in addition to my work as a Senator, is a recruitment agency. I <Col N="1236" /> am glad to speak on this issue because a lack of understanding of the role of agency workers and agencies seems to lie behind this amendment. There seems to be misunderstanding as to what agencies do.</P>
      <P>An agency worker is generally paid by the agency and the agency must negotiate the rate workers are paid, as well as negotiating their fee. It is in the agencies' interest to get as high a rate as possible because their fee is generally a percentage of the base rate paid to the employee. It is inconceivable that part-time workers would measure themselves against other part-time workers in an existing company when they are only there on a temporary contract basis. Agencies often put in workers who are over-qualified or under-qualified. It is generally a temporary arrangement. That is the reason employers use agency workers. It is not possible to draw appropriate comparisons between a part-time worker who has been put in by an agency and a part-time worker who is already in a company. There may be different levels of knowledge and skill, different lengths of service and other criteria that are in no way comparable when it comes to setting out the rate per hour, even though the job done may be the same for different workers.</P>
      <P>I was president of the National Recruitment Federation and I know that most of the agencies that operate in Ireland do so in good faith and treat their workers well. While they welcome the legislation as it is set out, it is only fair that agency workers are compared to other agency workers, not necessarily within the same agency, and the legislation allows for this. Then, it will be possible to compare one agency worker with another who works for a different agency. That is the way to go.</P>
      <P>If we make the changes suggested in the amendment, we are in danger of making the agency business, which is important to our country, untenable. It just would not work if these changes were made. This has happened in a number of European countries, including Germany and France, where it is practically impossible for agencies to operate their business. A platform of rules and regulations has been made which have changed the temporary business completely.</P>
      <P>Some people might say that it is better not to use agency workers but there is a body of people who enjoy agency work. It suits them to work for three or four months of the year for personal reasons, particularly in the case of women as Senator Henry has said. They can work around school holidays or take a summer off. They can earn good money on a short-term basis or can spread it out over a longer term. Young people can travel in Ireland and abroad. People coming from places such as Australia and New Zealand can work here under the agency system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would do anything to ensure that workers are protected &ndash; this Bill will do that &ndash; and that the agency business, which contributes to our economy, is also protected. While I understand the points made by Members, I suggest that the <Col N="1237" /> points come from a misunderstanding of how agencies operate and how employees are treated. While I would not stand over any employee being mistreated or abused by any agency, that does not happen. The comparisons and safeguards that the Minister has put in the Bill by identifying this category of worker is enough to safeguard them and the industry. If the Bill is to work, there must be a win-win situation for all the players involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a good and necessary Bill. This amendment, far from taking from it, will strengthen the legislation. It will guard against discrimination rather than, as could be the case without it, encouraging the black economy. That would defeat the Minister's purpose in this well-intentioned legislation. We are all aware that there has been a downturn in the economy. Increasingly, employers will want to work through agencies as they cut back on full-time staff. The number of agencies has been on the increase in Ireland and throughout the free world.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding what Senator Cox has said &ndash; I bow to her superior knowledge in this sphere &ndash; not all agencies operate to the high standards of Senator Cox's agency. In my limited experience of this area, agencies want to sell on and take their commission. They do not want to hold on to their problems. I am sure Senator Cox takes an interest in her workers and in their future. Not all agencies will operate to those high standards. As Senator Henry has said, nursing and medical staff are increasingly working through agencies, both here and abroad.</P>
      <P>This is a good and useful amendment that will strengthen the legislation. I am happy to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their contributions on this amendment. I will again outline the Government position. The concerns raised in amendment No. 1 have been raised by the ICTU. It feels that in the case of a part-time agency employee performing his or her work in an enterprise other than an agency, it should be possible for an employee to compare himself or herself with a non-agency full-time worker in that enterprise. As I informed the House on Second Stage, negotiations took place over the past 12 months at EU level between the European Trade Union Congress and the CEP on the rights of temporary agency workers. It is obviously an issue that needs to be addressed and it is being addressed at European level. The discussions collapsed because the parties could not agree a definition for the comparison of agency workers. The EU Commission now proposes to introduce by the end of this year a new directive on agency workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first meeting of the national experts to discuss the proposal took place on 15 October 2001 in Brussels and at that meeting member states were divided as to whether a temporary agency <Col N="1238" /> worker should be able to compare himself or herself with another agency worker in the user enterprise or with a comparable full-time employee in that user enterprise. In light of this development, the Commission undertook to consider the issue further before publishing the proposed directive which, I understand, will require to be agreed at Council of Ministers by a qualified majority and also agreed at the European Parliament under the co-decision procedures laid down in the Maastricht Treaty. Given the above uncertainty at European level, I propose to retain section 7(4) of the Bill as currently drafted and, therefore, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 1.</P>
    <P>This does not mean, as has been alleged, that temporary agency workers are excluded from the Bill. I think people are clear on this. It means that such a worker cannot for the present, pending the EU directive taking a position on this issue, claim a full-time employee in a user enterprise as the comparator for any purpose. However, a part-time temporary agency worker may under the Bill compare his or her pay and conditions with those of another full-time agency worker in certain circumstances whether or not employed by the same agency. This very provision is contained in section 7(2) of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, so there is consistency here in regard to legislation.</P>
    <P>My officials, on my instructions, are very active at EU level in trying to find a reasonable formula. For example, there is a suggestion, which has merit, that a part-time employee with a contract for three or six months could have as a comparator a worker, a full-time employee, in the user company. As in any situation, there is always some middle ground one can pursue. I suggest that and do not have any more to say on it at the moment. It is reasonable for me, as Minister, to say we are leaving section 7(4). We are not excluding temporary agency workers. Senator Cox articulated the position very clearly and I thank her for that. We are leaving that position but we are very actively involved at EU level in looking for a possible solution and we will revert back to Members as soon as we find it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has given us a very good explanation. We should try to help him by pushing this amendment because then he will be able to say there is trouble back at the ranch. When he goes to these meetings, he will be able to say this is an urgent issue. I know discussions have been going on but the unfortunate thing I find about EU discussions is that it is frequently live horse and you will get grass. It may take the Minister of State and his officials considerable time to get something done. Sometimes looking at this Bill I think that if people could be employed on a casual basis, they would be better off. We should help the Minister of State by showing that we are all behind him in getting something done about these agency workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so long ago since an agency recruited a large number of Filipino nurses, brought them to this country and put them up in substandard accommodation in Gardiner Street which was condemned subsequently by the local authority. They were paid only a fraction of the money paid to their counterparts doing the same work in the various hospitals. I have no doubt the agency got a fee for this, negotiated the rate with the health boards and put them up in those conditions having negotiated with some landlord. All that was unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>A recruitment agency is a third party service that gets people for employers. Whether the employer employs them directly or whether he or she, or a corporate entity, gets an agency to do it, they are employees. Why should we distinguish because of the method of employment? Recruitment agencies have mushroomed in the past ten years although they hardly existed before. Why should this category of employee, who comes under the auspices of an agency, be different from any other category of employee recruited directly? That is my problem with this.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the legislation is to prevent discrimination between employees working on a part-time basis and permanent employees in terms of work and conditions, yet the first thing we do is say this is a new method of recruitment with which we cannot interfere. People recruited under this method will be in a little world of their own given that they can only be compared to each other.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister of State if he could give us an idea of the number of part-time or whole-time workers recruited through agencies. On the 291,000, do we have any figures on that, for example? The Minister of State may not have them but they would give us some indication. I would say quite a lot of them &ndash; perhaps 50% or more &ndash; are recruited through agencies. We are talking about a substantial number of people whom we choose to leave outside the remit of this legislation. We are saying they can only be compared to each other rather than those in mainstream employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not good enough to say the European Union will do something. The procedure about which the Minister of State spoke could be very lengthy and it could be some time before we come back to this. I am not happy with that and I understand why congress was very concerned about the matter because I think we are legislating for a new black economy &ndash; the area of agency worker. Everybody will recruit workers on a part-time basis through agencies because they will be able to treat them less favourably <Col N="1240" /> than if they employed them directly. We have no choice but to push this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue of the Filipino nurses, nobody working in a recruitment agency would condone any of that. However, the amendment we are discussing would not have made any difference to what happened to those Filipino nurses. Those nurses were recruited to work here on a full-time basis, not part-time. This amendment is not relevant to that. Senator Costello mentioned that their accommodation was condemned, and that is very emotive, but it is completely irrelevant. It was disgraceful that it happened and something should have been done regarding the people responsible. I do not know if the Department followed it up and whether they were fined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>My point was to show there can be bad standards under the auspices of agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>When we enact tax and company law, one of the key factors is that the legislation is workable. It would be unworkable for agency workers to be compared to other people working in the same company doing the same job on a part-time basis because they are not the same. Agency workers sometimes get paid more than the person doing the job previously or they sometimes get paid less because they have a different level of experience. Most of the time, they get paid a rate which reflects the job being done. Senator Costello made the point that it is in appropriate to compare them to each other. Would he not compare the rate for a part-time carpenter with that for a part-time carpenter elsewhere? That is what he would do if he was trying to get a rate for a carpenter. In that case, is an agency worker not entitled to be compared to an agency worker elsewhere?</P>
      <P>There are many different benefits for agency workers compared to full-time employees in organisations. Let us consider the level of protection afforded by this Bill in the light of our role as both legislators and people who have to try to implement it. For example, in terms of legal secretaries rather than carpenters or nurses, it is possible for a part-time legal secretary, under the provisions that have been put in place by the Minister, to say to her employer: &ldquo;I am a part-time legal secretary working in company A. I am paid £10 per hour. The legal secretary who works in company B for a different agency is paid £15 per hour. Why am I not paid that amount?&rdquo;  That is eminently more sensible than comparing her to a legal secretary within the organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the way the legislation is drafted. The Minister can say that is the position but an agency might not be happy with it because it puts additional competitor pressure on it when it is trying to work. However, that is the position. A legal secretary can compare himself or herself to a part-time legal secretary, a part-time account<Col N="1241" /> ant, a part-time nurse or a part-time carpenter who is working somewhere else for an agency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">

It contains a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of agency workers and the benefits that accrue to them. I would prefer if the amendment was not pressed because it would create difficulties for recruitment agencies and people who choose to work on a part-time agency basis. We should compare carpenters to carpenters and agency workers to agency workers. That is the way the legislation has been framed.</P>

      <P>Senator Cox articulated my views on the matter and I commend her for doing so. She has rightly taken some time to do that. Obviously, the Opposition is entitled to table amendments. That is its prerogative and I think the amendment will be put to a vote. However, that should not detract from the fact that this is good legislation relating to part-time workers generally and it will be welcomed. It has been welcomed already by many groups and I look forward to its enactment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agency workers are a particular type of worker. Many people like working in that area. Senator Costello asked about the number of <Col N="1242" /> agency workers. We do not have a figure, but the number of agencies has increased from about 200 some years ago to about 600 today. That gives an indication of how many agency workers there are and demonstrates that many people like to work in this way. The agency is the employer so there is not a normal employer-employee relationship.</P>
    <P>Earlier I mentioned what might happen at EU level and I will clarify those statements. They are only suggestions, but one is that somebody with a contract for three to six months could be compared to a fellow agency worker. A person with a contract for perhaps more than six months could be compared to the worker in the user enterprise. They are some of the ideas being mooted at present. I am sticking to my position and the Opposition is sticking to its view so we will have to leave the issue to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the numbers, no information has been collected so I am speaking from my own experience. Most agency workers do not work part-time. Most part-time workers are not agency workers. Given that there are 291,000 part-time workers in the country, probably less than 10% of that group work for agencies, not 50%. The nurses and the medical staff referred to by Senator Henry are not part-time workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>They are temporary. I do not believe the number is as high as 50%, as Senator Costello suggested.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue of comparing one job to another, what if one was doing a part-time job in an organisation and there was nobody else within that organisation to whom one could compare oneself? One could compare oneself to another agency worker working in a similar organisation. That is where the comparison has true validity because one is comparing like with like in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation is good, but Senator Cox has convinced me that I must press the amendment because many of the people who are employed in nursing in particular are part-time employees from agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cox summed it up by saying carpenters should be compared to carpenters and agency workers to agency workers. This is precisely my problem &ndash; workers must be compared to workers. How they are recruited is not the point. What is important is their pay and conditions. We want to ensure in this legislation that people who work in a part-time capacity are paid fairly and that their conditions are fair. The same applies to full-time workers. To say that agency workers can be compared only to agency workers is confining matters to the detriment of workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a serious problem to be addressed in this regard. Although Senator Cox will talk about the problems she deals with in her recruitment <Col N="1243" /> agency, as legislators we are concerned about the overall benefits to workers &ndash; all workers, not just agency workers. It is a problem that will give rise to discrimination in the future. We could close this loophole now if the Minister of State, at this eleventh hour, had a change of heart.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to push the point and make the Opposition Members more convinced <Col N="1244" /> than they already are because we have done so much in this House by way of consensus, but I am not certain about their definition of &ldquo;part-time&rdquo;.

      <P>To benefit from this Bill by accruing pension entitlements and other benefits, part-time workers have to work 20% of what was originally eight hours, but is now 20% of the normal working week. What happens when the normal working week is flexible? On Second Stage, I spoke about teachers who have a minimum weekly working time of 18 hours and a maximum working time of 22 or 23 hours. Does the Bill refer to 20% of the minimum hours, 20% of the maximum hours or 20% of mean working hours?</P>

      <P>Having checked the matter for the Senator, I have established that the figure of 20% refers to comparable workers. A worker may, for example, be compared to someone working 16 hours per week, so he or she would have to work four hours each week to benefit.</P>

      <P>It is fine if we can be as specific as that, but there may be problems with jobs where there is a minimum and a maximum working week. A full-time secondary school teacher's working week can vary between 18 and 23 hours. Teachers are said to work in a full-time capacity if they work in the classroom for 18 hours each week, excluding hours worked supervising students or correcting examinations. I presume the Bill refers to hours worked in the classroom, but that may not be the case. There may be a need to clarify this issue, particularly as the Minister of State has proposed supervision as part of a teacher's duties.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for the latitude you allowed Members who were seeking clarification on Final Stage. I also thank Senators Costello, Henry and Coghlan for their informed debate on the Committee Stage amendment which gives us food for thought in terms of the kinds of protections we need to put in place. The amendment was lost, but the power of their argument was such that it will be taken into consideration and will assist the Minister of State in his deliberations at European level.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for their assistance. Senator Coghlan referred to the fact that this Minister of State and his officials are most helpful and co-operative when Senators are preparing to deal with legislation in the House. They set an example which I sometimes wish was followed by other Departments.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that this legislation has been passed by the House. The Bill will complete and confirm the protection of workers. One of the reasons for our competitive edge is that we provide an environment in which business can thrive, but we also ensure that workers at every level are adequately protected. I welcome this.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, pursuant to subsection (2A) (inserted by section 2 of the Standards in Public Office Act, 2001 (No. 31 of 2001)), of section 21 of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995 (No. 22 of 1995), Seanad Éireann recommends the appointment of Mr. Justice Matthew P. Smith, a Judge of the High Court, by the President on the advice of the Government to be the chairperson of the Standards in Public Office Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on these three motions. Two of the motions concern appointments to the new Standards in Public Office Commission and the third would have the effect of applying the new Standards in Public Office Act to Members of the Seanad. The motions have been considered by the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and are being referred back to the House.</P>
      <P>I will outline some of the main features of the Standards in Public Office Act. The Standards in Public Office Commission, which will be established under the Act, will take over all of the functions of the existing Public Offices Commission. These include functions under the Electoral Act such as those concerning political donations or election expenditure. The new commission will have wide investigative powers regarding so-called specified acts. Specified acts are acts or omissions of public servants or office holders which are inconsistent with the proper performance of the duties of the relevant position, or which would be inconsistent with the maintenance of public confidence in that performance.</P>
      <P>The commission will take and investigate complaints in this regard only where it considers the matter complained of to be of significant public importance. While it is a matter for the commission to make a judgment on what that means in any given case, the Act provides that the commission may deem a matter to be of significant public importance if it relates to a benefit or potential benefit allegedly received by a person, where the value of the benefit exceeds £10,000.</P>
      <P>The commission, or a committee, will not investigate complaints lodged anonymously. However, where the commission or committee, as the case may be, considers that the circumstances warrant it, it can restrict the disclosure of the complainant's identity where it is necessary or expedient for the commission or committee's investigation of the complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission will also hear and investigate complaints from Members or from the public about certain actions of public servants and public office holders. These includes acts or omissions of public servants or public office holders which are inconsistent with the proper performance of the duties of the relevant position, or which would be inconsistent with the maintenance of public confidence in that performance. The com<Col N="1248" /> mission will take and investigate complaints in this regard only where it considers the matter complained of to be of significant public importance.</P>
    <P>While the commission will be in a position to accept complaints about office holders and a wide range of public servants, similar complaints about Members of the Oireachtas who are not office holders under the Act will need to be made to the relevant Clerk, as happens under the Ethics in Public Office Act. However, if it so determines, a committee will be in a position to ask the commission to investigate an issue and report back to the House concerned.</P>
    <P>The Commission will be entirely independent of Government and will enjoy full tribunal powers. The Act provides that it shall be chaired by a judge or a former judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court, who will be appointed by the President on the advice of the Government and following resolutions passed by each House of the Oireachtas recommending the appointment. A former Member of either House, appointed by the Government following resolutions passed by each House, will serve as an ordinary member of the commission. There are four <i>ex-officio</i> members: the Clerks of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Ombudsman. The provision for appointing a former politician was introduced following a recommendation of the Dáil Select Committee on Members' Interests.</P>
    <P>The Standards in Public Office Commission will be able to engage inquiry officers to undertake initial investigations of complaints on its behalf. This will give the commission a mechanism allowing it to determine whether a particular complaint might be frivolous or vexatious or not of significant public importance. In cases where a minor matter is the subject of complaint and the commission does not believe it justifies the full weight of an investigation by it, the complaint may be referred to a committee of the relevant House of the Oireachtas or to the Minister or public body concerned, as appropriate. The commission may also decide not to investigate a complaint at all. These provisions should avoid a situation developing where the commission is swamped with investigations of minor matters.</P>
    <P>The Act requires that Members of the Houses must furnish a tax clearance certificate in respect of themselves or a partnership in which they are a member within nine months either side of an election. A statutory declaration that the Member's tax affairs are in order would have to be made one month either side of the election. The Act also provides for tax clearance and declarations for persons appointed to positions as senior public officials and for persons seeking appointment to the Judiciary. They would also have to make similar statutory declarations. The commission is empowered to investigate breaches of the tax clearance requirements.</P>
    <P>Codes of conduct under the Standards in Public Office Act will indicate standards of conduct and <Col N="1249" /> integrity appropriate to the person or group to whom it relates. A person covered by a code of conduct will be expected to have regard to the code in the course of the performance of his duties and to be guided by it. Where appropriate, a code of conduct will be admissible and can be taken into account in court proceedings or in proceedings before the Committee on Members' Interests of the relevant House or by a tribunal or the Standards in Public Office Commission. This means a code of conduct under the Standards in Public Office Act is to be a substantive and important document and the persons to whom it relates will have to regard it as such.</P>
    <P>The Act also makes provision for a level of streamlining of the current requirements for declarations of interests and donations under the Electoral Act, 1997, and the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995. Members of both Houses laid great emphasise on the importance of streamlining to avoid repetition and the submission of different forms at different stages over a number of months. For example, the dates for the making of statements under both Acts will be brought into line and the overlap in reporting requirements which require certain amounts to be declared both as political donations under the 1997 Act and as gifts under the 1995 Act will be removed. Moreover, it is intended that the forms will issue at the same time from a single source and will be returned in the same way. The Minister for Finance is currently considering a regulation under the 2001 Act to further clarify the position in relation to the destination of forms for the return of Members' interests to ensure that all returns are made through the commission to the clerks. The streamlining provisions of the Act will make compliance with the legislation simpler and less confusing.</P>
    <P>It will be of enormous benefit to the commission to have a chairperson with a strong legal background and the Government is therefore pleased to be able to seek the recommendation of the Seanad for the appointment of Mr. Justice Matthew P. Smith as chairperson of the commission. Mr. Justice Smith is an eminent judge with many years' experience on the Circuit and High Courts, having been appointed to the Circuit Court in 1985 and to the High Court in 1998.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the commission should understand and appreciate the context in which the political process operates. This will not in any way undermine the independence of the commission but will bring to the commission the special perspective and expertise which comes from service as a public representative. The Government is very pleased that Mr. Liam Kavanagh has agreed to permit his name to be put before the Houses as the Government's nominee for the position of ordinary member of the commission. Liam Kavanagh will be well known to many in this House and to members of the public. He has had a distinguished political career. He was first elected to Dáil Éireann in 1968, having contested a by-election caused by the death of his <Col N="1250" /> uncle, the late Deputy Jim Everett, who had been Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in the inter-party government of 1948-51 and Minister for Justice from 1954 -57. Liam Kavanagh subsequently became a Minister himself and served during the 1980s as Minister for Labour, Minister for the Public Service, Minister for the Environment and Minister for Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry. He was elected to the European Parliament in the first direct elections to that body in 1979. The Government is grateful for his willingness to serve on the new commission and I have no doubt his experience and personal qualities will be of immense value to the commission in carrying out its various functions.</P>
    <P>I know that Members will be concerned at what often seems a complexity of arrangements to which they have to adhere. I know also that Members will be anxious to progress this Act as a clear signal of the Houses' intention to ensure the highest standards in public life. The new Act streamlines the situation in a number of respects. I understand that the select committees will be in a position to offer guidance to Members in relation to the Act and I am sure this will be very welcome. The timing of these resolutions is in part to ensure that the committees have as much time as possible before the Christmas recess to offer this guidance and to allow Members of each House to apprise themselves of the position.</P>
    <P>The motions will ensure that the necessary appointments are made to get the new Standards in Public Office Commission up and running. The motions in relation to the commencement of the Act will apply the Act to each House of the Oireachtas. Aside from the application of the Act to Members of each House, the Act will commence generally in accordance with the provisions of the Act by Government order on 10 December 2001.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Government, I wish to recommend that its nominees for positions on the commission be approved by the House for appointment by the President in the case of the chairperson and by the Government in respect of the ordinary commission member. I also recommend the motions which would apply the Act to members of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome and support this motion. It is an indication that we have come a long way in a very short time. In the past ten years or so the way in which we do our business in politics and the framework within which we operate has changed enormously. Much of that change has been painful and has been the result of things we wish had never happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the problem arose from the fact that our Constitution is entirely silent on the question of political parties and seems to regard them as a necessary evil not to be spoken of in front of the children. The Constitution makes no reference to political parties. It is as if the political system operated without them. This is in huge contrast to the German constitution, just 12 years younger <Col N="1251" /> than ours, which lays down the law with very clear guidelines as to how political parties are funded, are accountable and how they must operate with democratic principles and so forth. We need similar legislation to bring together all the rules dealing with parties, but that is not a matter for today.</P>
    <P>The Constitution is of very little help to us on the question of how Members of the Houses and senior officials should behave. Until now the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has tried to take responsibility for this area. In the past there was not a great deal of work for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and issues were generally settled by people accepting the rules of the club and obeying them. However, we live in a very different world today. As long ago as the case of Senator David Norris in the late 1980s, it was clear that the old ways were not enough and that the operation of a committee like Committee on Procedure and Privileges, in dealing with charges made against Members, was going to have to be on a different plane from anything we had experienced before and was fraught with legal difficulties, many of them arising out of constitutional rights which Members rightly enjoyed.</P>
    <P>We have been in a difficult situation. The most difficult problem of all is that in dealing with charges made against Members, there is a great lack of proportion. It is not clear whether the ultimate power to expel a Member whose conduct might warrant expulsion rests with the Houses or with the new body. There is a clear constitutional conflict of opinion on this matter. I have been a member of a number of committees which have sought legal and always expensive advice on this question, but I still have not got the answer. It may be a question that can only be settled in the Supreme Court. The Constitution appears to take contradictory positions on the matter.</P>
    <P>The motion is a further step on the way to building a properly regulated structure to govern the way in which Members of the Houses and in high positions in Government behave. It is the result of a great deal of thought and debate in various committees. However, I must contradict the Minister of State on one point. He referred to the appointment of a former politician as being the result of a recommendation by a Dáil committee. It may well be, but the recommendation was first made by the Seanad committee and it was subsequently adopted by the Dáil. I was a member of the committee and there were strongly held views on this point. We considered that something was missing in the earlier proposals and that it was important the membership of the commission should include somebody who understood the political process from within, who was retired, disinterested but was capable of giving a political perspective which judges and officials were not in a position to give.</P>
    <P>I am delighted Mr. Liam Kavanagh accepted the proposal that he be a member of the com<Col N="1252" /> mission. He commands the confidence of all parties in the House, is level headed and has great common sense. He also has much experience, does not get carried away and sees things in proportion. He understands politicians. These qualities are needed in the commission to augment the legal and other skills which the other members will no doubt bring to it.</P>
    <P>My only advice to the members of the commission is to adopt a lightness of touch. They are not there to be a prosecution authority but to judge the fairness, substance or otherwise of complaints made to them. A lawyer and former judge who was head of a similar commission in one of the Australian parliaments attended a meeting of the Seanad committee and with relish explained how he had appointed a series of prosecutors and how there was hardly a Member of Parliament or a senior official who had not been investigated by his committee. He conveyed the sense that it was his job to almost drive people out of public life rather than to protect standards or those involved in it.</P>
    <P>Members of the commission should bear in mind the conditions under which politicians work and that things are not always as they appear or as they are represented in the newspapers. They should value fairness and take cognisance of the rights to good name and reputation of those, including politicians, who may be investigated. I have no doubt this will be a fair and good commission and that its members will do that.</P>
    <P>The Seanad committee is unhappy with the legislation. There may be ambiguity about the definition of related and specified persons. There is also a fear that the legislation may not have been as well drafted as the situation demanded. In correspondence with the Department of Finance the Department assured the committee that everything is correct and that we need have no worries. I am not so sure. I suspect that the first person to be seriously investigated by the commission &ndash; I hope it will be a long time away &ndash; may mount a successful legal challenge. For the moment we are advised by the Department that all is well. I wish the commission and its members well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these motions. They have arisen from the belief that in view of recent developments there should be such a commission. The need for the commission does not point the finger at public representatives because, by and large, those elected to public office serve the people well. Any need for an overseeing body is unnecessary for most of those in public life. However, the public demands transparency and that a body such as the commission be in place to consider situations that are inappropriate. It is important to have such a facility rather than rely solely on tribunals of inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The structure established will be independent of the Government, which is important. Its members will have the knowledge and expertise to consider issues before it in an independent and <Col N="1253" /> objective manner. The inclusion of a member who has served in public life strengthens the commission. I join with Senator Manning and the Minister of State in complimenting the former Minister, Liam Kavanagh, on his appointment. He will bring to the commission a political understanding that will be necessary. I served with him on the former Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, which he chaired. He is well qualified to be an effective member of the commission. He will enhance it and his deep knowledge of political life will be of benefit.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning referred to the Constitution and the situation in Germany. Perhaps in those days we were more innocent or did not investigate dark corners as we should. The German Constitution was drafted 12 years after ours. It is important to bear in mind that the greatest atrocity in history happened in Germany and given that nobody wanted a repetition of what happened, the provisions regarding political parties contained in the German Constitution were necessary. It would be practically impossible to provide extensive provisions on political parties in the Constitution. I doubt if the example in Germany would be appropriate or would operate in a satisfactory manner in this country. This legislation is a practical response.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Senator Manning that the commission should not adopt a Ken Starr, witch hunt type of approach. Whatever the wrongs of Bill Clinton, people took the view that Ken Starr was on a personal crusade to prove his allegations. If the wrong people were appointed the commission could embark on a similar crusade. I hope that will not happen and that the various members of the commission will not allow it.</P>
    <P>The production of tax clearance certificates is important, even where people are in dispute with the Revenue Commissioners. A declaration of intent should be sufficient, provided there is no avoidance. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service which investigated this aspect. I told the committee that, given the small size of the country, a deliberate attempt to discredit candidates during an election by publishing information that they were under investigation by the commission could have the intended effect of tarnishing their reputation and cause them to lose the election. I am still not convinced that protection is provided in this regard and I hope that the commission will consider this issue. If, in the interests of influencing an election, someone were to make a statement or a complaint, there could be consequences for the person about whom that statement or complaint was made. Will penalties be imposed on a person who makes a statement or complaint which is later withdrawn? I am not sure whether provision has been made for such penalties.</P>
    <P>The motions before the House are important and I welcome them. Having made demands in that regard, the people will appreciate the establishment of such a commission. Standards must be met by those involved in public life. Public <Col N="1254" /> representatives and public servants have a duty to the people and they must do what is expected of them. I welcome the establishment of the commission because it will bring to the areas of public representation and public service a greater degree of transparency. Let us hope that behaviour about which we have heard in recent years is a thing of the past. While the number of people involved in such behaviour was quite small, what they did has had enormous influence on how people view those involved in public life. There is a cynicism abroad which must be removed and in my opinion the commission will do so.</P>
    <P>I commend the motions to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I also commend to the House the motion to establish by 10 December the new Standards in Public Office Commission and the other motions before us. I agree with Senator Finneran that it is absolutely necessary to have transparency in public life because that is what the people expect of us. A small number of people have brought the profession of politics into disrepute and, in the public mind, we have all been tainted because of certain abuses that occurred. There is no doubt that we must take the initiative and ensure that proper mechanisms are put in place and that the system is transparent and accountable. This will allow us to state that while there were problems in the past, as a result of which we have all been tarred with the same brush, we have put the commission in place and we intend to move forward.</P>
      <P>The process designed to allow us to put our house in order is quite recent. The first legislation relevant to this area, the Ethics in Public Office Act, was introduced only in 1995. The most recent measure enacted is the Standards in Public Office Act, 2001, which has paved the way for the establishment of the Standards in Public Office Commission. These are some of the slow, painful steps we have taken, as a professional body, to ensure that there will be transparency and that we will be accountable. It is extremely important that we should have in place a comprehensive set of procedures over which we can stand in the future.</P>
      <P>I hope the commission will either not be used at all or that there will seldom be a need for it to be called upon. In other words, I hope it receives few complaints. The declaration of interests, the tax clearance requirements and the code of conduct set out in the Act and the commission and the guidelines that will be prepared should form a package of proposals that will ensure Judge Smith and his commissioners will have little to do. If these proposals had been in place previously, it is unlikely we would be obliged to deal with the problems currently under investigation by the various tribunals. When they have been put in place, I do not believe many difficulties will arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, however, there is a constitutional quagmire in terms of how investigations can take place. As Senator Manning stated, a grey area exists with regard to how the specified Acts, <Col N="1255" /> etc., will apply. I am sure members of the legal profession could yet experience a heyday in relation to the complaints received by the commission, the inquiries, decisions and reports made by it and, indeed, the nature of its wide powers. The commission will have extensive powers equivalent to those of a tribunal and questions will be asked about how it will report and the penalties it will impose.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that Liam Kavanagh is to be appointed as a commissioner. Liam is probably the best person in the country for the job and I do not say that because he is a member of the Labour Party. Liam Kavanagh has tremendous experience and is a cool, level-headed and cautious person. He will be an ideal commissioner, he will weigh up all the evidence and he will not make decisions lightly. As Senator Manning stated, the original suggestion in this regard emanated from the Seanad. It is important to appoint a former politician as a commissioner because he will ensure matters are properly teased out and supply his fellow commissioners with the enormous amount of valuable information at his disposal.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the commission is being established. I am delighted that we have come this far in dealing with the area of ethics and standards in public life. I hope we will eventually streamline the existing process because people are still confused in terms of the forms they are supposed to complete, etc. The system should be simple and direct and accountable in every sense. There is no doubt we are making progress.</P>
    <P>I commend the proposals to the House.</P>

There is no doubt that the body we are establishing will be extremely important for our democracy. Its existence will be a tangible sign of our development and maturity and will clearly demonstrate that we are striving to attain the highest goals in regard to standards in public life, and rightly so.</P>
      <P>Unlike my learned colleague, Senator Manning, I am neither an academic nor a historian. The Senator touched on a number of important constitutional, legal and other issues, regarding which Senator Finneran and I would concur. No doubt these will be further teased out in due course. I heartily concur with Senators Manning and Finneran in regard to Senator Manning's advice that this commission should have a lightness of touch and not be unnecessarily or unduly overbearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I came in to support the appointment of Mr. Justice Smith but more particularly of Liam Kavanagh. There is no more fitting person to be a member of this commission. He is patently an exemplary person. He was a long-time Member of the other House and, I think, is still a county councillor. He was an outstanding Minister and member of the European Parliament, and his <Col N="1256" /> record is without blemish. He is a member of the Labour Party, but we have all long recognised his merit and, unanimously on all sides, we support his proposed appointment. This body requires members of the highest standards and calibre and Liam Kavanagh is truly such a person. I could not say enough good about this man, whom I have known for a considerable number of years. Accordingly, in line with everybody else on all sides of the House, I wholeheartedly and without reservation concur with the recommendation that he be appointed.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators for their support of the Bill and the motions before the House today. I am happy to acknowledge what Senator Manning said in regard to the role of the Seanad in having a former Member involved. I inadvertently simply set out the structures and formalities, but there is no doubt that the Seanad had a major involvement in the construction of the blue book and I am quite happy to put that on the record.</P>
      <P>To answer a specific point raised by most of the Senators, a complaint to the commission must be made reasonably and in good faith if the complainant is to enjoy immunity from any action arising from the complaint. Such protection will be denied to a person who makes a complaint knowing it to be false, misleading, frivolous or vexatious or who furnishes misleading information to an inquiry officer, the commission or a clerk of the commission. That is very important. Again, I thank the Senators for their support of these motions.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to bring this Bill before the Seanad. Although it is technical, this is an important Bill which will enable the further development of the international financial services sector here and provide a new and efficient form of financing to domestic credit institutions. We will, of course, discuss the technical aspects in detail on Committee Stage. What I would like to do today is explain the purpose of the Bill, set out broadly how it will operate and place it in a European context.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to allow international banks based in Ireland, and domestic banks and mortgage providers, to access international capital markets on the most competitive terms. This will underpin the strength of the Irish financial system and the continued attractiveness of Ireland as a base for financial institutions. To do this, this Bill provides for the introduction of new financial instruments &ndash; the asset covered securities of the title &ndash; by Irish institutions into the eurozone market. These securities will be backed by assets held by the institutions concerned, in particular mortgages and public sector loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides that asset covered securities issued by a financial institution will be statutorily secured on a pool of underlying assets held by the same financial institution. These underlying assets are primarily mortgages or public sector loans. In the event of the insolvency of the issuing institution, the cover assets must be used first to meet the claims of the holders of the securities. Ordinary creditors of the institution may not make a claim against these assets until the full obligation due to the investors in the securities has been discharged. The enhanced security which this preferential status offers to the holders of the securities is one of the key features of the <Col N="1258" /> product. Because of the reduced risk to investors, it will be possible for financial institutions to borrow more cheaply and easily. This is an important basis to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The product which we are introducing is not new to the European capital markets. It is similar to the German <i>Pfandbriefe</i> securities. These <i>Pfandbriefe</i> are the largest single bond type in Europe. They allow German institutions to access finance on exceptionally good terms, with consequent knock-on benefits for the strength of their financial system and the availability of credit. In recent years other European countries have taken the view that their institutions should also be able to access this source of funds. For example, France, Spain and Luxembourg have introduced enabling legislation to facilitate the issuance of these types of securities.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, securities similar in nature to the proposed product have long been a feature of European capital markets. They are longest established in Germany where they have a demonstrated history of 125 years. No issue has ever defaulted. Asset covered security markets are also long established in Austria and Sweden. As I have already mentioned, other European countries have introduced enabling legislation in recent years to facilitate the issuance of similar securities. This is because the enhanced security afforded by the preferential creditor status, the specification of strict matching of assets and liabilities and the regulatory environment for the product have resulted in the German <i>Pfandbriefe</i> attaining a triple-A credit rating and becoming an extremely popular investment.</P>
    <P>The availability of asset covered securities has contributed to stability in the continental European markets due to their long-term primarily fixed rate nature. Their high credit rating enables issuing institutions to raise long-term funds at interest rates only marginally higher than those of a sovereign borrower. Of course, this confers a significant competitive advantage. Introducing this type of bond into Ireland will allow Irish-based banks and building societies to take advantage of this cheaper funding source and ensure that they are able to continue to compete against other European credit institutions within the Irish and the broader European markets.</P>
    <P>Enabling legislation is required to allow Irish credit institutions to issue asset covered securities because the legal basis for the new securities must be clearly established. It is also necessary to provide a legal framework for the type of regulatory supervision required which is unique to <i>Pfandbriefe</i> type securities.</P>
    <P>I would now like to set out the key features of asset covered securities. The first point is that asset covered securities are securitised bonds backed by a pool of high quality assets. In a conventional securitisation of the type we are used to in this country, the bond is secured on a defined and unchangeable set of assets which are removed from the issuing institution's balance sheet. Essentially, this means that the issuing <Col N="1259" /> institution sells the collateral for the bonds to an independent trust which then issues the bonds backed by this collateral. The principal and income earned on this collateral is used to meet payments to the bondholders who no longer have to worry whether or not the issuing institution as a whole is creditworthy.</P>
    <P>By contrast, asset covered securities will be secured on a pool of assets called the cover assets pool. These assets, even when put into the pool, remain on the issuing institutions balance sheet but are ring fenced. This means that, in the event of the issuing institution getting into financial difficulties, these assets must be used to meet the institution's obligations to the holders of its asset covered securities before they can be used to meet the claims of any other creditors.</P>
    <P>The most important feature of the cover assets pool is that it is dynamic in nature. This means that non-performing or redeemed assets may be replaced in the pool by new assets, an option that is not available through conventional securitisation. By replacing non-performing assets with new assets, the high quality of the cover assets pool can be maintained. It is this dynamic feature of the cover assets pool, allied to the conservative management of the pool, which enables institutions to obtain high credit ratings and to issue asset covered bonds at low interest rates.</P>
    <P>There are two distinct types of asset covered security. The first is a &ldquo;public credit covered security&rdquo;. These securities are usually issued by specialist banks whose main activity is the provision of finance to governments, municipalities and local authorities. The securities are primarily backed by public sector assets such as sovereign bonds, local authority loans and government guaranteed loans.</P>
    <P>The second type of asset covered security is a &ldquo;mortgage covered security&rdquo;. These securities are usually issued by institutions whose main activity is the provision of mortgages. These securities are primarily backed by mortgage assets.</P>
    <P>Public credit covered securities are, at all times, secured by a pool of assets of at least equal nominal value and yielding at least equal interest. Mortgage covered securities are similarly secured, but based on a conservative valuation of the assets concerned. The ultimate investors in asset covered securities are normally institutions wishing to hold high quality securities offering a modest yield premium over comparable government securities. The introduction of asset covered securities will, I believe, greatly assist the financial services sector in the new era of EMU, globalisation, deregulation and new technology. It will remove the structural disadvantage which could otherwise affect Irish capital markets through the undercutting by foreign financial intermediaries of the rates offered by their Irish counterparts. The mortgage sector is probably the best example of what I am referring to here.</P>
    <P>The advent of the euro with its consequent <Col N="1260" /> elimination of exchange rate risk, the mutual recognition of credit institutions throughout the EU and the advance of e-commerce which will enable institutions to penetrate a market without establishing a branch network all pose particular issues for the domestic mortgage sector. Such a situation could allow foreign institutions to &ldquo;cherry pick&rdquo; customers and provide increased competition to the domestic mortgage sector. Of course, this is not a bad thing and I am all in favour of competition in this area. However, I do want to ensure that the domestic mortgage sector is well equipped to compete.</P>
    <P>Specifically, we need to ensure that domestic institutions are enabled to raise funds on terms similar to foreign institutions which are in a position to raise capital through the issue of their own mortgage covered securities. The introduction of mortgage covered securities will enable Irish mortgage institutions to raise funds more efficiently and to compete with their European counterparts. They should also facilitate the introduction of more attractive and longer-term fixed rate mortgages which will provide greater security for borrowers.</P>
    <P>The issue of public credit covered bonds is a more specialised operation. It is likely that issuance of these bonds will be mainly concentrated in the IFSC. The Government is committed to maintaining a vibrant and growing international financial services industry in Ireland, building on the success of the IFSC and further boosting employment in the sector. To do this, we need to be proactive in providing the environment which will attract new business here. The enactment of this Bill will do precisely that.</P>
    <P>I would now like to describe for the House the main features of the Bill. The Bill provides for the establishment of designated credit institutions, i.e., designated mortgage credit institutions and designated public credit institutions which may issue securities under the terms of the Bill. Designations must be approved by the Central Bank and only credit institutions already regulated by the Bank may apply for designated status. The sector will be regulated by the Central Bank. The Bill contains restrictions on the types and amount of business activity other than core mortgage or public sector lending in which designated credit institutions may engage. This is to ensure that designated credit institutions engage only in conservative lending practices.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains detailed provisions on the issuance of asset covered securities. These include the issuance by designated credit institutions of mortgage or public credit covered securities secured on cover asset pools, specifications on the type and location of assets which may be included in cover asset pools and specification of requirements for matching of securities and cover asset pools with respect to duration, principal, interest and currency and allowing for the use of hedging contracts in this regard. It should be noted that to provide some flexibility and diversity in the cover asset pools, the legis<Col N="1261" /> lation allows up to 20% of the pools to consist of high quality assets other than mortgage credit or public credit assets.</P>
    <P>An important feature of the Bill is the appointment of a cover assets monitor by a designated credit institution to supervise the cover assets pool. The cover assets monitor acts like a trustee on behalf of the holders of an institution's asset covered securities and may be either an individual or an institution. The role of the monitor is to supervise the detailed operation of the cover assets pool. The institution must obtain the consent of the cover assets monitor before including assets in the cover assets pool so the monitor can verify that the assets to be included are permitted assets, conform to the valuation criteria for the asset class and ensure that none of the prescribed limits on any of the asset types is breached. The appointment of the cover assets monitor will ensure that designated credit institutions are regulated closely and that they operate cover assets pools in the best interests of security holders and in accordance with the legislation.</P>
    <P>The key provision of the Bill and the basis on which asset covered securities are issued is the provision of preferential creditor status to the holders of asset covered securities. This is dealt with in Part 7 of the Bill. It provides that the insolvency or potential insolvency of a designated credit institution does not affect the claims and rights of the holders of asset covered securities issued by the institution. In the event of insolvency, the cover assets pool will continue in operation until such time as the claims of the holders of the securities have been met. Only then will excess assets, if any, be distributed to the other creditors of the institution.</P>
    <P>Other features of the Bill which should be mentioned are the setting out of detailed measures to ensure that an institution's obligations to the holders of its securities continue to be met in the event of the insolvency of the institution or the revocation of the institution's designation, the reciprocal recognition between Ireland and other States of priority of claims similar to those provided for in this Bill and the amendment of the Building Societies Act to enable building societies to issue securities under this Bill to enhance their powers to fund through the issue of securities generally and to ensure that the rights of members are not adversely affected by these changes.</P>
    <P>Overall, the Bill treads a balance between conservatism and innovation. On the conservative side the Bill is clearly modelled on the German <i>Pfandbriefe </i>legislation. This is because of the German model's long and successful history, its market acceptance and the volume of securities in issue. It is expected that the similarity of the product to the <i>Pfandbriefe</i> will assist in its quickly gaining market acceptance. However, the Bill also contains some innovative features which address issues raised by credit rating agencies regarding the operation of asset covered securities markets generally. These features should help <Col N="1262" /> in gaining high credit ratings and ready market acceptance for the Irish product. They include specific interest rate risk management requirements, express powers to enter into hedging contracts to manage risk and clear provisions on what happens if an institution gets into financial difficulties. Much effort has gone into making the Bill a state of the art product and ensuring that it meets the needs of domestic credit institutions. It will be studied closely by rating agencies and investors in the sector and it has an important role to play in launching Irish-based asset covered securities and making them competitive in the wider European market.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the euro is leading to the development of an integrated and competitive capital market in the euro area. Mortgage and public credit covered securities are now becoming a standard feature of European markets. They are a recognised asset class in their own right and are attractive to long-term institutional investors. They offer financial institutions the prospect of raising funds in a cost effective manner and, as a consequence, they can have a substantial and beneficial impact on competitiveness. We are part of the European mainstream now and we must compete in the wider euro area capital markets. This Bill will enable Irish lenders to finance their activities as efficiently as their European counterparts and demonstrates the Government's commitment to the further development of Irish capital markets and the IFSC. It introduces a product for which there is a proven market demand and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure will certainly not be as controversial as the one we discussed last night. As the Minister of State has said, this is a very technical Bill and, in my view, the Members of this House are not geared to deal with it as we do not have the required back-up services. It is my hope that, in any future reform of the Dáil and Seanad, Members will have the necessary research staff to deal with Bills of a very technical nature. However, I am thankful to an official in the Minister of State's Department who gave me some insight to the Bill.</P>
      <P>I know the passing of this Bill is very important to the financial institutions as a mechanism of refinancing and I believe that, when it is passed, it will be of benefit to mortgage holders in Ireland. I hope the Bill will enable mortgage holders in the Irish market to obtain long-term fixed mortgage rates that have not been available previously. This, I hope, will be a by-product of the legislation and I intend to return to this point later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill appears to be a worthy attempt to provide a legal framework to allow bonds backed by mortgages, that is, mortgage covered securities or Government credits, meaning public credit covered securities, to be issued in Ireland. It would appear that the principle of mortgage covered securities and especially public credit covered asset securities originated in Germany and the famous <i>Pfandbriefe </i>securities are the <Col N="1263" /> largest single bond type in Europe. These bonds enable German financial institutions to access finance on exceptionally good terms. Other European countries have taken the view that their financial institutions should be able to access this source of funding and France, Spain and Luxembourg have passed enabling legislation to facilitate the issuing of this type of bond. I understand the pressure for this Bill comes from a German financial institution based in the Dublin International Financial Service Centre and I assume it has a special interest in this type of financial product. The German<i> Pfandbriefe</i> bond has an excellent record. It has never defaulted in Germany. As a result, the<i> Pfandbriefe</i> bond has obtained a triple A credit rating and, as there is little or no risk to investors, it is possible to borrow more cheaply and easily.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this legislation is appropriately timed. With the introduction of the euro on 1 January, Irish institutions will be able to compete with other EU financial institutions on a more level playing field. Asset covered securities are securities bonds and are secured on a pool of assets called a covered assets pool. These assets when put into the pool are ring fenced on the financial institution's balance sheet. If the financial institution gets into difficulties, these assets must be used to meet the institution's obligations to the holders of its asset covered securities before they can be used to meet other claims. In addition, if an asset in the pool underperforms or, in case of a mortgage, defaults, it can be taken out of the pool and substituted by another asset.</P>
    <P>Another important safeguard in the Bill is that it provides for the appointment of a person known as the cover asset monitor whose responsibility will be to supervise the asset pool. Was this part of the German<i> Pfandbriefe</i> legislation or was it introduced in the Bill to make the system more secure? A financial institution must obtain the consent of the cover asset monitor before including certain assets in the cover asset pool and must satisfy the monitor that these assets were properly valued and are suitable for investment in the pool. These guarantees enable institutions to obtain high credit ratings and to issue bonds at low interest rates.</P>
    <P>There are two types of asset covered securities. The first is credit covered securities which are usually backed up by public assets, Government bonds and so forth. The second type of asset covered security is a mortgage covered security. These securities are usually issued by institutions who are in the business of providing mortgages. This type of asset covered securities may be of interest to Irish financial institutions because it will enable mortgage institutions to raise funds more efficiently and will, I hope, facilitate the introduction of more attractive and long-term fixed mortgage rates.</P>
    <P>The arrival of a 30 years fixed rate mortgage would revolutionise the Irish market which has up to now had nothing longer than five to 10 <Col N="1264" /> years. However, these mortgages are not without their problems since early repayments attract heavy penalties. I understand that in Germany the outstanding mortgage can be transferred as part of the sale.</P>
    <P>This Bill will enable Irish lenders to finance their activities on a single playing field with their European counterparts. The measures proposed in the Bill will make Irish bonds more attractive to large institutional investors and will assist in maintaining activity in the Irish market when the State is not issuing bonds. As I indicated earlier, a German bank based in the IFSC is most likely the first financial institution to take advantage of this legislation and will issue bonds on assets lodged in Dublin. The Bill introduces a financial product for which there is proven market demand and I hope it will not be long before Irish institutions follow their German counterparts.</P>
    <P>I found the Bill technical and difficult to comprehend. Nevertheless, as I read through it I got an understanding of it. I hope we will be able to take Committee Stage of the Bill, when we will deal with the technical details, at our own pace and that we will not rush it as we tend to do. I hope we will be able to tease out the different sections with the Minister. I am happy to support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. This is another step in our involvement in Europe and it presents another opportunity for this country. In recent years we have seen a complete change regarding finance and mortgages generally. Everybody remembers the 14% interest rates on mortgages and the uncertainty and trauma people experienced because of turbulence in the exchange rates and changes in interest rates. That is now gone. We are now in a stable situation thanks to our membership of the European Central Bank.</P>
      <P>Although house prices are extremely high, young people can put greater reliance on the information they are given when they take out a mortgage in that the level of interest rate change is more limited compared to what people experienced in the past. That stability in interest rates is a beneficial result of Ireland joining the single currency. One of the products this country lacked was the fixed mortgage. While there have been limited opportunities to get fixed rate mortgages over two to five years, the concept of a 20 year or 25 year fixed rate mortgage was not considered realistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is extremely technical and I freely admit that I am not qualified to discuss all the areas with which it deals. However, taking the point of view of the lay person in search of a financial deal to secure a home for their family, the Bill provides an opportunity for that person to get a mortgage agreement which was not previously available in this country. They will be able to get a 20 year or 25 year fixed mortgage. The other important element is that the mortgage can be transferred when the property is being trans<Col N="1265" /> ferred. This is innovative and new and it will be relished by the public.</P>
    <P>The other great advantage is that our financial institutions will be able to tap into this pool of finance at a better rate and pass on that rate to the public. Those two aspects of the legislation alone have practical and positive consequences for people, particularly those who wish to take out a mortgage. I am pleased with the safeguards provided in the Bill. The system is overseen by the Central Bank. All Members appreciate what the Central Bank has meant to this country over the years. While it does not have the power it had previously due to the European Central Bank overshadowing and taking control of many matters, it is still the regulator of financial institutions in this country and has done a wonderful job in that regard.</P>

      <P>I listened last night in the House to the incoming president of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. He sat on the benches where Senator Ryan sat not so long ago. He endorsed totally the decision of the Minister for Finance&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;on the matter. I am not sure of the total membership of the trade union movement in Ireland but it is probably close to 1 million people. The president speaks on their behalf so we are good for one third of the nation on that alone. I spoke to my constituents in Longford-Roscommon today and the feedback from them is very positive about the decisions of the Minister and the Government yesterday, and they are a smart electorate.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Bill, I mentioned the involvement of the Central Bank as one safeguard. The other is the monitor. I am not sure that I understand the position of the monitor and perhaps the Minister could explain what the monitor does, how it will operate, whether the monitor works in parallel with the Central Bank and if he is independent of the Central Bank. I am at a loss on that matter but I do not doubt that there is a reasonable explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1266" />I compliment the Minister and the Government for bringing this Bill forward. It is another step forward in our involvement with Europe. This country has benefited enormously from our membership of the EEC and the EU. Our decision on the euro is positive and, hopefully, people going into the mortgage market will now have a new opportunity to get a fixed mortgage. This will create increased stability. People will know where they stand when they are paying back a mortgage. That is important and will be embraced by the people. I hope that financial institutions embrace it and make it available to the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refrain from diverting from the Bill to a discussion on the budget. Senator Finneran and I will have many opportunities to discuss that and I have plenty of other fora to discuss it with the incoming president of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and to explore the degree to which he represents the membership of that body.</P>
      <P>One should not pretend to understand what one does not and I will not pretend that I understand the intricacies of this Bill. If the Members who spoke on the Bill understood its intricacies, we would be working in the financial services centre and earning £250,000 per year. I compliment the Minister on his explanation of the Bill. He would make a fine teacher as he gave such an intelligible explanation of something that is profoundly unintelligible. I would love to have the expertise to test him on Committee Stage, but even my considerable abilities to be awkward on Committee Stage would be well tested by this Bill. I will not make much trouble for the Minister.</P>
      <P>I wish to take up a point raised by Senator Finneran. The political sensitivity in Ireland and Britain of mortgage interest rates has been widely reported in the media over the years, particularly prior to EMU. Such interest rates are not as sensitive a political issue in many countries in mainland Europe because the rates tend to be stable and are in the background. That is related to different forms of funding which facilitate stable long-term interest rates. The Bill is a welcome innovation on the issue of providing people with long-term stability in terms of mortgage interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem for regulatory bodies, be it the State, the Central Bank or any other body, is that the complexity of these issues means it is very difficult to have a regulator who knows as much as the regulated. I am not implying dishonesty but I know that in the environmental area the EPA has done a wonderful job. However, many industries do not like the fact that the EPA keeps working to increase standards. This results in industries withholding information from the EPA. They do not disclose what they have done until they have to. They attempt only to meet targets. There will always be a degree of uncertainty between regulators and the regulated. I hope we have got this right, but we appear to have fol<Col N="1267" /> lowed the German model which has been extraordinarily successful.</P>
    <P>One of the most positive benefits of our membership of the EU is the process by which we have learned to do things that are often different from those in our neighbouring island. Our neighbouring island is a profoundly conservative institution in political and financial terms and in other ways. In spite of the radicalism of Thatcherism, Britain still has a profoundly conservative and traditional society. Many innovations in all sorts of areas, including that covered by this Bill, were invisible to Irish people because Britain formed a barrier. Ireland is moving from that position and this has been facilitated by EMU, which has allowed us to see things that we could not see before.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome. It is worth pointing out that one of the remarkable achievements of this country, and one of the contributors to our economic achievements, has been our success in developing the country as an international financial services centre. It was an innovation of a former Fianna Fáil Taoiseach, who is now in disrepute but whose capacity for innovative thinking in every area of life could not be disputed. His vision in many areas, including the political, cannot be denied although it would have been better if he had been less innovative in some other areas. However, the financial services centre is an achievement brought about by State activity. It epitomises the fact that the State still has a major role to play in development. This means much more than tax incentives. It involves the identification of a physical location, the putting together of a package to attract building in that area and then the attraction, via a tax package, of international agencies. None of that could be done without a creative role for the State.</P>
    <P>We should never imagine that the State can be left out of such development. The structure of what we are talking about here is conditional on a sophisticated regulatory agency, but a regulatory agency nonetheless. It is not the antithesis of a deregulated financial market due to the deliberate construction of a system which facilitates low and stable interest rates because of the reduction of perceived risk. That is usually the way, although it does not always happen like that in Irish banking. Interest rates should relate to the risk involved but, as we all remember from the days of bridging loans, banks used to sit on people's money and give secured temporary loans at the maximum overdraft interest rate with the minimum security. Unless there is vigorous competition in the banking sector, that will happen. One of the attractions of this is that it should encourage further vigorous competition in the banking sector and that is welcome.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister of State mentioned the degree to which we are integrating into the European financial market, it is worth putting on the record &ndash; it is not a criticism of this Government in particular &ndash; the extraordinary fact that, not<Col N="1268" /> withstanding the year's notice, the European banking system has not yet addressed the issue of a single European clearing house. Until last week, it was attempting to pretend that nothing was going to change and that if we had to transfer money after 1 January 2002, not only paper but real single currency, it was going to charge us differently for moving it from the Netherlands to Belgium across the border than from one point in the Netherlands to another. Our banks were at the head of the posse in terms of the rates being charged. It seems quite extraordinary that something as central to the consumer as that has been left on the long finger. I am glad, albeit reluctantly on the part of the Government which resisted some of the Commission's proposals, we are now moving. If a single market is to be successful, it has to be seen to ordinary consumers and not just the high flyers in high finance &ndash; I am not disputing the importance of these things &ndash; to make a difference but so far, it has not. I hope it will.</P>
    <P>Everybody in business thought that after 1 January 2001, or after the introduction of the single currency, cheques written in France would be treated as domestic cheques here. They suddenly discovered that they could pay 24% to cash a French cheque written in euro. That has to change. I hope innovation will be seen and that pressure will come from the State in this case. One of the many fine qualities of my colleague, Senator Ross, in his other career is his willingness, unlike many business journalists, to expect people in business to behave as if they were in the private sector, to compete for business and not to construct quasi-monopolies which protect them from the rigours of competition which they think are very good for everybody else. Most of the big institutions in Ireland do not do that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. The success of the financial services centre is one of a considerable number of successes that have been developed here. If, as we hope, it produces long-term, stable and low interest rates, particularly in the mortgage area, it will be of perceived benefit to consumers. I suppose we are coming to the stage of assuming that we will always have low interest rates given the operations of the European Central Bank but, that said, it will contribute to it. It is a further indication of the degree of sophistication we are beginning to develop in our relationships with the world. We are dealing with issues which would have been unimaginable ten years ago. I compliment the Minister of State on, as I said at the beginning, an intelligible speech which, given the topic, was a considerable achievement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. He gave an intelligible address given the considerable technicality of the legislation before us. It would seem the legislation presents a win-win situation and that there is no downside whatsoever. We are providing a mechanism through which we can get the most competitive rates available into which Ireland has not yet linked <Col N="1269" /> even though we are operating in a global economy. The way it is being done, according to the Minister of State, is that there is an exact matching of assets with liabilities. I always thought that happened anyway and that anybody looking for a loan had to have collateral which pretty much matched what they were looking for and that, in the open market, these were the basic principles that operated. The Germans seem to have pioneered the particular environment in which this has happened.</P>
      <P>About what type of assets are we talking? What provides these high quality assets which hitherto were not acceptable for rating? In what context does this operate? What demands will be made on the Irish bank or financial institution seeking to access this cheap capital? Is there a definition or description of these assets? Is there discrimination in the marketplace in relation to certain countries which might not be regarded as having a track record in the financial area? I am not saying we are one but I would like to know the context in which the assessment is made in terms of what constitutes these high quality assets. It would seem we are accessing a European and an international market elsewhere and that this type of operation has not existed here. What is the capacity and the likelihood of this operation being based in Ireland in the financial services centre? The Minister of State said the multinational banking institutions will have the opportunity to access these markets elsewhere and that our own domestic banks and financial institutions&mdash;</P>

      <P>What about our own market? Will we be likely to get the benefit of an expansion in employment and in capital coming into the country so that this will be a location for this high quality market? The Minister of State said decisions are made in a very conservative environment and that adds to its likelihood to attract a triple-A credit rating. What started as a national institution, largely in Germany, has now expanded to France, Spain and Luxembourg. The Minister of State said that in the event of an issuing institution getting into financial difficulties, these assets must be used to meet the institution's obligations to holders. What is the situation in that regard? Obviously this is the purpose for which the assets are used. How do we know how the parent body is dealt with and how it operates? What mechanism do we have in that respect?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State satisfied that is taken care of? If an Irish building society decides it wants to get a long-term fixed rate mortgage, in so far as it can get a new dispensation for its clientele and present an attractive package in Ireland and goes abroad and accesses one of these institutions, what guarantees can it give? Does it have any say other than that it is going to be what is regarded in the international market as a credit worthy body? What further guarantees does it have in that respect? It almost seems that we are accessing a pool of money abroad with competitive rates while at the same time having no clear indication whether it will be a reliable source in the long-term, especially if it is a long-term fixed rate for which we are looking.</P>
      <P>What is taking place is good in terms of competitiveness and rates, but it seems that one of the most likely spin-offs will be further closure of financial institutions. Already, the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank have substantial plans to denude rural areas and many urban areas of offices. If most of the activity is to take place by way of e-commerce and the Internet, which is the direction the Bank of Ireland in particular is going in terms of its trying to limit the amount of face-to-face customer contact, it seems there will be very little need for financial institutions to have offices. One of the down sides will be a justification by institutions for getting rid of offices because it will eliminate overheads and allow them to obtain capital much more cheaply. They can do business over the Internet. At least that is the theory. The small customers, whether it is small businesses or elderly people, who do not do business in this way will be left to the wolves once again. This will further that particular practice, which is not very desirable at present.</P>
      <P>The Bill looks very attractive to the borrower. It will open up an area of credit which would not be here otherwise. It is important that we ensure we are in the most competitive arena in that respect. Will the Minister state if there is a downside? I am suggesting that there might be in respect of some areas. I presume the Minister is suggesting it is a win-win situation right down the line.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions to the debate. Even though it is technical and complicated legislation, the contributions were worthwhile. Many Senators had a good grasp of the main thrust of the Bill, which is a credit to them and the Seanad in general. This is always the case.</P>
      <P>Senator Joe Doyle asked about the monitor in terms of its role and how it was brought about. It is almost entirely based on the<i> Pfandbriefe</i> monitor so it is not something new. The role of the monitor has a long history of 125 years. While it may be adapted to suit the Irish market, one can take it that the construction of the monitor is based exactly on how it is in the German <i>Pfandbriefe</i> market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1271" />Senator Finneran asked about the monitor's role<i> vis-à-vis </i>the Central Bank. First, the monitor is independent but he or she will have a lot of serious functions which he must carry out in terms of his responsibilities with regard to the monitoring of the pool. Although independent, there is clearly a relationship with the Central Bank. The Central Bank is the overarching body with responsibility in this area. If the bank felt the monitor was not carrying out his or her responsibilities properly, it could act on that.</P>
    <P>The monitor does not have to be an individual. It could be an institution or firm. These are the regulations that are being worked out in detail with the Central Bank at present. Wide experience shows that the monitor does not have to be an individual, but a particular firm could be made responsible for monitoring the particular assets pool.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello asked why the assets pool has worked. I do not know if the Senator was here earlier when I said that in the 125-year German experience there has not been a default. One of the reasons is the quality of the assets pool. What goes into the assets pool is valued by the Central Bank. In other words, it is the mortgage itself. It takes a prudent view of it. It is not necessarily what I might think is the current market value. When the bank's view is taken, up to a maximum of 75% of the value can be included in the pool, as one can see in the Bill. There is another substantial ceiling of space for anything deteriorating. If an asset is underperforming or something has gone wrong with it, it can be taken out of the pool immediately and replaced by a stronger asset. This creates a pool that is almost impenetrable in terms of something going wrong because of the facilities involved in the asset pool itself.</P>
    <P>There are banks in the IFSC at present whose mother companies are operating in Germany or elsewhere. This facility was not available on the Irish market so clearly there was a strong wish on the part of the IFSC to operate this type of facility. We examined this matter in relation to Irish institutions, particularly building societies. It is important that the assets invested and the rights of the members who own the individual assets are equally protected.</P>
    <P>Assets must be mortgages or public sector borrowings. That is the custom. They are guaranteed by Government loans, etc., so they are pure credit triple-A types of assets. That is why this covered assets pool has worked so successfully internationally. The <i>Pfandbriefe </i>model is the most successful model. That is why our legislation is based largely on it. We have tried to be as innovative as we can.</P>
    <P>Assets are limited to the European economic area or G7 countries. One would not be dealing with other countries that might have questionable track records in the physical area. One obviously tries to confine one's dealings to areas where there is certainty and stability. Again, the Central <Col N="1272" /> Bank of Ireland makes the assessment. It is a very prudent, conservative assessment of what the asset is worth, not necessarily what somebody might say is the market value of an asset. As I said, only 75% of that is allowed in the pool.</P>
    <P>There was some confusion in the Dáil over a matter with which I will not deal today. We will obviously address some of the questions Members raised in more detail on Committee Stage. Because I am saying 75% is allowed in the pool, this does not exclude people with 90% or 100% mortgages. It means that only 75% of the value is included in the assets pool. The rest is discounted. This point was raised in the Dáil, particularly by Deputy McDowell, and the matter was made more clear. People felt that because recent Irish mortgages are much higher, they might be excluded.</P>
    <P>Overall, it has been a very good debate. I welcome all the contributions. I look forward to addressing the matter on Committee Stage. It is clear Members have an understanding of the thrust of the Bill. As they have rightly said, much of the Bill is technical, which is necessary if everything is to work properly. I thank my officials for the clarity of the information with which they provided me to give to the House. Obviously, most Senators have realised that a complex Bill can be put across in a clear way. I thank everybody for their co-operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past few years not a week has gone by in the Seanad without Senators requesting more speech therapy teachers. I am aware that there is a shortage but I will give the case of one student in a school in Limerick, the Catherine McAuley Special School, which will illustrate the need for the immediate appointment of a speech and language therapist. This student's experience is replicated in many cases throughout the midwest and other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The girl in question is 13 and has Down's Syndrome. In her early years she was getting a certain amount of speech therapy from the health board but quite a number of speech therapists came and went, which meant that every time a new one was appointed there would be a new programme, new assessments and so on. Her parents had no complaint about any of the speech therapists apart from the number of speech therapists the girl had dealt with and the short amount of time spent with each one. While this was going on the parents applied for the child to be accepted at the Catherine McAuley Special School in Limerick, where she would get speech <Col N="1273" /> therapy that would render her ineligible for speech therapy at the Rockstown clinic.</P>
    <P>The parents cannot say enough about the excellence of the school and its teachers. She started at the school in 1997 and was getting on extremely well except for speech development. For the last two years the school has had no speech and language teacher available for the girl's development, so she is in limbo. Because she is supposed to be getting speech therapy from that school she is not getting it from the health board, so she is left without any speech therapy.</P>
    <P>This is the area in which the girl needs help most. The school lost its last speech and language therapist in Christmas 1999 and at that time the girl in question was in a group class for the maximum 12 weeks outside a mid-term break. That school has a designated specialist speech and language therapy unit sitting idle for two years. The parents who came to me are pressing hard for their daughter. She is now 13 so Members can imagine how many years she has lost in gaining confidence to speak. The fact that she has Down's Syndrome makes it more poignant as she obviously has a speech difficulty, though she is doing extremely well in all other areas. She is caught because the health board is saying that speech and language therapy is supposed to be available at the school.</P>
    <P>The parents are making concerted efforts on her behalf but what exactly is the Minister doing? The principal wants a senior appointment as there is no good in having speech therapists joining and then leaving again. I cannot see the State's logic in this situation. Parents paid for this specialist unit, which I have visited, but this magnificent facility is lying idle for two years and the child in question has had no access to speech therapy one way or the other since the school lost its speech therapist and cannot find a replacement.</P>
    <P>I am appealing to the Minister of State and I do not want a bureaucratic answer. One of the most frustrating aspects of raising an Adjournment Matter is that one has no chance to question the answer one is given. I expect the answer to be positive and that a speech therapist will be appointed to the school. It is extraordinary that this pristine, state of the art facility is unused while the child in question has no access to health board facilities. Senator Costello would agree with me as he has raised this issue also. As a secondary teacher myself I know that when such children reach second level it is too late for any interventions.</P>
    <P>It is not as if these parents have not worked on their child's behalf; ever since she was born they were determined to do what they could for their child. I am sad that she is now 13 and has not made the progress she might. This is one child too many in this position; I know the situation is replicated in many cases elsewhere. It is very poignant after the much-heralded budget yesterday. There can be no excuse for the fact that this child and many <Col N="1274" /> others in her school are left in this extraordinary position in a designated school while a specialist unit sits there like a white elephant. It is appalling and I hope the Minister of State tells me there will be an appointment immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Jackman for raising this matter and for giving me the opportunity to respond on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board is responsible for the provision of health related support services for children with disabilities in the Limerick area. The board has informed me that it has found it difficult to recruit speech and language therapists and allied health professionals needed if various therapy services are to be delivered. In acknowledgement of these difficulties, my Department asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to explore other means of enabling as many children as possible to access such services. It may be necessary to purchase additional therapy sessions, resulting in the maintenance of existing levels of service provision or an enhancement in line with agreed service developments, using the resources which have been allocated. Each health board and the Eastern Regional Health Authority must determine what additional measures should be undertaken to facilitate improved access.</P>
      <P>The post in the school referred to by Senator Jackman and other posts have been advertised nationally and in the United Kingdom, but the recruitment campaign has been unsuccessful so far. A recruitment agency has been engaged to broaden the search for therapists, with the objective of speeding up the recruitment process. Finding teachers to provide speech and language therapy to school children with an intellectual disability is a priority for the board. While significant additional resources have been made available to health boards in recent years to enhance the level of health related support services available to children with disabilities, the boards and other service providers have encountered difficulties in recruiting and retaining health professionals.</P>
      <P>Parents have been assisted in providing educational services for their children by section 8 of the Finance Act, 2001, which amends section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, to extend tax relief for medical expenses to cover the cost of educational psychological assessment and speech and language therapy services for children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department commissioned Dr. Peter Bacon to undertake a workforce planning study, which has just been published. The study examined and quantified the existing and future demand for therapy grades, including speech and language therapists. It concluded that a major expansion in the number of therapy professionals over the next 15 years is essential, necessitating a significant increase in training places. An inter-<Col N="1275" /> agency group, comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority has been created to ensure the rapid provision of additional places as an urgent priority. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to training needs. Other key recommendations relating to the shortfall in supply are also being addressed within the Department.</P>
    <P>I assure the Senator that the Government is <Col N="1276" /> committed to the ongoing development of support services for children and adults with intellectual disability, including the health related support services provided to children in special schools and other educational settings.</P>
