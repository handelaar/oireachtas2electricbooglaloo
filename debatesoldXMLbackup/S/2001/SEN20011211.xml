    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re Planning and Development Regulations, 2001; No. 2, Mental Health (Amendment) Bill, 2001 &ndash; First Stage; No. 3, Asset Covered Securities Bill, 2001 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; and No. 4, Family Support Agency, 2001 &ndash; Second Stage. The contributions of spokespersons shall not exceed 15 minutes while those of all other Senators shall not exceed ten minutes. Senators may share time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable to my group. I wish to pay a vote of sympathy to the family of the late Detective Sergeant Seán Eiffe who died in the course of duty last Friday. It is important we remember, even though we are at times critical of the Garda, that this man made the supreme sacrifice in defence of the public good. We would like to pass on our sympathies to his family.</P>
      <P>I refer to the tragedy at Wexford over the weekend. Lives were lost in dreadful circumstances and perhaps the Leader will consider having a short debate under No. 5, which will be the first item of business tomorrow. It would afford an opportunity for brief statements on asylum seekers and the events in Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn to the constitutional amendment Bill. I draw the attention of the House to a statement by a group calling itself Mother and Child, which is better known as Youth Defence. The group announced that it is about to launch a major poster campaign personalising the abortion issue around the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children. The debate so far has been about the principle involved and there is no place in politics for the personalised nastiness that the group intends to bring into the campaign. We debated the issues here last week without becoming personal or attacking the motives of people on either side. These people should be told these imported tactics have no place in Irish politics. Neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Health and Children, both of whom are doing <Col N="1362" /> their jobs honestly according to their lights on this issue, should be subjected to the personalised abuse promised by this appalling group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Leader intend to order the remainder of the debate? Is there any great point in going ahead, given that the Deputy Leader and the Tánaiste do not think there should be a referendum? Surely, at the very best, we could postpone this&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot get into those matters now on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>As always, I am just trying to be helpful. Surely we could postpone the debate until after Christmas, given that there is no urgency now about a referendum. If the Progressive Democrats continue to face both ways at once and state, &ldquo;We will vote for a referendum, but we really do not want one,&rdquo; will the Leader at least make sure that Committee and Report Stages are held on separate days?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first item, when the committees were being established we were strongly of the view that there was a need to refer matters to them and that on that basis they would be referred without debate. The reason for this was that the matters, having been considered by the committee, would then come back to the House. I note that the motion states that the committee shall send a message back to us. The reason I am raising this question is that I cannot recall any messages having being received. We have referred quite a number of matters to committees in the past six or seven months without debate. Obviously, they are being debated. If possible, I would like to get a list of all the matters we have referred to committees in the past six or seven months, and an update on their current position and when we will get a chance of debating them. The committee system is not a black hole into which we dump things. It is in place to have a rational and informed debate begun. I ask that the Leader respond to this request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to open a debate on the issues raised by what happened in Wexford last weekend except to make two simple points. Members will recall the long debates in the House and the many votes on the legislation governing the question of asylum seekers and immigrants. Time has passed and we need a debate in the House without the legislation being part of it. I ask the Leader to timetable a debate in order that Members can express their views on economic migrants, convention refugees, other refugees and asylum seekers and how they should be dealt with. It should include issues such as the right to work while waiting for their cases to be processed. We could then inform Government. It is important to have such a debate, particularly at a <Col N="1363" /> time of declining employment. I do not know who wants to go picking mushrooms in Belmullet, fruit in north Dublin or raising chickens, but we will need people to do that work.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has made his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to come to the House to explain to us what exactly is happening in RTE. I have asked this question previously. The question of Aer Lingus has been raised because it is an issue in the national media and has a high profile. That is what tends to happen in the House. It is only when an issue receives a high profile in the media that people want to discuss it. The issue of what is happening in RTE is very important and we should be getting an update. I understand there is a decision pending to sell Ireland's long wave broadcasting licence which would seem to be irrevocable. It escapes me why we would want to lose our right to broadcast on long wave, with a footprint right around western Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is pre-empting the debate with his statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree. I used it only as an example of the reason it is important to have a debate at this stage. I ask that the Minister come to the House to debate the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my sincere condolences and sorrow on the deaths over the weekend of the garda and the asylum seekers who were coming here to look for a better life. There could well be a benefit in having a debate on the general issue of immigration which, as Senator O'Toole stated, is not set in the rather passionate context of the taking of legislation. There are numerous issues which need to be looked at. Almost weekly one hears a question about the nature of the agreement with Nigeria entered into by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I understand there is another such deportation about to take place where there are serious questions of human rights and fears that the person concerned might be persecuted on returning home.</P>
      <P>Second, I seek two debates before Christmas. One is on the question of housing and homelessness. The National Economic and Social Forum reports that the situation has deteriorated considerably. Local authority housing output is well below the requirement for the homeless and others. We should also debate the war being waged in Afghanistan, the global threat from terrorism and the deteriorating position in Palestine in this season of good will in the context of the Secretary General of the United Nations being awarded the Nobel peace prize yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1364" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in expressing sympathy on the death of Sergeant Eiffe, not just to his family but also to his colleagues, particularly those who were present when this appalling incident happened.</P>
      <P>It would be useful to debate issues arising from the terrible events in Wexford and the finding of the bodies in the container. However, it ought to be considered on two levels &ndash; the national and European. It is apparent that some of the difficulties could be minimised if there were a concerted, unified European response.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning raised the matter of targeting over the proposed referendum. Some of us have already been targeted in hoarding advertising by those people. Members of the Oireachtas All-party Committee on the Constitution were targeted in that way. This is a free country and people are entitled to do that, but they should have the courage of their convictions and identify themselves on the advertising. This occurred in my local town and my experience of that committee was that several of these people showed an absolute disregard for the Oireachtas, the Judiciary and the will of the people, which is the most worrying aspect. I thank Senator Manning for his helpful comments. We will debate this on Committee Stage, which I know an Cathaoirleach would prefer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have allowed a certain latitude to the leaders because they speak on behalf of their groups on the important matters which the groups wish to raise on the Order of Business. I insist that other speakers confine themselves to questions to the Leader which are relevant to today's business. I call on sister . . . I mean Senator Ridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, my husband always said that a wonderful reverend mother was lost in me. I do not know why. He also said that if the nuns ran the country, there would never be a deficit, a statement with which I agree.</P>
      <P>I ask for a little indulgence as I received my nomination to the Seanad from the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors. I extend my deepest sympathy to the family of Sergeant Eiffe and his colleagues in the AGSI.</P>
      <P>I do not know why people are putting up posters about the referendum as no one in Dublin has spoken a word to me about it. I also think we should not proceed with it.</P>
      <P>Closer to home, or homelessness&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Closer to the Order of Business if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought that An Cathaoirleach would have had more respect for a nun.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Costello's comments on homelessness. He says that there is no room at the inn, but the reality is that there are no inns and no rooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1365" />An appalling issue is that, for whatever reason, we do not seem able to provide transport facilities for people who have a physical disability. People who do not get the appropriate transport services in the days of the gloating Minister for Finance are outside the gate today, and that is shameful. The Taoiseach should consider our colleagues outside the gates who have no transport when he is contemplating how to arrange the millions for the Bertie Bowl in Abbotstown. We should start again with a proper attitude. There should be a meaningful debate on how to meet the transport needs of people who use wheelchairs in this city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree with the sentiments expressed by Mother Ridge on the provision of transport for people with disabilities. I do not think there should be an ongoing debate on issues decided by those outside the gate. They should come to us and put their case. We will put the case to the Minister or the Leader of the House and we could then have a more meaningful discussion. Otherwise we will be dictated to by those outside the gate irrespective of whether their views are good, bad or indifferent.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise an important matter. Mr. David Byrne, the EU Commissioner was privileged to speak to this House recently. According to a report by the political correspondent, John Cooney, which was taken up by various newspapers all over Europe, Mr. Byrne described the knowledge of Europe in this House as abysmally low. If there had been sufficient time to discuss matters of European importance with him in this House, he might have formed a different impression. He suggested that Members of both Houses did not earn their salaries because of their failure to campaign in the referendum.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This has nothing to do with the Order of Business. Have you a question for the Leader of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has a relevance which I will explain. This remark is a total slur on this House and that is why it is relevant to the Order of Business. Commissioner Byrne said that he did not vote in the referendum even though as a Commissioner he was granted two days leave in which he could vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This contribution is totally out of order. It is not relevant to the Order of Business and I must ask Senator Lanigan to resume his seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask that the Commissioner return to the House to explain what he meant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader when No. 11 on the Order Paper, the matter of dumping, will be taken. I raised this matter repeatedly over the past couple of weeks. It is an important issue and we now have dumps all over the place. The latest one is in Fairview where some serious waste has been found. It has been going on for a number of <Col N="1366" /> years and has been revealed by the development of the Dublin Port tunnel.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader if there is a possibility of time being provided for a discussion on discipline in schools in the light of the decision against a teacher who wished to discipline a pupil who was supplying cannabis to other pupils in the school. I say this despite the fact that I support the legalisation of cannabis.</P>
      <P>I understand, a Chathaoirligh, that you do not wish much discussion on the question of the tragic shooting in Abbeyleix, but I wish to add my voice to those who sought a debate. The committee has been fairly neutered in investigating the Abbeylara case and that is relevant particularly since for so long we have boasted that we have an unarmed police force. We now have an armed section. We need to know what rules govern the use of guns in these circumstances. It was tragically a member of the police force who was killed but it could have been a member of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>You have made your point, Senator Norris.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the public is concerned at shootings in the public street where civilians may well be hurt. Other Members have raised the question of the refugees who tragically met their deaths while being brought to an Irish port. I ask for a debate on this matter. We should bear in mind in that debate the very serious words of Bishop Comiskey, who referred directly to legislation in a very fine and considered interview on the radio and indicated that not only Irish law but also European Community law should be looked at.</P>
      <P>With regard to posters, it is distressing for people to be pilloried in this manner, but senior politicians have a way of dealing with it. I remember the last time this kind of issue was raised and precisely the same group was around. They were abusive and violent. I treated them with contempt and I hope that is the way the Taoiseach will treat them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the damning report on water quality just published, which raises major public concern as to how all local authorities deal with the supply of good quality drinking water. Given that it is a national condemnation of local authorities, we should have a debate on it here as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have it down on the Order Paper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the expressions of sympathy for the family of Detective Sergeant Eiffe. I support Senator Manning's call to discuss the tragedy in Wexford during the debate on No. 5 tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know my county is often referred to as the Kingdom. However, it is not yet an independent republic. We never declared UDI and it is not a <Col N="1367" /> secessionist state. I call on the Leader to use his good offices on behalf of the citizens there who are still paying their taxes to get the euro calculators and ready reckoners distributed immediately to all the blank spots, which have not received them to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I know we have a very busy schedule, but I ask the Leader to allow time for debates on road safety and fire safety. Christmas is supposed to be a happy time and a family occasion. However, many families will receive tragic news of the loss of loved ones. The carnage on our roads in particular is absolutely shocking and seems to be out of control. This House could play an important role in alerting people to certain procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Following Senator Ó Murchú's point about road safety, we had a debate here two weeks ago on that. However, we held back somewhat because we understood the Road Traffic Bill would reach us before Christmas. We understood that penalty points would be introduced next year. I ask the Leader to tell us when the Road Traffic Bill will reach us. I gather it has not yet gone through the other House. That means we will not deal with it before February, in which case the penalty points will not be introduced until perhaps 2003. If that were to be so, it would be a great disappointment.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on insurance, which has been sought for some time. There are two aspects that worry me. The Government promised to establish the Personal Injury Assessment Board this year. Is it possible that we will have to wait until 2003 for that also? The Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 2001, requires the Health Insurance Authority to introduce risk equalisation. That was promised for October and it is now December. Will this be introduced in the near future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House, early in the new term, for a further discussion on the problem of immigration, which was highlighted by the tragic happenings of the weekend. I congratulate the Minister on his humanitarian approach to that tragedy. It is highly commendable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also highly unusual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to welcome Senator Costello back to the House. He and his colleagues were conspicuous by their absence from the vote last Friday. Perhaps he <Col N="1368" /> would like to confirm that he was in the genealogy office checking out his background.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the recent U-turn by the Government on stamp duty and residential rented accommodation and the ESRI report which stated that more houses were built last year than this year, which is worrying for the future, I ask for an urgent debate on housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator O'Toole for a debate on RTE. I have raised this issue on a number of occasions. I am concerned that competition from other television stations will mean the quality of programmes will not be as good. It is important to have a debate on this issue. I mentioned the Sunday sports programme when I raised this issue before. Last Sunday I listened to what replaced it and it was a joke to hear RTE personalities making jibes at each other. There is bad management in RTE. I would welcome a debate if that is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with everyone here in expressing sympathy on the tragic death of Garda Sergeant Seán Eiffe from Ratoath in County Meath. I know his family well. They are decent, hardworking and honourable people. He served his country with great distinction. I want to be associated with all the remarks made here today. The tragedy occurred while he was protecting our society.</P>
      <P>I also want to be associated with the sentiments expressed about the tragedy in Wexford. I hope to have statements next Friday on asylum seekers, for which Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Ridge, Norris, Coghlan and Glennon called. I wish the five people well who are fighting for their lives. I also commend those who are looking after them in hospital.</P>
      <P>As regards the points made by Senators Manning and Dardis about the proposed campaign by Youth Defence, I will pass their comments to the Minister responsible for that area. It is time to adhere to the standards for public notices, irrespective of who they are targeted at. No one, particularly those who are serving in the national interest and who are chosen by the people to hold certain positions, should be abused in such a way.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning mentioned the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill. With the agreement of the leaders, I intend to take Committee Stage tomorrow and Remaining Stages on Thursday. Whips and leaders will meet after the Order of Business to find agreement. I thank the leaders and the Whips for their co-operation in dealing with a heavy schedule of legislation this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will come back to Senator O'Toole about the list of matters taken without debate during the past year. Senators O'Toole and Rory Kiely <Col N="1369" /> expressed concern about what is happening in RTE. Senator Rory Kiely mentioned the Sunday sports programme on the Order of Business on a number of recent occasions. Senator O'Toole informed the House of his up-to-date knowledge. He participated well last night on &ldquo;Questions &amp; Answers&rdquo;. It is regrettable RTE is considering the sale of its long wave signal. I hope that will not happen because its long wave signal enables it to broadcast across Europe and further afield, which makes it easier to sell Ireland as a nation.</P>
    <P>Senators Costello and Ridge called again for a debate on homelessness and I have no difficulty in accommodating that in the next session. A debate on the matter was already taken during this session. Senator Costello also called for a debate on Afghanistan and the Middle East and I am happy to agree to that, time being of the essence. Senator Norris referred to No. 11 and I propose to include statements on it on the Order of Business for Friday. I will endeavour to facilitate the taking before the Christmas recess of matters called for which are of an urgent nature.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran called for a debate on water quality. We had a debate on the matter a few weeks ago, but a new report has come out which is damning of group water schemes. It is not as scathing of local authorities. Millions are being spent on group water schemes at present and, as most of us who are members of them know, local authorities being pressured to spend this money. Counties in the midlands are being pressured because of a lack of activity. Rural local authority members of all parties have responded to the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Ó Cuív's CLÁR programme. He is to co-ordinate with other Departments, such as the Department of the Environment and Local Government, with regard to the programme. I certainly agree with the sentiments expressed in the Senator's call for the debate and I will have time allowed for a debate.</P>
    <P>I note Senator Coghlan's comment about the euro. Senators Ó Murchú and Quinn spoke about road safety. The Road Traffic Bill, 2001, is before the Dáil and it is hoped that it will come before this House in February. Senator Quinn also called for a debate on the insurance industry, which I have agreed to. He referred specifically to public liability. It is extremely difficult to get cover in the first place and, having got it, to be quoted a reasonable cost. I will certainly allow time for this debate in the early part of the next session.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke returned to an old chestnut. As a local authority member he is always vigilant. I welcome his congratulating the Minister for Finance on restoring mortgage interest relief in the budget. It will allow the investor to come back into the market. I heard at lunch time that a very large company is returning to Ireland and will employ 400 people in construction. This is very welcome to Members on all sides of the House as we are all concerned that such occurrences will <Col N="1370" /> take place. It is positive news and an immediate positive response to a very good budget.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

    <P>This is a technical Bill and most of my amendments are of a technical nature. The definition of dealing in an asset includes &ldquo;originating, acquiring and disposing&rdquo; of an asset. I propose the substitution of &ldquo;or&rdquo; for &ldquo;and&rdquo;. It is unlikely anyone intends the originating, acquiring and disposing of an asset to mean dealing. The use of &ldquo;or&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;and&rdquo; is preferable and I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

Am I to understand that designated mortgage credit institutions are not allowed hold mortgage credit assets as tier two assets and designated public credit institutions are not allowed hold public credit assets as tier two credit assets? Will the Minister of State explain this section of the Bill to me?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Senator refers specifically to tier one and tier two assets. I will give him the explanatory note on it. He is essentially correct in what he said but I will read the note for the sake of clarity.</P>
      <P>Tier one assets are those designated by the European Central Bank for monetary policy operations. These are assets which euro area banks must place with their national central bank as collateral when they require excess cash from their central bank. Examples of tier one assets include Government bonds and high quality commercial paper. For the purpose of the Bill, tier one assets may not be considered as such by a designated public credit institution if they are also public credit assets. This is because the purpose of the definition is to set out assets which are eligible for use as substitution assets. The same assets should not be eligible for inclusion in pools as public credit assets and substitution assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tier two assets are those designated by national central banks for monetary policy oper<Col N="1372" /> ations. These are assets additional to tier one assets which euro area banks may place with their national central bank as collateral when they require excess cash from their central bank. The list of tier two assets varies between member states depending on the character of the financial market in each state. Examples of tier two assets in Ireland include commercial paper, high grade corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities. For the purposes of the Bill, tier two assets may not be considered as such if they are also public credit assets, mortgage credit assets or substitution assets. This is because the purpose of the definition is to set out activities additional to mortgage business or public credit business in which a designated credit institution may engage. Assets which an institution may already hold in other ways should not be used to engage in these additional activities.</P>

The purpose of the subsection is to ensure the maximum flexibility is maintained. More specifically, it will provide for the possibility of including certain proportions of mortgage backed securities in a cover assets pool, if this is deemed an appropriate course of action. That is the point we covered on Second Stage.</P>

      <P>At a time when we are transferring most of our powers from the Central Bank to the European Central Bank it appears that we are giving the Central Bank more detailed powers under the Bill.

      <P>This section sets out the functions of the Central Bank, which have to do with the regulations which are not being transferred by <Col N="1374" /> any of the national central banks to the ECB. The Central Bank still has an important regulatory function in its own market. That is the reason the section relates to it specifically. It also deals with other matters regarding the European Central Bank, but not functions of this type. It sets out the functions of the Central Bank which are essentially to approve credit institutions as designated credit institutions for the purpose of the Bill and to regulate them as well as the asset covered securities market.</P>
      <P>Explicit functions conferred on the Central Bank under the Bill are additional to those functions it already has in relation to the supervision of financial institutions under the Central Bank Act, the Building Societies Act and EU directives etc. These general supervisory powers also apply to designated credit institutions.</P>
      <P>The Senator asked specifically about section 9(3) which clarifies the supervisory functions and powers of the Central Bank under the Central Bank Acts, Building Societies Act, EU directives etc which apply to designated credit institutions subject to modifications as are necessary to adapt them for the purpose of the Bill. The only circumstance in which these supervisory functions and powers do not apply is where they are specifically disapplied by the Bill. This is to ensure no general power or function of the bank overrides the specific provisions applying to designated credit institutions and asset covered securities by the Bill. In other words, we maintain the primacy of what is being established under the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, there are many other pieces of legislation which equally come into play when dealing with fraud, etc. The fine to which the Senator is probably referring is the small fine on summary conviction. There is a larger fine on indictment. There are other Acts in place which cover serious fraud and which are not being superseded. The smallest fine in the Bill is on summary conviction, but if the situation develops into a major crime, obviously there are other laws to take care of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The banks may establish subsidiaries to do so. As the Senator is aware, there has to be a balance in the books of the financial institution as to what way it is to be done. Therefore, it may have to establish a subsidiary which specifically fits within the remit to enter the asset covered securities pool. Some of the mortgage institutions would not have to establish a subsidiary. Designated credit institutions are confined in the range of business activities they can carry out. This means it is unlikely that existing banks or building societies will seek designation in their own right because most of them would have to curtail their range of activities significantly. It is, therefore, likely in the case of mortgage institutions that the institution interested in issuing these bonds will set up subsidiary companies which will apply to the Central Bank for registration as designated credit institutions. This is provided for in section 58 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 24, subsection (4), line 36, after &ldquo;institution&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, such conditions as were imposed by the authority under <i>section 14(5).</i>&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The register of designated public credit institutions must contain the name and the address of the principal place of business of each designated public credit institution and such other information as the Authority determines.</P>
      <P>I propose that section 17(4) should read as follows:</P>
      <P>The register of designated public credit institutions must contain the name and address of the principal place of business of each designated public credit institution, such conditions as were imposed by the authority under section 14(5) and such other information as the Authority determines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for tabling the amendment. Section 14 allows the Central Bank to attach conditions to a credit institution registration as a designated credit institution. Section 16 allows the Central Bank to vary these con<Col N="1376" /> ditions and impose new conditions. These conditions are additional to those which the Central Bank may impose on designated credit institutions through its regulatory powers generally.</P>
      <P>The provision is designed to resolve any specific issues the bank might consider need to be addressed if it is to award a particular institution designated credit institution status or to allow an institution to keep that status. It mirrors the approach taken to the licensing of banks under the Central Bank Act but it is not envisaged that it will be widely used.</P>
      <P>As it stands, section 17(4) enables the Central Bank to record these conditions in the register of designated public credit institutions should the Central Bank decide to do so. However, I would not be in favour of making the disclosure of these conditions mandatory. This is because such conditions might contain sensitive financial or personal information which could have a lasting effect on the reputation of the institution concerned out of all proportion to the reason for which the condition was imposed or, in the case of published personal information, leave the condition open to legal challenge. Furthermore, publication of conditions could damage the Irish asset covered securities market or the financial services industry generally. This would not be in the public interest and it would be unhelpful to the prudent regulation of the market if the Central Bank had to take the impact of publication into account every time it wished to impose a condition.</P>
      <P>It is my view that any decision to publish conditions should be left to the Central Bank and each individual case must be considered on its merits. Consequently, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This section sets out the conditions under which the authority may direct a designated credit institution to suspend its business. We should be very wary of granting the courts powers to hold hearings on such issues <i>in camera</i> because certain judgments have been made in the family courts due to the secret nature of some of the cases held <Col N="1377" /> there.

      <P>It is an important point. As the Senator knows there was a lot of discussion during formulation of the Bill, largely driven by the representatives of the industry and based on good experience of legalisation and the way the market operates in Germany. It was a question of getting the balance between the responsibilities of the regulatory authority and those of the Minister that would ensure flexibility was built into the <Col N="1378" /> Bill. The reason for the flexibility is clear. This is a new product and we want it to work extremely well. We do not want to set it down in such a rigid way that it does not have the flexibility to move with the market. A balance has been struck between the responsibilities of the regulatory authority and those of the Minister. A lot of them are obvious &ndash; the actions which the Central Bank should take are, in most cases, obvious. What has been retained for alteration or regulation by the Minister is equally obvious. The balance struck gives an inherent flexibility and all interested parties have welcomed that.</P>

      <P>It is an important point which led to some confusion. People thought that if a mortgage held was greater than 75% of the value it could not be included, but that is not the case. It can be a 100% mortgage. The maximum we will allow into the pool is a 75% valuation. That is not necessarily what the Senator or I might think is the market valuation. It would be a prudent valuation done by the Central Bank and it could be even less again. That is to ensure the quality of the assets and the security and surety of the product available.</P>

      <P>That is very straightforward and it will happen. As the Senator knows, there will be occasions when an asset may have to be removed by default. It may have come to the end of its life term and it will come out of the pool and be replaced by a new mortgage. An asset belonging to an individual in the pool has no direct implications or effect on the holder.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 41, subsection 2(<i>d</i>), line 37, after &ldquo;made up&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and comparative prior-year figures showing the current default status of assets held in the pool at the end of the prior-year period&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A number of the assets were held in the cover assets pool at the date to which the financial statement for that year was made up. I propose that it should read &ldquo;. . .  at the date to which the financial statement for that year was made up and comparative prior-year figures showing the current default status of assets held in the pool at the end of the prior-year period&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties for an individual investor is that the asset pool to which he or she will have claim is dynamic in its nature. He or she may have an eventual claim on a pool of assets but the exact assets in the pool may vary from time to time. This section sets out the financial statement publication obligations in respect of assets in default. There is the danger of financial institutions replacing defaulting credits with non-defaulting credits to window-dress their financial statement. Requiring the financial institutions to show the current default status of assets held in the pool at the end of the prior-year period will help prevent this. I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>We were not sure what the Senator's intention was when he tabled this amendment. Having listened to him I am satisfied that the point the Senator made is more than well covered. Section 42 sets out details of the mortgage credit assets contained in cover asset pools which must be cleared in a designated mortgage credit institution's financial statement. It is designed to give the reader information on the quality of the mortgages underpinning the pool. Subparagraph (<i>d</i>), to which the Senator has tabled the amendment, requires designated credit institutions to set out details of assets on which there have been defaults on payments in the previous year. Subparagraph (<i>c</i>) requires the desig<Col N="1380" /> nated credit institutions to set out details of defaults at the time the financial statements are made up. Subparagraph (<i>e</i>) requires institutions to record all cases where it has replaced non-performing mortgage credit assets with new assets.</P>
      <P>The Bill as it stands requires designated credit institutions to show all relevant information in respect of current and previous defaults in cover asset pools and cases where non-performing assets have had to be replaced. I think that fully meets the questions raised by the Senator.</P>

      <P>In page 47, subsection 8(<i>a</i>), line 12, to delete &ldquo;less&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;more&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is a little difficult when one does not get help from anyone in the House and is on one's feet all the time. Section 47(8)(<i>a</i>) provides that &ldquo;a covered asset pool maintained by the institution has a duration of not less than the public credit covered security that relates to the pool&rdquo;. I propose that section 47(8)(<i>a</i>) should state &ldquo;a covered asset pool maintained by the institution has a duration of not more than that of the public credit covered security that relates to the pool&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The section addresses the conditions under which assets may be replaced in a covered asset pool. Other subsections protect the position of the investor by insisting the replacements have a market value and annual interest payments not less than the original assets. &ldquo;Duration&rdquo; is not necessarily a positive for investors as it denotes a time risk. Many investors would prefer a shorter rather than a longer duration. That is the purpose of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I fully appreciate the difficulties the Senator had working on his own to table amendments on this particularly technical Bill. I compliment him on his efforts. He has put a great deal of work into the legislation, which is welcome. I have examined the subsection the Senator proposes to amend and I am satisfied it is correct as drafted. &ldquo;Duration&rdquo; is a technical financial term which measures financial assets in regard to when payments will be received. It is expressed in years in respect of those assets. It is vital that the duration of the covered asset pool is at least equal to that of the securities so that it will contain sufficient funds to pay interest on and redeem the securities. In other words, one does not want a scenario where the aggregated assets collaterising asset covered securities mature before the securities. I must, therefore, reject the amendment.</P>

      <P>The section deals with transfers of assets between credit institutions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am <i>ad idem</i> with the Senator on this point but it is covered by the legislation. The purpose of the subsection is to clarify that if legal proceedings are pending with regard to any asset or business whose transfer is proposed under the section, the proposed transfer will have no effect on those legal proceedings. If the transfer takes place, the transferee assumes the rights and obligations of the transferor in respect of the legal proceedings. The amendment would introduce an element of doubt as it raises the question of whether there might be circumstances in which the legal proceedings may not continue. As drafted, the subsection provides that the transfer of assets has no effect on the legal proceedings other than to make the transferee become a party to the proceedings in place at the transfer. The subsection does not have any implications for the normal conduct of legal proceedings. Whether, for example, the parties to the legal proceedings decide to settle or a court decides to put a stay on proceedings are entirely separate matters on which the legislation does not impinge. I do not, therefore, propose to accept the amendment but the Senator is in agreement with we have proposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Ms Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith leithscéal a gabháil ar son an Aire. Tá Ceisteanna na Dála ag dul ar aghaidh ag an am gcéanna agus cé go bhfuil muid inár bpoiliteoir, nílimid in ann a bheith in dhá áit ag an am chéanna.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to present the Bill to the House on behalf of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. It provides for the establishment of a new statutory body to be known as the Family Support Agency which will bring together the main programmes and pro-family services introduced by the Government in recent years to support families, promote continuity and stability in family life and prevent marital breakdown, and to foster a supportive community environment for families at local level. The Bill delivers on commitments in An Action Programme for the Millennium to protect the family through political, economic, social and other measures which will support the stability of the family and through a &ldquo;families first&rdquo; policy focus designed to make families central to policymaking.</P>
      <P>The legislation marks a significant step forward in providing a comprehensive and coherent response for families in need of support services and for families generally. The Family Support Agency will: provide a family mediation service; support, promote and develop the provision of marriage and relationships counselling services, and family support services; and support, promote and develop the Family and Community Services Resource Centre programme. The legislation provides for the transfer of responsibility for the administration of these programmes from within the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to the new agency which will report to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>The agency will also have functions in providing information about these services as well as promoting knowledge about parenting responsibilities and family issues. It will undertake research and have an advisory role to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs in family matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new agency will be overseen by a board with expertise and experience in matters related <Col N="1384" /> to its responsibilities and will be accountable for Government investment in the development of family services and programmes which, following a substantial additional investment announced in the budget, amounts to almost £13.5 million next year.</P>
    <P>The Family Support Agency will be a dedicated agency and a resource for voluntary and community groups which work with families at national and local level and all those involved in promoting family well-being, in particular, family resource centres.</P>
    <P>I will now outline the principal features of the Bill. The Family Support Agency will carry out its function, set out in section 4, to provide family mediation through the family mediation service which the Government has expanded nationwide in the past four years. The service is free, professional and confidential which assists couples, who have decided to separate, to reach agreement on all issues related to their separation. It is important when a couple have decided to separate that they have a service which allows them to deal with the issues which arise at the breakdown in a non-adversarial manner where this is possible. This approach is particularly helpful where children are concerned. It is a feature of the mediation process that parenting arrangements focus on children having ongoing supportive relationships with both parents into the future.</P>
    <P>The family mediation service was established on a pilot basis in 1985. In 1997, it was available in two centres in Dublin and Limerick. Since the Government has taken office, new services have been established in Athlone, Castlebar, Cork, Dundalk, Galway, Tralee and Wexford. The Dublin service has been expanded and relocated to larger premises to deal with more clients and new services have been established in Tallaght and Marino.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides the statutory framework to secure the future development of these activities. An important goal for the Family Support Agency will be that family mediation is recognised and promoted as an alternative to more adversarial approaches to resolving issues that arise on marital breakdown and that more people throughout the country have access to this very valuable professional family support service.</P>
    <P>Section 4(1)(<i>c</i>) provides that the Family Support Agency will support, promote and develop the provision of marriage and relationship counselling and family support services. A new service for Blanchardstown and surrounding areas is planned for early in the new year. In line with the nationwide expansion, the number of couples assisted by the service has increased significantly from 484 in 1997 to 1,225 this year. In addition to its services to clients, the family mediation service each year provides a small number of training places for people who wish to specialise in family mediation, thereby contributing to the growth <Col N="1385" /> and development of a vibrant profession of family mediators.</P>
    <P>Government grant aid for the provision of these services in the voluntary sector has increased from £900,000 in 1997 to £5.2 million in 2002. There are now over 400 voluntary and community groups throughout the country providing marriage and relationship counselling, marriage preparation programmes, child counselling for children whose parents have separated, and bereavement counselling and support services. A key objective for the Family Support Agency will be the development of a strong regional network of accessible counselling services for families as recommended by the commission on the family and envisaged in the Government programme.</P>
    <P>Government investment has enabled the first steps to be taken with key providers of services towards this long-term strategic objective. The agency will build on this start. As a dedicated agency, with its own budget and expertise, it will be well placed to assist the voluntary counselling services in meeting new challenges such as the sector's growing professionalisation, the increasing emphasis on high standards of training and qualification, and the need for the development of models of best practice.</P>
    <P>The Family Support Agency is being given in section 4(1)(<i>e</i>) a specific responsibility to support, promote and develop the family and community services resource centre programme, currently being administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. This programme has been singled out by the Government in recent years for radical improvement and expansion. In 1997 there were ten centres, while in the review of An Action Programme for the Millennium the Government is committed to establishing 100 centres. To date, 80 centres are either up and running or have been approved for inclusion in this programme. The additional investment of £0.83 million, provided in the budget, brings the overall allocation for the programme's development in 2002 to over £4.1 million. The aim is to help combat disadvantage by strengthening the capacity of families to carry out their caring responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Services for lone parent families, young mothers and others in need of extra support can be provided. Initiatives to enhance the role of young fathers in the lives of their children, improve parenting skills and promote the greater involvement of young men in the life of the community are also part of the programme in some centres. Family and community services resource centres build on local neighbourhood solidarity, promote informal support networks and have links with schools and services in their locality. The Family Support Agency will be an important resource for their work by enhancing the role and capacity of these local community initiatives in responding to families at neighbourhood level. <Col N="1386" /> The agency will work with the centres by fostering their individuality and helping them to promote and develop their own ways of working within their communities.</P>
    <P>The agency will undertake research to better inform the development of policy and services to promote family well-being in the future. It is being given responsibility to provide information to the public about issues relating to marriage and relationships education, family mediation, parenting issues and family responsibilities to better support parents in the ordinary day to day challenge of rearing their children. Furthermore, it will co-operate with other public authorities in providing information to assist families in balancing their work commitments with their family responsibilities. The research and information functions will underpin the agency's role in providing advice to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs on family matters. The Bill provides that in carrying out its responsibilities the agency will have regard to Government policy, and, in particular, to social inclusion objectives.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for that membership of the agency will comprise 12 members including the chairperson. These will include an officer of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, an elected member of the staff and persons who have relevant experience or expertise in matters relating to the agency's functions and responsibilities. In particular, the Minister considers it necessary for the agency to include members with a special interest or expertise in areas such as family mediation, counselling, the work of family and community services resource centres, and parenting matters.</P>
    <P>The Governments' legislative proposals for the Family Support Agency are designed to provide the comprehensive and coherent response that families today need. It will provide national and local voluntary organisations working with families with the back-up and support they need in a dedicated new body. It will increase our knowledge and understanding of the issues facing families so that Government and all those with a shared interest in family well-being are better equipped to respond to the needs of families as we enter the new century.</P>
    <P>It is particularly vital that the State, the community and families work together in the way envisaged in this agency so that better outcomes are achieved for families in today's changing world. The agency will be both an agent and a symbol of what is needed if we are to have a real &ldquo;families first&rdquo; approach. Molaim an Bille seo don Teach.</P>

      <P>I assure the Minister of State that she is more than welcome to this House while the Minister is detained in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All sides of the House support this Bill. To <Col N="1387" /> oppose it would be akin to opposing motherhood and apple pie. Notwithstanding that, there are issues which must be explored, particularly as this is a proposal which is bringing the voluntary agencies along.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the role of the Department's family unit and its work over the years in which it has displayed dedication and understanding. This Bill is the culmination of that work. We must also applaud all the voluntary agencies that run the country's family and community centres. There is no end to the dedication of many volunteers to our society. It is ironic that the Taoiseach acknowledged that recently. Without them, we could not run many of our services and it is good that we have people who are concerned about the community as it enriches us as a society. Anything which makes the system more effective is welcome. I support the idea of the Government services working hand in hand with voluntary agencies.</P>
    <P>It is important to put this agency on a statutory basis. It has various functions which raise certain issues. The Minister's conclusion is that it will provide the comprehensive and coherent response that families today need, yet there is no longer a set definition of what a family is. The cosy idea of the nuclear family does not exist in many circumstances. We need to acknowledge that there are many different facets to family life today. There are lone parents living on the poverty line who need high support. There are a myriad of difficulties and pressures on family life. This was widely acknowledged in the debate in the other House. There are huge divisions in our society and anything that helps bring about true equality in society must be pursued avidly.</P>
    <P>Education, the support of agencies such as this and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs all have a part to play. We must acknowledge the huge issues that exist such as child poverty and the drugs problem. Despite the fact that the OECD report shows our children are performing well within the education system, there are unfortunately huge numbers who drop out far too early. As servants of the public, we must dedicate ourselves to people such as these and ensure that they receive the best possible support.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes a family mediation service. The Law Society of Ireland has written a submission on the topic of mediation. I propose that we examine this topic more closely on Committee Stage. The Law Society also welcomes the spirit of this Bill but it is concerned about the absence of detail in some sections. This submission is dated 28 November 2001 and I am sure the Minister is aware of it. The society states:</P>
    <P>. . .  the absence of such a definition [of family mediation] dilutes the previous stated purpose of setting up a statutory agency dealing <Col N="1388" /> with family mediation. The definition should include, <i>inter alia,</i> that mediation is available for both married and unmarried couples and for a variety of family issues.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (b) (i) of the 2001 Bill alludes to mediation through such persons as it considers appropriate. The Committee believes that the standards of practice and training established by the Family Mediation Service (FMS) should be an essential requirement for any non FMS mediator. Accordingly, reference to standards of practice and training in this Bill is essential to maintain high standards in this most vital of services.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any quarrel about this but it should be underlined. The submission continues:</P>
    <P>Section 4(2)(a) of the Bill refers to the need to assist, in particular, couples involved in the process of separation or divorce to reach agreement where possible, especially in disputes involving children.</P>
    <P>Obviously we all agree on this point.</P>
    <P>The Committee is concerned that this may act to limit the existing statutory provision, where there is no attempt to limit mediation provision to child issues alone. Indeed, research suggest that in all issues mediation results in more positive outcomes.</P>
    <P>Under the existing statutory framework, communications between the parties to mediation and a third party (mediator) are inadmissible in evidence. We propose that a similar section be inserted in the Family Support Agency Bill, 2001, to ensure confidentiality.</P>
    <P>That is a very important point. The committee expresses its concern at the significant shortage of available mediators. I remember making this point in the other House when we were talking about family breakdown. It is absolutely necessary to have trained mediators available. It goes on:</P>
    <P>This shortage significantly impacts on the statutory requirement imposed upon solicitors to discuss with their clients the possibility of engaging in mediation to help effect a separation on an agreed basis. This is a requirement under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996, and the Children Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>We would all agree that a separation on an agreed basis without all of the trauma that is consequent on a divisive and adversarial situation is preferable. No matter how friendly or agreed the basis for separation is, it is still traumatic. A lack of availability of mediation services makes the whole situation impossible. I stress to the Minister the need for resources for mediation ser<Col N="1389" /> vices. This cannot happen overnight. We are aware of enormous gaps in the system and the personnel are not available to develop the services. There are huge gaps in the area of child care. If we wish to protect children we must have the trained personnel available.</P>
    <P>One of the functions of the agency will be to provide financial assistance to voluntary bodies. I have been involved in the voluntary sector for many years. I was involved in the marriage counselling services many years ago. Voluntary services are never sure of their funding. Is it proposed that this agency will be able to provide multi-annual funding? I am chair of the Well Woman Centres. We are part of the GMS service and also provide counselling services. We are funded through the Eastern Regional Health Authority. We never know when the money will be made available. The amount of funding is agreed on a year to year basis. It is very difficult to make plans and provide service without knowing what funding will be provided and whether it will be paid on time. Cash flow is essential to any organisation or service. No cash flow means no service. People have to eat and have to be paid. That is true for the voluntary sector where professionals are providing a much-needed service and must be paid promptly. Will the agency allow multi-annual funding and will that be the relationship between the agency and the Department?</P>
    <P>The promotion and dissemination of information about issues relating to family mediation, marriage and relationships, education, parenting and family responsibilities is very critical. Tomorrow we will be discussing the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001. We get our priorities wrong in this country. Why do we not put our resources, time and effort into education?</P>
    <P>The family and community services resource centres build on neighbourhood solidarity, promote informal support networks and have links with schools and services in their locality. That probably works well in some circumstances. However, the agency should be developing good relationships with the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science. There should be an acknowledgement of the type of information needed by children to develop responsible attitudes. To ensure we avoid children having children, they must be properly educated in sexuality and relationships. I acknowledge that resources are required to support such children, but we should give them the ability to make the most of their own lives and make choices when they are responsible enough to do so.</P>
    <P>A number of family and community centres were very concerned about the lack of consultation. They suddenly found this agency was going ahead. Having worked as voluntary agen<Col N="1390" /> cies, they fear they will be taken over by bureaucracy. The Minister and officials in the family unit appear to be willing to thrash this out, but it needs to be done as a matter of urgency. It is important we consider the views of people who have been working on these issues day after day and understand them well.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of this agency. I will have some amendments on Committee Stage and I look forward to hearing more from the Minister about approaches that will be made to the existing voluntary services.</P>

This is another part of the Government's family first policy which goes right back to the renaming of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. As Senator Keogh rightly said, the family is the cornerstone of our society and regardless of its make-up or break-up there is a responsibility on Government to formulate policies designed to protect the family and provide the services and support structures needed by families.</P>
      <P>In recent years there has been a remarkable change in family structures. The family regarded as traditional by most of us is rarer and may be in danger of extinction. The family make-up is now more varied, complex and transient and we need to deal with all the problems this creates. Whereas we may appear very affluent when compared to 40 or 50 years ago, that affluence has brought many problems and pressures for families. The family structure we all knew and loved so well was made up of the grandparents and the extended family as a whole. The support from the extended family was not only financial, but also social and emotional. This Bill is aimed at providing some of that support in promoting the continuity and stability of the family. It is aimed at preventing marital breakdown and making it easier when breakdown occurs.</P>
      <P>There are two aspects to this Bill. There is the family mediation service with the services for the family directly. The other relates to the community support structures, which have been in place through the family and community resource centres. We must ensure the ideologies of both are maintained under the new agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The family mediation service has been invaluable to the community. This service allows a couple who have decided to separate to deal with issues in a non-adversarial manner. However, while it has extended almost nationwide, among the public there is a lack of awareness that this service exists and that it is free and confidential. Many people who are going through difficulties in their families feel they have nobody to whom they can turn because they do not know about <Col N="1391" /> these services. We must raise awareness of them. I know information is available through citizen information centres, various social welfare offices etc., but there can be difficulties for people who do not go to those offices.</P>
    <P>This service reduces the cost to people and more importantly prevents some of the emotional trauma, referred to by Senator Keogh. Regardless of how friendly a break-up may be, there will always be serious anger and hurt experienced by both parties. There should be an emphasis on making it easier at that difficult time. One of the main objectives of the family mediation service is to focus on the needs of the children when a family breaks up.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the family affairs unit in the Department and to the family mediation service for the professionalism in their work in recent years. They have made it easier for a large number of couples who have decided to go their separate ways. Their work, on behalf of their customers, will be a major asset to the new agency.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the voluntary bodies and community groups throughout the country which provide services. One would be unable to list all the services they provide, but the principal ones relate to marriage preparation and counselling. It would be impossible to quantify the value of such services to the community. Regardless of how affluent we think we are, the work of voluntary groups will continue into the future and probably be more necessary in our busy lives.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the new agency and the implementation of its plans, objectives and programmes are important. It will be involved in a wide range of programmes. However, we must ensure that in establishing such an agency a strong network system is established between it and regional and local services. It is clear from the establishment of other statutory bodies that it is possible to get lost in the layers of bureaucracy and for funding to be used for administrative purposes rather than for those who need it. My gripe is with the health boards. I know it is a debate for a different day, but I am concerned that when the support agency is established, which I wholeheartedly welcome, and services are amalgamated there will be so many co-ordinators, facilitators and managers it will be possible to get lost in the layers of bureaucracy and that resources will not be directed towards those who need them. I do not have any doubt that when the work of the family unit is transferred to the agency the same professionalism will be shown and the resources directed towards those who need them.</P>
    <P>As the service expands, the plans and objectives will be outlined for the next number of years. Like the family mediation service which started with two centres, it is required that family and community services resource centres are established on a nationwide basis. If we are here <Col N="1392" /> in ten years, we will probably be talking about expanding the service. I do not have any doubt it will work.</P>
    <P>We all recognise the difficulties faced by family and community services resource centres. It is justifiable that they are afraid of change because when a system is in place and working, whether it is community or voluntary based, there is always a fear about changing it. However, it is necessary to bring them under the one umbrella. Part of their fear is that resources will be directed towards the family mediation service rather than community development structures. When existing bodies are amalgamated into one unit there is always the fear that one will be overtaken by the other. I hope the ethos and identity of the family mediation service and the family and community services resource centres are recognised and valued in the new agency.</P>
    <P>The family and community services resource centres have provided great benefits for the communities in which they are involved. One centre in the most disadvantaged part of my county provides basic services for local people, such as courses on parenting skills for lone parents, cookery, assertiveness and local community development. It also has a good visual impact on the locality. For the first time residents associations have been established, not as a lobby group, but to help in the development and enhancement of their environment. The community and individuals will benefit from everyone working together to develop their area. The commitment of those involved in the family and community services resource centres is second to none. I understand their fears that resources will be directed towards family mediation and counselling services. However, there is not any doubt that community development and support structures are of equal value to the individual needs of the family mediation service.</P>
    <P>Senator Keogh mentioned the difficulty involved in getting sufficient counsellors and mediators, not only for the family mediation service, but for all aspects of counselling, such as that for bereaved children. I do not know how we can ensure we have sufficient numbers, but that matter must be addressed. As the service develops and grows, there will be a greater need for such counsellors.</P>
    <P>I do not want to reiterate what the Minister of State said about what we want to achieve through the Bill. The family and community services resource centres should be treated the same as the family mediation service because they are both of equal importance. The Minister of State said the agency will work towards fostering the individuality of the centres and helping them to promote and develop their own ways of working within the communities. That is important because the requirements in a large urban area may not be the same as those in a smaller town. <Col N="1393" /> It is important to identify the individuality of centres and support them.</P>
    <P>A statement by the Commission on the Family sums up the Bill's objectives. It stated the experience of family living is the single greatest influence on an individual's life. It is in the family context that a person's basic emotional need for security, belonging, support and intimacy is satisfied. The Family Support Agency has the ability to provide that support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. I praise the staff of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs because the change in attitude from what it was years ago is amazing. Years ago I came face to face with patients who had problems and used to get many complaints about the treatment they received from the Department. However, I have not received any such complaints in years. It is not because they have given up on me doing anything for them, but because they believe they are getting a better service from the Department. I compliment all the staff there, from the top to the bottom. They seem to have made a very great effort. I was told it was one of the first Departments to provide extra training to staff on the management of their jobs and it appears to have paid off.</P>
      <P>Family breakdown is very sad and we must do whatever we can to prevent it. Like Senator Leonard, I hope that the family and community services resource centre programme will not be dropped by the mediation service. The mediation service is extraordinarily important and has gone from strength to strength since it was begun in 1985. As the Minister of State pointed out in her speech, there are now centres all over the country. However, I would like to see centres as locally based as possible because of what Senator Leonard said about them being individual to localities. There is not a typical mediation centre that is suitable for everywhere. Every place has different needs and it is most important that we ensure those needs are met.</P>
      <P>The scope of the Bill is good. It is good that &ldquo;family&rdquo; has not been defined. As both Senators who spoke before me have said, the family is a much looser arrangement than it was in the past. Things are now as they are in the spiritual tenet, which is that we are all God's family. The concept is understood in the broadest possible sense. While I am glad &ldquo;family&rdquo; is not defined, perhaps we should do more about defining &ldquo;family mediation&rdquo;. Senator Keogh brought up the difficulties she felt were occasioned by the lack of definition of that and I too am concerned that less than professional people could describe themselves as mediators of family issues. That should be looked at in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad no distinction is drawn between couples who are married and those who are not. A very large number of children are now born to <Col N="1394" /> parents who are not married. All of us are inclined to think it is better to have two parents than one, but we do not want to see a child deprived of two parents because of some social mores we all have. Therefore, I am delighted to see that provided for in the Bill. The word &ldquo;grandparents&rdquo; is not mentioned, but grandparents are part of the broader family and it is important to remember that they bring up many children nowadays. They may be the ones who are in need of mediation and it is important that they not be excluded. Maureen Gaffney, who chairs the national social and economic forum, produced a very good report recently on lone parents in which she pointed out how extremely important it is that lone fathers are kept in contact with their children. We have legislation regarding the single mother's allowance.</P>
    <P>Senator Keogh said she gets fed up of announcing herself as the chairman of Well Woman centres. I am the president of Cherish and I announce myself as such frequently. It is important to note that voluntary organisations play an important role in our society and it is good to see them included in the Bill. From the point of view of Cherish, this family legislation is welcome.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons I welcome the extension of the mediation service is that it is going well. People can endure dreadful trauma in the Family Court where there is an entirely unsuitable adversarial system. That system can be very damaging in stressful circumstances which are already bad. Men and women have been in contact with me to say they found themselves in an even worse predicament having gone to court. The strict application of the <i>in camera </i>rule in the Family Court is a problem. I have a motion on the Order Paper which states:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann, concerned that some of those involved in child custody cases before the Family Courts feel aggrieved about their treatment, asks the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider allowing some reporting from these courts, on an anonymous basis, so that the public may have a better knowledge of the workings of the Courts.</P>
    <P>I am not the only one who has suggested that is a good idea. Judges have asked for it. Mr. Justice Paul Carney said, in a paper he presented to the Law School at Trinity College, Dublin, that he felt the media could be trusted to responsibly report family law. He compared the issue to his experience in rape cases saying, &ldquo;It seems to me that the complete absence of reporting of family law cases is damaging to our understanding of the nature of our society.&rdquo;  It is significant that we have little idea of what is going on in terms of the break up of marriages and families in our society. We do not comprehend how extraordinarily stressful it is. No case is without tears and grief.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" />When he was speaking in Mallow at a family law association conference, Dr. Gerry Byrne, a child psychiatrist who regularly gives evidence in family law cases, said he felt the secrecy surrounding family law cases should be modified for the protection of children, the maintenance of professional standards and for the common good. The Minister of State might bring that issue to the fore again. A Supreme Court judge, Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, included a substantial chapter on family law in the final report of the Denham working group on a courts commission. In it she examined the <i>in camera </i>rule and noted, &ldquo;Criticism of the undiluted operation of the <i>in camera</i> rule is becoming more and more widespread.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A barrister was appointed by the Courts Commission to the family law courts early this year and it was hoped that she could sit in on cases and report on them with regard to anonymity. I am sure that would have been possible. Unfortunately, she has not been able to take up her appointment and do any reporting because it was decided the <i>in camera</i> rule is too strict to allow a barrister to report on cases even while preserving anonymity. I suggest the Minister of State asks the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to look at this important issue.</P>
    <P>Rather than having more people coming out of courts feeling aggrieved, I am glad to see the promotion of the mediation service. People come through it feeling more satisfied than they do from the courts. It may be the cases in which there is less conflict that go to the mediation service, but I am not sure that is the case. There appears to be a very fine line between people deciding to go to mediation or to the family courts. I hope the more widespread availability and publicity of the family mediation centres will make resort to them more likely. I praise, as did Senator Keogh, the voluntary services. They are absolutely splendid and most of the initiatives in family counselling and mediation came from voluntary agencies. They were there long before we in the Houses of the Oireachtas got the idea to bring forward a family support agency.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Keogh, I have been at the fuzzy end of the lollipop in getting money for various voluntary agencies. I hope the finances in this case will be clearly outlined and not decided from year to year. I have been warned repeatedly that we are entering a difficult time financially, no matter what may have happened in the budget of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. I do not know if the Minister of State has heard the joke which goes: &ldquo;What will we have to show for the Celtic tiger? Nothing.&rdquo;  The reply is: &ldquo;Nonsense, we will have Farmleigh.&rdquo;  I hope there will be plenty of money for this agency because it is most worthwhile. I would not like those involved in its running finding out that, while they have the bones of extremely good legislation, they do <Col N="1396" /> not have the money to run the agency which we hope will be established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important the Bill is before the House. It co-ordinates and brings into focus the need to amalgamate all the services provided. I agree with what has been said about the voluntary aspect of the services. The voluntary sector has done a great job during the years. Regarding Senator Henry's concluding remarks, it is only fair when talking about driving forward all aspects of the Bill to point out that the Minister of State has made it clear that this is done in two ways. First, the structures are provided, and second, they are funded. An additional £13.5 million to be provided in 2002 shows the Minister is serious in this regard.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult to contribute at this stage of the debate because most of what I would like to say has already been said. If I repeat something which has been said, it is merely to underpin or underline its importance. The family mediation service is of the utmost importance. As a member of a very large family and the youngest of 15 whose father died when I was only weeks old, I know better than most what it means to be part of a family and for the family to be the cornerstone of society. The concept of society and its continued existence as we know it depend in the main on the family. That is recognised by the Government and the purpose of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The family mediation service has a pivotal role because, unfortunately, irrespective of whether we like it, marriage breakdown is a feature of society today. That the service is free and confidential underpins further the importance of the service to ensure it is available to all sections of the community. The approach is helpful where children are concerned. This should prevent the usual post-separation situation, otherwise known as the tug of love, between both parents where children are pulled like a rope in a tug of war. That is welcome.</P>
      <P>The service began in 1985 on a pilot basis and, by 1997, there were two centres in Dublin and Limerick. Since then, an additional seven centres have been provided in Athlone, Castlebar, Cork, Dundalk, Galway, Tralee and Wexford. An expanded service in Dublin has been extended to Tallaght and Marino. The numbers dealt with have increased from 484 couples in 1997 to the respectable number of 1,225 in 2000. This indicates there is an appreciation of the service available and that it is being availed of.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers referred to voluntary groups and their relevance. They have provided marriage and relationship counselling and are the unsung heroes in this. The fact that the agency will adopt a co-ordinating role towards all the services provided means the voluntary sector will have a pivotal role to play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The family and community services resource <Col N="1397" /> centre programme was singled out by the Government in recent years for radical improvement and expansion. There were ten centres in 1997. In the review of An Action Programme for the Millennium the Government committed itself to the establishment of 100 centres. To indicate it was not just lip-service that was paid, some 80 centres are up and running and a commitment has been given to establish the remainder. We are well on target in this regard.</P>
    <P>Services for lone parents, young mothers and others in need of extra support have been established. I always thought there were two parts to the equation in marriage, namely, the mother and father. Initiatives to enhance the role of young fathers in the eyes of their children, to enhance parenting skills and promote the greater involvement of young men in the community are an integral part of this programme. That is as it should be. It should have been done before now.</P>
    <P>Family and community services resource centres build on local neighbourhood solidarity, promote informal support networks and have links with schools and services in their locality. That is the way they should proceed. In bringing these services under the umbrella of one agency it is important we do not forget what already exists. It is important to co-ordinate what is new and what already exists.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill. The family has a pivotal role to play in society. Everything that can be done to keep the family unit together should be done because it has and will continue to play a pivotal role in society. Everything should be done to conserve the family unit as we know it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is lovely to come to the Seanad when we are all agreed on the value and importance of a topic, especially family support agencies. Senator Henry concluded by telling a story about the Celtic tiger. One thing for which it will have been responsible is a greater focus on family rather than Farmleigh, whether it is through the trebling of child benefit, the extension of family support schemes or the Family Support Agency which brings together the pro-family services introduced by the Government in recent years. It is evident that the Government adopts a family first policy approach, something which we see coming across in a number of Departments and which I hope will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is important about the Bill is that it is not a programme, grant or payment, but legislation which will underpin our support for families and the services available to them. We want to see continuity and stability in family life. We want to foster communities and a sense of community for families at local level. We want to be able to support families. That is the reason the agency is set out in the way it is with its main responsibilities <Col N="1398" /> of the mediation service, the counselling services and the resource centre programme incorporating both professionals and volunteers. Having such well trained professionals will be central to its success and that of the mediation programme.</P>
    <P>Senators mentioned their concern about court cases and the struggles which take place in custody cases. As Minister of State with responsibility for children, I am seriously concerned about the absence of the child's voice in these cases and how there is an undoubted increase in the number of children being used as pawns in court cases, often not in their best interests. In my role I hope to see the development of mediation centres helping to avoid this and that the world and voice of the child can be heard and considered.</P>
    <P>There has been another gap in our understanding of the family and children, namely, research. The responsibility the agency will have for undertaking research will strengthen its role in giving us a better understanding of families and also enabling us to move forward in our policies. On Thursday next I will launch two pieces of research relevant to the debate. One is the evaluation of the springboard family support projects, which was hugely successfully, and the other is the research on fathers and families. That is something that needs to be examined closely and we can move forward by ensuring that all the relevant Departments work together. The family affairs unit in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will continue its role of working closely with the Minister to develop further services and policies.</P>
    <P>The Minister will retain responsibility for the development of family policy which links in with other sections, including in particular the national children's office. That office has shared objectives with my Department concerning the well-being of children and families in general. Together, the Department and the national children's office can promote an awareness of the challenges families are facing as well as developing appropriate and effective responses to those challenges.</P>
    <P>In devising the family support agency's mediation centres the views of young people were considered, as they were for the national children's strategy. Their views made it clear that the most important people to them are their immediate family members. The family support agency will play an important role in helping children to have a safe, secure and stable future.</P>
    <P>The family support agency will work with State agencies and non-governmental organisations. Senators have mentioned the role of voluntary groups that are essential to the proper running of any structure dealing with family issues. To meet our priorities, aims and objectives for social inclusion, such voluntary bodies must work in unison with Departments and other State bodies.</P>
    <P>As public representatives, we are well aware of the problems faced by diverse family units. One speaker asked whether there is a definition of a <Col N="1399" /> family, but of course there is not. The family support agency will work with families in the broadest sense to ensure that its remit is inclusive and child-focused. That is the aim of the Bill. Mediators will have a particular role in dealing with joint and shared parenting, thus keeping both parents involved with their children because that is what children want.</P>
    <P>During consultation on the children's strategy, a child wrote that her father was the most important person in her life. It is unusual to see the father being referred to alone because, in general, children refer to their mothers. I said to the child in question, &ldquo;Isn't that lovely, why is your father the most important person in your life?&rdquo;  She replied, &ldquo;I don't know my father, that's why he's important to me&rdquo;. That type of message from a child makes us realise that family support is a complex area requiring support from all Departments and State agencies with regard to policy-<Col N="1400" /> making, funding and co-operation with voluntary groups. In that way we can ensure that we are working for the best interests of the child and its relationship with the family. That has been the general thrust of the contributions to this debate. The Bill's objective is to achieve a consensus whereby we can create a supportive environment for families. I thank Senators for supporting the Bill.</P>
