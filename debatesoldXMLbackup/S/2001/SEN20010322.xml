      <P>I have received notice from Senator Quinn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to consider lowering the starting age for compulsory schooling so as to encourage a pattern of regular school attendance at an early age, especially in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Connor of the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Public Enterprise if she is aware of the very unsatisfactory operation of the schedule on the Knock/Dublin air route and if she will make a statement on the agreement between her Department and Aer Arann on the public funding of the service and the level of cancellations of service, if any, which are allowed under the agreement.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Trustee Savings Banks (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; No. 2, statements on under age drinking, to be taken not earlier than 12.30 p.m. Contributions of spokespersons are not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed 12 minutes. Senators may share time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed as far as I am concerned. There was an official statement earlier this week that the Government intended to hold four referenda on 31 May 2001. The remainder of the statement was vague. It appears that one referendum will be on the Nice treaty, another will relate to the Judiciary and I am not sure about the other two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1194" /> As any referendum involving constitutional change is a very serious matter, could the Leader find out, for the benefit of the House, details of the Government's proposals and the proposed time-scale for publication of these Bills? On a matter so fundamental as the Constitution, it is only reasonable that the period for debate on the issues concerned should be as long as possible. Experience shows that when Governments treat referenda in a cavalier way or try to rush matters through, the people have their own way of giving their answer to that approach.</P>
    <P>Can the Leader now clarify the Government's intentions in this regard? The date of 31 May is only nine or ten weeks away. Can he say what the proposals are and when the Bills will be published? Although such Bills must be initiated in the other House, could the Leader arrange for a debate in this House on the substance of the proposals, even before the legislation is actually published? </P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise an issue, which I have raised previously, but the practice in question seems to be recurring. It is appropriate that, when issues are before this House, the appropriate Minister should be present. Last night on the Adjournment debate in this House on an issue concerning foreign aid, a Minister of State attended who has great abilities in the area of consumer protection. It is a serious issue. It is obvious that this system of &ldquo;renting a Minister&rdquo; means that a Minister, or Minister of State, reads a script written by the Civil Service, with which he is not familiar, on a subject on which he has no authority whatsoever.</P>
      <P>This practice tends to bring the House into some degree of contempt. We all know that we are going through the motions of asking a question about a serious issue and the Minister is going through the motions of answering that question, on an issue with which he is not familiar. I suggest to the Leader that, in future, if he cannot guarantee the attendance of the appropriate Minister, either a reason should be given for the Minister's absence or the procedures of the House should be changed, particularly on Adjournment Matters, so that the matter can be deferred, by agreement, until the relevant Minister is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ross it is important that the appropriate Ministers come before the House. It often happens that even the appropriate Minister of State does not appear but a Minister of State with no responsibility for the area about which he or she is speaking. That is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also agree with Senator Manning's comments on the forthcoming referenda. The Treaty of Nice represents an important step in the enlargement process and in the development of the European Union. It would be a pity if confusion arose as a result of the number of referenda being taken together. The Government should give careful <Col N="1195" /> consideration to how it intends to proceed with these referenda on 31 May. The Leader should make time available for a full-scale debate on the draft treaty document produced at the Nice summit.</P>
    <P>I wish to request a debate on waste management. This matter has reached crisis point with the publication of the Waste Management (Amendment) Bill by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, who proposes to denude local authorities of powers in relation to the compilation of plans. In addition, the Minister proposes to put in place incinerators instead of landfill dumps.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be an opportunity to discuss the merits and detail of these proposals when the Bill comes before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been raised on the Order of Business on numerous occasions, by Senator Coogan in particular, but a debate has not been forthcoming. We have requested that the Minister come before the House to outline his plans for a national waste management strategy, but instead we have been presented with legislation which is critical of local authorities. The Minister has not made proposals in this area. I am concerned that we will go through the motions of putting through the Bill without having an opportunity to discuss the broader issues. I ask the Leader to facilitate us by arranging a full-scale debate on waste management policy as distinct from a debate on the narrow provisions contained in the new Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the initiative being taken at present in relation to the teachers' dispute. On numerous occasions we have highlighted the fact that there is a need for both parties to enter negotiations. It seems that the teachers are responding to what appears to be an invitation from the Taoiseach. As stated yesterday, there is a need for clarification on the benchmarking process and on the proposals put forward by the Labour Court. It would be a welcome development if there was some movement in relation to this dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Cathaoirleach will grant me a degree of latitude, given the significance of what I am about to say. The Taoiseach has just announced on the Order of Business in the Lower House that the overnight tests for foot and mouth disease carried out at the Pirbright laboratory have proven positive on two samples from animals in the Jenkinstown area which is within the exclusion zone near the Border. Obviously this is a huge blow and it is a matter of grave disappointment. The Taoiseach stated that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development will make a full statement in the Lower House between 11 a.m. and 11.15 a.m., that the Opposition spokespersons will also make statements and that he hopes there will be a question and answer session. However, it is imperative that the <Col N="1196" /> Minister be allowed to return as quickly as possible to his Department because a case has to be prepared for presentation to the veterinary committee tomorrow morning regarding our national response to this issue.</P>
      <P>This is a matter of enormous national significance. It is unfortunate that there has been an outbreak, particularly in view of the marvellous efforts made by official bodies and, on a voluntary basis, by people throughout the country. Our hope must be that the outbreak can be confined to this small area and the risks to other areas can be minimised. All we can do at this stage is appeal to everyone to co-operate fully with whatever additional measures are introduced and call for continued vigilance in local communities, on farms and on the Border. There will be ongoing developments in respect of this matter and perhaps it would be appropriate to review them later in the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the serious announcement that has been made in the Lower House, the first thing people must do is co-operate fully with the regulations laid down. We must do whatever is needed. It is important that the public is made aware of the consequences of this outbreak. When the debate in the Dáil has concluded, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development or the Minister of State should come before the House to discuss the outbreak. This is an issue of major national importance and Fine Gael will give the Government every co-operation and assistance in respect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a good morning. The Taoiseach's announcement in the Lower House that the tests have proved positive has left the country reeling because our worst fears have come true. Everyone had hoped and prayed that this disease would remain outside our borders but, unfortunately and regrettably, it has finally arrived here. Senator Tom Hayes was correct in stating that everyone's total co-operation is now required. It is regrettable that a measure of complacency was creeping in on the part of members of the public because of our success to date in keeping the disease out. In view of the seriousness of the situation, people must continue to be vigilant. Given that the Minister will be making a statement in the Lower House between 11 a.m. and 11.30 a.m., would it be possible for him to make a short statement in this House? There would be no need for a lengthy debate, but it would be desirable if the Minister came before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning raised an important subject, namely, the holding of referenda. In view of the Taoiseach's announcement in the Lower House, I take it there will be no question of these referenda being held in May. Perhaps the Leader will confirm that when he replies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> We now know officially that it is expected that the crisis in Britain will not peak before May. The British authorities admitted yesterday that they cannot envisage the disease being wiped out before August. In view of those facts, I support Senator Tom Hayes's call for the Minister to come before the House to make a brief statement outlining the precautions that will be taken and indicating what, if any, relaxations have been introduced in respect of existing restrictions. It is vital that this information is disseminated widely and immediately because people are concerned and confused. I repeat the call I made yesterday in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That point has already been well made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning's news is sad and it is a reminder that, despite our national commitment to keep this disease out, our economy hangs by a thin thread. I welcome Senator Tom Hayes's indication that his party will co-operate fully with the Government on this matter. I would expect the Minister will find time to come before the House to outline the position.</P>
      <P>In view of the seriousness of the Taoiseach's announcement, it will be difficult to talk about other matters. However, Padraic White, the chairman of the Irish Maritime Development Office, issued a severely critical statement recently. It would be appropriate for the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to come before the House in the immediate future to answer the criticisms made by the Irish Maritime Development Office. It appears that Ireland is one of the few countries which did not avail of the opportunity provided by the EU to develop its fishing industry. The criticism levelled by the office and by Padraic White was particularly severe in nature and it does not seem to have received the attention it deserves. I ask the Leader to arrange to have the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources come into the House shortly to explain to us the steps he is planning to take to avoid the catastrophe that is forecast for the Irish shipping industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue I wish to raise takes secondary position to the unfortunate events that have taken place in Louth. Nonetheless, it would be wrong for us not to mention what Senator Costello has already pointed out, namely, the fact that this House has called repeatedly for a debate on waste management. That request is on the Order Paper but the Minister has refused to come into the House to listen to our views and outline his proposals. We are now being made aware today that he intends to introduce an amendment to remove decision making from local authority members. That is heavy handedness without debate and it is most unfortunate that the Minister will not come before us. I ask the Leader to ask the Minister to come in here and give us an <Col N="1198" /> explanation of what he intends to do with this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disturbed and disappointed by the announcement this morning by the Taoiseach, and I know everybody in the House is of the same view. Many calls have been made to invite the Minister to the House for a debate on the matter but rather than do that we should suspend the House at 11 o'clock to allow us go to the other House to hear what he has to say on the matter. We could get on with the rest of the business later in the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from County Louth, I know the area in which the foot and mouth disease has broken out. In light of my knowledge of the area, particularly of the farmers and the livelihoods that are now at risk, I agree with Senator Hayes that we should fully support every action the Government must take to restrict this disease as much as possible. The inevitability of this outbreak is shocking and traumatic, particularly for all the farmers in County Louth and the entire country. This is a national crisis and those of us on the Opposition benches will respond positively and constructively to anything that needs to be done to support the Minister in stopping the spread of this disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to what Senator Dardis, it is very serious news. Unfortunately, it is not entirely unexpected because the Border is just a line on a map and once the disease got into the North of Ireland it was 90% likely that it would spread to the South. It is important that we should not lose heart at this stage. We have put in very useful precautions and as long as we ring fence those and try to concentrate the outbreak in this small area, we have a chance of rescuing our industry.</P>
      <P>I heard the leading authority in these islands, an English professor, speaking about this disease. He said the disease would not peak before May, that there will be at least 4,000 cases and it will be worse than the outbreak in 1967. If it will not peak until May, will the British continue with their general election during that period, regardless of this disease? We need to make representations on that. I know it could be seen as interfering but they are such bad neighbours. Look at Sellafield. Look at what they have now inflicted on us. It is time we made a friendly plea to them to be better neighbours in future because they are not good neighbours, and I say that even though my father was English.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris, you have supported the case for a debate. The other points can be made in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it possible to have some discussion or at least to communicate to the Minister for Health and Children the strong concern of a number of people in this House for parents of <Col N="1199" /> young people with autism and for autistic children? We had debates previously in this House and we got rambling answers from the Minister but again today we heard parents on the radio say they have had to watch their children's linguistic facility disappear, that the children were drawing away from them. That is at least in part because of the absence of speech therapists. Something has to be done about this issue. Perhaps we could ask the Minister for Health and Children, who I know is a caring father, to do something in this area, even if it takes some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the proposed four referenda on 31 May, I understand one of them deals with an issue I have often raised in this House, namely, to remove a constitutional bar on Ireland implementing the statute of the International Criminal Court and from that point of view I welcome it warmly. Another referendum deals with Nice and I gather the other two concern judicial matters.</P>
      <P>On the foot and mouth outbreak, this is the news of Armageddon for this country. I support fully the view of our party spokesperson on agriculture, Senator Hayes, that all sides of the House must co-operate in every way. There are no political footballs in respect of this issue. Irish food exports totalling £5.5 billion will probably be banned from tomorrow, including perishable exports. That is the prospect we are facing, so it is very bad news.</P>
      <P>I had intended to ask the Cathaoirleach if we could also examine the other implications of this news, namely, for the tourism industry. There are reports from the industry in today's newspapers that it can have catastrophic effects on the industry and that was even before the announcement of an outbreak in this country. We should put that on hold for the moment, although no doubt I will come back to it at a later stage. All focus must now be on what has happened in Louth and on co-operating to ensure that everything possible is done to contain the outbreak to one area.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calls for a debate on the foot and mouth crisis. With regard to Senator Norris's remark that the British are bad neighbours, they have been lousy neighbours for 800 years. I doubt they will change now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Costello had spoken before Senator Dardis, I want to confirm that the Labour Party will give every co-operation to anything the Government intends to do. This is far too serious an issue for politics to come into it. Most people believe that once we got started, the response here was very good, both politically and administratively, and by people generally, partic<Col N="1200" /> ularly those in urban Ireland who appeared to quickly understand the significance of it. I would not be as gloomy as everybody else. We can get over this with the same spirit that the country has shown up to now and those of us on this side of the House will do everything we can to facilitate the Government on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning and Connor referred to the referendum. The Government's intention is to have a referendum later this year on various matters which were mentioned by Senator Manning. The announcement this morning, however, defers everything in terms of elections of any kind until the issue is dealt with. I will come back to the House on that. I agree with Senator Manning that we should have a full and open debate on the various issues in relation to the proposed amendment of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>I will pass on Senator Ross's view in relation to the presence of Ministers in the House to the Government Chief Whip. It has been the policy of all Governments and Leaders of this House to have the relevant Ministers present for debates where possible.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello and Coogan raised the question of waste management. I understand the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will make a major announcement on that matter at 11.30 a.m.</P>
      <P>Senators Dardis, Hayes, Callanan, Quinn, Dan Kiely, O'Dowd, Norris, Connor, Lydon and Ryan offered words of advice in relation to the confirmation from Senator Dardis, following the Taoiseach's announcement regarding the two samples which tested positive in the Jenkinstown area of County Louth. That is in the Cooley area, which Senator O'Dowd knows well, and only three or four miles from the previous outbreak in the North of our country. It is news that we did not want to hear. There is a great effort and total co-operation from everyone on the island in containing the spread of this dreadful disease. It brings home the seriousness of the situation and how difficult it is to contain it. As Senator Ryan said, we should not overstate the problem as it is so close to the other outbreak in an area where it has occurred. All the various proposals to allow events to go ahead, or relaxation of the stringent controls we had over the last four weeks, will no longer be put in place.</P>
      <P>In order to allow Senators time to hear the Minister's address in the Dáil I will shorten the Order of Business. Senators may go to the Dáil and spokespersons for the Bill before us can remain to deal with it as the Minister of State is waiting to come in.</P>
      <P>I will meet with the leaders of the House and the Whips at 12 noon. We will assess the situation and, if necessary, invite the Minister to come before the House today. I will propose an amendment to the Order of Business later.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>With the Cathaoirleach's indulgence, may I raise another issue before amendment No. 1? Senator Quinn wants to speak on this issue and Members may wish to go to the other House to listen to the debate on foot and mouth.</P>
      <P>I want to raise a circular that many of us received from Mr. Barry O'Shea about the ESOT and the fact that it states that this particular legislation is different from the others transferring public sector institutions into private ownership. There is no 18 month clause, as it is known, which allows employees to avail of any shares distributed under the ESOT within 18 months of the termination of their employment. This has financial implications for many people who have been working less than 20 years, particularly married women. Will the Minister respond? This is before the Equality Authority, but if this legislation is passed it will be powerless to act on it. If it were appropriate, I would put an amendment down but I wish to hear the Minister's response first. It is incongruous that this is the only legislation missing the 18 month clause which deprives certain categories of employee of what is now regarded as a traditional right under the ESOT, namely, to avail of shares within the 18 month period.</P>
      <P>I want to raise that now before we deal with the amendment to get the Minister's response and allow other people to address it who want to go to the other House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what has been said. It is difficult to find any reference to the ESOT in the Bill. I suppose it would come in under section 1(3) in the setting up of a third company, Cancara Limited, to bridge the gap between the Trustee Savings Banks and the Irish Permanent. The Minister said at Second Stage that it was proposed to bring in an amendment to the Finance Bill. Could he indicate what was proposed in that amendment on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill on the ESOT?</P>
      <P>The ESOT, too, was different from others in that it does not contain the 18 month clause. The Revenue Commissioners, in correspondence, asked the joint committee that drew up the ESOT document why this was left out. It is detrimental to certain employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for raising this important issue which was brought to their attention. To allay their fears, it was at the request of the unions that the 18 month rule was removed. That is what they wanted and we agreed. Everybody signed off on it and everyone is happy with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Ryan: Except the Equality Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Another point is that if changes were made, it would be in a Finance Bill, not this one. To have no ambiguity &ndash; they wanted the 18 month rule removed and we agreed.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle raised an issue which came up at Second Stage. I will read out a note on that. Amendment No. 42 introduces a new section into the Bill as published. This new section is concerned with the employee share ownership trusts and approved profit sharing schemes &ndash; APSSs &ndash; being established for the current employees of TSB and ICC Bank in the context of their impending sale to Irish Life and Permanent and Bank of Scotland, respectively. Under the terms of the restructuring arrangements of these sales, the employees are being given 5% of the share capital of their respective companies with the possibility of purchasing a further 9.9% at the market price. Changes are necessary to the existing ESOT and APSS legislation to accommodate the schemes set up in these particular circumstances, although in broad terms they will be established on the same basis as in conventional ESOTs and APSSs, that is to say open to all employees and on similar terms. The one important difference is the need to ensure that the benefits of these ESOTs and APSSs will be restricted to the employees involved in the restructurings. There will be no justification for other employees of the takeover companies expecting to benefit also. It is to protect the employees of the two respective banks. This amendment will achieve that.</P>
      <P>In addition, provision is being made to enable TSB and ICC employees to continue to benefit in the event that the businesses in which they are currently employed are sold on again by the take-over companies. The ESOTs must be protected in case the company is taken over again, not that there is any indication this is likely to happen. We are simply making sure the ESOTs are protected. Provision is also being made to enable take-over companies to establish ESOTs and APSSs in their own right, and to include ex-TSB and ex-ICC employees in them. The normal annual limits of tax relief shares which can be appropriated to participants under APSS will continue to apply to the aggregate of all shares appropriated to those employees under such schemes, as is normal. In other words, there will be no double benefit.</P>

      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>1.The Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1989, is hereby amended by the insertion of the following section after section 56:</P>
      <P>56A.&ndash;In making an order pursuant to section 57 (as amended by the <i>Trustee Savings Banks (Amendment) Act, 2001</i>) the Minister shall have regard to the desirability of making provision in such order for persons who have for a substantial period been customers of a bank which is the subject of an order to receive a recognition of their loyalty to that bank.</P>
      <P>This Bill effectively reorganises the Trustee Savings Bank into companies and provides for ESOPs so that employees of the TSB can get a reasonable deal, albeit with the exception we have just mentioned. Legislation relating to private sector institutions and companies being transferred to a private or limited company capacity has not taken the customer into consideration. This especially applies to the long-serving customer who has been loyal over the years. It is particularly true of financial institutions, which are notorious for milking the customer for all they can get. They apply charges to beat the band, many of which are given all sorts of descriptions. People learn about the charges in circuitous ways. The customer gets very little in return and is often jettisoned at the end of the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" /> The Minister will remember a debate a few week ago when we tried to give the Central Bank some regulatory powers in relation to the closure of branches by financial institutions. The Bank of Ireland is closing over 20% of its Irish branches. Senators on the Government side, including Senator Finneran, mentioned that many branches of banks, and not just post offices, are being closed in rural areas without consideration for the customer.</P>
    <P>It is time for customer loyalty to be recognised, as is the case with employee productivity and loyalty. Employees are given 15% shares, which are quite valuable. Unfortunately, they are only given to current employees. Clients and customers who have served an institution, in this case the TSB, for a lifetime are not rewarded in any way. The manner in which the bank operates may change dramatically and customers may have to conduct their business elsewhere, although some will remain. The Minister of State should consider remunerating these loyal people in some fashion.</P>
    <P>The TSB, like all other banks, has been enormously profitable. When the Minister for Finance introduced this legislation, he mentioned an increase in profit of 75% in the past 12 months. The Bank of Ireland made profits of £750 million and the AIB's profits were almost £1 billion this year. All this money is made from customers and I think we should explore a mechanism of rewarding that. This amendment mentions &ldquo;the desirability of making provision in such orders for persons who have for a substantial period been customers of a bank which is the subject of an order to receive a recognition of their loyalty to that bank&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The number of TSB customers would be much smaller than the equivalent number for one of the major national banks. The TSB is unique because of its nature, origins, history and the fact that it was effectively a mutual financial institution, not dissimilar to the credit union banking system. It contributed substantially to the well-being and development of the State. Its limited number of customers could be regarded as having helped to make the bank a success. The employees are being rewarded and now it is time to think about rewarding the customers in a similar fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. I said on Second Stage that there were winners and losers. The winners were the Government and the employees and the losers were the customers. This was dealt with on Second Stage when the Minister outlined the legal position. It appears the customers of the Trustee Savings Bank in Scotland brought a case about the ownership of the bank and the High Court in Scotland came to the view that the customers were shareholders in the bank. Unfortunately, that decision was overturned by the House of Lords. The Attorney General based his advice to the Minister on that judgment. There is a justifiable case for customers to get some reward for their loyalty to the bank for many years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the fact that Senators have raised this issue through an amendment and I understand the arguments made. The amendment proposed by Senators Costello, O'Meara and Ryan was also proposed by Deputy McDowell on Committee and Report Stages in the other House. It would require the Minister for Finance to consider the desirability of giving some of the proceeds from the sale of the TSB to its customers in recognition of their loyalty, provided they have been with the bank for &ldquo;a substantial period&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As I stated in my Second Stage speech on 7 March, there is a legal issue to consider in terms of who owns the TSB Bank and a second issue of whether, irrespective of legal entitlements, the customers should receive a payment as a reward for being customers. The legal advice from the Attorney General on the ownership issue is that the Trustee Savings Banks do not have members. They are not owned by their depositors and the relationship between the TSB and its customers is the same as the relationship between any bank and its customers. The conclusion of this advice was that the Oireachtas had the power to dispose of the assets and this is the position under the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1989. The customers of other State companies are not shareholders either and such public assets are held by the State on behalf of all the citizens. It is not open to the Minister to arbitrarily allocate generally publicly owned assets to a small group of citizens. The only way he can discharge his overall duty is to take the proceeds of disposals into general public ownership.</P>
      <P>It is contradictory that the Labour Party's amendment, which is supported by Fine Gael, wants to favour a small group to the detriment of the overall value and holding of assets by the Government of the day or the State on behalf of all the citizens. It does not make sense why it would want to limit the proceeds from the sale of State assets to the group primarily responsible when it is acting on behalf of the State. I also pointed out on Second Stage that there are fundamental differences between the Trustee Savings Banks and building societies. Customers opening a share account in a building society are told that they will become an owner of the society with the right to vote at annual general meetings. It is the customers of a building society who run the society, who elect the board of directors and who decide to wind up the business and to demutualise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the TSB, the customers do not have an ownership stake. There are no annual general meetings of depositors. The customers do not elect the trustees and they do not have a role in the running of the bank or in deciding to sell it. It is the trustees who take the decision to request a reorganisation. Customers opening accounts in the TSB do so in accordance with the rules of the TSB which clearly state that they have the right to their deposit and the interest thereon but that is all. They are not given any indication or impression that their account confers any ownership interest on them.</P>
      <P>The second issue is whether customers in the TSB should receive payment from the proceeds. The arguments put forward are that they have been loyal customers for many years and it was their loyalty which built up the bank which has a unique status. I previously pointed out to Senators that until 1989 the TSB kept at least 80% of their funds from customers on deposit with the Exchequer which paid both the interest on customers' accounts and an additional margin of 1.65% to the TSB to cover their administration costs. Under these arrangements customers benefited substantially from State support of their deposits while also receiving an attractive rate of interest. The TSB has operated on the same terms as any other bank since the enactment of the Trustee Savings Bank Act, 1989. Until 1992 it was exempted from corporation tax in recognition of the fact that the reserves of the TSB belong to the public generally. That is another benefit to the customers. It was only in 1993 that the TSB started to pay corporation tax at a reduced rate and only since 1996 that it has paid corporation tax at the full rate. Much of the value built up in the TSB over the years, therefore, has been built up because of its special relationship with the State.</P>
      <P>Precedent has also been taken into account in reaching a conclusion. In the case of Irish Life, Telecom Éireann and ICC Bank, there were no free shares for customers. The proceeds received by the Minister and his predecessors were paid into the Exchequer. It would be extraordinary to take the route proposed by the amendment. I am, therefore, unable to accept the amendment. The customers do not have an ownership stake in the TSB and this is also the situation in all State companies. It would be extraordinary to deprive the State, which is the guardian of all State assets, of the proceeds and to divide them up among small groups of people. The proposition is extraordinary. The Minister must discharge his responsibilities to all citizens by putting the proceeds into State funds. On that basis, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1208" /> There are more than 300,000 customers in the TSB. They would get only a small amount if the proceeds were divided up. Perhaps the impression being given is that there would be great largesse, but that would not be the case given the customer base. It would also be expensive to deal with it. Are we talking about the customers in 1965 or those who have been customers since 1995? I do not have much faith in those arguments as they are separate issues. This would be an extraordinary step for the State to take. The Labour Party has made many sensible and sound arguments, but this one is almost contradictory. It is the type of argument another party I once knew might have put forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of our more sound arguments and amendments. The Minister of State is trying to present Lord Denning's appalling vista in terms of what would happen if customers got their entitlements. Customers have not got their entitlements, particularly in relation to financial matters. I do not see the difference in principle between ESOP and customers getting some reward. The employee is getting it on the basis that he or she contributed to the financial well being of a company. However, they have done so on the back of the unions' muscle. This affects only current employees, not those who have retired, although that is discrimination. There is discrimination in terms of the categories of beneficiaries of ESOP.</P>
      <P>This amendment refers to &ldquo;persons who have for a substantial period been customers of a bank&rdquo;. We are not talking about people who have been customers for a year or two but about the loyalty of long-term customers. That is more equitable than the current cohort of employees who benefit under the employee share option scheme. If the trade unions can hammer out a deal which means current employees benefit by up to 15% with 4% or 5% contributions from employees in share purchases, surely it can hammer out a deal for the most loyal customers who have built up the bank as much as if not more than the current employees. Surely the principle is valid and if so, regardless of the appalling vista, we should get down to the business of seeing how the customer can be rewarded. It is time to open our minds to this mutuality view that there is no such thing as a financial institution that is an island. It is not simply the shareholders, directors and employees that make it a success; it is the totality, including the marketplace and employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From what the Minister has just said, I am not likely to make much progress. However, we should at least acknowledge that the principle has not been teased out because the customer has no <Col N="1209" /> muscle. The poor customers are left on the wayside, no matter who they are. It is the more elderly people and women who are being discriminated against and who will lose out on the 18 month waiver clause. The older employees will lose out. All of the customers will lose out because they do not have a body to fight their case.</P>

      <P>If the Bill had proposed that the dividend to the Government be allocated to the customers, the Labour Party would have put in an amendment suggesting that it should be changed and it should be for the common good. This amendment from the Labour Party seems to be against all of the founding principles and utterances of that party over the years. They are talking about giving out the State money of some £330 million to a few people. This is money that came into the State coffers for everybody, not for a few. It is there for the common good to support social welfare and other areas of need. I find it extraordinary that, of all groups, the Labour Party should make such a proposal. Senator Ryan's Fíanna Fáil influences must be having a big bearing in the Labour Party thinking. The unions are no longer talking to them. There is something serious happening over there.</P>

      <P>I support the motion. In 1991-92, I was very lucky to be Lord Mayor of Cork when the agreement was being made on the changes in the structure to allow the amalgamation of Dublin Savings Bank and Cork Savings Bank. The Cork Savings Bank was started in the early 1920s with the pennies from our grandmothers. It is unfortunate to give the impression that none of these people should get any recognition. Even Margaret Thatcher did not allow that when the TSBs were changing over. The proceeds of that sale went back into the structure of the TSB. That is not happening here. For the tie-up between the Irish Permanent and the TSB, the Government should consider giving something so that it can compete on an equal level with the major banks, which are making such profits.</P>
      <P>With regard to the amendment, it is very unfortunate that we are giving no recognition to the people who started it. This was done with pennies and it started in the Cork Savings Bank with Bishop Cauldwell's involvement. Senator Ryan would have the history of that. When I was Lord Mayor, the people of Cork put up a very strong argument against tying up with the Dublin Savings Bank to form the TSB. Irrespective of who is in Government, recognition should be given to the people who started this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Finneran made a point about shareholders of AIB and Bank of Ireland. This is different. It started with the church and other strong people within the city of Cork. It was started with pennies to offer competition, in the <Col N="1210" /> same way that credit unions started in the 1960s with Bishop Lucey.</P>
    <P>It is most unfortunate that even trade unionists do not recognise the work done by other workers who will not get the benefit of the shares. As a very strong trade unionist, I do not agree that people who dedicated so much of their lives and worked on a share basis in the TSB are not getting any benefits. Employees with two or three years' service there are now getting all the benefits and people with over 20 years service are getting none. That is a contradiction in terms.</P>
    <P>I know the general manager of TSB and we had long discussions to make sure there would be no objections in Cork city when it was first mooted. Now we are giving no recognition even to long-term employees who, unfortunately, were working on a job share basis because of family commitments. The unions seem to want to take it all. For the first time I have to say in this House that I find it most unfortunate and wrong that trades unions give the impression the certain few should get it all. The Minister should look at that very seriously, irrespective of what the unions say or what the present employees say. We must give recognition to the people that created it and built it up.</P>
    <P>This amendment gives recognition to the people who built it. It happened in the corner of the South Mall in Cork. As a representative from the city of Cork, it would be wrong for me to agree with the idea that the Government should take everything and not even put it back into the structure itself to compete against the other major banks. We must give some recognition to those who built it up. It was built with pennies and then with shillings. Senator Ryan remembers that it started very small, just as credit unions started. Yet we are saying that a certain few must get it all.</P>
    <P>Because the unions agreed to it, people who unfortunately could not get back into work or who were only on part-time work are not getting the recognition they deserve. It is not fair and the Minister should look it.</P>

      <P>I have carefully listened to what the Senators have said and I understand the points being made, particularly by the final speaker. The reality is that this is a State asset and the State has been very much to the fore in supporting it over the years. We have given customers of the TSB great comfort from the beginning by, in effect, securing and guaranteeing the deposits and paying interest rates higher than what would have been obtainable elsewhere. They have benefited from that.</P>
      <P>There is a wonderful customer base of 300,000. The move is very positive for those customers and the creation of this third banking force will benefit them in the future. The arguments have been made but, unfortunately, I do not accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I understand what the Minister of State is saying. He answered me very politely when he readily admitted that it started with the customers and particularly the ones we knew. It was a very small matter at the start. What the Minister of State says is very unfortunate, the customers who created the bank are long gone and they are to be admired. They saved pennies when they had few of them and they did so in the interests of the less well off. All I am asking is that we make sure that the founders of this bank are recognised and, in particular, that they are recognised by the TSB itself. I see no reason the Minister of State cannot say &ndash; I understand it may be difficult  &ndash; at some stage that recognition should be given to the people who gave their pennies. We should not be ashamed that that is how it started. These people gave their pennies when they were badly needed and recognition should be put into the structure.</P>
      <P>I welcome the third banking force, and would welcome a fourth, because I do not want to see billions of pounds being made per year from the people when very little is given back except to the certain few. This is a golden opportunity to recognise those who gave their pennies at that time &ndash; my two grandmothers probably did so in Cork city and they deserve great credit for that, as do those whose initiative it was to create the bank. It is a sad reflection on us that people have to contact us constantly who gave so much of their time to the Cork Savings Bank and the Dublin Savings Bank and now they get no benefits from the shareholding. I refer not just to former employees but also to those who were sick and could not work and are now getting no benefit while people who are there only two or three years accrue all of it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Why can we not give recognition at such little cost? This would not cost millions. All the people are asking for is a relevant amount of the shares to which they are entitled as employees or former <Col N="1212" /> employees. Would it cost £100,000? It is only a share option and I hope that the shares do not drop. We should look at this matter seriously and the Minister of State should give some commitment to it. As the person pushing this through the Houses of the Oireachtas, he should not be afraid to say to the bank that sick employees, those who cannot work because of family commitments and so on, and those who were asked to go on a job share scheme, should get the same benefits as those who are new to the job and they should be looked after. The Minister of State should consider this matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State remarked that it was strange that Labour and Fine Gael should table such an amendment. By saying that he was indicating that no one in Fianna Fáil would support this kind of an amendment. I have a surprise for him because the minutes from the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service show that Deputy O'Flynn supported the amendment. He supported it in the same manner as Senator Dino Cregan has, not as forcefully or as eloquently, but he did support it.</P>

      <P>The suggestion that the proceeds, or part of the proceeds, from the sale of the TSB be put back into its structure to enable it to compete more effectively is not acceptable for two obvious reasons. First, Irish Life and Permanent is a very large, well-funded institution and does not need help from the State, which could be doing much more important things with its money. Second, such a grant of free capital would be a clear State aid and not permissible under EU law.</P>

It is the founders who should get the recognition and a plaque would cost only £1,000.</P>

The people involved were clearly a very large and forward-looking group who scrimped and saved to make this happen, there is no question about that. The Senator's points are well made and within the context of the new organisation there should be a recognition of that. Neither he nor I is in a position to do so from here but the Senator has certainly sent a powerful message from this House and I hope it will be listened to.</P>

      <Col N="1213" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section deals with the principle of the Bill which is the transfer of assets. At the end of Second Stage the Minister of State quoted what I believed to be representative extracts from the speech of the Labour Party spokesman on finance but which were a profound distortion of the content and the spirit of what he said. They were unworthy of the Minister of State, they were highly selective and extremely misleading. They are of no great significance in any long-term debate and he should not be allowed to get away with that sort of silliness. Deputy McDowell said he was unhappy with the transfer of the TSB into private ownership and that the idea was driven more by ideology than pragmatism, which is the same as what I have said here.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is a very capable man, more than able to argue his point and it was a descent into silliness to use selective quotations. There is a phrase in one of the psalms which says that there is no God and that is how one can use selective quotations. It was great fun, he had fun, but it made me a little uncomfortable and I took the sensible action of reading my colleague's speeches. The Minister of State got it all wrong and he should learn that if he is going to quote from something he should read the whole thing and not leave himself open to looking silly.</P>

      <P>The Deputy in question has spoken to me since and he accepted somewhat the difficult position in which he found himself. The Senator is quite correct in some of the other quotes he has attributed to the Deputy, in making his speech, which are equally accurate.</P>
      <P>What I was trying to do was to sum up the recognition by the Labour Party spokesman on finance that, taking all things into consideration, the sale of the TSB was probably in its long-term interests. He would prefer that such a course of action might not have been taken but, having seen the reality, I think that he accepted it. I quoted him quite liberally throughout his speech and this was a theme he used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

I have never before been accused in this <Col N="1214" /> House of adopting a minimalist approach to anything I have brought before it. I have tried to flesh out matters. I was trying to give a sense of the dilemma, the dichotomy that exists in certain instances. I recognise that.</P>

      <P>We have strayed into an area that is not directly related to the Bill. I remind the House that there is a long-standing convention that matters pertaining to the other House are for the other House and not for this House, and that ruling has been assiduously followed by all my predecessors. I intend to apply it now to both the Minister of State and Senator Ryan because we are not dealing with the essence of the Bill. I am therefore putting the question on section 1.</P>

The point, nevertheless, is that if a Minister comes here and quotes selectively from the Dáil record because he was a little annoyed with the tone of my speech &ndash; because that is the context in which it happened &ndash; it is a bit rich to tell me that I cannot respond to him because of the convention in the House which applies to me and not to him.</P>

      <P>I have a few words to say on the section as I was not here for the first Stages of the Bill. I congratulate the bank. In future we must be seen to be broadening our ideas and making the most of the advantages that have been built up over the years by people saving their pennies. In wishing the bank every success in the future, I bear in mind the 700,000 deposi<Col N="1215" /> tors in the bank which has now been purchased for £339 million. In the past, when discussing other companies such as the ESB and Telecom Éireann, there was argument about the number of shares workers would get. I have always argued in favour of employees getting a share of the company for which they work. The first company in Ireland to give shares to its employees was a Cork company, Musgraves. That company is to be complimented. When I was Lord Mayor of Cork that is the only company I visited, and I loved to visit it because of the benefits it gave to its workforce.</P>
      <P>Over the next 20 years £10,000 will be given in shares to each employee. That is a fair benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is about £40,000 over that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not cost much to give shares to the remaining few &ndash; by the time we are finished, many of those will have passed on. I am not suggesting that the shares should be passed on to somebody else. I do not want to know about the deal, but it is nice to see employees getting 14.9%. That is one of the main reasons we did not insist that there should be a tie-up in respect of the Irish Permanent or any bank that started up with Government help.</P>
      <P>It is very unusual, given that there is a clause providing that employees will get 14.9%, that somebody else, irrespective of who it is, can decide they will not get it. Perhaps the Minister would look at that. We, as an Oireachtas, should have the right to say that all employees will get it. However, it is possible that not all employees will benefit because another organisation could prevent it. It is great to see employees getting 15% over a period, but not all employees will get it. Nobody, at national, local or Executive level, whether trade union or otherwise, should have the right to decide that an employee will not be eligible to get a share. This is the first time I have ever knocked a trade union, but I find this possibility very disturbing and upsetting. It should not be allowed to happen and we, as an Oireachtas, should ensure that it does not happen. I would like the regulations clarified because I am no wizard on legislation. I demand the right for all employees, and if all employees have it, we have no right to take it from an employee who is sick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>ESOPs are not a backward looking arrangement. That is the fundamental point about them. The 5% is transferred to the ESOT and it is the current employees who will live with the new arrangements. It is for the future rather than what has happened in the past. The 9.9% is being bought by the ESOT at a fair market price and is not a reward for past service, it is for change in the future. That is the principle.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I could clarify it in this way, notwithstanding the issue the Senator has raised. This was agreed with the unions and employees. We carried out the collective democratic decision which was voted on by them. It is not open to me as an individual to prejudge or alter that outcome. This was a democratic process entered into by the employees. The Senator has certain views on what they did or did not do, and he is entitled to express them. However, that is democracy.</P>

There was a condition that has now been eliminated. A trade union or any other group should not have the right to do that with structures we set up as an Oireachtas. They should not be allowed take away the rights of very few people who are getting very little for all they put in. I am not looking for a reply from the Minister now, but he should consider this matter.</P>

    <Title>Under Age Drinking: Statements.</Title>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt): I thank you for giving me the opportunity to state the position of the Department of Health and Children on what it considers to be one of the most important public health issues facing us, that of under age drinking.</P>
    <P>We live in a culture where alcohol consumption is part and parcel of the social lives of many people. For the majority this poses no difficulty. There is one group however, who, according to recent evidence available to us, are engaging in <Col N="1217" /> behaviour which is both detrimental to their own health and to the quality of life of those around them. It is clear from this evidence that too many of our young people are engaged in high risk drinking.</P>
    <P>For many years we have known there is a high level of alcohol misuse among young people in Ireland. The survey of lifestyle, attitudes and nutrition, SLÁN, and health behaviour in school aged children, HBSC, surveys which were carried out on behalf of the Department highlighted these problems and anecdotal and other evidence has suggested that the problem has been getting worse.</P>
    <P>Our fears on this were confirmed by the publication of the recent ESPAD report. ESPAD, which stands for European School Survey on Alcohol and other Drugs, is a project administered by a group of Swedish researchers with a study manager in each country. This survey of 15 to 16 year old adolescents was first carried out in 1994 and at that time 23 countries from across Europe took part. In this recently published study, carried out in 1999, 30 countries took part. The statistics make for disturbing reading.</P>
    <P>More 16 year olds are drinking now than in 1995. Girls are drinking as often and as much as boys. Both binge drinking and drunkenness have increased. Girls are drinking much more spirits than before. Some 42% of girls reported drinking spirits three or more times in the last 30 days compared with 22% in 1995. It is clear that the new range of spirit based drinks are extremely popular. This negative trend continues across a wide range of categories. When comparing our results to those of other European countries, the news is also disappointing. Irish teenagers are close to the top in many of the categories in the survey. The number of occasions of drinking, of being drunk, and of binge drinking all place Ireland with the highest in Europe.</P>
    <P>While the news is bad it is important to remember there are many 16 year olds who are not drinking and abusing alcohol. Well over half of them are not into drinking, at least not with any regularity. These young people need to be supported in the decisions they are taking and those who are abusing alcohol need to be made aware of the dangers of their drinking. Now that the problem is clear, the question is what do we do about it.</P>
    <P>At the recent World Health Organisation Ministerial Conference which the Minister, Deputy Martin, attended, a Declaration on Young People and Alcohol was unanimously adopted. This called for a range of measures to protect young people from the pressures to drink and to reduce alcohol related harm. These included limiting availability, pricing mechanisms and greater curbs on advertising, sponsorship and promotion. These are issues which we are actively examining.</P>
    <P>A number of studies presented at the conference in Sweden confirmed the widely accepted belief among health professionals that greater availability of alcohol leads to greater consump<Col N="1218" /> tion and, ultimately, to higher levels of alcohol related harm. This trend is reflected in Ireland where alcohol consumption has increased as has related harm, especially since the mid-1990s with the strong economic growth which has provided more disposable income. Availability has also increased through exemptions and longer opening hours. A recent study commissioned by the Department put the estimated economic cost of alcohol related harm in 1999 at £1.7 billion. These costs attributable to alcohol relate to health care, road accidents, crime, loss of output due to absences from work and transfer payments due to inability to work. This situation is clearly unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The issue of access to alcohol continues to be a source of concern. Measures established by the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, provide substantial fines and penalties for publicans who serve under age drinkers and people over the age of 18 who buy alcohol for minors. These measures are to be welcomed and I am confident they will prove successful over time.</P>
    <P>Despite the existence of an advertising code young people continue to be exposed to the constant promotion and advertising of alcohol. It is hardly surprising that many children are experimenting with alcohol and many adolescents are drinking to get drunk. Alcohol advertising emphasises the desirable aspects of drinking, portraying alcohol consumption as a safe and problem free practice and ignores the potential risks and negative consequences for the individual. The Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland's code is now under review and the Department has been asked to make a submission to the authority setting out a number of recommendations regarding the placement and content of advertisements, compliance with the code and the promotion of alcohol.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children has also commissioned research into the impact of alcohol advertising on young people. This research will be available shortly and will inform further action in this area. International research clearly identifies a link between exposure to advertising and alcohol consumption among young people and adults. The recommendations made by the Department would, if adopted, go some way towards offsetting this exposure.</P>
    <P>A range of other concrete actions is being taken by the Department to tackle the issue of alcohol abuse among young people. The health promotion unit of my Department has developed, in association with the drinks industry group, a programme on the responsible serving of alcohol. This training programme is designed to enable those in the trade to better recognise under age drinkers, to better handle intoxicated customers and to inform staff of their legal obligations. The programme is fully supportive of the national age card introduced by the Garda Síochána. It is based on an Australian model which proved very successful and we have equally high expectations of the Irish programme. Ownership of the scheme <Col N="1219" /> now lies with the drinks industry which will promote the benefits of the training to its members.</P>
    <P>The severity of alcohol abuse by many young people has been recognised for some time by the Department. An alcohol awareness campaign was recently launched by the Minister, Deputy Martin, targeting young, high risk drinkers in its first year. This campaign aims to increase the debate around the issue of alcohol abuse and to encourage young people to examine their lifestyles.</P>
    <P>A national seminar was held at which over 100 stakeholders gathered to discuss this issue. These included the Garda, health professionals, parents, teachers, community groups, representatives of the drinks industry and many others. Examples of successful local initiatives which tackle problems such as binge drinking and under age drinking were presented. For initiatives such as the alcohol awareness campaign to succeed it is vital that support comes from stakeholders such as these at a local level and we now have that support.</P>
    <P>Another element of this campaign involved the development of a website, coolchoices.ie, dedicated to informing young people of the dangers associated with alcohol abuse. This website, however, does not just focus on the dangers of alcohol and its abuse, it also adopts a positive approach in promoting alternatives to drinking. These alternatives come from young people themselves and the website actively encourages young people to submit their own ideas and comments. These activities prompt young people to examine their behaviour and promote healthier lifestyle choices. The suggestions and comments submitted by young people are informing the future design and content of the site.</P>
    <P>Over the coming months other initiatives targeting young people are planned. These will include events on college campuses and in the workplace. This sustained effort will, in addition to engaging young people, encourage all of us to review our drinking behaviour and our attitudes to alcohol.</P>
    <P>Schools based programmes continue to play a central role in the education of young people around alcohol issues. September last saw the introduction of social, personal and health education, a new curriculum subject at junior certificate level. A core module of this subject examines alcohol and drugs.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland were among the first in Europe to develop life skills support material for use in primary and second level schools. These adopt a holistic approach, imparting the skills young people need to make the decisions they are faced with every day and to withstand the pressures of being a young person in Ireland in 2001.</P>
    <P>In addition to these programmes, all schools are encouraged to develop a comprehensive alcohol and drug policy. This approach needs to involve parents, teachers and pupils themselves. Policies such as these are becoming more common in the workplace and it is appropriate for schools to adopt similar measures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1220" /> The findings from the SLÁN, HBSC and ESPAD studies confirm that the abuse of alcohol by young people constitutes a major public health problem. The amount and frequency of drinking are of concern and the results show that the trends are getting worse. We recognise that we have a problem which we are committed to tackling. A range of policies is in place or coming on stream and these, together with a tougher stance on issues such as advertising and availability, measures which have been successful in other countries, will help to encourage young people to change their behaviour.</P>
    <P>We must all examine our attitude towards alcohol. As a society we must ask ourselves whether we are satisfied to drift along, complaining that things are getting worse yet reluctant to make substantive changes. Alternatively have we reached a point when we are prepared to say, &ldquo;Stop, it's time to take action&rdquo;? Alcohol abuse is a social issue and we as a society must decide where our values lie.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. The 1999 ESPAD report, Alcohol and Other Drug Use Among Students in 30 European Countries, cost a lot of money to produce but it is difficult to obtain a copy.</P>
      <P>It may sound alarmist but what comes through from the report is that little has changed with regard to the drinking habits of young people in Ireland. We have remained in the top group since 1995 when the first comprehensive study was carried out. However, as a woman, one of the most alarming aspects of the report is the finding that the increase in drinking is predominantly among girls, particularly young girls. This is a shocking finding which we must examine. We are not discussing cigarette smoking in this debate but it is interesting that the same findings were reported in the survey on cigarette smoking.</P>
      <P>I wish to be positive about the matter but only one small ray of light came from the report, namely, that the use of drugs by students in Ireland has reduced slightly. This may be due to the tremendous efforts of Governments, schools, parents, the drugs squad and others which promote greater awareness. However, the report highlights that it is easier than ever to obtain all kinds of drugs throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot contradict the findings of this report as it was a collaborative scientific study. One positive aspect was the forthcoming response of students in the 15 to 16 year old age bracket. The project set out to conduct schools based surveys as that was the way to obtain the relevant cohort of people in a supportive environment and free of peer and parent pressure. The students answered questions honestly and Irish students were very forthcoming in their responses to the research. We must view as positive the manner in which young people respond to questions and the fact that they are not fearful of stating the number of times they have been drunk. More often than not, young people use spirits and beer and not wine. <Col N="1221" /> This is probably due to the fact that wine is not one of the more popular drinks in Ireland among young people.</P>
    <P>It is important to get back to the goal, however. Researchers have stated that the knowledge gained will be important in future when changes in one part of Europe may serve as a forecast for other countries where such changes have not yet appeared, and such trends may also function as incitements for prevention initiatives. There were significant drops in some countries, but not here. We are still up there with Denmark and the United Kingdom in most categories of high alcohol consumption. When we receive reports such as this one it is incumbent upon us to take corrective action by looking at the methodologies employed by countries that showed a reduction in the 1999 survey. They must be doing something positive about reducing drinking, and we cannot resolve the drinking issue alone.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the countries where young people consume most alcohol happen to be places we normally associate with having an easy attitude to drink, including the Scandinavian countries, and particularly Denmark which is still up there at the top, with ourselves and the United Kingdom. The trend appears to be increasing towards eastern Europe, as the economic prosperity of those countries, although it is less than ours, has resulted in increased drinking among young people.</P>
    <P>In discussing the detail of the research it is no harm to go through some salient points concerning the graphs that are well illustrated throughout this report. As regards changes in alcohol consumption, Ireland is included in the category &ldquo;alcohol used 40 times or more in a lifetime&rdquo;, recording an increase between 1995 and 1999. Eastern European countries tend to come on board, so the Czech Republic is now included for the first time in the top group along with Finland, Ireland and the United Kingdom where increases have occurred. Interestingly, both Cyprus and Italy have recorded decreases in drinking, so perhaps we should examine what happened in those places between 1995 and 1999.</P>
    <P>I am frightened by the statistics relating to an increase in drinking by girls. In the category &ldquo;Alcohol used 20 times or more during the last 12 months&rdquo; we are still up in the high figures. There has been no change in the category &ldquo;Alcohol used ten times or more during the last 30 days&rdquo;, but we are still among the high consumption figures. The overall increase is, however, more pronounced among girls.</P>
    <P>Denmark, Ireland, Malta and the United Kingdom continue to be among the countries with the highest prevalence of alcohol use per 30-day period. In 1999, as in 1995, Ireland, Denmark and Cyprus held the top position in the category &ldquo;Beer consumption: three times or more during the last 30 days&rdquo;. Cyprus and Ireland used to be ranked second and third, but now the Czech Republic is in there, with the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1222" /> I will not refer to wine consumption because it does not impact much on us. The statistics concerning the consumption of spirits are frightening. Increases recurred in Cyprus, Denmark, Ireland, Malta, Norway, Slovakia, Slovenia and the United Kingdom in the category &ldquo;Spirits consumption: three times or more during the last 30 days&rdquo;. Whereas consumption of spirits was evenly spread among boys and girls in six of those countries, the opposite was true both here and in the United Kingdom, where the increase was larger among girls. Girls were in the majority both in the 1995 and 1999 surveys.</P>
    <P>In 1995 and 1999, Denmark and Ireland recorded the highest figures in the category &ldquo;Consumption of 101 centilitres of beer, or more&rdquo;. Sweden used to be the top country in this category. In the past, Sweden was regarded very much as a country where a high percentage of the population drank, but it is now surpassed by Ireland. According to this survey, the highest increase in the consumption of spirits was observed in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This frightening report cannot be pushed aside. We are a tiny country participating among 30 other states, yet we are still up there, recording the highest increase in the category &ldquo;Eleven centilitres of spirits on the last drinking occasion&rdquo;. Girls are in the majority in this category also. Denmark, Norway and Ireland recorded the highest increases in the category &ldquo;drunkenness, 20 times or more in a lifetime&rdquo;. It is very depressing. In every single category, except for wine drinking, Ireland is among the top countries for consumption.</P>
    <P>I repeat that there has been no improvement between 1995 and 1999, in the hope that parents, teachers, politicians and the public will be aware of this report. It is not just a newspaper headline that will come and go.</P>
    <P>Denmark and Ireland also recorded the largest increases in the category &ldquo;Drunkenness, three times or more during the last 30 days&rdquo;. It is not sufficient to provide a statistic and say that both Denmark and Ireland are up there among the top consumers. This pattern is consistent for all types of alcohol, apart from wine, and no improvement has been recorded between 1995 and 1999.</P>
    <P>I was horrified by the statistics on binge drinking, which is classified as &ldquo;five drinks in a row on at least three occasions during the last 30 days&rdquo;. Ireland is again among the top countries, including Denmark and the United Kingdom. In 1995 and 1999, the top group comprised Denmark, Ireland, Poland and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of the survey, respondents were asked at what age they began drinking and what their drinking patterns were like at the age of 13. Both Norway and Ireland recorded increases in the category &ldquo;Drunk at the age of 13, or younger&rdquo;, whereas decreases occurred in Cyprus and Italy. In this category in most countries boys were in the majority, but the proportion of boys and girls was equal in Ireland. In 1999, three countries showed particularly high <Col N="1223" /> figures for this category &ndash; sadly, they were Denmark, the United Kingdom and Finland. Ireland did not hit the top three but it was not very far from them.</P>
    <P>Even though we are discussing drinking, it is important to refer briefly to the prevalence for using illicit drugs. I began by stating that there was a slight decrease in drug taking by Irish youths, but we are up there among the highest consumers. The report found a slight decrease in the consumption of all drugs, cannabis in particular, but that decrease was only found among boys, so girls are still at risk. Ireland recorded a slight decrease in the category &ldquo;life-time use of any illicit drug other than cannabis&rdquo;. That is possibly because of interventions across the community. Ireland also figures in the statistics for the use of inhalants.</P>
    <P>The statistics relating to the availability of drugs are frightening also. Ireland is among the top five countries in the category &ldquo;proportion of students who perceive the availability of drugs to be very easy or fairly easy&rdquo;. There is no question but that drugs can be found easily by young people. As regards LSD and any other drugs named in the report, we have been there, done that, and had access to them. To summarise the report, girls drink more often and in larger quantities than boys in Ireland and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned sponsorship, promotion, responsible serving of alcohol, and schools-based information programmes, but they are not enough. I worked as a teacher from 1994 to 1997, so it is not long ago that I was teaching 15 and 16 year olds. They had no problem in telling me they had easy access to alcohol. According to the report, while other nationalities were drinking in parks, at home or in other people's houses, Irish boys and girls were drinking in pubs. They said that was the only area where they had access to alcohol, whereas in other countries such access was always in somebody's home or at parties. The big question is how, at that age and even younger, they are able to get their hands on alcohol.</P>
    <P>There is also an increased level of drinking among students who have easy access to off-licence premises. They may be third level students, but if we were to carry out our own survey I am sure we would discover that many of them are second level students. There is such a demand for off-licence drink that students buy in quantities. They buy in crates and move to their rented accommodation, apartments or elsewhere to parties. We may have to deal with the issue of monitoring off-licence premises in relation to access by young people, who can obviously consume both within pubs and outside them.</P>
    <P>It is a sad indictment that, despite the emphasis on a holistic approach to health, social and personal development and moderation, we are still not getting the message across. Can we liaise with <Col N="1224" /> other countries which have positive interventions and similar lifestyles, where there has been a decrease? Perhaps the situation in Italy or Sweden could be studied. There is no shortage of information. We should avail of all expertise which may be available at EU level, such as the appropriate committee of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>Unless we take positive steps now, we may be even more horrified when the next report comes out in four years' time. The collaborators in this report said they would prefer to have reports more frequently than at four yearly intervals but the limiting factor is funding. In the interest of better use of funding, we should press for two-yearly reports rather than allowing a problem of heavy drinking by young people to go undetected for as long as four years.</P>

      <P>We do not need reports to tell us how bad the alcohol problem is throughout our society. Alcohol seems to be a central feature of Irish lifestyles. No social occasion is complete without plentiful supplies of alcoholic drinks. The drinks industry has a strong economic input to Irish life. In the context of under age drinking, we are distinguished from all other European societies by the level of &ldquo;binge drinking&rdquo; in Ireland. The problem is apparent on our streets every weekend, and even mid-week, in terms of 16 year olds and upwards in various stages of an alcoholic haze. Anybody visiting an accident and emergency room on any night of the week would be frightened by what they see there. The hospital staff themselves are frightened. Our accident and emergency departments need security people on duty 24 hours a day to protect the staff and the patients.</P>
      <P>This is a relatively new development in Irish life, although there have always been problems of over-indulgence in alcohol, with consequent family and social problems. In the Mater Hospital, 25% of all admissions through the casualty department are drink-related. If that element of hospital admissions could be removed, there might not be a problem of lack of hospital beds for people who are ill and who are lying on trollies for 12, 24 or even 36 hours until a bed can be found for them.</P>
      <P>To deal with this problem, we need to bring on board all elements of society, from the drinks industry right through to the consumer, to foster a more sane approach to the consumption of alcohol. The Americans have proved that prohibition does not work. It just drove the supply underground and created another industry. The effects of prohibition have never really been shaken off. Once the trade in alcohol passed to the criminal element, that control was never regained. That is obviously not a route we should follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of dealing with young people, there are a few things we can do. We can make the sale of alcohol contingent upon the production of ID, especially by young people. It is high time that a proper national identity card was <Col N="1225" /> introduced. We can also deal with people who knowingly sell alcohol to those under age, or who buy it on their behalf. I am aware of a practice whereby such people will go into the off-licence, purchase alcohol and give it to children. There should be exemplary sanctions against that kind of behaviour.</P>
    <P>There should be a curb on the current rampant advertising of alcohol on billboards and television and in newspapers. We should also stop the practice of drinks companies supplying free alcohol to student society functions. The use of vouchers and various other sales promotional methods in pubs, including the euphemistically styled &ldquo;promotion nights&rdquo;, should be banned. These measures can be taken without much damage to the drinks industry.</P>
    <P>We need an educational programme involving the whole apparatus of State, not just teachers and schools, to point out to young people the damage which alcohol abuse can have on their physical and mental health. I quote the following statement from the European Commission on its proposal for a Council regulation on alcohol consumption by children and adolescents:</P>
    <P>In the long term, the effect of alcohol on a person's health may be determined by their consumption pattern, that is to say, the drinking behaviour they acquired in their youth. There is evidence that young people who begin regular drinking at an early age, are substantially more likely to develop alcohol dependence later in life than those who begin drinking at a later age. It is therefore important to help young people to acquire behaviour that will minimise the harm associated with the consumption of alcoholic beverage.</P>
    <P>This is where the education aspect comes in, to try to minimise the peer pressure on teenagers to drink. They cannot go to a function without finding alcohol freely and cheaply available. We have to break the connection between social enjoyment and the abuse of drink, and I speak as one who enjoys a drink. In moderation, the social use of alcohol can be beneficial, but we are now reaping the results of binge drinking by young people. From my observation in medical practice, I see that the people being admitted to places such as Cuan Mhuire are of a progressively younger age group. It used to be a problem of middle aged people but now it is younger people who are being admitted there. If this has not yet reached the stage of being a national emergency, it is certainly becoming a serious problem in Irish society.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association on its magnificent report. The report in question is not an attempt by the association <Col N="1226" /> to be a killjoy or to display an anti-pub bias, it is a factual document which I hope will be sent to every pioneer group and school throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In the past people in this country had serious problems with alcohol and we were known as the &ldquo;drunken Irish&rdquo; etc. However, that was in the days when shebeens and poitín held sway. We eventually got rid of these and in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s &ndash; poverty may have been the cause of this &ndash; people were able to enjoy themselves. During that period bouncers on the doors of dance halls would have refused entry to anybody who smelled of drink. If people were not properly dressed &ndash; for men this meant wearing a shirt and tie &ndash; and smelled of alcohol, they would be removed from the premises. Those halls were packed to capacity. At that stage there were no fire regulations and there was no need for them. People enjoyed themselves because they were sober.</P>
    <P>The greatest problem with alcohol abuse today is that it causes much heartbreak. When I see people protesting about ESB pylons and mobile telephone masts, I reflect on the fact that we must face up to our hypocrisy. The two greatest causes of damage to people's health are alcohol and drug abuse. However, people do not protest about this fact because they do not accept it. Three people were killed in a car accident a number of days ago, one of whom was a priest going about his business, and alcohol could possibly have been involved. It is a fact that up to 50% of all accidents involve alcohol. Young people have been fatally stabbed outside discos but nothing has been said about it. If they had been stabbed in amusement arcades or bingo halls, people would march and protest until these places were closed down. Why do people turn a blind eye when trouble is caused by alcohol abuse? Why do those who are so concerned about their health not protest about and discuss this issue?</P>
    <P>It is time people woke up and realised the damage being done by alcohol advertisements. As stated on numerous occasions, the drinking of alcohol has been glamorised. I congratulate RTÉ on the great &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme it made on this subject. However, camera crews never seem to film the people who are sleeping rough in Dublin and who are victims of alcohol and drug abuse. The vast majority of those who sleep rough throughout the country &ndash; I accept there is a small number with mental health problems &ndash; are in their predicament because of alcohol abuse. However, people do not protest about this but prefer instead to ask what we are doing about the homeless. What are we doing about the causes of homelessness? If we do not deal with the root cause of the problem, we will not solve it.</P>
    <P>I am involved in bringing international amputee and disabled golfers to this country later this year. It was suggested by the organising committee, of which I am chairman, that we ask one of the drinks companies to sponsor the event. I <Col N="1227" /> refused to countenance such a move and the other members eventually agreed. The event will now proceed without sponsorship from an alcohol company. In my opinion alcohol companies sponsor too many events. It is time people involved in sport stated that they will not accept sponsorship from such companies. There are other companies that are willing to sponsor events and their involvement would end that of the alcohol companies. At every televised sporting event one will see hoardings in the arena which promote alcohol.</P>
    <P>It recently came to my attention that alcohol companies have promotion officers in third level colleges and institutions throughout the country. Their next step will be to try to appoint such officers to secondary schools. They state that these people operate in a professional manner, but that is not the case. These officers' activities are dedicated to selling more alcohol, corrupting people and destroying lives. Let us stop taking a soft approach to this issue. The situation we face is serious and I would hate to think what will happen to this country if we do not come to grips with it.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Fitzpatrick's statement that identity cards should be introduced. I have advocated their introduction for many years. In my opinion such cards should be issued to everyone, not just students. Identity cards are essential in any educated and well run society. If they were introduced, people would not be ashamed to produce them when they enter a public house and no one would be singled out as a result.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the activities of supermarkets, off-licences and discos. First, however, I must point out the dangers posed by drinks cabinets in people's homes. These are a recent phenomenon and it is now the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing to have a drinks cabinet in one's house. How many children got their first taste of alcohol by raiding their parents' drinks cabinet? I have stated previously that these cabinets should be removed from people's homes because there is no need for them. If people do not want to remove them, they should ensure that they are locked.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, people should not be allowed to drink alcohol at discos. People should be able to enjoy themselves in such establishments without sucking alcohol from a bottle from the time they enter until they leave. We must put an end to this and I appeal to the Minister of State to put a stop to the sale of alcohol in discos and dance halls.</P>
    <P>The activities of off-licences and supermarkets are not policed in a sufficiently rigorous manner. As stated on many occasions, people who frequent public houses buy their alcohol by the glass. However, in off-licences and supermarkets they can buy a dozen cans or bottles. For a period, supermarkets were obliged to limit the sale of alcohol on their premises to a particular section, which was fenced off, but it now appears to be freely available on the shelves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1228" /> The latest development by alcohol companies is the sale of mixed drinks which contain alcohol and soft drinks. This is another attempt on their part to encourage people to become addicted to drink. Addiction is very serious and someone &ndash; I do not recall who &ndash; was prompted to state &ldquo;You do not throw addiction out the window, you coax it down the stairs step by step.&rdquo;  Young people who are becoming addicted to alcohol will experience serious problems later in life.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware, only one bishop in Ireland is facilitating people who want to take the pledge. I spoke to Bishop Jones in Sligo about this matter recently and was informed that people will not keep the pledge. That is a defeatist attitude which only takes account of the lowest common denominator. There are many people who might be drinkers today if they had not taken the pledge at confirmation. That pledge is a great crutch on which parents can lean. They can say to their children, &ldquo;You took the pledge and said you would not drink until you are 18, and if you do not honour your word on that matter, no one will take your word in respect of anything else.&rdquo;  The pledge is a challenge which must be undertook and kept. We could do more to educate people in this regard.</P>
    <P>The number of pioneers throughout the country has decreased considerably. Anyone who spoke Irish in the 1950s were laughed at and asked why they were talking such nonsense. At that time Irish music had been thrown to one side. However, the position has changed and Irish music, Irish dancing and the Irish language are considered to be &ldquo;cool&rdquo;. It is now time for the pioneers to lift themselves up because we are almost at the point of no return in regard to alcohol. The pioneers should get active again and run advertising campaigns and promotions, as well as try to increase their membership, because to wear the pioneer pin and to be seen to be sober could become cool, to use modern phraseology. I sincerely thank the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association for this excellent document.</P>
    <P>There should be an accident and emergency ward in psychiatric hospitals or alcohol treatment units. People with alcohol or drug problems should not be brought to general hospitals because they upset the people who are awaiting treatment for heart attacks or other serious medical conditions. I had occasion to be in the Mater Hospital five or six years ago with a heart complaint and I had first hand experience of watching these people being brought in drunk. It was shocking. People who are drunk should not be allowed into such units. I ask the Minister for Health and Children to consider opening an accident and emergency ward in alcohol treatment units or psychiatric hospitals to deal with people who are drunk. They are not sick but they are a nuisance when they fall in the streets and have to be picked up by the emergency services. Those people should not be brought to a sick unit. If that change were made, it would take a great deal of pressure off the accident and emergency <Col N="1229" /> departments and make life much easier for the nurses and doctors who have great difficulty dealing with people who are intoxicated.</P>
    <P>I wanted to refer to many other issues in connection with this report, which is excellent. I have been speaking about this issue for the past 25 years. I remember speaking about it at a health board meeting in Manorhamilton at which somebody said we should not worry about alcohol abuse but drug abuse, which would be our next major problem. It did become a major problem but unfortunately my breath has been wasted on that matter.</P>
    <P>I thank the Leader for providing time for this debate. It is important that we continue to highlight this problem. I appeal to parents and teachers to recognise that alcohol is the biggest killer in our society. As was said on a previous occasion, it is time people took the srams out of their eyes and met the problem head on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Some weeks ago I called for this debate arising from the publication of the report. I have not read the report because it is not available widely. Obviously it is a voluminous study of drinking habits throughout Europe, with many references to Ireland. A major dearth in our own information is that we do not have reliable statistics on alcohol consumption here and the way that consumption breaks down among consumers. This report proves that there is a serious problem of under age drinking and many of us have anecdotal evidence in that regard. If one is in the vicinity of a disco in the early hours of the morning one can see many young people who are clearly under age and under the influence of alcohol.</P>
      <P>There are a number of legal problems in relation to this issue. I took a hard line in relation to the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1999, which amended the previous Act to allow for late opening on New Year's Eve at the start of the new millennium. Last year we had the full Intoxicating Liquor Act, which was a major reform of the myriad of laws that govern the consumption and the sale of alcohol. I made a request on both those occasions, which was not always popular, that when a young person under the age of 18 years, or any young person, presented themselves for the purchase of an alcoholic beverage in a licensed premises, it should be compulsory that the person serving them should insist on seeing a proper identity card. We have a voluntary identity card system which simply does not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, we impose severe penalties on publicans and owners of licensed premises who are found guilty of serving alcohol to under age people. I welcome that but it is a little too heavily weighted on the person who owns the premises or the publican. Perhaps this is too draconian, although the law already provides for it, but it should have been provided in the 2000 Act that criminal responsibility would be placed on the young person. I gather we are to raise the age of criminal responsibility to 12 <Col N="1230" /> years through legislation in these Houses. An under age person who falsely represents their age should be held responsible before the law. It should be a serious illegal act. They would have to be accompanied by their parents in court because they are under age but we need to do that. Placing all the burden of responsibility on the person selling alcohol to the young person simply does not work. We must insist that young persons between the ages of 12 and 18 &ndash; hopefully there are not many people under the age of 12 presenting themselves at bars to purchase drink &ndash; be held responsible before the law for their actions, and that serious penalties be imposed in terms of fines. We must bring all the actors together in relation to this serious problem.</P>
    <P>I call for the introduction of a mandatory identity card system for young people. Much socialising on the part of young people is now done in an atmosphere where there is alcohol for sale. When I was of that age, I will not say how long ago, drinking was not part of the entertainment centre where the music was played or the dancing took place. I am talking about the 1960s, the early 1970s and before that. In the 1980s, however, we had this new phenomenon of the disco where drink is sold in addition to the entertainment being provided. In an atmosphere like that, with darkened rooms, etc., it is difficult for the person in charge of serving alcohol to determine the age of those who present themselves to purchase alcohol. For that reason, responsibility must be shared by all the actors involved here.</P>
    <P>Drinking is a prevalent practice in Ireland. Two years ago, and last year, I referred to the fact that it was proven in 1995 that we consume approximately 11.5 litres of pure alcohol per head per year &ndash; that was for all of the population over 15 years of age. Since 20% of Irish people are abstainers &ndash; the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association is very strong here &ndash; that figure then increases to close to 14 litres per head per annum. That is a very high level of alcohol consumption among that portion of the adult population, the 80% of us who appear to take a drink, which includes myself. It is a serious problem.</P>
    <P>A large part of the health burden is alcohol related. People with alcohol-related illnesses are found in hospital beds, as the Minister knows. We need to do a proper study if we are to know exactly what alcohol is doing to society, the benefits and particularly the damage. We need to study in detail how it affects the health system, abstentionism from work and disruption from school. I urged the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to undertake this but he stated that it was not his responsibility. I urge the Department of Health and Children to do this work immediately. We should not depend on the good work of a Swedish institute. The debate today was triggered by figures extrapolated from its report.</P>
    <P>There are figures but much is put together from anecdotal evidence about absenteeism from work. The amount of absenteeism on a Monday <Col N="1231" /> morning is much higher than a Tuesday or Wednesday. That is clearly related to excessive consumption of alcohol by people over the weekend, particularly on Sunday evening.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that at least 30% of deaths in road accidents are directly related to alcohol. It is the main contributory factor to these accidents. That is a serious problem that has not been tackled. There is a range of diseases, such as stomach and breast cancer, related to excessive alcohol and much psychiatric illness is related to it.</P>
    <P>What one concludes from anecdotal evidence would be proved correct if based on scientific research. I urge this to be done. No doubt, we would be amazed at the cost to the health service of alcohol abuse.</P>
    <P>We must do something about under age drinking and by extension drinking by younger people. We have a high level of teenage pregnancy, depression among the young and suicide among young males. All these are related to excessive consumption of alcohol in these age categories. We must do something about advertising, the social acceptance of alcohol and education. Drugs education is on some schools' curriculum but it is not taken as a serious subject.</P>
    <P>We must socialise the young into the belief that excessive alcohol is dangerous and above all socially unacceptable. It is socially acceptable among adults, used as part of social intercourse between people and part of our culture &ndash; entertainment, sporting events and other activities. People therefore see the enjoyment side rather than the deleterious and damaging side of it. An education programme aimed at young people should address this.</P>
    <P>Under the 1988 Act it is an offence for an under age person to purchase alcohol, but last year's Sale of Intoxicating Liquor Act placed all the burden on the person operating the premises. Those people have to take their share of the responsibility but we must restate in another Act that persons between 12 and 18 years should share responsibility for the illegal act of consuming-selling-dispensing alcohol.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Acting Chairman for making a crusade out of the issue of drink, especially for young people. Alcohol is our favourite drug. We extol its benefits but ignore its downside. We cannot continue to turn a blind eye to the epidemic of alcohol abuse and ignore the fact that young people drink at a younger age and in greater quantities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years some health boards, including that in my area, the Midland Health Board, conducted a survey of drug abuse among young people in second level schools. It covered a number of areas, including smoking and drugs in the established sense. The startling, worrying statistic is that 88% claimed to have consumed alcohol once, with no difference between males and females, although males were heavier drinkers than females. The most common age of initiation <Col N="1232" /> of drinking was 14 to 15. Cider was claimed to have been drunk by 11% by the age of ten, wine and spirits by 9% each. Those who took alcohol were more likely to have used illegal drugs.</P>
    <P>The alcohol industry has taken over our social and cultural life. In sporting events, as the Acting Chairman mentioned, festivals, Christmastide, birthdays, dog fights, and cat fights alcohol plays a pivotal role. If there are not a few jars there, it is not enjoyed.</P>
    <P>Recent European surveys show us to be top of the league for under age drinking. This is not a wonderful achievement and is not a boast. Under age drinking has reached epidemic proportions.</P>
    <P>I applaud the efforts made by the vast majority of the members of the Vintners Federation of Ireland. I speak with knowledge because I take a drink, but I do not let drink take me. The publicans in my local town are diligent and conscientious in not serving people they consider to be under age. There is a small percentage, as there is in every category of people, who sell drink to whomever asks for it without looking for proof of identity.</P>
    <P>The Acting Chairman raised, as did Senator Connor, the issue of identity cards. I support identity cards for everybody. It is an absolute must today. If we make any attempt to curb under age drinking, identity cards must be introduced. Whether we like it or not, the measures we have taken are not working. We do not like it, so we have to go back to the drawing board. The drinks industry, including breweries and distilleries, should devolve a percentage of their turnover to education on alcohol. When I was working in the area of alcohol and drugs 20 years ago, there was a national independent organisation called INCA. It did great work, and helped to set up advisory bodies on tobacco and drugs. We do not seem to have anything of that nature for our favourite drug, which is alcohol.</P>
    <P>We need to tackle the area of under age drinking to see what can be done. Parents will play a pivotal role in this. I once met a young lady from Dublin who was a reformed alcoholic at 22. She was an only child who had a serious drink problem at 15. When she arrived home at midnight or 1 a.m., her parents were happy to hear her announce she was home. She was usually full of drink, however, because she had a very serious problem at a tender age.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Leas-Chathaoirleach and others who have said that all alcohol should be banned from teenage discos. There should be no such thing as alcoholic discos, especially when the disco is for under age people. In fairness, proprietors of off-licences are diligent in the main. It must be borne in mind, however, that young people will always find somebody who is willing to buy drink and supply it to them. There should be a mandatory prison sentence for those who do something of that nature.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to hospitals, including acute units and accident and emergency departments and psychiatric hospitals. My col<Col N="1233" /> leagues, Senators Norris and Henry, put down a motion last year on the need for acute psychiatric beds in the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Some 45% of inappropriate bed occupancy is taken up by people who come in full to the gills with drink, creating havoc and disturbing people who are genuinely ill. I agree with Senators who said that this is unacceptable. Having served in the psychiatric services, I can say that drink related problems were the most common reason for admission, which was a startling statistic. I do not know what the statistic is now. Alcohol impacts on people's physical health, causing cirrhosis of the liver and the destruction of brain cells, to name just two. People who continually abuse alcohol will find themselves in the care of the health services, especially the psychiatric services.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that parents have a huge role to play, and not just in the area of under age drinking. It is interesting to think that some years ago, young lads and lasses were getting pocket money to buy their favourite comic. Now they are buying alcohol. It is also very worrying that young people often come to secondary school on a Monday morning with a hangover. They tell their friends they have kept a few bob for a drink later on as a cure. As anyone who knows anything about alcoholism knows, relief drinking is the first step to becoming an alcoholic. That is an established fact.</P>
    <P>There has to be a meeting of minds between all sections of society. I commend the efforts of the Minister for Health and Children, but I do not believe we are winning the war. Death on the road is another topic on which the Leas-Chathaoirleach has spoken <i>ad nauseam</i>. A large number of the accidents which take place on our roads are drink related. I will not even speak about marriage break-up and violence on our streets, most of which are alcohol related. Something needs to be done. I could say much more, but to go on longer would be to repeat some of what has already been said. Like other Senators who have spoken, I am concerned and there is a need to be.</P>
    <P>I conclude by reading from a survey of young persons' views of the attitudes of their parents towards under age drinking. Most young people said their parents would probably not approve of under age drinking. Ten years ago, they would have thought their parents would kill them if they knew they were drinking. A casual approach can be seen in the young people's responses. Regular drinkers said they do not drink in front of their parents, and that their parents are unaware of the amount of alcohol they consume at the weekend. I am talking about boys and girls of 14 to 16 years of age, who come to school on a Monday morning with a hangover.</P>
    <P>Some younger females reported that their parents prefer them to be open about their drinking habits, and a minority reported they are not allowed drink in front of younger brothers and sisters. Even that information betrays the casual <Col N="1234" /> approach of parents. It is an old saying and a true one that you cannot teach an old dog new tricks. We have an opportunity as a House, in tandem with the Minister for Health and Children, his Department, the drinks industry, parents and the education system to facilitate the meeting of minds needed to tackle this problem. It is out of hand, but it is never too late to do the right thing.</P>

      <P>I will take six, and Senator Ryan can have the rest. It is very suitable that the Leas-Chathaoirleach is in the Chair as he has pressed for this debate for such a long time. Other speakers have covered the issue of under age drinking in this country very well, so I will concentrate on the efforts the medical profession should make. It is great to have a doctor like Deputy Moffatt in the House for this debate.</P>
      <P>Dr. Joe Barry is the dean of the faculty of public health medicine in the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. He recently wrote that under age drinking in Ireland is a tale of woe, and I think that is a good way of expressing it. We all see the great sorrow it brings to young people, their families and the wider community. Professor Anthony Clare was, until recently, medical director of St. Patrick's Hospital, one of our major psychiatric institutions. He has frequently said to me that he thinks under age drinking in this country is a more serious problem than the use of illegal drugs. For quite some time, doctors have recognised the seriousness of this issue and the need to deal with it.</P>
      <P>The problems in accident and emergency departments were mentioned. Perhaps those who work in such departments have not made it abundantly clear that young people coming in drunk, particularly on weekend nights, interfere with the running of a casualty service. A huge amount of their time is occupied trying to establish whether these young people are injured or merely drunk. Those who are drunk may need to be left at the back of casualty wards to sleep it off. Sadly, one of them dies every now and then because they have a head injury as well. Diagnosis of such problems should not be estimated.</P>
      <P>It is also a terrible curse for the rest of the population who must go to the casualty departments with serious injuries or illnesses and who have to wait for hours while these people are dealt with. This was on the television programme which inspired Senator Farrell to ask for this debate. Perhaps we need more publicity from doctors about the amount of time and effort wasted dealing with people who are in the casualty departments because of alcohol abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have talked about the influence of alcohol on road traffic accidents. I am not just talking about those driving cars but also pedestrians. It <Col N="1235" /> is worth mentioning the influence alcohol has on serious accidents in the home. I am not only talking about cases of domestic violence but about falls down stairs and into cookers and fires. Perhaps the medical profession should stress this aspect more. Approximately half the coroners are doctors. While it is difficult not to have respect for the feelings of the family of the bereaved when there has been a fatal incident, we must stress the importance of the fact that these people had over-indulged in alcohol before the incident which led to their death.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we could also speak out more about the enforcement of legislation. I come from an area in Dublin where there is a large number of pubs. Large numbers of under age people, particularly girls, go into these pubs. I raised this issue during our discussion on the Intoxicating Liquor Act last year. Senator Bohan pointed out the difficulties for staff in recognising people who are under age and I appreciate that. However, the answer is to employ more staff. This would not happen in America because there must be plenty of staff to question people. I know the pubs are not as crowded, but perhaps that has something to do with our licensing system. We should look at smaller pubs in areas where people know who people are. There is a lack of enforcement of the legislation dealing with the age of people going into pubs and we must address that. Doctors could also become involved in that area.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, is a medical practitioner. He must make more of an effort to separate the link between sport and its promotion by those who sell alcoholic beverages. The Minister for Health and Children was right to seize the opportunity to take the snooker competition away from the alcohol industry. Some £600,000 over three years is chicken feed. Sport looks more dramatic in Croke Park, but it is not right to associate something, such as snooker, which is not energy consuming but which people regard as laudable, with alcohol. It is unfortunate that every celebration of a sporting occasion appears to need a bottle of champagne fizzed all over the place. It is a waste of champagne. It is unfortunate that this appears to be the only way one can celebrate. Dr. Michael Loftus of the GAA must be applauded for the work he has done for years to try to separate the GAA from alcohol. I think he resigned because he felt he had failed. It is unfortunate that of all organisations the GAA relies on Guinness for sponsorship of its tournaments. It should consider breaking that link.</P>
    <P>Young people earn more money nowadays and this is important when they want to buy drink. We should look at why they want to get drunk. They do not buy drink to have a good time or to have a party but to get drunk. That is worrying. The fact we have only one adolescent in-patient psychiatric unit means we are not taking adolescent psychiatry seriously. If the new Mental Health Bill ever becomes an Act, it must provide <Col N="1236" /> for more units to deal with adolescents and children with psychiatric problems. There must be a reason they drink to get drunk. Perhaps when they look at the stress they are under from the education system and the current strike they feel they need to get drunk. We are also short of psychologists in our schools and that needs to be addressed. Alcoholism is closely associated with depression which leads to suicide.</P>
    <P>General practitioners have the greatest influence of any doctors on people. Perhaps we should encourage the Irish College of General Practitioners to go further in the way it has addressed alcohol abuse. We should also support its idea that the drinks industry must be prevented from advertising and that there should be a health tax on it. The big battle is between the Government and the vested interests. I hope the Minister of State relays that view to the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry for sharing her time. I remind everyone that alcohol is good. The Lord's authority is there at the wedding feast in Cana because when the wine ran out, he made more available. It is a good thing which is capable of being abused. Life is full of good things which are capable of being abused. I will not list them but we all know the type of things about which I speak.</P>
      <P>The ability to enjoy the pleasurable side of alcohol presupposes the ability to make mature choices. That is why we impose restrictions on people up to an age where we assume, rightly or wrongly, that they are capable of making mature choices. After that it is up to people's mature choice to recognise whether they are able to deal with drink and to make the choice accordingly. If that is our logic, then everything which inhibits or interferes with people's capacity to make mature choices must be removed, such as the use of subliminal advertising which makes suggestions to young people who are at their most vulnerable. There are few categories of people more vulnerable than adolescents. It is a dreadfully difficult time when people are full of personal, sexual, intellectual and familial insecurities. We should not allow a single one dimensional suggestion that there is one simple way of eliminating all those problems, which is what the indirect promotion of alcohol does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I work in third level education and from the moment a student arrives there, they are bombarded with propaganda from the drinks industry. That should not happen. If the drinks industry is interested in the third level sector, it should make block grants available to fund sporting facilities and we will give it credit in the literature. We will thank Beamish &amp; Crawford and Murphys for sponsoring it. Senator Farrell may not agree with me but that is the only way if the drinks industry wants to be associated with this sector. Recently when I walked along the corridor of my place of work and of UCC I saw a poster which advertised a table quiz sponsored by Beamish &amp; Crawford <Col N="1237" /> and the business studies society or another society. It was that society's table quiz but the name of the brewer was in large print on the poster compared to the small print used for the name of the society. We must change that ethos.</P>
    <P>We must also enforce the law. I have said on numerous occasions that I know the name of the night club in Cork where my 17 year old daughter says she will not go because it is full of junior certificate students. I will not name it because it would be a breach of privilege. If I and others who have any knowledge of Cork city know that, why will the Garda not do anything about it? Every dog in the street knows about this. I am not talking about marginal 17 year olds who look like they are 19; I am talking about junior certificate students. Within the 17 to 19 age group, it is difficult to distinguish their age especially with young women. Most publicans would not dream of serving children who are visibly under age but somebody is giving free access to 12 and 13 year olds.</P>
    <P>Quite rightly, we have heavily resourced drug squads. By contrast to the drugs squads, how many gardaí are dedicated to the enforcement of the laws on under age drinking in any Garda district? I bet it is minuscule. It is something they fit in at the tail end. It is about mature choice and our obligation to protect people when they are not old enough to make a mature choice.</P>
    <P>I am a great advocate of the equality law. However, there is a perverse consequence of that whereby publicans can no longer display a sign restricting admittance to 21 or 23 year olds because apparently that is in breach of the Equality Act. That should be changed. It should be perfectly legal for a provider of a service like the service of alcoholic drink to be able to establish any additional conditions to do with age that they feel are appropriate to the service they want to provide. There should not be a legal obstacle to that.</P>
    <P>There is also a parents' issue. Every time an under age person is found by the health services or the Garda in such an intoxicated state that they need to be rescued, the parent should be hauled in to get proper social work counselling. That would cause a considerable number of well-off parents to discover that they are part of the problem of society. Many well-off parents go out for the night leaving 16 year olds in a house full of drink and pretend that nothing will happen. Parents have to take their own responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Are the laws about young people at work being enforced? They have huge amounts of money, which enables them to drink and distracts them from their study etc.</P>
    <P>There are many positive things that we do not do and particularly in country towns. What is available at night apart from a public house for any youngster? Most of our sports facilities are run by volunteers and most of the time are closed at night. Most of our libraries are closed at night. Schools are closed at night. Those clubs which open at night do so intermittently. A huge num<Col N="1238" /> ber of country towns do not have a cinema. We must create a culture in our community of facilities available to young people, which are not adult facilities, so that they do not have to congregate around the nearest pub because it is the only place they can get in out of the rain to hang around. They are allowed in to pubs and that adds them to the culture.</P>
    <P>I have one little, long-standing grievance. When I am driving, I do not drink and I tend to drink alcohol-free lagers. A pint of alcohol-free lager is 50% dearer than a pint of lager with alcohol in it. The last time I had a pint of alcohol-free lager it cost me £4 in a pub that was selling a pint for £2.50. I am told that is to do with the way the excise duty is calculated. Because of the way it is produced, the excise duty is the same as if it had alcohol in it. I do not know if this is true. I do know it is vastly more expensive and it should be cheaper. It is only a small thing but it is an irritant.</P>
    <P>We have to be positive in the things we do and we must enforce the law. I am very worried by the point that Senator Henry made earlier about why so many of our young people believe that the best thing to do on Saturday night is to get so drunk that on Sunday morning they cannot remember what they did the previous night. The Department of Health and Children has to do much work on this.</P>
    <P>I am a drinker but I do not get that drunk. There was a time in my student days when I drank far too much; many students do. There is a huge population of 15 and 16 year olds who cannot imagine a life in which they do not end up so drunk on Saturday night that they cannot remember on Sunday what they did. That is a serious commentary on their whole set of values and it is a really deep issue in our society.</P>
    <P>In other countries that would nominally be far more permissive of alcohol than we are, teenagers do not do that. They either drink or do not drink, but they do not have this urge to get gloriously, blindingly drunk that a large proportion of our young people have. That is something we have to look at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. As a legislator, a parent and a person involved in the drinks industry, I welcome the debate. I recognise the seriousness of the issue being discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that both the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Martin, recently announced the national alcohol awareness campaign. People must recognise the whole change in the drinks industry in the past eight to ten years. We have moved from old traditional type pubs where people used to form a general observation corps involving different age groups, particularly in small towns. There were different structures in the city but it was closer. The whole drinking pattern has now changed, particularly for young people. It is more concentrated in bigger centres <Col N="1239" /> and in some towns up to 1,000 young people may congregate at night.</P>
    <P>With the launch of the awareness programme, the important thing is to recognise the pressures on young people and let them know the seriousness of the problem. Within a society that has changed with economic progress there is a great availability of money and there is a trend for young people to be focused towards alcohol. Within the drinks industry, there is a change in the range of products available and the focus of the advertising makes it extremely attractive to young people. Alcohol gives them the kind of buzz they feel is necessary to enjoy themselves.</P>
    <P>We are one of the countries at the top of the European league when it comes to binge drinking among young people. Having discussed the social aspect of drinking with my own children, I appreciate the pressures on young people and the need for greater awareness among parents when dealing with their children so that they know what their needs are and the type of social structures involved. Parents must play a greater role. The Minister recently announced that deregulation of licences is not really of great interest or merit and recent studies have shown that deregulation will not play any part in diminishing excessive drinking by young people.</P>
    <P>The important thing is to bring in adequate reforms to deal with advertising, which has a major impact on young people. Contributions from the drinks industry for promotional purposes are an integral part of all sporting activity in the State and that influence will have to be looked at seriously by sporting bodies and by the Government. The sponsorship that is given is very focused encompassing football, racing, soccer, snooker championships and other areas of sport and entertainment. People are very much focused on the drinks industry through television and the massive interest in sport.</P>
    <P>Dr. Mick Loftus and Dóthain have supported the Minister in his recent announcement relating to the alcohol awareness campaign which sets out the slogans &ldquo;Less is more&rdquo; and &ldquo;It's your choice&rdquo; and there is a website of choices for young people. We have to offer them alternatives. We provide very little investment at local authority level for suitable facilities for young people to enjoy themselves. There is no county level policy of investment in alternatives for them and there is a great need to encourage development in that area within the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, local authorities and the private sector. There is a great opportunity to provide for young people.</P>
    <P>We have a responsibility as to how we implement the law. It is very difficult for establishments catering for 400 and 500 people a night to ensure that every young person on their premises is over 18. As a parent, I can say that most tall young fellows have little difficulty in getting into these places at night because of their growth, strength and appearance. My local newspaper <Col N="1240" /> today lists 22 court cases of which 70% are alcohol related. Two of the cases regard prosecutions of persons in the taxi business for the procurement of alcohol for young people and there have been 16 other cases relating to families and youths attending under-age discos and assaulting people on the door over being refused entry after drinking alcohol on the buses that carried them there. It is interesting to know that in one of those cases the drink was provided by a person in the taxi industry. It is an issue that we must deal with in a comprehensive and planned way.</P>
    <P>Today's debate helps to focus minds because life is moving very quickly in a fast growing economy and sometimes we do not see the changes taking place in family and social structures, particularly dealing with young people. This issue indicates the changes that have occurred and the problems that exist for young people. The report and the Minister of State's statement today reveal that there are many young people who take a drink in a moderate way. It is important that the issue of awareness is brought to the fore and that it remains there. All the statistics are there but, besides the legislative changes, public awareness of the concept throughout the industry is necessary. Most publicans have a genuine approach to the business of drink. They know the business, it is their livelihood and they have a responsibility towards it, but there are those within the industry who abuse and take advantage of it and that has to be stamped out to the best of the ability of the Garda. Overall there is a need for a more determined effort by parents to take on board the issues and the responsibilities involved when dealing with young people.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association has made recommendations to the Minister in relation to advertising and, in a recent public statement on television, he indicated that he was considering them comprehensively. They highlighted the need for a comprehensive examination of the effects of alcohol on young people. That should be undertaken because we need to see what the statistics are and how effectively we should deal with the problems we face. Tighter control of off-licences and their structures is important. Through them young people are able to procure, either through third parties or by themselves, a substantial quantity of the alcohol they consume. One has only to visit public parks and areas to see the amount of cans and plastic containers, most of which are obtained in off-licences. A key aspect of this is public awareness which is an area in which there has been a substantial lull in terms of how clued-in we are to the business of drink and our responsibilities in that regard.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out to me by Fr. Micheal MacGreil S.J. that there is a growing interest in the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association and that is to be welcomed in the student fora of primary and second level education. One of the big issues is to make young people aware of the damage and the problems caused by alcohol, be they <Col N="1241" /> drinkers, non-drinkers or those who intend to drink in the future. From the experiences of my life, I have found that when you go through the system you learn a lot of the downside to alcohol consumption and abuse and, as an alternative to the advertising of the bliss and enjoyment of drinking, young people should be made aware of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This report is potentially one of the most serious ever presented to, and discussed by, this House. If continued, the trend revealed by this report could lead to social catastrophes and major problems beyond our wildest comprehension. The fall-out for society would be very serious and dramatic and, indirectly, it would have a huge impact on our economy.</P>
      <P>This is not just a simple matter of discussing another report. The figures that emerge from it are dramatic. The change in drinking patterns here in just four years is quite astounding, in particular the increased consumption of alcohol by girls. It is frightening to find that, of over 30 countries surveyed, the largest increase in the consumption of spirits was among girls in Ireland, almost double the 1995 figure. That is something that needs to be very seriously examined.</P>
      <P>The report raised many questions. One can immediately point to the State to do this, that or the other but first we must look at the issue and those involved. The people involved are children, young people under 18 years of age or still in their teens and, as Senator Chambers said, their parents must take responsibility. It may not be politic to say it but, if adults choose to have children, they have a responsibility to see those children right through into mature and responsible adulthood. As far as I am concerned, it is unacceptable that 14, 15 and 16 year olds around the streets of every town and village in Ireland throughout the weekend have unlimited amounts of cash available to them, are in a position to secure alcohol and are unsupervised by the adults who have responsibility for them. Maybe it is not for public representatives or the State or the Government to lecture parents on their responsibilities but parents have a moral obligation to take responsibility and that must be pointed out to them.</P>
      <P>Reference was made earlier to how the Garda Síochána deals with the situation. The Garda has a responsibility to let the parents of these youngsters know what their responsibilities are and laws relating to how their children are behaving. A much more proactive approach should be adopted on this front because it concerns young people trying to find their feet and not succeeding because they get so drunk and so out of their minds over the weekend because of drink, and that is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the contents of this report, the Government should, of its own volition, undertake a study or research independently of this report on how this dramatic change has occurred between 1995 and 1999 because the underlying trend, if it <Col N="1242" /> continues, will lead to serious problems down the road. We already know what problems exist as a result of alcohol abuse. They include marriage breakdown, violence in the home, violence on the streets, poor performance at work, absenteeism from work, accidents on the road, fights and rows on the streets, injuries and people ending up in hospitals costing the taxpayer money. The litany of the fallout from alcohol abuse is mind boggling, but there is also a huge cost factor which means that it would be in the interests of the State to examine the problem with a view to curbing, correcting and redirecting.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan mentioned that alcohol was good &ndash; he referred to the wedding feast at Cana. Everything is good in moderation. The fundamental point is that people should use alcohol in moderation, and if they cannot do that, they should not use it at all. The issue is to convey that sense of balance. There is a need for balance and a sense of proportion. If people could be educated to be balanced in their approach and to have a sense of proportion about how they do things, many difficulties would be avoided.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to advertising. Advertising has a huge influence on young people and also older people in terms of what they buy, what they do, what is fashionable and what is the best way to behave. The type of glamorous advertising particularly on television relating to alcohol in pleasant social environments is not exactly helpful to curbing young people's drinking. It is an encouragement to young people to go out and partake in alcohol.</P>
    <P>The promotion of sporting activities by alcohol companies has also been referred to. There is a real need to closely examine that issue. It will lead to political difficulties because there are vested interests who would not like to see legislation to prevent that type of promotion, for obvious reasons. However, the association of alcohol with all types of sport is not commendable and should be discouraged, and I hope something will be done to discourage it.</P>
    <P>This report referred also to the problems that arise as a result of the use or abuse of alcohol. An average of 5% of the participating students reported accident or injury because of alcohol use. The highest figures came from the United Kingdom at 13% and Finland, Ireland and Lithuania at 10% each. Those are very high figures and it must be remembered that we are talking about accidents, in many cases serious or fatal accidents. A total of 8% of youngsters in Ireland get into trouble with the police because of alcohol and a further 8% get into trouble with their parents. There were other interesting statistics. The loss of money or other valuable items was reported by more girls than boys in 17 countries, and by more girls in four. However, the figures for girls in the four countries I already mentioned are among the highest of all for that variable, and 23% of girls in Ireland lost money or other valuables as a result of being drunk. That is a very interesting figure given that the largest increase <Col N="1243" /> in the consumption of spirits was among girls in Ireland and that that figure almost doubled between 1995 and 1999. Is there a correlation between those figures? It is something that deserves further examination and I would ask the Minister, with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Education and Science, to examine that. The Minister for Health and Children and the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, are not the only Ministers with specific or direct departmental responsibility for this issue. All three Departments have responsibility.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry referred to the problems created in accident and emergency departments in hospitals. The scenario in some accident and emergency departments at weekends is chaotic because of the use and misuse of alcohol, particularly by younger people. The resulting demand and drain on resources is extraordinary. In some cases it has to be seen to be believed. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, in his capacity as a general practitioner, would be in a very good position to expand on that issue.</P>
    <P>On the question of identity cards, anyone who objects to identity cards at this stage is being ridiculous. There is a real need for them and they should be demanded in public houses and off licences. The trend in recent times has been for other people to buy large quantities of alcohol in off licences and hand it over to groups of young people. These groups converge on a street corner or on a quiet area and drink themselves silly. The Garda must be on the alert and establish who purchased the drink for these youngsters. If they purchase the drink themselves then the full rigours of the law should applied to those who sell it.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case for the introduction of ID cards for all people up to 18 years; the age limit could even be higher given, as Senator Chambers said, the difficulty in establishing the age of a young fellow or girl. However, this will not happen unless there is an all out concentrated national effort, and not simply a once-off slipshod measure. The Government should establish a sub-committee of the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Education, Finance and the Taoiseach which would put together a programme to deal with these issues. Otherwise the long-term fall-out of this problem for society could be dramatic and serious.</P>
    <P>The report has highlighted a definite trend which will result in serious consequences if we do not take it on board and respond to it. If corrective action is taken we can avoid the social catastrophe which could occur in the years ahead. People should be directed to take their responsibilities seriously because some of them are not doing so. Individuals have responsibilities in this area and looking to the State to take responsibility for everything is not the most commendable approach.</P>

      <P>I agree with the points made by previous speakers. Senator Farrell covered many of my points in his good contribution.</P>
      <P>Seldom, if ever, have all sections of the licensed trade received so much negative press in relation to alcohol misuse as they have in the past month or so. Hardly a day has gone by without an official report, ministerial statement, press report or television programme on the problems of excess alcohol consumption. This publicity not only reflects a serious issue but it is bad for the drinks industry, one of our most important industrial sectors. In a wider and more important context, it says much about the society we have created from our newly achieved affluence. I want to make it clear that the drinks industry will not benefit in the long term from alcohol misuse; it benefits from alcohol sensible use. I have no doubt that rising prosperity has led to increased alcohol abuse. This affluence, together with a loosening of traditional family values, has created a situation where young people have more money at their disposal than ever before. One has only to look at the increase in mobile phone ownership among those under 18 years to prove this point.</P>
      <P>Since the mid-1990s when the economy took off, all alcohol related harm factors have increased significantly, particularly accidents, injuries, violence and even death. The recent Council of Europe funded ESPAD report on alcohol and other drug use among students in 30 European countries shows that Ireland has registered the highest growth in under age drinkers in Europe over the past five years. In addition, research carried out by the drinks trade shows that the top three ways young people access alcohol is through pubs, clubs, discos and off licences. This is a cause of much concern for the trade and it is an issue which must be effectively addressed.</P>
      <P>The trade is not the only component which must be used in tackling the problem. Educators, parents and the community services of the Garda Síochána also have a role to play in tackling it. Responsibility at community level is a key factor. Responsibility also rests with an adult who purchases alcohol from an off licence for under age youngsters or a parent who buys his under age son a drink in a pub after a football match or whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the enactment of the Intoxicating Liquor Act last year the penalties for publicans or alcohol retailers who sell to an under age person have been significantly increased. The Act provides not only for endorsements and heavy fines but has also introduced for the first time the concept of mandatory temporary closure on conviction of up to seven days for the first offence and up to 30 days for the second or subsequent offence. Added to this is the shame of having to post a public notice that the premises or part of it has been closed because of the offence of selling to minors. These serious penalties are a wake-up call for alcohol retailers, publicans and off licence and disco operators who think the law will not be enforced in the future. It is a clear message <Col N="1245" /> from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>For many years the trade representative body &ndash; I have a vested interest in this as I represent the licensed trade in Dublin in the House &ndash; had three basic policies on under age drinking &ndash; first, not to defend in any way a member who had deliberately broken the law in this regard; second, within sensible parameters, to support the legislator and the Garda as well as community groups in helping to stamp out the practice resorted to by a small minority of members in serving under age persons; and, third, consistently advising members and their staff to seek valid proof of age before serving young drinkers. These are straightforward and unequivocal policies.</P>
    <P>I should mention the Equal Status Act, 2000, in relation to discrimination on the grounds of age. The requirement under the Act to serve 18 year olds and upwards complicates the issue. Prior to the enactment of the Act it was commonplace to see notices in Dublin pubs to the effect that people under 21 years, 23 years or even 25 years would not be served. This was an effective precautionary measure, particularly in so far as young girls were concerned given the well accepted difficulty of gauging their age. Signs of this kind are now illegal and one must rely solely on proof of age. The voluntary ID scheme administered by the Garda Síochána is to be commended. However, it cannot be anything more than what it is, that is, a voluntary scheme which relies on voluntary participation which will always be small relative to the population in the 18-21 age bracket.</P>
    <P>The LVA has recommended to the Commission on Liquor Licensing that the effectiveness and uptake of the scheme could be increased by abolishing the £5 application fee and by marketing the existence of the scheme to the general public in a more proactive way. Regardless of the civil issues involved, it may well be that the State will have to introduce a compulsory national ID scheme for a variety of purposes as is common in mainland Europe.</P>
    <P>Much can be done within the licensed sector in terms of proprietor and staff training to combat under age drinking. After a planning and development period of almost three years the Department of Health and Children, in co-operation with the drinks industry group of Ireland, the Licensed Vintners Association, the Vintners Federation of Ireland and CERT, last month launched Responsible Serving of Alcohol.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Martin, on this initiative and Dr. Ann Hope of the health promotion unit of the Department who played a key role in the development of this programme. The RSA aims to provide management and bar staff with the knowledge and awareness necessary to responsibly serve alcohol in licensed premises. The training process includes problems associated with excessive alcohol consumption, how to handle difficult customers and situations, alcohol and the law, avoiding serving under age persons <Col N="1246" /> and monitoring bar and lounge areas. The format of the training process is interactive, using real life situations on a case study basis to help reinforce skills and encourage full discussion among participants. The workshop provides the core element of the training process which runs for three hours with a maximum of 20 participants per session.</P>
    <P>Throughout 2001 the LVA plans to have as many as possible member houses participating in this scheme. Not alone will training of this kind be seen as an important community initiative towards the goal of solving, in so far as possible, at trade level the under age drinking problem but it also makes sound commercial sense. It is an initiative in which our association is proud to be involved.</P>
    <P>Minimising under age drinking behaviour must in the final analysis be a dedicated community effort requiring input and responsibility by all the stakeholders concerned. Parents, educators, guardians, the licensed trade, the association and its members will not be found wanting.</P>
    <P>If the Government is serious about combating the problem of under age drinking, I cannot for the life of me understand why there is so much publicity and pressure to deregulate the licensed trade. Approximately 100 new licences have been granted in the Dublin area in the past 12 months since the new Act came into force. I cannot speak for the country but anyone who gets planning permission and approval from the fire department etc. can apply for a new licence. Under the new Act they can purchase a licence anywhere in the country and move it into Dublin or elsewhere. There is pub for every 190 people in the State, and that includes pioneers of 18 years of age and over of whom there are 27%. In County Leitrim in the 1800s there was a pub for every 390 to 400 people, today there is a pub in that county for every 64 adult persons over 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>The reason for the rush to deregulate the licensed trade is beyond me. It is not like taxis. I do not think anybody has ever had to wait three hours in a pub to get a drink or to walk far to get one. If children are allowed to go into any corner shop or a fish and chip shop for that matter to buy drink it would be absolutely impossible to control it. A previous speaker said that 99% of publicans would not serve people if they knew they were under age. Many of the mini-markets are staffed by Chinese. In the local mini-markets where I live 90% of the staff are Chinese and they do not speak good English. One cannot expect them to question whether a person is over 18 years of age. This is an area that should be looked at carefully. I compliment and congratulate the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association on its submission to the commission. It is an excellent submission and I agree with every word of it. I hope the commission takes it on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>These are significant and important issues for society. The fundamental question we should ask is why young people drink <Col N="1247" /> to excess. What is their need to go into the darker parts of parks and towns and to litter the place with beer bottles, beer cans and so on? There is a significant lack of alternative recreational amenities in society for young people. If such facilities existed we could offer our young people an alternative lifestyle, a healthier and a happier one in which they could get involved.</P>
      <P>The reality is that most of our smaller towns, particularly on the east coast, are beginning to grow. At a meeting of our council this week a group of sports people said they were unable to buy recreational land and were overrun with hundreds of extra children who wanted to get involved in their club. They had nowhere to go and we had no land to give them. At the same time there is a proposal to build one massive stadium in Dublin, costing millions of pounds. That money ought to be distributed to local communities, villages and towns which are a long way from Dublin and will not benefit from the stadium.</P>
      <P>A fundamental shift is needed in Government policy towards recreational amenities for young people, specifically girls. I note the Minister of State said that under age girls are drinking as much if not more than boys. There is a lack of interest in and support for recreational facilities for girls. The emphasis in society is towards the GAA and rugby but there is no real support for recreational amenities for young girls.</P>
      <P>Another reason people drink is lack of confidence. By getting involved in sport and community facilities young people will have more confidence in themselves and their ability to communicate and get on. If schools were properly focused and resourced young people would be happier and the need to abuse alcohol or drugs would be significantly reduced.</P>
      <P>I welcome the work done by the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association since its foundation and particularly its ongoing work. One of the reasons young people take alcohol relates to the way society is manipulated by the drinks industry and the advertising industry. Because of the Celtic tiger and a greater amount of money in the economy they have more to spend than any other age group and they are ruthlessly and effectively targeted by these industries. I do not say that lightly. The drinks industry has much to answer for. Its effective advertising campaigns, witty and funny as they may be, have an effect on young children who watch television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said the advertising code of the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland is under review and the Department is making submissions to it. The advertising industry regulates itself through the Advertising Standards Authority which is not responsible to anyone else. The Department of Health and Children should have a veto on drinks advertising. This would not constitute an abuse of privilege as the subtlety and significance of the psychological pressure placed on young people by advertisements has to be directly challenged by the State. The Department <Col N="1248" /> is the proper body to exercise a veto on these advertisements.</P>
    <P>Some may think that if advertisements only include adults they do not affect young people. One particular advertisement features children aged four or five who repeat the punch line because it is witty. However, they are repeating the golden mantra of the drinks company involved which is Budweiser, Guinness or whatever. These forces are at work in society and are having a significant and disproportionate impact. Why does Ireland have one of the highest rates of alcohol abuse among young people in Europe? The drinks industry has a significant part to play in this regard and we must insist that we control its activities.</P>
    <P>I also wish to raise the problems concerning pubs. Pubs have traditionally been a social focus. In many cases this was due to a lack of an alternative centre. Small communities need a place to which people can go. People in the television series &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo; went to the pub and pubs are a focal point for community life. I acknowledge and welcome the fact that people have somewhere to go which is warm, sociable and so on. However, calls for the deregulation of the drinks industry in Dublin city are due to the fact that so many drinkers are being ripped off by publicans. I do not drink in Dublin so I do not know the price of a pint in the city. However, the price differential is in the order of 14p or 15p per drink. Publicans are also ripping off people who buy soft drinks. One will probably pay more for a bottle of spring water than for a pint of Guinness. That is disgraceful.</P>
    <P>If the drinks industry and publicans want to have the community's respect they should make the price of alternatives to alcohol more in keeping with the cost of production. One can buy a bottle of spring water for 35p in a supermarket but one will not pay less than £1.50 for it in a pub. We must directly tackle this issue. I acknowledge the importance of the drinks industry in terms of employment and its impact on communities. However, these rip-offs must stop now.</P>
    <P>This is an important debate. Discos or pubs are the only places in which young people can meet members of the opposite sex and enjoy recreation. We must encourage, support and promote the right of people not to drink alcohol and not to be pushed into doing so by peer pressure. They should not have to resist such pressures. Alcohol abuse can have a significant impact on the lives of young people. Many of them become depressed and there is an increasing incidence of young people presenting with mental health problems as a result of alcohol abuse.</P>
    <P>This is a timely debate. The experiences we are discussing are very important but we must rule the roost. Young people must no longer be at the beck and call of ruthless advertising and drinks industries which target them for their increasing disposable incomes. This is leading to ill-health. Young people are dying between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. They are crashing <Col N="1249" /> cars into walls or other stationary objects because they are drinking too much and abusing other substances. We must put in place a more controlled environment for young people. There must also be significantly increased recreational facilities for young people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not intend that this debate would take so long but this is such a serious subject that Senators wish to comment on what is the scourge of society. I was shocked by the European reports in 1995 and by the trend which has emerged in the past year or two, the disturbing results of which are shocking.</P>
      <P>Irish teenagers are drinking more than their peers in Europe. The statistics also show that teenagers top the league in terms of drinking. This is awful news. St. Patrick's College and Berkeley College, California, carried out research which produced similar statistics. The problem will not go away unless we tackle it. I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Martin, for taking the initiative and launching the alcohol awareness campaign. However, we must assist him in every way possible to combat this awful scourge.</P>
      <P>Weekend drinking is widely acknowledged to be out of control. People, including teachers, now complain about the Monday morning syndrome. It is acknowledged that second level students have easy access to alcohol in off licences, pubs and football clubs. We must not allow this to continue.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State pointed out that, in 1998, about £1.7 billion was spent on alcohol related problems. This does not take account of the toll in human suffering and distress in the form or road accidents, crime and absenteeism. Where do we go from here and what can be done about this problem? The Minister has made a start but he will not succeed on his own. I call on health professionals, young people, parents, the drinks industry, the Garda, the media, youth leaders, teachers and self-help groups to play their part to see how we can change attitudes and reduce the consumption of alcohol.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senators' comments on an increase in the number of outlets and the deregulation of the industry. There is a link between this problem and the sale of alcohol in grocery shops and off licences. We must curb the availability of alcohol. Senator Bohan stated that there are about 150 people to every pub in Ireland. This is awful. We do not have a hope of addressing this problem unless we control the number of outlets and we all have a role to play in this regard. The problem will not go away given the number of outlets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Research undertaken by the Mater Dei Institute has proven that when alcohol is less available and less convenient to purchase, there will be less consumption. Alcohol-related problems will be lowered if we can confine the number of sale outlets. Research has also shown that young people have access to alcohol in three ways, through pubs, discos and off-licences. We should ban alco<Col N="1250" /> hol advertising and sports sponsorship by drinks manufacturers.</P>
    <P>Although I might not be thanked for doing so, I would also ban the happy hour concept which has an adverse impact on the social fabric of society. Many people on their way home will decide to avail of the happy hour from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. or from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. They drop into the pub when there are special offers available, but once one has consumed one or two drinks the night begins and it is the end of the road. This has an impact on our youth because adults are supposed to set an example. I am calling for a ban on happy hour drinking because I do not like the concept and I never did.</P>
    <P>Parents can make a difference through improved supervision of their children and more liaison with other parents. Individuals who cynically serve under age drinkers should be reported. Parents have a big role to play in the community and the public should be alerted to the scale of the problem. Parents, teachers, gardaí and others in a position of influence should use their combined energies to object to the renewal of licences for offending establishments. This should also apply to venues used for school events &ndash; I refer to debs balls, many of which have become overnight events.</P>
    <P>How can we intervene on behalf of young people? Although not currently practising, I am a trained teacher and guidance counsellor, and still have regular contact with members of those professions. In many of our discussions it appears that many parents have abdicated their responsibilities. In doing so they have increased the pressure on others to do their job for them.</P>
    <P>The concept of invulnerability is one that has not been aired too often, but it is relevant to young people who think they can do what they like. They are fearless and think they can take risks without any adverse effects. In my experience, intervention in such cases has not been used often enough. Whenever we are counselling young people we should take into consideration the concept of invulnerability which means they have no sense of responsibility. Such intervention should be brought to the fore in our schools. I would also target parents to help young people. Because of the way of life today, where both parents are out working, young people are left on their own and have an unsupervised space between 4 o'clock and 6 o'clock in the evening, during which they have time on their hands. That is where the problem starts and that is why we need a co-ordinated programme to help such young people.</P>
    <P>Local authorities also have a role to play in introducing by-laws to deal with under age drinking on open spaces, including public roads. That problem is not highlighted enough. A penalty system should be introduced whereby if young people offend, their parents will be made to pay a £1,000 fine. Such a measure could act as a key deterrent to under age drinking if enough people were engaged in monitoring the problem. The <Col N="1251" /> community is the real stakeholder in this matter. On many occasions, parents have phoned me in mid-afternoon to tell me that under age drinking is taking place after 4 o'clock or during the summer when the examinations are over. Fifth year students may have nowhere to go from mid-June to the end of June while they are waiting to begin summer jobs, so they have time on their hands. They find themselves hanging around in open spaces and public roadways. Most of them have been caught with drink.</P>
    <P>We need more monitoring patrols by local gardaí which would put the fear of God into young people. This can be done in co-operation with schools and parents who have a huge responsibility to intervene on behalf of young people faced with such a problem. I do not know if we will be successful, but we have to combat under age drinking. There are no easy solutions but I have put forward some suggestions for dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the idea of a training programme for those who work in licensed premises, but I wonder whether we are targeting identity cards sufficiently. The ID card system is workable in some areas but not in others. When a pub becomes crowded, bar staff do not have the time to check if under age drinkers are on the premises. The owners of licensed premises are responsible people who must train their staff to tackle the problem by watching customers as they come in.</P>
    <P>We must not knock the Minister who will do everything he can. The problem must be tackled in the community at large by methods which include the use of identity cards. The problem can be resolved by working together in a co-ordinated way. I congratulate the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association whose submission I have read. The association's recommendations, to which I have devoted much thought, will be taken into consideration. The churches are in the background and I acknowledge their work. We all have a role to play in dealing with this issue, and much remains to be done. Everyone should be prepared to act as leaders in their areas in dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>Young people should cop on, but communities had better provide interesting pursuits for them which do not have to be drink-oriented. We should incorporate into the curriculum leisure activities to enable young people to develop their social and artistic attributes. I do not buy the idea that drinking is the only way young people can improve their confidence; it should not be. Today the Seanad has made an impact. We have taken the lead in deciding how best we can combat this scourge in society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a joy to hear Senator Ormonde speak with such vigour and enthusiasm. She said that the solution to this problem is in our own hands, as individuals, family members and communities. It is time we faced up to the fact that passing further legislation is not the way <Col N="1252" /> to tackle under age drinking. I cannot say that often enough. Legislation is in place and it seems to be working to the extent that it can do so. It was interesting to hear Senator Bohan speaking about this matter. Making further inroads into the problem demands an attack on attitudes but we cannot expect legislation to do that.</P>
      <P>I was sceptical about the new legislation when it was introduced last year. Senator Bohan will not like to hear me saying this but, given the strength of the publicans' lobby, I doubted that it would ever be passed. I was wrong about that because the Bill was enacted, and I congratulate the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, for sticking rigidly to his views, particularly in regard to under age drinking.</P>
      <P>I then transferred my scepticism to whether the new law would ever be implemented, and whether we would ever see pubs temporarily losing their licences because they were caught serving under age drinkers. It seems, however, that I was wrong about that point as well. The Garda Síochána assures me that the law is working and that it is being used. Some pubs have already had their licences temporarily suspended and further cases are in the pipeline. It was explained to me as being somewhat like the use of the &ldquo;sin bin&rdquo; in rugby matches. When the only sanction a referee had available to him was to send off a player, he tended to use that sanction very rarely and only in the most serious cases. However, when he has available the lesser sanction of the sin bin, where a player was sent off just for a few minutes, that sanction is used more often. The analogy with pubs is that when the only sanction was to take away a licence, it was not used very often, but the ability to close down a pub temporarily is like the idea of the sin bin. It is a lesser punishment and, because it is not quite so drastic, it can be used more often. It does not permanently deprive the owner of his livelihood or his family investment.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that we could improve the legislation further, but one of the obstacles is the absence of a statutory identity card system. This has been discussed previously and I am not entirely sure that it has to be established on a statutory basis. There may be another way of implementing it. However, there seems to be an enormous resistance, on civil liberty grounds, to bringing in such a scheme, though national identity cards are of course an unquestioned part of life in most of the other EU member states.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is time we did a cost-benefit analysis on this issue to evaluate the gains and losses. If we did, we might well find that the many advantages of an identity card system would outweigh the disadvantages. Maybe we should consider it more fully. For as long as we go on without identity cards, we are putting an unfair and unrealistic burden on those in the front line who have to police age restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should declare an interest here because, as a retailer, I am bound by the law against selling to <Col N="1253" /> under age customers, not only alcohol but also cigarettes. We have wrestled with this problem for almost as long as I have been in business. In the absence of an identity card, one has to judge whether a person is under age. Judging a person's age is a notoriously difficult thing to do and it becomes an additional embarrassment when the person doing the judging is also young.</P>
    <P>We decided to approach this by setting our age limit well above the legal limit, at 25 instead of 18 &ndash; Senator Bohan has already referred to the problems which this can present &ndash; but we soon found out that our customers would not stand for that and we changed it slightly some years ago. The signs in our supermarkets now read: &ldquo;If you are lucky enough to look under 25, we need to have proof of your age before selling you alcohol.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have soldiered along with this approach for many years now, despite the warnings of a friend who takes delight in assuring me that it is unconstitutional. Senator Bohan referred to the equal status legislation, but I do not think that is a major difficulty. However, it may be sailing somewhat too close to the wind under the Equal Status Act, which makes people more aware of the rights they have in regard to age discrimination.</P>
    <P>For as long as we refuse to face up to the identity card issue, any under age law will be a comparatively blunt instrument. However, blunt though it may be, it is clearly a very useful mechanism. There are cases where a publican simply cannot be unaware that certain customers are under age and the law now has an effective way of penalising publicans who serve such young people.</P>
    <P>I believe that the law helps to strengthen attitudes. Some years ago, when we were travelling in the USA, an air hostess refused to serve my son a glass of wine with his meal because he was then under 21 years of age. I was most impressed to find that standards were being maintained so strictly in that situation.</P>
    <P>As I suggested earlier, we are wrong to expect that we can cope with the problem through our laws alone. There is a massive attitude problem and I am not sure how we can handle it. In recent years, it has become the norm for young people to drink together. They drink in large groups and they often drink to excess. The phenomenon of &ldquo;binge drinking&rdquo; is, as far as I know, something new, within the past decade or so. I believe it is a factor in the frightening escalation of violent behaviour among young people.</P>
    <P>From earlier contributions to this debate, including Senator Ormonde's figures, it seems that we are experiencing a different trend in Ireland than elsewhere. Visitors from the US have told me they find it incredible to see so many young people drinking in Ireland, to a far greater extent than in the US. Perhaps the hard truth is that our society has not taken sufficient care about the way we have relaxed our norms of behaviour. At one time, parental control was strict, especially in the matter of drinking. It was <Col N="1254" /> common for people not to take a drink until they were 21. In recent years, we have become more permissive in our attitudes towards the behaviour of young people. Unfortunately, for some people that has gone to the point where parents think that the proper thing to do is to exercise no control at all.</P>
    <P>I remember when I first started going to France being surprised and somewhat shocked to find that young children were allowed to drink wine. When I got to know France a little better, I realised that young people were actually being taught how to drink responsibly and moderately. They were given wine only as part of a meal, they were never given more than one glass and often the wine was well diluted. They were taught to regard alcohol as part of daily life, to be used carefully and in moderation. Such an approach is better than holding out alcohol to young people as a forbidden fruit which, of course, creates a desire to have it. It is certainly a better approach than allowing young teenagers to drink without controls, or ignoring what one knows is going on once they are out of the house.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example of how pervasive our attitudes have become in this regard. Within the past few days, I heard a radio commercial that shocked me because of the attitude it reflected. It was not a commercial for alcohol. It was selling mobile phones, using a young male voice. I regret that I have not got the acting ability to portray the authentic accent.</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resurces (Mr. Byrne): Perhaps the Senator would have a go at it? </P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do my best. It ran as follows: &ldquo;Ah, it was a brilliant night. There was such a good crowd. You should have come out. Mark was given a load. Aoife got thrown out of the toilet and Nicola fell asleep while some lad was chatting her up. What? No, we lost Helen somewhere with somebody else. And then we all went back to a party. Yeh, and then we could not get a taxi and I ended up walking home.&rdquo;  That was delivered by a young male voice on the radio, and it was not selling alcohol. At first, I thought perhaps it was an advertisement to warn against the pitfalls of alcohol, but it turned out to be an advertisement for mobile phones.</P>
      <P>Running underneath all this is the assumption that the norm for a young person's great night out is for a crowd of them to get drunk to the point of unconsciousness. This is taken as so commonplace that, when I complained about the commercial to the chief executive of the company concerned, I was told it had been passed by RTÉ, that it had nothing to do with drink and that nobody else had complained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to single out that company in particular because that is typical of a very widely-held attitude within our community. We should face up to the reality that we are not going to make major inroads into the problem of young <Col N="1255" /> people drinking, until we decide to do something about the attitudes which tolerate and, indeed, encourage such behaviour. Meanwhile, as we wait for attitudes to change, we could do something concrete about the identity card scheme. The law may not provide a complete solution but it can help greatly. I wish to refer briefly to Fr. Bernard McGuckian's proposals on behalf of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association. It is recommended that to combat drunk driving the maximum permitted blood content level for drivers be reduced from 80 milligrammes to 50 milligrammes; that the EU Commission's recommendation on young and inexperienced drivers be adopted and that a permitted blood content level of 20 milligrammes be introduced in respect of them and drivers of two wheeled motor vehicles; that penalties for drunk driving be increased substantially and should include the mandatory loss of one's licence and that to encourage the sale of soft drinks &ndash; this will be of particular interest to Senator O'Dowd &ndash; and non-alcoholic beers, a ministerial order be issued requiring that the percentage mark-up on these products should not exceed that which applies on a glass of stout.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Pioneer and Total Abstinence Association on the 25 recommendations it has put forward. A number of these are worthy of consideration and many of them are not necessarily to do with changes in the law; they involve changes in attitudes. Let us ensure that we strengthen the law &ndash; we may have strengthened it enough already &ndash; but let us also ensure that we change our attitude to alcohol and the problems it creates.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Byrne, who is a pioneer. That is appropriate given the nature of the debate.</P>
      <P>When I was young, one of my favourite pastimes was to watch a little dog following its tail. It used to run in circles and I wondered what it would achieve because it was getting nowhere. It is particularly important that the concerns that have been expressed in recent weeks with regard to the problem of under age drinking are not diluted and that we do not end up in a <i>cul-de-sac</i> or, like the dog to which I referred, that we do not merely chase our tails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are faced with a serious problem which is on the verge of becoming an emergency and our response must be appropriate. However, it will not be appropriate if we merely seek to find scapegoats because everyone can fall into that category where this matter is concerned. I make that point in the context of the recommendations put forward by the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association. In recent weeks I was fortunate to be invited by the association to address its national ball in Tralee. I was particularly impressed not only by the number and calibre of people present, but also by the number of young <Col N="1256" /> people in attendance. I was struck by their ability to express their views in a generous manner, which prompted me to think that they could provide leadership to everyone on this matter.</P>
    <P>If I was to ask the Minister of State to convey to the Government one message among others, it would be that it should respond in a positive way to the application for the funding by the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association. Perhaps the association, which already has the necessary structures in place, could be given £1 million per year. There is no doubt that we need the services of the association.</P>
    <P>In the past, Irish people were seen as drunkards and layabouts. The enemies of Ireland were quick to seize on that image. For example, in the old <i>Punch</i> cartoons we were depicted as gorillas and shown as people who were less than civilised. People might believe that image was superficial, but there is no question that it took root. It took a long time to undermine that image and dismantle the hostility which promoted it. There are still echoes of that image today. If one travels to certain parts of the world, it is still not unusual for someone to shake hands and make a remark about the Irish being very good drinkers.</P>
    <P>The Pioneer Total Abstinence Association was largely responsible for destroying the image to which I refer. It was successful in doing so because it was well organised and focused and had at its disposal a number of good leaders. The association went well beyond targeting the problem of alcohol. Everyone is aware that Irish people were deprived, particularly in the aftermath of the Famine when they were in an abyss of despair out of which it would be difficult to claw their way back up into the light. However, the fact that we were able to tackle the problems posed by alcohol and provide people with an ideal by which to live was enormously helpful. Many other positive developments followed in the intervening years.</P>
    <P>We were not obliged to wait for the publication of a European study before realising that a problem exists with regard to under age drinking. Almost 12 months ago I spoke on the Order of Business and quoted statistics from a study carried out in a particular part of the country which covered two issues &ndash; alcohol and other addictive substances. The study to which I referred indicated that an alarming number of young people had consumed alcohol regularly or had experimented with drugs. It is not really possible to separate the two. People become excited about drug abuse and rightly so. Reports about it appear in the newspapers and public representatives and community leaders comment on it. However, it must be remembered that alcohol is an addictive drug and its use has implications for everyone, not just the people who imbibe.</P>
    <P>Those who are addicted and who require addictive substances must have the wherewithal to purchase them. There are people who, in the past, felt comfortable living on their own in isolated areas. However, six or seven years ago a <Col N="1257" /> spate of attacks on people who were vulnerable took place. We saw pictures of them on television after they were attacked and we could not believe that this had happened in a civilised country. I refer to pictures of 80 or 90 year olds whose faces had been pulverised by thugs. We can put in place numerous community constraints and provide those who have been attacked with any number of facilities, but we will never allay their fears. They have lost the quality of life they had previously earned. The same applies to young people and tourists who have been attacked and mugged. These examples illustrate the fact that the harm caused by alcohol extends beyond those who use it to other people.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about dealing with drug and alcohol abuse, our reaction to them must be definite, focused, united and strong in nature. We must involve everyone in that reaction. I have been reading editorials in provincial newspapers from around the country and I have never seen such unanimity on this issue before now. Some of those who regard themselves as progressive are expressing reservations about this age old problem.</P>
    <P>When the Seanad takes statements on any subject on Thursday afternoons, the debate would normally wind down before 3 p.m. However, there is a long list of speakers who have already or who wish to express their concerns about this matter. They come from all walks of life and represent different political parties. Representatives of the licensed trade, parents, medical professionals and business people have spoken and all have said the same things. In many ways we reflect the general consensus in the country. If that be the case and we allow this opportunity to pass, we will have a problem.</P>
    <P>This subject has been debated in society many times and we have debated it in this House on several occasions but there is one definite difference on this occasion. People have heard the alarm bells. They now want to see the fire engine and they want us to head towards the fire, the source of the problem. The community will not thank us, as public representatives, when there is such support behind this effort, if we do not respond in a very definite manner.</P>
    <P>I would like to return again to the pioneers, and I am glad to see their representatives here today. We can talk about the image of the pioneers, the GAA and many other positive groupings in society but the pioneers offer something which I suggest is at the root of any solution we will find to this problem, and that is that we have to appeal to the idealism in young people. The pioneers have offered us a heady cocktail of pragmatism and spirituality and if adults are prepared to show that they have confidence in young people, young people will respond to that confidence.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in calling for more legislation but I would add two more concepts to legislation &ndash; one is education and the other is the challenge to which I refer. If we put all the legislation in place and give young people a goal <Col N="1258" /> so that they can take back control of their own lives from the pushers, purveyors and peers, they will respond. Has anyone ever seen a young person who wanted to become successful in sport but who was not prepared to give up their time or divorce themselves from their peers while training to bring out the very best in themselves? I was on the Pat Kenny show this morning speaking about another issue along the same lines. There comes a time in society when it is not politically correct to do something but it is politically correct to ignore something. What happens as a result of that? When people do not put their heads above the parapet they allow the quality of life to diminish until there is a blight which is corrosive and which eats away at the very roots of society.</P>
    <P>I could have used the 15 minutes available to me to talk about legislation. We have legislation and we will have more legislation but I suggest we should take the leadership from the pioneers, give them all the support they require and, at the same time, have the confidence in young people to challenge them to be different and not to ruin their lives.</P>
    <P>I watched a television programme recently on which young people said that when they were out of school, they worked at night in McDonald's and various places where they could earn £90 in two or three nights. When they were asked what they did with that money, they said they spent it on drink at the weekend. When those young people get older and look back at the lost years, they will be very disillusioned at the lack of leadership provided to them.</P>
    <P>I realise I have gone over my time, and I am grateful for that opportunity, but I will be very disappointed if we do not act immediately and respond to the spirit, energy and concern which has been expressed here for several hours, and which mirrors the concerns in society, when the opportunity exists. It may not come as quickly or as easily again.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on under age drinking. There were a number of meetings in the House today and I missed out on a number of excellent contributions on this matter. As one who is totally committed to the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association and who has been involved all my life with young people through the promotion of schemes and the development of games in various parts of the country, it is only right that I make a small contribution on this important subject.</P>
      <P>A report appeared recently in the national newspapers which stated that Irish teenagers in the 15 to 16 years age category were the worst binge drinkers in Europe. That was not another country having a go at Irish people. The report was produced by the World Health Organisation and the Government and all elected Members must take serious note of that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To find out the reasons for this problem we have to look at advertising standards because <Col N="1259" /> there is much advertising of alcohol. We could also look at sponsorship by drink companies and the reasons major sporting organisations use those companies. I realise it is for financial gain but sponsorship should be outside the control of drink companies. We had a problem with advertising by cigarette companies but much of that is now gone.</P>
    <P>I recently read a report which stated that the amount of money spent on alcohol here annually is £1.7 billion. The country can ill afford to over-indulge in alcohol. Much could be done with that amount of money in terms of developments for young people. We are talking about under age drinking but there are serious problems in many homes as a result of alcohol. Somebody referred earlier to young people reaching their full potential, particularly on the sporting field. Many young people dropped out of sport at 16, 17 and 18 years of age because they got involved in drinking. They were unable to keep pace with those who were not involved in that practice.</P>
    <P>When we go to a reception there is usually wine offered but if one is a pioneer, what does one do? We have to stand there with one hand as long as the other because in many cases one cannot even get a drink of water. People who promote receptions for whatever reason should understand that many people do not take alcoholic drink and they should prepare for that.</P>
    <P>We recognise the contribution of the many thousands of members of the Pioneers Total Abstinence Association and the way they promote the association at second level. The No Name Clubs, which have about 17,000 members, are also doing an excellent job throughout the country. Those organisations are playing their part but what are we doing to influence those young people? Are we taking the hard decisions to ensure that alcohol is not freely available to them?</P>
    <P>I was involved with under age GAA teams. At minor level some years ago, there might be one or two people taking a drink. The situation is now that drinking is at under 14 level or younger. That is sad. Where are we going? What can we do?</P>
    <P>Our young people are the best in the world, but when some take alcohol they are not sure what they are doing and become involved in serious problems. We talk about car accidents and young people driving. Cars do not cause accidents. The people driving them do. Health board statistics show that young people are filling hospital accident and emergency units, particularly at weekends. Something must be done to reduce the risk of young people getting involved with alcohol.</P>
    <P>We are overboard in allowing the extension of opening hours in licensed premises and discos. People can leave a public house and move on to a disco to consume alcohol to the small hours of the morning. This must be dealt with. At one time young people drank on a Saturday night but now it is Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. We <Col N="1260" /> can see the consequences for young people in their performance in school and work. We are facing a major problem and must be prepared to decrease the number of pubs. Where a pub is closed, leave it closed. No one is short of a drink or thirsty for the want of a public house.</P>
    <P>I want to read a poem about a young person who could be anyone's son or daughter. It is something that could happen to anyone of us.</P>
    <P>I went to a party, Mum, and</P>
    <P>Remembered what you said.</P>
    <P>You told me not to drink, Mum so</P>
    <P>I had a coke instead.</P>
    <P>I felt so proud of myself, Mum, the</P>
    <P>Way you said I would,</P>
    <P>That I didn't drink and drive, Mum,</P>
    <P>Though some friends said I should.</P>
    <P>I made the healthy choice, Mum, </P>
    <P>And advice to me was right</P>
    <P>As the party finally ended, Mum,</P>
    <P>And the kids drove out of sight.</P>
    <P>I got into my car, Mum, sure to get</P>
    <P>Home in one piece,</P>
    <P>I never knew what was coming,</P>
    <P>Mum, something I expected least.</P>
    <P>Now I'm lying on the pavement,</P>
    <P>Mum, and I hear the policeman say,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The kid that caused this crash was drunk.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mum, his voice seems far away.</P>
    <P>My own blood's all around me,</P>
    <P>Mum, as I try hard not to cry</P>
    <P>I can hear the paramedic say,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This girl is going to die.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I'm sure the guy had no idea,</P>
    <P>Mum, while he was flying high,</P>
    <P>Because he chose to drink and</P>
    <P>Drive, Mum, now I have to die.</P>
    <P>So why do people do it, Mum,</P>
    <P>Knowing that it ruins lives?</P>
    <P>And now the pain is cutting me,</P>
    <P>Mum, like a hundred stabbing knives.</P>
    <P>Tell sister not to be afraid, Mum,</P>
    <P>Tell Daddy to be brave,</P>
    <P>And when I get to Heaven, Mum,</P>
    <P>Put &lsquo;Daddy's Girl' on my grave.</P>
    <P>Someone should have taught him, Mum, </P>
    <P>that it's wrong to drink and drive.</P>
    <P>Maybe if his parents had, Mum,</P>
    <P>I'd be still alive.</P>
    <P>My breath is getting shorter, Mum,</P>
    <P>I'm getting really scared.</P>
    <P>These are my final moments,</P>
    <P>Mum, and I'm so unprepared.</P>
    <P>I wish that you could hold me,</P>
    <P>Mum, as I lie here and die.</P>
    <P>I wish that I could say I love you,</P>
    <P>Mum, so I love you and good-bye.</P>
    <P>That touching poem is something I hope many young people will read and take on board before they go out at weekends. If they did they would realise that although they may be in fine form going out, when they take alcohol they do not know the consequences and are unable to control what happens.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> This was an excellent opportunity to speak, as many said. I thank the Minister of State for coming here. He is a pioneer and is prepared to listen to the contributions of Members. We hope that together we can influence young people through the views and suggestions expressed today.</P>

This matter must be taken seriously. As I said, it is time to call a stop. We must see what can be done. People suggested ways of stopping the tide of under age drinking. The ID card was mentioned. Parents must take responsibility. Education has a role as has the Garda and Departments.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Farrell for putting this matter on the agenda. His views are well known. The Government will take note of what was said.

The tide is moving in the right direction &ndash;&ldquo;There is a tide in the affairs of men which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.&rdquo;  The tide is right and we should encourage young people to give up drink.

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to discuss the need for the Minister for Education and Science to consider lowering the starting age for compulsory schooling, to encourage at an early age a pattern of regular school attendance, especially in disadvantaged areas. I remember the debates we had in this House about a year ago on the Education (Welfare) Bill, which set up a new structure to deal with the problem of non-attendance at school. Perhaps the Minister will fill us in on the progress that has been made in implementing that legislation. One of its provisions was to raise the age at which a person can legally leave the education system. We did not pay much attention to the possible need to lower the legal starting age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My attention has recently been drawn to the fact that the starting age is also a problem, especially in disadvantaged areas. Educational disadvantage starts early; too many children arrive already disadvantaged on their first day in <Col N="1262" /> school, and then try to catch up with more fortunate children. The early start programme is important because it aims to attack the problem of disadvantage at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>I had a letter recently from a teacher in Tallaght, who is deeply involved in the early start programme. She works in St. Thomas's junior school and informed me of the attendance problem there. There is no attendance officer to deal with the problem. At present, the legal school-going age is six, but the law is out of date. To combat educational disadvantage, St. Thomas's operates the early start programme, which means that children start going there at the age of three. I was unaware of that until the teacher informed me.</P>
    <P>The school also has a reduced pupil-teacher ratio and is given extra money to combat disadvantage. It is a waste of money, however, if children do not attend the school. Children who are not at school fail young and then turn away from the system. The cycle of disadvantage thus starts at the age of three because children, through no fault of their own, are not at school.  </P>
    <P>The teacher drew my attention to the problems created for the programme by the general culture of non-attendance at school that is prevalent in the whole area. The general issue is precisely the one the Education (Welfare) Act is designed to address. The problem in these areas is that there can be no policing of school attendance of three and four year olds, because of course they are not legally compelled to be at school. My correspondent suggests, not unreasonably, that the extra resources put into the early start programme are largely being wasted because of the attendance problem.</P>
    <P>There is a gap here that we should try to put right. One could argue that we should attack the attendance problem right at the start of the education process. If non-attendance is an issue for three to five year olds, it is no wonder it becomes a major problem when they are older. We may assume that the legal starting age is a quaint anachronism, as all children are attending school by five at the latest. I argue that the legal starting age is a real problem, as it stands in the way of the early start programme being fully effective in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to this issue because I would like the Minister for Education and Science to do two things. He should think about reducing the legal starting age to a level where it starts to engage with reality. I would also like him to think about whether there is a need for special treatment in dealing with the attendance problem in relation to very young children. I have seen notes from a meeting that recently took place in Tallaght. The notes say that non-attendance at school is an issue which should concern all statutory agencies, rather than being viewed as a school problem.</P>
    <P>School attendance is an indicator of wider problems, both in the family and the wider community. A large percentage of children do not attend school, for no apparent reason. There are a number of children, however, whose non-<Col N="1263" /> attendance results from severe family problems. In countries like Sweden, school attendance is linked to child benefit, and therefore loss of child benefit can be a deterrent. This reminds us that something can be done. The structures created by the Education (Welfare) Act are geared to the circumstances of older children. Perhaps the Minister could find room for a pilot programme to experiment with ways of encouraging better attendance among very young children, especially in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Under the early start programme, children are taught from the age of three. This is wonderfuI, except for the attendance problem. If the Minister is looking for an area to carry out a pilot programme, I suggest he could hardly pick a better place than Tallaght. The letter I received, which I can show to the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, shows that some parents, teachers and schools are committed to solving this problem. Tallaght would be an ideal place to see if it is possible to do something. The cost would not be very high, but the benefits could be huge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Senator Quinn has raised this issue. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, regrets that he cannot be here to answer personally.</P>
      <P>Although children in Ireland are not obliged to attend school until the age of six, most children commence primary school and attend infant classes from the September following their fourth birthday. Thus what is commonly regarded as pre-school education in other European countries &ndash; education for children aged four and five &ndash; is provided free of charge by the State in our primary schools. In addition to the provision of infant classes in national schools, the Government supports a number of pre-school initiatives aimed at children who are disadvantaged and children who have special needs. These initiatives include the early start pre-school pilot programme, the Rutland Street pre-school project, pre-schools for Traveller children and pilot pre-school provision for autistic children.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science has recently announced proposals for a nationwide pre-school service for children with autism. His Department is currently working on the detailed arrangements for introducing such a service. I am sure the House will appreciate there is an extensive range of supports already in place for early education. The Minister accepts the need to build on this and to focus more resources on children who are disadvantaged. The White Paper on Early Childhood Education, Ready to Learn, sets out a comprehensive strategy for the development of early education for all children aged up to six, particularly focusing on disadvantaged children and children with special needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science is proposing action on a wide range of issues, including the promotion of quality of provision, measures to facilitate and encourage parental involvement in children's early education, and the develop<Col N="1264" /> ment of a system of evaluation to determine whether providers meet quality standards and to assist them in doing so. The Government is fully committed to implementing the policies set out in the White Paper, and a total of £74 million is being provided under the national development plan for the implementation of the White Paper in the period up to 2006. Implementation will be phased and done in consultation with those involved in early childhood education.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science recently received proposals from third level institutions for a pilot project to develop early childhood education, in line with the objectives of the White Paper. It is envisaged that the project will include the development of early education quality standards in relation to equipment and materials, staff qualifications, training, learning objectives, methodologies and curriculum. The pilot project will examine the development of a support framework to encourage compliance with quality standards by early education providers, and the co-ordination and enhancement of early education initiatives for disadvantaged children and children with special needs. A programme of research and development through which best practice in curriculum, teaching methodology and parent involvement may be implemented and evaluated will also be commissioned.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science is currently engaged in discussions with the relevant institutions and hopes to be in a position to make further announcements about future developments in early education soon. Tackling educational disadvantage is a priority of the Government and over £400 million has been allocated under the national development plan for various programmes to address it. Early intervention is a key principle underlying the Government's approach to countering the problem.</P>
    <P>While there are no plans to lower the compulsory school age, I can assure this House that in implementing the White Paper on Early Childhood Education the Minister, Deputy Woods, will give particular attention to developing and supporting initiatives for children who are disadvantaged or those who have special needs.</P>
    <P>Promoting regular school attendance is also a key element in the Government's strategy to reduce disadvantage. As the House will be aware, the enactment of the Education Welfare Act was a major priority of the Government and the Minister will shortly announce the establishment of the national educational welfare board. The board will be given a lead role in promoting regular attendance at school and in addressing the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. I hope that gives the Senator hope. I will bring his suggestion about a pilot programme to the attention of the Minister.</P>

      <P>This issue is important in terms of transport in the west. The Minister for Public Enterprise is not here this evening but I am glad the Minister of State is here because the airport about which I speak is in his constituency.</P>
      <P>On 12 January the Minister of State, I and others were invited to Knock Airport for the inauguration of a new service between Knock Airport and Dublin Airport. We were all delighted about this new service which was to begin on 18 January. However, due to industrial relations problems in the company, Aer Arann, the service was not put in place until 15 February. The service was established because it was given a public service subvention by the State. In other words, the Department of Public Enterprise underwrites losses incurred by the company operating this service. This means the company cannot lose.</P>
      <P>The contract for the service was that there would be a flight from Knock Airport to Dublin at 7 a.m. and a return flight at 7 p.m. each day, which would take approximately one hour. It is an excellent idea because Knock Airport is probably the best regional airport in the country. It has two services each day across the Channel, one to London and one to the British midlands. The one disadvantage was that it did not have a service to the capital but that was put right.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the role played by the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke. We lobbied her strongly to seek EU permission for the public service subvention to establish this flight because an operator would not take the risk of establishing the service on a daily basis and then making losses for two or three years before making a profit.  </P>
      <P>What has been delivered has fallen far short of the contract the company signed with the Department of Public Enterprise. It honoured its part of the bargain to provide the subvention. I am not sure of the figures because they have been difficult to obtain but more than 30% of the scheduled flights have been cancelled without notice. I turned up at Knock Airport on three occasions at 6.30 a.m. to get the 7 a.m. flight to Dublin but I was told at the last minute that the flight was cancelled. There was no good reason that the aircraft was not able to take off or land. Knock Airport has category one instrument landing equipment which means all modern airlines can land and take off in adverse weather conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company is reluctant to give answers to the questions put to it about the service or the cancellations. However, we are entitled to answers because public money is involved. If the company which has this contract is not willing or is unable to honour the terms of the contract, it must be given to someone else. What negotiations, if any, has the Minister or her officials had with the company operating the flight? Has any reason been given by the company for the cancellations? What plans does the company have, if it intends to continue with the contract, for improving the service? I understand the contract allows it to have a cancellation rate of 2% in any operating year. I may <Col N="1266" /> be overstating or understating the facts, but at least 25% of the scheduled flights have been cancelled.</P>
    <P>This issue is damaging to Knock Airport which has been a wonderful development in the west. It is one of the most essential elements of the transport infrastructure in the region. Every summer it brings in thousands of tourists from locations in Germany, Switzerland and other places. There was a weekly service to Amsterdam last summer and this will be expanded this summer with the provision of chartered flights on a weekly basis which will start in May and end in October. The one essential element which is needed is a daily link with the capital. One of the problems experienced by Waterford Airport was that it lost its link with the capital, which can be a fatal blow to a small regional airport.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Public Enterprise, although I am a member of the Opposition and I could say otherwise. I had much correspondence with her, as I am sure had the Minister of State who is a Deputy for the constituency of Mayo. We all support the airport at Knock. We were lobbied to seek the public service subvention for the service which was granted. The EU had to be convinced that the Government could pay it and I have no doubt that involved difficult negotiations. The public service subvention was put in place, advertisements were placed for the contract and when this company tendered for it, it was granted it. We hoped and expected the contract would be fully delivered but, unfortunately, it was not.</P>
    <P>Does the company have enough airplanes to carry out the service? Do the airplanes have proper navigation equipment on board which will allow them to land in difficult weather conditions? We are often told at the last minute that the weather conditions are not right or there are technical difficulties. Other airlines operate out of Knock Airport on the same days when similar weather conditions prevail and they do not seem to have any trouble taking off or landing.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister of State's response to this urgent issue. I do not have any doubt he will agree that the current service is disappointing for the dozens of people who turn up every morning. It appears to run at 75% occupancy every day. I was at Dublin Airport on a Friday evening two weeks ago because I wanted to travel to Knock. However, the service was cancelled at the last minute and there were at least 30 people waiting for it. They were not well treated by the people representing the airline. Information was not dispensed and when a bus was eventually provided to take us home, the journey took four hours. That is not a good service. There is a great sense of community and regional support for the airport which is run on a shoestring. There is much voluntary effort to ensure it stays open. However, it is being damaged by this type of poor service. There is a clear demand for this service to operate every day, yet the operator is not keeping the terms of the contract.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1267" /> I thank the Minister of State for taking this motion this evening and I look forward to his reply.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Connor for raising this issue on the Adjournment. Unfortunately, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, cannot be here to take it.</P>
      <P>Aer Arann Express holds the contract from the Department of Public Enterprise to provide the Public Service Obligation, PSO, air service between Knock and Dublin and I am aware that certain difficulties have been experienced since the service began on 18 January this year.</P>
      <P>Aer Arann is contracted to provide one daily return flight between Knock and Dublin and the PSO specifications for this route required an early morning departure from Knock to Dublin and an evening return from Dublin to Knock. By agreement with Aer Arann and in consultation with the authorities at Knock Airport, the flight schedule provides for a 7 a.m. departure from Knock on weekdays and 10 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday. The return flight departure time from Dublin is 7 p.m. In line with the specifications for the Knock PSO service, Aer Arann operates the route with a 36 seater Shorts 360 aircraft. This is similar to the aircraft type used on three of the other PSO routes, namely, Sligo, Donegal and Derry.</P>
      <P>For most of the first month of the PSO contract, Aer Arann could not provide the agreed service for early morning departures from Knock. This was due to an industrial dispute at Knock Airport which had nothing to do with the airline. The dispute at the airport between management and employees concerned the level of extra payments for working outside normal airport working hours, something which was needed in order to accommodate the PSO flight schedule. Throughout that dispute, however, Aer Arann provided a midday service to Knock. Following resolution of the industrial dispute at the airport, the normal service, as per the PSO requirements, was provided by Aer Arann from 13 February.</P>
      <P>In the 63 day period since the start of the contract up to yesterday, 21 March, Aer Arann operated 60 flights between Knock and Dublin and 57 flights between Dublin and Knock. The majority of the nine flight cancellations in that period were due to adverse weather conditions at Knock Airport. I notice that the Senator was unfortunate to be there on three of these occasions. Most of the instances where delays were experienced in flight schedules were also due to weather factors. Senators will appreciate that passenger safety is a top priority and when weather conditions are below minimum levels, flights must be cancelled, diverted or delayed as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreed level of subvention for operating the Knock/Dublin PSO route is £4.04 million over the three year period of the contract. This breaks down as £1.27 million for the first year, £1.34 mill<Col N="1268" /> ion for the second year and £1.43 million for the third year. These are maximum amounts and the actual level of subvention is established <i>ex-post</i> taking into account the costs and revenues generated by the service.</P>
    <P>As regards the permitted level of flight cancellations, the contract provides that except in cases of <i>force majeure</i> concerning weather conditions, closure of the airports, security reasons, strikes and reasons of safety, the number of flights cancelled for reasons directly attributable to the airline shall not exceed 2% of the total number of flights on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>While the Knock PSO service got off to a difficult start with the industrial dispute at the airport, Aer Arann informs the Minister that it has invested heavily in the promotion of the service. Local and national newspaper and radio advertising campaigns as well as extensive leaflet drops have been carried out. Aer Arann has also sponsored a number of local events such as the Claremorris football club draw and the company's marketing department is working with a number of local hoteliers to develop flybreak packages to the region.</P>
    <P>In order to further stimulate traffic on the Knock route, Aer Arann has introduced a promotional return fare of £50 for all passengers on all flights. This is well below what the airline is entitled to charge under its PSO contract. To date, load factors on the route have been disappointing at just 14% in February and 23% to date in March. The measures which are being taken by Aer Arann to promote greater use of the service should see an improvement in these load factors.</P>
    <P>The Department monitors the performance of all the PSO routes. In the event that the disappointing load factors experienced to date in relation to the Knock PSO service do not improve significantly, then my Department would have to review whether, for example, the flight schedule involved is the correct one for that route.</P>
    <P>The purpose of a PSO is to provide an air service, on a subsidised basis by the Exchequer, between a regional airport and Dublin in response to a local demand for such a service. If, however, that demand fails to materialise in a meaningful way on any PSO route, the essential rationale for such a PSO would have to be looked at.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. I do not find it fully satisfactory. I am amazed to find that only nine flights out of 57 were cancelled. I was extraordinarily unlucky. I am not here to make my case; this is the case that has been made to me by many business people in the west who wish to use this flight and lobbied to have it provided. There is a general feeling that it is not satisfactory and it needs to be monitored very closely. If this level of cancellation continues, the whole contract needs to be reviewed.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 27 March 2001.</P>
