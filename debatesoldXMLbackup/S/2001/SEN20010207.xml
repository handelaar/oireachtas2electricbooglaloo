      <P>I have notice from Senator Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to ensure that the crèche and pre-school in Saint Laurence O'Toole's primary school, Seville Place, Dublin 1, remains open while the school is being refurbished.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children immediately to provide funding to the Mid-Western Health Board to allow the Stella Maris nursing home in Lisdoonvarna, County Clare, to re-open.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Caffrey of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to expedite approval for the Ballina town, County Mayo, water supply scheme, stage 3, in view of <Col N="2" /> the fact that there is a serious shortfall of water in Ballina town, and there is a need for pipe replacement and a new reservoir.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cassidy of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to increase the retirement age for fire service employees.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Costello, Taylor-Quinn and Caffrey as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Costello's and Taylor-Quinn's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Caffrey may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret that I have had to rule Senator Cassidy's matter out of order on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the commissioner and staff of the Office of Public Works on the very fine refurbishment of phase one in the <Col N="3" /> Seanad Chamber. It is a credit to the craftpersons who carried out the work during the recess. The standard has to be seen to be believed. I would welcome many visits by touring groups, school tours and the public to the Seanad to witness the magnificent craftsmanship.</P>
      <P>The Order of Business is No 1, motion re Order of Business to be taken without debate; Nos. 2 and 3, messages and motion re the establishment of the joint committee on the strategic management initiative to be taken without debate; No. 4, motion re the fourth protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam regarding refugee status to be taken for 30 minutes, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed seven minutes and all other Senators not to exceed five minutes; No. 5, Broadcasting Bill, 1999 &ndash; Second Stage, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 30 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed 20 minutes, and Senators may share time; and No. 23, motion 29, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Business will be resumed thereafter if not previously concluded and conclude not later than 10 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, perhaps the Leader will allow more time for No. 4 as 30 minutes is too short. Perhaps he will extend the time to one hour and allow 12 minutes for the principals and seven minutes thereafter.</P>
      <P>I join the Leader in complimenting the Office of Public Works on the very fine job it has done on the House which is a credit to it. It is nice to be able to look out the window and see natural light coming in on our work.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate as soon as possible on the report of the Ombudsman on nursing home subventions? This is one of the most important reports published in recent years, not only because of the scandalous matter unearthed by the Ombudsman and the very forthright condemnations his report contains but also because it raises some very fundamental questions about the way in which the Oireachtas does its work and the role of the Oireachtas in ensuring the measures it passes into law are enacted in the way it was intended. It raises very serious issues about secondary legislation, the Executive and so forth. It is a fundamental document and I would like a debate on it.</P>
      <P>I do not know how to phrase this but I appeal to the Government not to appeal against the ruling in the Jamie Sinnott case. I know there is a danger. Before the Government acts on this, there are fundamental questions to be raised. It would be of benefit if both Houses of the Oireachtas had an opportunity to address not the specific case, but the wider issues involved. I will leave it with the Leader to see if he can organise something in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I express my sympathy to the family of the late Dr. Yousef Allan, the former ambassador of Palestine to this country. He was a very good friend of a great number of people in this House. <Col N="4" /> He was hugely respected and did a great job for his people and his country. He frequently attended before committees of the House. His death was sudden and untimely and I wish to convey our sympathies to his wife and to his country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the comments made about the refurbishment of the House and draw attention to the high level of craftmanship in the work of Office of Public Works displayed time and time again. It is superb and is something we can enjoy and praise. On behalf of this House it would be worthwhile if our comments were conveyed to those who carried out this work.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to start the new term on a sour note but I believe everyone in the House would share my view, irrespective of party affiliations, that the most negative image of Irish public representation was to see someone being released from Mountjoy and coming to his office in Leinster House. I do not wish to raise that particular case but I do so because we need to debate such issues in a proper way as was done in another House. People are rushed in all sorts of directions. There needs to be a calm and measured debate as to how we order our business, the standards we demand and what our authority should be in those situations. I would like to have all party agreement on a debate on how the Oireachtas can determine the conduct and the code of conduct of its Members. I ask the Leader to discuss this matter with the different groups with a view to having an agreed debate on it. It is not for the purpose of scoring political points, it is in everybody's interests. It is important that we all hold the position that there are good people in all parties and groups and it has nothing to do with individual backgrounds or whatever.</P>
      <P>The other serious issue we need to deal with in a measured way is the proposed EU reprimand to the Government which will be dealt with in a week's time. We need to have a debate on what is meant by this. It is grossly and utterly unfair to demand of Ireland the same low level of growth as others until we have the same levels of support for education, health and services. We have to spend more money in those areas before getting to a position where Europe can tell us we may not spend any more. When we are up to their level we can then look to that kind of advice from them. Similarly, workers have high expectations of taxation improvements and it would be utterly wrong and undermining if the Government were to move back from that. I would like a calm and measured debate on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also ask for a debate on the happenings in Northern Ireland. I am particularly concerned about the development of pipe bombs over the last couple of months. It is absolutely appalling and should be a matter of concern for people from all sides of all views. The RUC has taken a progressive line in dealing with it. It is an issue that reflects a deterioration in the North and we <Col N="5" /> should certainly have a debate on it in order to find our way through it and to see what the next move is likely to be in that area.</P>

      <P>I add my voice to the compliments to the staff of the Office of Public Works on the work that has been done here. To enter a caveat<i>,</i> while fantastic craftwork has been done, the choice of curtains, a dark voluptuous velvet, gives a certain dimming effect to the Chamber&mdash;</P>

      <P>On No. 1, we have traditionally opposed any time limit on the Order of Business. It is once again proposed that it be maintained at 30 minutes until Easter. We have opposed it on the basis that it is an opportunity for Senators from all sides to raise matters of concern that are relevant to the Order of Business. In the absence of another opportunity to do this, apart from the Adjournment, which is very limited, we should allow the Cathaoirleach a greater degree of flexibility.</P>
      <P>A debate of one hour's duration rather than half an hour on the Treaty of Amsterdam protocol should be allowed because if four spokespersons are to be allowed seven minutes other Seanators will be unable to contribute.</P>
      <P>I am not happy with the Leader allowing business to resume for an indefinite period after the conclusion of Private Members' Business. We should set parameters to this.</P>

      <P>Since we last met serious matters have arisen. We have lost some very important people, not least the leader of Fine Gael. I pay tribute to Deputy John Bruton for his contribution to politics and democracy. He was a magnificent leader of the main Opposition party for a period of ten years. The former President of the United States was a great friend of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Prime Minister Barak of Israel, a man of peace, has given way to a man of war, Ariel Sharon. We have also lost our good friend, Yousef Allan, the representative of Palestine for Great Britain and Ireland. We also lost a parliamentarian to Mountjoy Prison for a week. As Senator O'Toole said, that requires a debate in this House on the issue of conduct and a code of practice for all parliamentarians, a matter raised in the other House yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="6" /> The Minister for Finance has been slapped on the knuckles by the EU Commission for introducing what it considers to be an inflationary budget. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this. Most importantly, the Ombudsman's report on nursing home subventions, mentioned by Senator Manning, raises very serious questions in relation to accountability, responsibility and how we deal with care of the elderly. The report must be debated as a matter of urgency and I ask the Leader to include it on the agenda next week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in congratulating the Office of Public Works on its work in refurbishing the Chamber. It has been done to a very high standard. I hope it will not encourage people to sing arias on the Order of Business. The 30 minute time allocation to the Order of Business has worked reasonably well over several sessions. It would be sensible to reinstate it. I note, a Chathaoirleach, you have always treated it with discretion and that you have used your judgment in that regard. It would be the way to continue.</P>
      <P>I join with Senator Manning in expressing sympathy to Dr. Allan's wife and the Palestinian President and people on his untimely death. He was a very able and effective advocate on behalf of Palestine. There is no Member in either House who is not aware of the situation there through his work, night and day. He was always a cheerful presence in the Houses. His death was tragic and untimely and it was good to see the many Members from both Houses at the funeral service held in the mosque in Clonskeagh.</P>
      <P>It appears strange that a sanction by the EU Commission on the budget and the management of the economy should be issued in the context of a country that contributes no more than 1.5% to European output. It is curious that it followed on the day the new US President, Mr. Bush, said he thought the way out of an American recession was to cut taxes. Perhaps the European Commission will consider sanctioning President Bush on the basis of his statement. It would be useful to debate and tease out these issues in the House in order to demonstrate our growth rate and low level of unemployment, issues on which they might applaud us when considering the other strictures they propose to impose on us. The Minister will have a chance at Council level to rebut what has been said by the Commission.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning that the document from the Ombudsman's office on nursing homes is important. I have read it and he is correct that it raises serious issues about the role of the Oireachtas and so on. It would be useful to debate that issue in some depth.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Foolish words were said in the Swords area regarding the establishment of a house for former psychiatric patients, which probably eventually led to the vandalising of the house. Will the Leader of the House make time available to discuss last year's Inspector of Mental Hospitals report? I have been asking for <Col N="7" /> this since last April when it was published but perhaps the Leader wishes to leave it until the next report is published in April. Psychiatric patients and their relations would think we have some interest in them if we debated this topic.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to this House and tell us what progress has been made on the legislation needed to fulfil our obligations under the EU Human Rights Convention and if he proposes to sign the Rome Statute so that we can make progress towards establishing an international criminal court? The United States of America signed it before Christmas and it was thought they would be one of the last to sign it. I am sorry that we will be behind them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader make time available as soon as possible for a debate on recycling. Many local authorities are facing enormous challenges&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;on the issue of waste management. It is essential to address the issue in the House. Fine Gael has a policy which supports incineration and seems to be similar to those of us on the Government side. It is appropriate to discuss the matter in this House and to identify the strategies available in other countries and which are being proposed for this country. This will indicate the commitment of the Minister and the Government on the whole issue of waste recycling, minimisation, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senators Manning, Costello and Dardis in relation to the nursing homes subvention report, which was shocking. It raises the issue of accountability and the way in which voiceless and vulnerable people were affected. Some of these people are now dead and did not have a chance to have their rights considered.</P>
      <P>Before Christmas I asked the Leader to allow time for a debate on education for autistic children. He promised to have this issue debated and it fits in well with Senator Manning's request in relation to the Jamie Sinnott case.</P>
      <P>There must be a debate in this House on waste disposal. We have had some discussion on the issue but nothing very constructive. We must come to grips with this problem in all local authority areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on the Ombudsman's report on nursing home subventions and its wider implications. A debate on this issue is long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like time to be made available for a debate on the role of An Bord Pleanála. Despite the fact that we have new planning legislation, which is now being implemented, there are still <Col N="8" /> questions to be asked about the composition of An Bord Pleanála, including its workings, accountability and transparency. Questions are being asked as to how decisions are arrived at. I already asked for this debate. This is a necessary debate because the public at large are asking questions in this regard. This is an appropriate forum in which to have such a debate.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Office of Public Works on the magnificent change in this Chamber where we again have some clear light.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the first motion on the Order Paper relates to the Leader replying to the Order of Business not later than 30 minutes after its proposal. I wish to point out that the first four speakers on today's Order of Business took 20 minutes between them. In my opinion, Members must be economical with their contributions on the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>I support calls for a debate on nursing homes. The most significant issue relevant to this debate has not been mentioned, namely, the fact that a systematic decision was taken to subvert the will of the Oireachtas. This was done in the face of legal advice. That is the single most worrying aspect of this matter.</P>
      <P>I had understood that the debate on the Nice Summit was to have been taken today. Will the Leader inform the House when this extremely important matter will be dealt with?</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Office of Public Works on the redecoration of the Chamber. However, I have reservations about the colour used on the doors which is quite wrong. I am available for consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House, as a person with interests on the north side, convey to the relevant Minister the strong feelings of this House about the proposed continued asset stripping of cultural sites from the north side of the city? I refer to today's announcement by the board of the Abbey Theatre that it wishes to move to the Grand Canal Docks site. Those responsible for the Grand Canal Docks development have indicated that they regard the Abbey Theatre's proposed move as significant because it will provide their project with a cultural anchor. Should £80 million of taxpayers' money be spent on providing a cultural anchor on the south side which will have a negative impact on the north side and move a significant cultural asset out of the Taoiseach's constituency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Members in expressing sympathy the wife of the late Dr. Youssef Allan, Jane, who loved him dearly. Dr. Allan loved Palestine so much that the pressures of the negotiations and the problems associated with the area eventually caught up with him and led to his death at the young age of 47. He was a <Col N="9" /> friend to many people in this country, including Members and the staff of the House. He had a good relationship with the Israeli Ambassador and they discussed the problems affecting the area in a manner fitting to negotiations aimed at fostering peace and reconciliation.</P>
      <P>On a day on which there has been a change of leadership in Israel, instead of criticising what happened in the past, we must hope that Prime Minister Sharon will form a Government which can enter meaningful negotiations with the Palestinian people. What happens in the area to which I refer is not only of importance to Israelis and Palestinians, it is extremely important to people living here because it is situated quite close to Europe. If further destabilisation occurs because of a hardening of attitudes, hostilities could spread to the continent and we could find ourselves embroiled in the conflict. I hope Mr. Sharon will see that peace, not might, is the way forward.</P>
      <P>I understand there will be a debate on the Nice Summit tomorrow which will last for one hour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>We certainly will if only an hour is being set aside for a debate on the Nice Summit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wished to suggest that we might spend more time addressing that matter.</P>
      <P>Articles appeared in the newspapers in recent days about a report in which the Glencree group suggested that people in this country are anti-Unionist and that the GAA, the Oireachtas and the Catholic Church are anti-conciliatory organisations. We should get that report and debate its contents in order to, perhaps, suggest to that group that while its observations in respect of certain issues may be right, they may be wrong in respect of others. We must discuss this matter.</P>
      <P>I am glad the colour of the Chamber and the curtains are the greatest concerns of the Labour Party and the Independents. I am not concerned about these issues so long as I remain in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the call made by Senators O'Toole, Costello, Dardis and others for a debate on the conflict between the EU and the Minister for Finance. We should debate this issue today or <Col N="10" /> tomorrow. We should also send a clear message to the EU before the ECOFIN meeting on Monday that the majority of Members of this House, and the Government is guaranteed a majority as it has the support of some Independents, fully support the principle that taxation is a matter for each independent country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It is up to Ireland and Ireland alone to decide how we tax our people and we do not welcome interference and empire building of this kind on the part of the EU. The EU has certain powers in this country which we may or may not welcome. However, the right to set our own taxes is established and it is a power which the Minister for Finance is rightly holding on to. We should debate this issue before the ECOFIN meeting so there is no doubt that the Minister has the support of democratically elected representatives in safeguarding our taxation interests.</P>

      <P>I support the call made by a number of Senators for an urgent debate on the Ombudsman's shocking report on nursing home subventions. Senator Norris pointed out that not alone was there malpractice involved in blatant breach of health legislation, but that the Minister must reassure us that victims of that malpractice will be fully compensated. He must also reassure us that best practice will be put in place, monitored and maintained.</P>
      <P>I support the call for a comprehensive debate on waste management. This debate should not be limited to recycling, which is only one neglected aspect of the issue, but should encompass the entire issue. The waste management crisis is hanging over the country like a black cloud and we need a reasoned debate on the available options with a view to giving some kind of national leadership to public opinion. Such leadership would avert an impending economic, public health and environmental crisis. Will the Leader arrange for debates on these two issues as soon as possible?</P>
      <P>Senator Norris raised the relocation of the Abbey Theatre. There is wide public interest in this issue which is a suitable subject for debate in this House.</P>

      <P>This is the third session in which I have raised the issue of the report on Aer Rianta. Will the Leader invite the relevant Minister to the House to discuss this issue? On several occasions I have asked the Leader about the sale of Cork Airport. Rumours about this issue have been circulating for so long that one is inclined to believe them. Will the Leader invite the Minister to the House to explain whether there is a commitment to provide moneys to Cork Airport? The situation is quite serious and I have been raising the subject for nine months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on finance. Such a debate would be appropriate in light of recent discussions and comments at EU level. It would be fruitful to have such a debate in the House. I have no doubt this House will compliment the Minister and the Government on their excellent handling of the economy in recent years.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government a recent announcement by the National Roads Authority of a proposed dual carriageway from Dublin to Galway. It was extremely high handed of the National Roads Authority to ignore the householders and landowners who will be directly affected by it. They had to read in local newspapers and hear reports in the local media that their houses would be knocked or their farm would be divided. It is unacceptable that a body set up by this House and by the other House should ignore the public. I ask the Leader to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and to request him to impress upon the authority that it has a responsibility to the public in this matter. It could follow the example set by Bord Gáis which has gone out of its way to make contact with landowners.</P>
      <P>I do not have a problem with the drapes. As regards the comparison made by Senator Costello about the drapes here and those in another house, Members on this side of the House would not be in a position to comment on such a comparison.</P>

      <P>Other Members mentioned the crisis in waste management and the position in which local authorities have been placed around the country. We have had some discussion on this issue in the past but it is now time for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to explain to us, particularly those of us who are members of local authorities, what he plans to do to deal with this crisis. Leadership is not being shown on this issue. It is ironic that members of his party are having late conversions on the subject of recycling and minimisation. I would like to hear the Minister's views on incineration and what he intends to do to exercise his full authority under the Waste Management Act, 1996. I would also like him to expand on comments he made in recent weeks that he would take control of the issue. Will he continue to sit on his hands and allow the situation to get worse? </P>

      <P>Food safety and BSE, particularly in the aftermath of the measures taken by the EU Commission and the <Col N="12" /> implications for the Irish beef industry, is an extremely important and urgent issue on which only the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has spoken but which clearly has implications for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I would like the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to address us on that matter.</P>
      <P>I support the calls for an early debate, which I hope will take place next week, on the Ombudsman's report on nursing homes which makes for shocking reading. This scandalous situation has pertained in this country for many years, particularly for those families who have been treated badly by the authorities and whose rights under legislation have not been protected. There must be accountability on this issue. While there is an important matter of how the will of the Oireachtas has been ignored, it seems the most important issue has been how families of individuals in nursing homes have been treated.</P>

      <P>I join with Senator Henry in requesting an early debate on the report published by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals. I regret the unfortunate incident which occurred in Lispopple near Swords last weekend. I suggest it was as a result of frustration by an individual who was completely fed up with the lack of communication between the residents of the area and the health authority. It is opportune, particularly in the that context, that we debate the report in full.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas aid to come to the House? It would be timely to have a debate on the structure of our spend on Third World aid. Members will be aware there is intensive ongoing lobbying, particularly by GOAL, in relation to the structuring of our funding. At a time of relative plenty it behoves us to ensure the dramatic, and welcome, increase in overseas aid is spent with the maximum efficiency.</P>

      <P>I support the call by Senator Manning and others for a debate on the Ombudsman's report on nursing home subvention and I agree with the preliminary remarks made on both sides.</P>
      <P>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage of the Broadcasting Bill, Second Stage of which is ordered for today? I join the call by Senator O'Toole and others for a debate on the EU Commission reprimand regarding Irish budgetary policy. Will the Leader outline to the House the intended parliamentary timetable for the local government Bill, particularly when it will reach this Chamber?</P>

      <P>I do not want to become involved in inter-party or intra party politics, but if Senator O'Meara had spoken to Senator <Col N="13" /> Costello she might have got some very useful insights on the handling of waste management in Dublin Corporation &ndash; the Labour Party members on the Corporation are authorities on it.</P>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Norris that the Abbey, Amharclann na Mainistreach, be left on the north side. It looks far better on the banks of the Royal Canal than it would on the banks of the Grand Canal.</P>

      <P>Finally, I ask the Leader at an early opportunity to have a debate on the banking system, how it works, its relations with the people who use it and its social relations. I know Senator Costello will support me in this call. There are wholesale closures of bank branches. Banks, in their headlong rush for profits, are closing branches with no reference to local communities. This week a new low was reached by them when a constituent of mine was charged £10 by a bank to cash a carer's cheque. The House will realise that a carer's cheque would not be enormous.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to specifically address what is happening in urban areas? I have previously asked for such a debate. The Garda rapid response unit for Clondalkin is stationed in Blanchardstown. It has to cross the Liffey and presumably stop and pay the toll. The old and vulnerable are being abandoned by the Government and the Minister &ndash; I cannot put it stronger.</P>
      <P>I invite the Minister to spend an horrific Friday, Saturday or Sunday night in the suburbs of my own electoral ward and explain to me how manpower at Clondalkin Garda station is lower than in 1975 despite an increase of 40,000 in the population, how there was only one squad car based there in 1960 and this is still the case today. Then he may talk about his policies and how he is going to solve the crime problem. I would be very grateful if the Leader would arrange that because it is very important that we do something in the interests of the people. I look forward to his response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would support a debate on the Ombudsman's report on nursing homes <Col N="14" /> subvention. I was horrified at the attack on the community for psychiatric patients in north County Dublin. The people who carried out that dastardly act are saying that people should be taken into hospital and kept there because we do not want them in society. However it is very important, and I speak as a long serving member of a health board, to have dialogue with local residents. The programme of relocating former psychiatric patients by my board is working well. If the people who carried out the attack want to see how well it works, they are welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to contribute to what has been said re the reprimand from the European Commission on our rate of inflation. We ought not be jingoistic. We have to remember that we are in the EMU and signed a stability pact. The essence of the pact was that we would do nothing to upset the stability of the European economy.</P>
      <P>Irish inflation is three or four times the European average. Other countries feel that is threatening the European economy. We complain about importing inflation from abroad but other countries might complain that they import inflation from here. Not everything they say is wrong. That should be borne in mind.</P>
      <P>I welcome the contribution from Senator Henry on a subject I have often raised &ndash; the need to have a statement from the Minister for Justice on the International Criminal Court. When will the statute signed in Rome over three years ago be incorporated into law? The court was set up to try the many people accused of committing outrageous crimes in their own country with immunity and impunity. The International Criminal Court is meant to put an end to that scandalous situation.</P>
      <P>We have examples of the court which sat in the Hague on the Lockerbie bombing, the one which dealt with atrocities in Rwanda and the <i>ad hoc</i> one which dealt with the former Yugoslavia. I have asked the Leader to consult with the Minister if we need a referendum, as has been suggested, to bring this forward. The Leader must obtain a response from the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>A subject which should be debated in this House is funding for the vocational training education opportunities scheme. This has been operated by the vocational education committees for about 12 years and has contributed to the retraining and second chance education of thousands of people. There has been no increase in the non-pay side resources for 12 years. I call on the Minister for Education and Children to ensure that there is a major increase in funding for the purchase of equipment, given the lapse of time since there has been any increase in resources. A major increase is due for the purchase of equipment, the hire of premises <i>et cetera.</i> The matter should be the subject of debate in the House. Can the Leader facilitate this?</P>

We have heard very little about it. I would advise European economists to come here and get a crash course from the Minister on how to run Europe. The way he is running this country is a credit to him. We were sick listening to what was robbed from PAYE workers but the Minister is returning to their pockets what was taken out by previous Governments. He is to be applauded and I hope the House will back him 100%. My sentiments are from the heart.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader indicate if we can have a debate on the invasion of privacy? I read a very disturbing article about a priest who departed this life rather suddenly, written by a journalist who presumed he knew why he did it. That is scandalous. There was a time when we let the dead rest but we need legislation to ensure that they continue to be allowed rest. It is disgraceful that people can say what they like once you are dead and there is no come back. I appeal for debate and legislation to ensure the dead are not defamed.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Toole called for a debate on Northern Ireland. We could usefully debate this but I was impressed by Senator Lanigan's call for a debate with a more specific focus on the Irish platform for peace and reconciliation report, which was issued yesterday or the day before, called Peace Building in the Republic of Ireland. This questions seriously our commitment and our ability to engage with the Unionist community in the North. It makes uncomfortable reading. It questions our whole sincerity in regard to parity of esteem. These are issues we must face up to. We have had debates on Northern Ireland. They are useful but they contain a &ldquo;what they should be doing up there&rdquo; element. This particular document criticises us for the way we are behaving. A debate with that specific focus would be very useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to No.1, the limit of 30 minutes, I assume after 55 minutes it is the will of the Cathaoirleach or perhaps the motion has not yet been passed. The objective is very useful and understandable but maybe it would be more useful if the Cathaoirleach were no longer restricted <Col N="16" /> by having this motion passed. Some alternative such as limiting the words and length of time each speaker has might be more useful. I have been impressed today by the range of items covered, by the topics and by the interests outside the Seanad. I feel we should not pass No.1 but find a better solution.</P>

I have no difficulty with that and I now propose to amend my proposal for the Order of Business as suggested by Senator Manning to allow 12 minutes for the principal speakers and seven minutes for all other contributors.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Dr. Desmond Connell on his elevation to the college of cardinals by his holiness Pope John Paul II. Dr. Connell is a man of great faith who has been unfailing in his defence of the church's teachings. His capacity for hard work, intellect, natural humanity and unquestionable integrity have earned him wide respect. I congratulate him.</P>
      <P>I wish to pay tribute to Bill Clinton, a great friend of Ireland, whose term as President of the United States has finished. I welcome the new President Bush.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, Costello, O'Toole, Dardis, Henry, Jackman, Ormonde, Norris, Quill, O'Meara, Coghlan, Fitzpatrick and Glynn expressed concern regarding the report of the Ombudsman on nursing home subvention. I will try to facilitate an all-day debate on this next week.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole, Manning, Dardis, Ross, Finneran and Connor called for a debate on the EU's opinion of our budget. Senator Finneran also called for a debate on finance. I hope to have these debates next week. Much legislation is coming before the House. Legislation is also being initiated in the House to continue the policies of the Government. To facilitate these will mean an extra day's sitting, which will require the consent of the House.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole, Lanigan, Quinn and Manning called for a debate on peace-building in Ireland. I shall allow time for this. Senators Henry and Glennon asked for a debate on the recent report into mental hospitals. Time will be left for this in the coming weeks. Inquiries will also be made to the Minister for Justice on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Cox, Quill and O'Meara requested a debate on waste management, which I believe is the greatest challenge facing local authorities. Senator O'Meara is a member of Tipperary North Riding County Council, which is in the midland region along with Laoighis, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath. She knows, therefore, that local authorities are beginning to face up to their responsibilities. We all realise the urgency <Col N="17" /> and importance of this matter, as has been witnessed in Galway in the last few days.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman called for a special debate on education. Senator Ormonde asked for a discussion on An Bord Pleanála. I will allow time for both these subjects.</P>
    <P>Senators Norris and Lanigan called for a debate on the Nice Summit. I am pleased to inform the House that the Taoiseach will be here tomorrow at 1 p.m. Allocation of time will be arranged by the leaders in the morning.</P>

      <P>Senators Norris, Quill and Fitzpatrick expressed their shock and horror at the proposal to remove the Abbey Theatre from the north side of the Liffey. I will allow as much time as possible to discuss this. It would be a retrograde step and this side of the House supports the Senators' call that it should not happen. I will contact the Taoiseach this afternoon to let him know the House's displeasure at this proposal. The debate will last as long as required</P>
      <P>As regards Senator Dino Cregan's point, there will be a debate for as long as is required. The Senator also called for a debate on Aer Rianta and I will pass this request on to the Minister's Department.</P>
      <P>I offer the sympathy of the House to our colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, on the sad passing last week of her husband, Enda. All our prayers go with her in this sad time of bereavement.</P>
      <P>Senator Finneran expressed serious concern about the lack of communication with landowners in certain areas about the National Roads Authority's proposed routes for motorways and dual carriageways. The essence of success in this area is good communications, as we found with the Athlone, Mullingar and Longford bypasses in the midlands. I will certainly pass on the Senator's views to the chief executive officer of the National Roads Authority. If the Senator highlights the specific areas of concern, I will pass those on also.</P>
      <P>I will convey Senator Glennon's views on overseas aid to the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and I will allow time for a debate on this matter in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan asked when Committee Stage of the Broadcasting Bill will be taken. Judging by the number of speakers who wish to contribute on this matter today, we will review progress tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Fitzpatrick and Coghlan asked about the Local Government Bill and I will make <Col N="18" /> inquiries about that legislation. I can assure all local authority members, however, that when the Bill comes before the House we will give it safe passage over a period of two weeks. Many local authority members have been inquiring about the Bill and have a keen interest in it. I thank Senators for informing local authority members about it. They can further inform them that we will not be delaying the Bill any longer than two weeks, with the consent of Members and the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick called for an urgent debate on banking. The fact that a carer was charged £10 for changing a cheque is a disgrace. It is not acceptable and, as a matter of urgency, I will pass on the Senator's views to the Minister for Finance. Before the Christmas recess, Senator Finneran and others called for a debate on banking, and we will have such a debate at the earliest possible time.</P>
    <P>I will pass on to the relevant Minister the concerns of Senator Ridge about the problems that exist in Clondalkin.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor has requested me to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when it is proposed to establish the international criminal court. I will inquire about that and will revert to the Senator with that information. The Senator also sought a debate, with the attendance of the Minister for Education and Science, on the lack of funding for the VTOS. I have no difficulty in arranging time for such a debate.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Farrell for his kind remarks regarding the efforts I made, with other party leaders in the House and yourself, a Chathaoirligh, to have the decor brought up to its current standard. It is absolutely magnificent. As regards the colour scheme, I hope Members of the Opposition will feel comfortable with blue because we on the Government side are doing so positively well in relation to the financial affairs of the nation. It is a matter of satisfaction to have them happy in Opposition.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell called for congratulations to be sent to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, as well as our EU Commissioner, Mr. Byrne, who is European person of the year. I will certainly ensure that the Senator's wishes are passed on.</P>
    <P>On the subject of invasion of privacy, a further debate on the establishment of a press council is long overdue. The protection of people's integrity is very important, including the integrity of deceased persons. We should debate all matters relating to the press and press standards.</P>

    <P>That the proposal that Seanad Éireann approve the exercise by the State of the option, provided by Article 3 of the fourth Protocol set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam, to notify the <Col N="22" /> President of the Council that it wishes to take part in the adoption and application of the following proposed measure:</P>
    <P>a proposal for a Council Directive on minimum standards on procedure in member states for granting and withdrawing refugee status, </P>
    <P>a copy of which proposed measure was laid before Seanad Éireann on 9 January 2001, be referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights in accordance with paragraph (1)(<i>a</i>)(v) of the Orders of Reference of that Committee, which shall, not later than 12 February 2001, send a message to the Dáil in the manner prescribed in Standing Order 67, and Standing Order 69(2) shall accordingly apply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion for reference to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights relates to the exercise of the option which the State has under the provisions of the fourth protocol to the Amsterdam treaty to take part in the adoption and application of the proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards on procedures in member states for granting and withdrawing refugee status.</P>
      <P>The background to the motion is broadly as follows. The Treaty of Amsterdam came into operation on 1 May 1999. The House will be aware that annexed to that treaty was a protocol, also known as the fourth protocol, the effect of which is to exempt both Ireland and the United Kingdom from the provisions of Title IV of the treaty which deals with visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to the free movement of persons.</P>
      <P>The fourth protocol, however, also allows either or both countries to opt into particular measures under specified terms and conditions. Article 3 of the protocol provides the State with a three month period to notify our wish to take part in the adoption and application of any proposal from the date such a proposal is presented to the Council, usually by the European Commission, or we may also accept a measure any time after it has been adopted. For a transitional period of five years the overwhelming majority of decisions in relation to proposals tabled must be on the basis of unanimity but, under the terms of the protocol, if, after a reasonable period, the proposed measure cannot be adopted with the United Kingdom or Ireland taking part, the other member states may go ahead with the decision in Council without their participation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important for me to clarify why the matter is only now coming before the House for consideration. Although this proposal was actually sent formally to the Council by the Commission at the end of October last year the final text as communicated to the Council only became available to the Department in mid-November. Prior <Col N="23" /> to considering whether the State should exercise its option under Title IV, the necessary interdepartmental consultations had to take place and then Government approval had to be sought for the exercise of the option. Although copies of the proposal for a directive were laid before both Houses on 9 January 2001, due to the intervening Christmas recess, which took up nearly half of the 12 weeks &lsquo;opt-in' period, it is only now, on the return of both Houses, that the necessary motions can be considered.</P>
    <P>The consequences of the presentation of this proposal by the European Commission to Council is that if the State wishes to opt into discussions from the beginning, we have until 14 February 2001 to inform the President of the Council of our intentions. Failure to opt in at this time does not prevent us from participating in Council discussions. However, we would not be able to opt in until such time as the negotiations have been concluded and the measures adopted, and our ability to influence the outcome of the discussions would be correspondingly limited. The United Kingdom has recently conveyed its decision to the Council to exercise its option in respect of the Council directive. This initiative is the first major proposal in a series of measures which are aimed at creating a common European asylum system.</P>
    <P>The framework for the creation of a common system is already contained in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council of October 1999 and in Title IV of the EU Treaty which was inserted by the Treaty of Amsterdam. At Tampere, in particular, the Council agreed to work towards the creation of a common asylum system in the EU on the basis of the full and inclusive application of the Geneva Convention.</P>
    <P>While this is the most significant proposal to arise from the Tampere Council agenda in the asylum area, we have also had proposals on the EURODAC fingerprinting regulation, a decision on a European refugee fund, and a directive on temporary protection. In the coming months proposals are expected on common reception standards for asylum seekers, the revision of the Dublin Convention and rules on the recognition and content of refugee status.</P>
    <P>This is the third occasion on which my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has sought the approval of both Houses for the State to exercise the option provided in the fourth protocol in respect of a proposal for an EU legal instrument in the area of asylum policy. The approval of both Houses has already been obtained for participation in discussions at EU level aimed at the adoption and application of a Council regulation concerning the establishment of &ldquo;EURODAC&rdquo; for the comparison of the fingerprints of applicants for asylum and certain non-nationals and a Council decision on the European refugee fund. The option has also been exercised in respect of other proposals for EU <Col N="24" /> instruments mainly in the area of judicial co-operation in civil matters.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline the main elements of this proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards on procedures in member states for granting and withdrawing refugee status in respect of which discussions have recently commenced in a Council working party in Brussels.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this proposal is to set out requisite measures for dealing with asylum applications in EU states as part of the creation of a common EU asylum system, based on the full and inclusive application of the Geneva Convention. The aim is to set down common minimum standards for dealing with asylum applications. The intention is not to require member estates to apply uniform procedures nor to oblige them to adopt common concepts and practices which they do not wish to apply. All standards for a fair and efficient procedure are laid down without prejudice to member states' discretionary power to prioritise cases on the basis of national policies.</P>
    <P>The proposed directive essentially contains three different sets of provisions which relate to procedural guarantees, the decision-making process and the application of certain concepts and practices.</P>
    <P>Chapter one of the proposed directive sets out the scope of the directive, including its purpose, which is to establish minimum standards on procedures in member states for granting and withdrawing refugee status. It also contains the main definitions.</P>
    <P>Chapter two contains the basic principles and procedural guarantees for dealing with asylum applications. These procedural guarantees relate to all stages of the asylum procedure and are designed to ensure procedural fairness in the asylum process. The key basic principles and guarantees contained in the proposed directive include: the right of asylum applicants to have access to the asylum procedure as soon as possible; the right of each asylum applicant to remain on the territory of the member state as long as his or her application for asylum is being considered; a number of procedural guarantees which apply to every asylum applicant, including the right to be informed of the asylum procedure to be followed, the right to an interpreter, the right to a written decision and the right to appeal a first instance negative decision. All these and other key procedural guarantees are already features of the Irish asylum system and most are enshrined in the Refugee Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>Chapter two also contains provisions on the processing of asylum applications from unaccompanied minors, the detention of applicants, the provision of resources and training for determining authorities, the right of access by UNHCR personnel to applicants and the protection of applicants' identities. While member states may retain their own national asylum systems, the intention of these provisions is to ensure that decision-making meets certain minimum requirements in the interests of developing <Col N="25" /> a comprehensive common European asylum policy.</P>
    <P>Chapter three contains common standards for the application of an admissibility procedure, including proposals for the grounds under which an application can be deemed inadmissible. As mentioned previously, each member state may decide whether to apply the admissibility concept, but if it does its national application would have to follow the common framework for all member states. Accordingly, if a member state applies an admissibility procedure to dismiss an application as inadmissible on the basis of the safe third country concept, it will have to abide by the common principles for designating a country as a safe third country as laid down in Annex I to the proposal as well as to the common requirements for applying the concept in individual cases.</P>
    <P>Chapter four deals with substantive determination procedures and provides for a regular procedure and an accelerated procedure. While there is no obligation to apply an accelerated procedure to deal with manifestly unfounded applications, member states will have to abide by the common definitions and maximum time limit if they do so. With regard to the safe country of origin principle, which applies in some other EU states, Annex II of the proposal lays down a common approach to the designation of countries as safe following consideration of a range of information on the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>Chapter five deals with appeals procedures and provides for an appeal to a review body such as our Refugee Appeals Tribunal. In certain circumstances a further appeal may lie to an appellate court. Chapter six contains provisions on penalties for the infringement of the national provisions adopted pursuant to the directive.</P>
    <P>The text of the proposal generally reflects many of the key elements of Ireland's domestic asylum legislation and procedures. Our procedures encompass strict safeguards so as to guarantee fairness and provide for a fist stage determination process and an independent appeals mechanism in the case of a negative recommendation at first stage and applicants may also apply to the High Court for a judicial review of their case. The Refugee Act, 1996, also provides a statutory right to consult a solicitor, a right to interpretation and a right of access by UNHCR in relation to the asylum process.</P>
    <P>There are also, however, some differences between Ireland's asylum procedure and those contained in the proposal, such as time limits for making appeals and for examining asylum applications and the inclusion of a third tier appeal to an appellate court on both facts and points of law, all of which will be considered in some detail during the negotiations at country working party level.</P>
    <P>The proposal also contains concepts which are new to us, such as the safe country of origin principle, the admissibility procedure and the provision for an appeal in certain cases not to have <Col N="26" /> suspensive effect. These concepts are not obligatory and, of course, all members states have discretion to decide whether to adopt concepts or practices which are not currently part of the Irish asylum system. The Government continues to be committed to meeting the State's obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention, both by identifying and protecting genuine refugees and by more quickly dealing with those asylum applications which are clearly not from genuine asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the Government has allocated major additional resources to the asylum area, including 370 additional staff aimed at the speeding up of processing times in respect of asylum applications, including appeals, and to deal with the consequential increase in the level of repatriation of people whose applications for refugee status are unsuccessful. In addition, significant additional resources have been made available to the Refugee Legal Service to ensure that it can provide a comprehensive and quality legal service to asylum seekers at all stages of the asylum process.</P>
    <P>This proposal for a council directive on minimum standards on procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status is likely to be the subject of lengthy and protracted debate at EU level, involving as it does the marrying of various member states' asylum systems. The exercise of Ireland's discretion to opt in to discussions on this proposal will initially only involve participation in those discussions at council working party level, leading, in due course, to the adoption and application of the instrument. When adopted by the council, it is likely to be a key instrument governing the grant and withdrawal of refugee status in the member states of the EU.</P>
    <P>The conference which adopted the Amsterdam treaty amendments took note of a declaration by Ireland that it intended to exercise its right under Article 3 of the protocol to take part in the adoption of measures pursuant to Title IV of the EU treaty to the maximum extent compatible with the maintenance of the common travel area arrangements with the UK. Accordingly, the Government is of the view that it is important for Ireland to respond positively to the tabling of this proposal by exercising our option before the deadline of 14 February 2001 so that the State is fully able to participate in and influence discussions on this significant instrument from the beginning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Government has decided on the opt-in, at least in its discussions on this very important document, which is the first attempt by the EU to establish a legal framework governing asylum and refugee status throughout the EU. The Council of Europe, which is a human rights over-watch on the legislation enacted in the human rights area by member states, is extremely critical of every EU country and every one of the 41 member states of the Council of Europe in respect of their <Col N="27" /> asylum laws and the legal codes, if any, that exist to deal with people seeking refugee and asylum status. In view of this we welcome this move.</P>
      <P>The problem is that it will take years before an agreement is reached because many countries are not interested in it and many more have a hostile attitude towards refugees and asylum seekers and migration. In addition, many people are blind to the phenomenon of huge migrations of peoples arising from developments in communications and travel. Economic circumstances in south-eastern Europe have meant that hundreds of thousands of people have migrated northwards to western Europe. The populations of Romania and Bulgaria and the states of the former Yugoslavia are falling or static because tens of thousands of their people are migrating to the better off parts of Europe.</P>
      <P>There is a clear onus on us in western Europe to respond much more generously than we have to date. I am old enough to remember the worst days of the Cold War when the propaganda machines of western Governments called on people in eastern Europe who were suppressed to rise up against their Governments and seek democracy. They were offered a safe haven in western Europe if they did so. Everything changed 12 years ago when the Berlin Wall fell, which was the seminal event that ended the Iron Curtain in Europe. However, there was a most ungenerous response to the plight of thousands of people in these countries. The discriminatory and racist attitude in Europe to Roma or gypsy people is almost not objected to at official level. They are a discriminated against minority in many countries of south-eastern Europe. When they move northwards to countries in western Europe they find the same discrimination they suffered in their old homeland in as bad if not worse form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are very concerned about the widespread reports from both EU and non-EU countries, including applicant countries, of the serious abuse and bad practice that exists where applicants for asylum and refugee status is concerned. Reports, indeed allegations, of discrimination, racist and verbal abuse, abuse of authority, dangerous methods of restraint and violence are common. There is often poor, inadequate and an unclear legal framework for dealing with applicants for refugee and asylum status in almost all EU states, and indeed in the other states I mentioned, including this State, in terms of fair and humane procedures by the State's agencies which are enforcing the law and having a clear legal code that sets out legal protection, the right of appeal, etc., for people seeking asylum or refugee status. It is a disgrace that it is almost 50 years ago since the Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees was signed. That major document was signed on 28 July 1951. Nevertheless, within the borders of most countries which enthusiastically signed this document, preach about it and pay lip service to it, there is no proper legal framework that <Col N="28" /> guarantees to an unfortunate asylum seeker or refugee the ordinary protection that any ordinary citizen of these States can expect. Neither is there a proper legal framework to inform the State's agencies in relation to how they should enforce the law.</P>
    <P>Expulsions are a very controversial issue in the whole area of migration, refugees and asylum seekers. In the last two years four people have died as a result of the enforcement of expulsion orders at European airports &ndash; one died at Brussels, one at Vienna, one at Frankfurt and one at Zurich, which is not a member of the EU. Three deaths occurred at airports within the EU states, which is unacceptable. Eleven Pakistani businessmen and Moldovans were arrested here and put in prison. The treatment of these people was a clear contravention of the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 3 of the convention lays down that people in such situations must never be subjected to inhumane and degrading treatment. To have placed these people in a prison where those who have been convicted of the worst crimes in society are placed was inhumane and degrading treatment and should not have happened. In a few weeks' time, we will debate in this House the incorporation into Irish law, as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the European Convention on Human Rights. It is hardly propitious that it is against the background of such clear contravention of that convention we are having a self-congratulatory debate about the issue. Since the European Convention is a creature of the Council of Europe originally, we are the last country of the 41 member states of the Council of Europe to incorporate this requirement into Irish law because we used to say that the Irish Constitution guaranteed us greater rights than the rights guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights. It is not the first the time the State's agencies have been in contravention of Article 3, one of the most fundamental articles of that convention. It is very important that these issues are raised in a debate such as this because we will be congratulating ourselves on the incorporation of this particular convention. However, at times we have very little about which to congratulate ourselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State spoke about the concept of the safe country of origin. I am very interested in this because in Europe today some countries apply this concept. Under the 1951 convention, this means that if a person is to be returned, they should not be returned where they may be subject to degrading or inhumane treatment or where their lives may be put in danger, etc. This is called <i>refoulement</i>. Some European countries have a policy whereby they identify certain safe countries of origin. To my knowledge, we have deported people to the Republic of the Congo, which is in the throes of a terrible civil war. It appears that we would consider that a safe country of origin. It cannot be a safe country of origin for someone who, for one reason or another, may be on the wrong side of the parties to the civil war <Col N="29" /> in that country. We never properly assess what is a safe country of origin. The basic concept in the 1951 convention states that no person may be returned unless in safety and in dignity. However, we have deported people, illegal immigrants as they were called, and we were not satisfied that they were returned in safety and in dignity, nor was there satisfactory evidence that they were returned to safe countries of origin or that the country of origin to which they were returned was safe for them.</P>
    <P>There are a number of issues this country should put in place, even before the agreement on this fourth protocol, because it will take years before there is Europe wide agreement on the matter. Given the lack of political will, I believe this debate will go on for years. We should put in place a clear set of principles that guarantees refugees or asylum seekers, particularly those who may be facing deportation proceedings, that their cases will be dealt with on an individual basis. There is clear evidence in other European countries &ndash; I am not sure about this country &ndash; that these cases of removal or return are not taken on an individual or case by case basis but several may be taken together. This is a clear infringement of human rights.</P>
    <P>There should be a clear code of practice in relation to the right to legal advice and the rights of NGOs to have access to give advice. Currently, this advice is very patchy and it is only on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis that charitable organisations or non-governmental organisations which wish to give humanitarian or legal assistance to persons who find themselves with illegal status in this country in terms of their arrival on our shores have access to them. Access to places where such people are held is very often on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis in European countries, and we have had plenty of controversy about it in this country. NGOs in particular should have a right of access under law to inspect these places. I am referring to organisations such as Amnesty International and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, etc. These organisations should have a right under law to inspect these places to see that they comply with at least basic minimum standards. They should have a full right to interview people, give them advice and so on.</P>
    <P>Given our history, these are initiatives the Irish Government should take. For the last 100 years we have sent many people abroad from our own shores. We called these people emigrants but that was a euphemism because many of them were economic refugees. These people were very lucky that they were well received in these countries &ndash; usually the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand &ndash; and were not, by and large, subjected to discrimination or any kind of degrading or inhumane treatment. Many other races were not so lucky, such as the unfortunate people from Africa who travelled to the American continent.</P>
    <P>I welcome the motion which is a step forward. However, it is only the first step in what will be a long process. I appeal to the Government, in <Col N="30" /> terms of its participation in the negotiations, to find a common set of rules which will apply throughout the European Union in respect of the granting of asylum and refugee status. I request that we should give a lead in this area and that we should not be like so many other states which will be reluctant, recalcitrant and show no enthusiasm for pushing forward in search of agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this motion and I recommend its referral to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. The purpose of adopting the protocol to which it refers is to set out, in so far as is possible, minimum standards for dealing with asylum seekers and related matters throughout Europe, particularly within the European Union, in order that there are parallels from state to state. This is significant, particularly when one recalls that some weeks ago, in extreme weather conditions, a cargo vessel from north Africa brought a number of people into Cork. Luckily none of the people to whom I refer, who were hidden on the vessel, was drowned, due mainly to the efforts of the Garda Síochána. When these individuals were eventually brought ashore, they were treated in a humane fashion. I understand that the ship in question docked in Portugal and another European state where its passengers tried to disembark, but to no avail.</P>
      <P>It is fair to state that we must live up to our responsibilities, but it is difficult not to envisage that the rules and regulations in individual European countries will be different. Having said that, however, the protocol is a step in the right direction. I compliment the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, and the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, on the huge amount of work that has been done in this area since 1997. The total influx of refugees and asylum seekers to the State in 1995 was equivalent to that of a single month in 1998. The numbers entering the country have risen dramatically in the past six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Government took office, there was no proper mechanism in place to deal with refugees and asylum seekers and only a skeleton staff was operating the relevant office. A budgetary programme was not put in place after the passing of the Refugee Act, 1996, to ensure that we could deal, in financial terms, with a problem that was obviously escalating. In addition, there was no proper appeal mechanism and, as far as I am aware, there was no right to judicial review. The Government has taken steps to deal with the problem in a very humane way. As the Minister of State indicated, the Minister provided 400 additional staff to ensure that asylum seekers' applications were processed quickly and efficiently and that this was done in a manner consistent with the terms of the United Nations Convention. There is no doubt that hiccups occurred. As already stated, the numbers increased dramatically within 18 months of the <Col N="31" /> Government's coming to power and lengthy queues could be seen outside the office in Mount Street. However, steps were taken to resolve these problems.</P>
    <P>It is easy to castigate a Government or a Minister for the way they deal with issues of this nature. To avoid a situation where refugees and asylum seekers living in Dublin or other areas might be ghettoised, they were provided with accommodation in centres throughout the country. I do not know of any county, or part thereof, where refugees and asylum seekers have not been treated humanely. They have full access to the health services, can obtain medical cards etc. In my opinion the Minister, the Department and the Government have treated them in a humane, fair and equitable manner.</P>
    <P>I wish to place on record my concern about the unfair criticism that has been levelled against the Minister in respect of certain matters. Senator Connor referred to the cases involving Pakistani and Moldovan nationals. As I understand it, the Pakistanis were visiting Ireland on a business mission and were not seeking asylum or any sort of status. Be it right or wrong, there was obviously some confusion because their papers did not appear to be in order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it was wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Consequently, a regrettable situation arose. However, it would be unfair to equate these individuals with people who are genuinely seeking asylum.</P>
      <P>The situation in respect of the Moldovans was somewhat similar. Apparently their papers did not appear to be in order to the Garda Síochána. It is regrettable that events unfolded in the way they did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was regrettable and it was also disgraceful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The individuals, who were not asylum seekers, came through their experience unscathed. It would be wrong to equate both groups with genuine asylum seekers. The Moldovans were not seeking asylum, they were looking for work. It would be wrong to confuse matters. I regret that these people had unfortunate experiences. However, what happened to them has nothing to do with the protocol to which the motion refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The movement of people from country to country is a complex issue. Regardless of how we may strive, I do not believe we will achieve a Utopian ideal in respect of asylum seekers. In the past three to four years, since this issue came to the fore, we have taken giant steps forward. As far as some people are concerned, however, we may not have gone far enough. They often refer to Irish people who left Ireland &ndash; half of my family did so &ndash; and travelled to England or America in the 1960s. At that time, Irish citizens on land<Col N="32" /> ing in England were fingerprinted, had to have a place of accommodation to which they could go and had to be able to survive on their own for a certain period. If they could not survive on their own, they were quickly sent home. We must be careful that we do not make simple comparisons with what happened to, for example, the population of Africa in the days of slavery or with the Irish who emigrated to England and America in the 1950s and 1960s.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the Government and the State have a duty to deal fairly and professionally with asylum seekers. They should be given legal advice and have the right to have their applications processed. If those applications are unsuccessful, they have the right to appeal and if they are unsatisfied with the outcome they have the right to seek judicial review. Our system may not be perfect but it has come a long way. Since the Government took office, structures, mechanisms, financial supports and additional staff have been put in place. A great deal has been achieved and I reject the criticism levelled at the Government and the Minister.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House. It is a step in the right direction. As Senator Connor stated, it may take some time for its benefits to filter through and for agreement to be reached between the various European states. It should be acknowledged that Ireland is well ahead of many of its European counterparts in this area. I thank the Minister of State for her contribution. We are going in the right direction. I hope the motion will be adopted.</P>

      <P>We support the motion. It is important that Ireland should be involved in the discussions relating to the protocol and it is vital that we indicate our intentions before 14 February.</P>
      <P>I welcome the tone of the Minister of State's contribution. On certain occasions when the Minister has come before the House, the tone of his contributions has not been as objective as it could be. Senator Ryan and I were present on one unfortunate occasion when the Minister referred to a &ldquo;glut&rdquo; of refugees. It is extraordinarily important that we take as calm an approach as possible to this matter because we are discussing people who, for some reason, are seeking asylum here and we have certain obligations under the Geneva Convention.</P>
      <P>While Senator O'Donovan naturally wanted to praise the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it would be wrong not to mention the former Minister of State, Joan Burton, who did a great deal of work in respect of the original Refugee Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="33" /> The important paragraph concerns proposals which are new to us. Senator Connor referred to the concept of a safe country. This is an important but difficult issue as European countries may differ in the countries they regard as safe. I hope we will take the lead on this issue in the discussions which the Minister of State may attend.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the provision that, in certain cases, an appeal may not delay action. We in this House have always argued that appeals should always lead to the suspension of action and I hope we will continue to do so and play a leading role on this issue.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we are so hostile to strangers. The racism which seems inherent in our make-up has become a real problem. I live in the notorious Dublin 4 in which some refugees were being housed in a hotel. The area is stable yet local people objected that locating refugees would reduce the value of property. The refugees were eventually moved due to problems with planning laws. All areas have to take people and it is a pity that an area like Dublin 4&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Connor's concerns about facilities at arrival points for the questioning of asylum seekers. I was at the airport on Monday night and saw about 20 people outside the passport area. One woman had small children and the area was unsuitable for interviewing people. There did not seem to be much communication with NGOs or others. I have also seen people getting off the Belfast train being questioned on the platform at Connolly Station.</P>
      <P>Can we have figures for the number of people turned away at ports, airports and Connolly Station? Such people's cases are not given much consideration. How many people are being turned away from ferries at French ports? French police claim that a considerable number of people are being sent back.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Connor, I regret that nothing has happened regarding the Convention on Human Rights. I thought this legislation had to be introduced as part of the Good Friday Agreement but we do not seem to be getting anywhere with it.</P>
      <P>Trafficking in people is becoming an appalling international problem and I hope this serious issue will be to the fore when the EU committee meets. I hope the Minister of State will attend that meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry for sharing time. I congratulate the Minister of State on her explanation and the clarity with which she expressed the need for this measure. I was interested to hear Senator Connor state that the Council of Europe was critical of 41 members precisely because there has not been clarity. This clarity can only be provided by this measure and that is why I support this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> I looked into the eyes of a man from eastern Europe who paid £2,000 in France for fake documentation to enable him to work in Ireland. This man told me of his sadness at leaving his wife behind and asked what he could do to get her into Europe. It reminded me of what Irish people must have gone through during famine times in the 1840s when they did anything to save themselves and their families by getting them across the Atlantic or anywhere safe.</P>
    <P>One can only imagine the horror of the 56 people who died in that box crossing the English Channel as a result of traffickers. People are driven to such measures by horror. We are not going to solve such problems but at least we are ensuring clarity. I hope this will happen quickly and I was impressed by Senator Donovan's explanation of the figures and the fact that we were wayward because we did not have this problem until 1997. The huge increase in the numbers meant we were left behind because we were not prepared for it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the steps being taken by the Minister of State. If nothing else it means we will be able to handle applications quickly and efficiently and hopefully reduce the number who come expecting far more than we are able, or perhaps willing, to offer. Let us ensure we in Europe get it right. Despite what the Minister for Finance is going through, we have been regarded as good Europeans. We want to make sure we are good Europeans but to do so we must ensure that we keep in line with what is expected of us by our comrades in Europe. We must provide what we owe to those who are distraught, horrified or terrorised and who will do anything to save themselves and their families. Let us ensure such people do not take the wrong steps. We must be clear and efficient in outlining the rules and regulations and how we are going to handle applications in the future. I welcome the Minister of State's comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry for sharing time. I welcome this measure. We have about one week to signify our intention to take part in these discussions and we must be part of those discussions. That does not mean that I wholeheartedly accept this kind of European view as we are in the process of creating fortress Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have sympathy with economic refugees and I was interested in Senator Quinn's comments as he also seemed to be moving in that direction. We in Europe are partly responsible for creating the conditions which squeeze these people out of their countries. The largest fish factory trawler in the world is owned by a man from Achill Island but it is not allowed to fish in Irish waters because of the damage it would cause. This trawler is now fishing off the west coast of Africa. People are being driven out of the contiguous countries in that region because they are no longer able to employ traditional fishing methods. This highlights how we are helping to create the pressures which drive these people out and then we <Col N="35" /> describe them as economic migrants. They are part of our responsibility and we are all interdependent.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the language used in the debate has been reasonable and moderate, that is until my contribution. Language creates a context within which hatred can occur. It is important that we have a reasoned debate.</P>
    <P>There should be some kind of &ldquo;culturation&rdquo; process for asylum seekers and refugees so they fit in once accepted. To remove the issue of colour from the debate, many people from eastern Europe habitually spit on the pavement. I am almost afraid to raise this issue as it could be used for racist purposes. The simple fact is that these people have not been through the same experience as us with tuberculosis. In the 1950s buses were plastered with signs asking people not to spit because of TB and diphtheria. We need to include such elements to make sure people can comfortably join this society.</P>
    <P>Let us have common minimum standards. Let us also teach people such as the French what is meant by a safe country. On numerous occasions France has returned asylum seekers and people claiming refugee status to countries such as Algeria which were clearly unsafe and where they were subsequently imprisoned, tortured and murdered. Many European countries such as Belgium are appalling in this regard. I was born in the Belgian Congo so I take an interest in things which affect citizens of that country. Senators will remember the case some years ago of a Congolese woman in Belgium. No sane person would want to stay in the Congo given the current conditions. This woman was sat on in an aeroplane and smothered to death. Does that satisfy the minimum requirements?</P>
    <P>There are certain anomalies in terms of the people who are punished. In many cases it is lorry drivers who are punished. I do not believe that all drivers are implicated. My brother is a long distance lorry driver and I hear it from him. For example, in Calais the French police will, by request, test lorries with a type of seismographic equipment that will detect a heartbeat or gas equipment which will tell the presence of oxygen. They can then give a clearance certificate which secures the legal interests of the lorry driver and stops them being smuggled in. We should look at that because it is not fair that a number of Irish lorry drivers have been caught in this bind. They were not involved and they did not have criminal complicity, yet the British authorities automatically imposed enormous swingeing fines. We should request that this be routine. If a lorry driver wants to get the test and to get a certificate, that should be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had difficulty getting my hands on a copy of the draft directive, although it is probably my own fault for not looking for it earlier. It is an interesting directive. Most of the major countries of the European Union are character<Col N="36" /> ised by a history of colonialism. They made a mess of many of the countries of Asia and Africa in pursuit of aggrandisement which only ended in the 1950s. The consequence of that was largescale social disruption in those countries, the pillaging of their natural resources to some extent and the destruction of the national culture in many cases. Now, significant numbers of people from those countries are being told they are unwanted and that they are a threatening people who cannot be allowed into Europe which caused hardship, harm and damage to their countries over a period of 300 years. Europe has a colonial history. The ending of the political colonialism in the second half of the 20th century is not the end of Europe's obligations to the countries to whom it did such great damage. It is worth remembering that the economic powerhouse of the European Union, Germany, was waging war through north Africa not too long ago and causing enormous depredation. It is suggesting, as many countries are, that there is no longer an obligation to any of these people.</P>
      <P>In recent times we had the ideological experiment of the IMF on eastern Europe. The unelected powers of the IMF and the World Bank got a wonderful opportunity to test out their theories on the former Soviet Union and its former satellite states. That experiment was a human disaster. Life expectancy in the countries of the former Soviet Union has reduced by perhaps one third, from perhaps 65 to 50. That has been brought about not because people who survived to 50 are dying at that age but because there has been a horrific increase in infant mortality rates because the health provisions which used to be there were destroyed at the behest of international financial agencies which insisted that those services be contracted out, collapsed and destroyed and because they failed hopelessly to recognise that there had to be institutional reform before there could be proper economic reform and a properly functioning market. We do not have market economies in most of those countries but gangster economies because institutions were not put in place to ensure that a free and fair market operated and the result has been the victimisation of the people of those countries. It is inevitable, therefore, that anybody who can will try to get out of them. It is the fault of institutions over which we have some influence that those countries are in the mess in which they find themselves. However, it is not just the fault of those institutions, as there are other issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I and my party welcome the idea of a common standard. However, one must read the literature carefully. I am intrigued by Annexe I which describes the concept in frank terms as the designation of a safe third country. It lists a number of basic standards laid down in international human rights laws, most of which are reasonable, including freedom from being imprisoned merely on the ground of inability to fulfil a contract and the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. What is absent from the designation of <Col N="37" /> a safe third country is any reference to the right of freedom of expression. The right of freedom of expression is present in the designation of safe countries of origin which mentioned that countries which are to be classified as safe countries of origin should have democratic institutions. However, that is not a requirement for a safe third country but for a safe country of origin, that is, a country from which a person could not claim asylum because it did not have democratic institutions.</P>
    <P>The right of freedom of association with others, the right of thought, conscience and religion and the right of freedom of expression are part of the definition of a safe country of origin. For an asylum seeker to be left in a safe third country, it does not have to be a country where they can open their mouths and express an opinion about how they are being treated there. It is extraordinary that the democracies of Europe would envisage a situation in which asylum seekers could be left in what is classified as a safe third country but where they would not have a right to publicly complain about the standards under which they are being held. These are the types of things which deserve elaboration by a Department which is not given to much elaboration on its thinking or to much signs of enlightenment on how to deal with issues.</P>
    <P>I have just heard good news about a young man of Japanese origin who has been living in Ireland since he was five and who speaks with a stronger Cork accent than I do because he grew up in Cork, unlike me. Yet he looks Japanese. He was told by an immigration official after he innocently went to work in a Japanese restaurant that he would have to go home once he finished his studies. He was at home in Cork. It was the only place he remembered. Fortunately, he has now been given the right to Irish citizenship. However, this young man, who speaks better English than Japanese, should not have been told he would have to go home because he was a child of Japanese parents who ended up in Cork. I did not speak about this before because the young man was not in a position to be certain.</P>
    <P>One of the tragedies of our attitude to asylum is the belief of many people, both asylum seekers and those who assist them, that to speak publicly is to put their position at risk. That should not happen. People have been refused asylum here on the grounds that there was no state to persecute them because the state had collapsed, for example, in Somalia. Their first reason for refusal was that they could not stay in Ireland because they could not prove they were victims of persecution under the terms of the Geneva Convention as there was no state to persecute them because the state had collapsed. The fact that academic studies comparing asylum seekers in this country with asylum seekers in Britain who come from the same country of origin show that our refusal rates are spectacularly higher than those of Britain is an issue which has not been addressed by our policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="38" /> There is also the eternal thorny question of enforced idleness. There are asylum seekers in every city and town who are told they can have bed and board and £15 per week pocket money, which works out at £2.20 a day. If they buy a newspaper and write a letter home, they will spend £1.50. Then people wonder about the visibility of these people on our streets when there is nothing else they can do because we say they cannot work under any circumstances. However, I have a different view. Every asylum seeker who comes into the State and who does not have family responsibilities, that is, who does not have children who need the exclusive attention of that particular person, should be told that if we can find them work, we expect them to work until their request is processed.</P>
    <P>Not only should we allow people to work, but we should say we expect them to work. This would mean the barriers would be broken. For example, if an asylum seeker was working in Senator Quinn's business, the Irish people would know them, know they were nice, and any fears would evaporate. If their asylum application was turned down they would have friends who would react very angrily and who would say it was not fair. However, if asylum seekers are kept away and out of contact with people, in ghettos, they cannot build up that network of support and therefore can be got rid of quite quietly.</P>
    <P>I am more than a little concerned by the language used in the document about detention of asylum seekers pending investigation of the factual situation. It is a very dangerous principle and one about which I am quite concerned.</P>

    <Title>Broadcasting Bill, 1999: Second Stage.</Title>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>Television and radio broadcasting have proved to be the most important means of mass communications which have been developed. They have and will continue to have a considerable influence on what we think and on what we think about at both national and local levels. At their best they have contributed to a shared sense of community and interest regardless of where we live, who we are or our economic circumstances.</P>
      <P>Such powerful communication systems also present enormous commercial opportunities. The ability of manufacturers and service providers to reach consumers is greatly enhanced by means of radio and television. The onset of the digital revolution has meant that the broadcasting services and the operation of their associated distribution networks have come to be seen as a very valuable commercial activity with enormous potential for future growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="39" /> There has been an extraordinary growth in the number and type of commercial and trans-national broadcasting services in the last decade or so. Despite this growth, broadcasting in its totality is much more than a commercial activity where the object of the exercise is to simply deliver the biggest audience at the lowest price or to deliver the largest dividend to investors. Broadcasting services are without doubt powerful tools for the dissemination of information and the education of public opinion. It is imperative that there be a source of information which can be trusted to be accurate in its news, documentaries and current affairs programmes and impartial between different social and political views. Central to the idea of democratic society is that of the well informed and self-determining individual, but if individuals are to be genuinely autonomous it is not sufficient for them merely to receive information, no matter how much or how impartially presented; they must be able to understand it and make sense of it in ways that relate to their own lives and decisions. It is, therefore, hugely important that Irish viewers and listeners should continue to have access to high quality indigenous services that are of relevance to Irish society and which serve the interests of our citizens in the 21st century.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands I must seek to find a balance between protecting and enhancing the needs of Irish society in terms of programme content and the expectations of those working in the broadcasting sector with regard to the commercial exploitation of radio and television. The statutory pillars on which Irish broadcasting is currently based are the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, as amended, and the Radio and Television Act, 1988. The Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, established RTÉ as the national broadcaster on a monopoly basis and provided for the introduction of television.</P>
      <P>Let me acknowledge the 75th anniversary of the commencement of broadcasting in this country on 1 January 1926. Let me also congratulate those who down the intervening years have striven through thick and thin to provide radio services of the highest quality for Irish listeners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Radio and Television Act, 1988, while not fundamentally changing the 1960 Act, introduced competition in the sector by establishing the Independent Radio and Television Commission providing for the introduction of independent radio and television broadcasting services. The existing legislative framework, however, is not suitable to cope with the developments in the environment of digital technology as applied to the broadcasting and telecommunications sectors. It is, therefore, timely that we examine our existing body of law and seek to provide a sound legis<Col N="40" /> lative basis to allow broadcasting in this time of fundamental and rapid change.</P>
    <P>The advocates of digital terrestrial broadcasting claim that the new techniques will significantly improve the quality of television reception. However, by far the most significant effect will be the increased broadcasting capacity and a significantly increased flexibility and sophistication in the number and type of services which can be broadcast.</P>
    <P>Most of the new services that will be made possible through the introduction of digital television will be provided on a commercial basis. We will all have the possibility to have a huge amount of services by today's numbers vying for commercial survival. Quality popular programming is already at a premium and the cost of producing and acquiring such material will continue to rise. Across Europe some of the more prestige programmes are disappearing from the schedules and are being replaced by programmes of a more simple nature reflecting the precious and scarce resources. Some programming that is available on free to air channels has migrated to pay per view and subscription channels. Niche services, subscription services and pay per view services are already with us and are set to grow.</P>
    <P>A fundamental change also is that there are now competing platforms. People in many areas of the country will be able to choose the platform from which they receive their services. The same broadcasting and broadcasting type services can be provided across a range of technical platforms, including satellite, cable television, MMDS, digital terrestrial television &ndash; DTT &ndash; and telecommunications infrastructures. Digital satellite services are already available in Ireland. Cable and MMDS systems are being upgraded to facilitate digital distribution of broadcasting services. DTT, as it is commonly known, will enable at this stage of the technological development the provision of up to 30 channels on a countrywide basis. Cable television, MMDS and satellite systems have the capacity to deliver much more. The level of access by viewers to additional services on cable, MMDS and satellite platforms will in large measure be determined by the attractiveness of the services on offer and especially by the ability of the viewer to pay for such services. It is not for me to say which is the better platform or to look into a crystal ball and try to predict which platforms will be the most profitable.</P>
    <P>An added dimension is that infrastructures which up to now have been perceived as being capable of providing broadcasting services only, for example, terrestrial transmission and cable television systems, can be used in the provision of services for the information society age. Similarly, infrastructure that was visualised only as appropriate for the delivery of telecommunications services will be capable of delivering audio-visual services. Such changes will have profound cultural and social effects at local, national and international levels. In a world where the globalisation of broadcasting services is a growing phenom<Col N="41" /> enon and where technological developments provide virtually unlimited capacity for the delivery of programme services, we must be concerned to ensure that Irish broadcasting services which reflect Irish culture and the needs and tastes of Irish viewers remain relevant.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that we give some basic guarantees to our citizens. We must ensure as far as possible that all our citizens, regardless of economic circumstances, have a reasonable guarantee of access to broadcasting services that have a distinctly Irish quality, that reflect Irish values and are relevant. In that context, there is now a stronger argument than ever for broadcasting services, operating to a strong public service remit providing programming schedules of quality, originality and diversity and catering for minority as well as mainstream tastes. Such services must be provided on a universal basis or as near to that concept as is technically feasible.</P>
    <P>I am also anxious to ensure real diversity and choice between broadcasting services. One of the main objectives of the Bill is to put in place a regulatory structure that allows Irish private sector broadcasting and public broadcasters to co-exist satisfactorily. Both sectors have much to bring viewers. Each sector can learn from and challenge the another. While they have different ultimate objectives, they both have an important place in the range of broadcasting services that can be offered to Irish viewers and listeners. I am also anxious to ensure that Irish broadcasters have the opportunity to use the latest technological developments to achieve their goals.</P>
    <P>This is why the Bill provides that our existing indigenous television broadcasters, both public and private, will have guaranteed access to the new DTT platform. It is essential that these broadcasters have the opportunities to have their existing services available in digital form and to develop new services.</P>
    <P>It is also necessary to provide a regulatory structure in which new indigenous services can be encouraged. In order to provide for this structure it is necessary to develop common basic programme and advertising standards which can be applied to all broadcasters across all platforms.</P>
    <P>The underlying purpose of the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, is, therefore, to provide a sound legislative and administrative framework which will encourage the Irish broadcasting sector to grow and exploit the opportunities which digital technology presents while at the same time ensuring that viewers and listeners can access high quality programmes, imaginative and challenging, with a distinctly Irish emphasis.</P>
    <P>The digital terrestrial television platform is seen to have the greatest potential for ensuring near universal coverage. However, the delivery of the broadcasting services on the platform will require significant investment both in the adoption and development of the existing analogue transmission network, the provision of reception equipment in the form of set-top boxes to viewers <Col N="42" /> and in the vital area of putting together of attractive content packages. DTT will have to compete against other digital delivery platforms including cable and MMDS and satellite. It will also have to compete to some degree with telecommunications operators using DSL technology. It will have to be seen to be competing fairly. It will also have attendant risks associated with the significant investment more proper to the private sector than to public ownership.</P>
    <P>Recognising the magnitude of the task and the associated risks, the Government has decided to facilitate the roll-out of DTT in Ireland by establishing two separate but interdependent companies &ndash; a transmission company and a multiplex company. DTT services involves two distinguishable and separate activities: the transmission of signals to people's homes and multiplexing, that is, the retailing of programme packages to viewers in much the same way as a cable television operator provides services.</P>
    <P>The Government has accepted that RTÉ should sell its transmission network as a going concern. The entity thus created, in which RTÉ will be allowed to retain a stake of up 28%, will be licensed to provide digital terrestrial television transmission services to broadcasters as well as the existing analogue transmission business. It will be the responsibility of this new entity to make the necessary capital investment to roll out the digital terrestrial transmission network to universal coverage in accordance with the terms and conditions of the licence to be issued by the ODTR.</P>
    <P>The DTT multiplex operator will be selected separately, in accordance with predetermined criteria, by me. I will be advised in this matter by a project management group made up of representatives of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the Departments of Finance, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Public Enterprise. I will also have the advice of a consortium of consultants led by AIB Corporate Finance.</P>
    <P>The multiplex operator will be licensed to operate six multiplexes. RTÉ is to be guaranteed the use of one multiplex. TV3 and TG4 are guaranteed the use of half a multiplex each. The multiplex operator will be responsible for assembling the programme packages to be provided on the multiplexes not allocated to RTÉ, TV3 and TG4. The multiplex operator will also assume responsibility for the capital investment required to enable viewers to receive digital services by way of set-top boxes, etc. Although the ODTR will be empowered to regulate the charging practices of the multiplex operator, it will be a matter for commercial decision by the multiplex operator as to what subscribers will have to pay for the necessary reception equipment, either by way of outright purchase or rental. I am aware that in the UK, particularly, vicious commercial strategies have been adopted to encourage the speedy take up of digital television.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> With regard to the regulation of broadcasting services, I propose to continue with the current administrative structures whereby RTÉ is regulated by the RTÉ Authority and independent broadcasters by the Independent Radio and Television Commission.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the Independent Radio and Television Commission to be given expanded powers and functions in relation to the regulation of digital broadcasting on all platforms. To reflect this body's increased powers its name will be changed to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. The commission will have the critical function, in addition to the current functions of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, of making arrangements for the provision of broadcasting services additional to those provided by our existing broadcasters. In carrying out this function, the commission will be required to endeavour to ensure that the number and categories of broadcasting services available in the State best serve the needs of its people, bearing in mind their traditions and culture. It is my expectation that the commission will in general regulate the broadcasting sector with a light touch. However, specifically the commission will draw up codes and rules relating to taste and decency of broadcast material, advertising &ndash; with particular reference to advertising at children &ndash; and a range of other broadcasting related matters, and enter contracts with providers of broadcast content. To ensure consistency such codes and rules will apply to all broadcasters, including RTÉ.</P>
    <P>With regard to RTÉ itself the Bill clarifies the public service remit under which RTÉ operates. The Protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty of the EU recognises that the system of public broadcasting in the member states is directly related to the democratic, social and cultural needs of each society and to the need to preserve media pluralism. The public service remit is currently defined in a general way in existing legislation. There have been significant changes in the broadcasting scene in Ireland and across Europe, not least the increased broadcasting capacity brought about by digital technology. For these reasons and in the context of the Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam on the system of public broadcasting in the member states, I believe that it is appropriate and necessary now to provide greater clarity as to what is expected in fulfilment of the public service remit which applies to RTÉ and to similarly define a public service remit appropriate to the ethos and mandate of TG4. I believe that the proposed provisions will provide for additional clarity and detail in statute law in respect of the uses to which the revenues, including licence fee, and other Exchequer moneys paid to these broadcasters may be put.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the repeal and restatement of the provisions of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, and the Radio and Television Act, 1998, in relation to the Broadcasting <Col N="44" /> Complaints Commission and extends the powers of investigation of the commission to cover all providers of broadcast content.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the Minister may establish Teilifís na Gaeilge as a statutory corporate body, the members of which shall be appointed by the Government; that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland shall draw up a scheme for the disbursement of a fund of £500,000 provided from the Exchequer in respect of capital expenditure on transmission infrastructure incurred by local and community radio stations; for the repeal of paragraph (b) of subsection (4) of section 14 of the Radio and Television Act, 1998, which enables the Independent Radio and Television Commission to impose a levy on the income of independent broadcasters; for the amendment of section 4 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993, to provide that in the financial year 2001, RTÉ shall make the sum of £20 million available for independent television productions and that, in subsequent years, this amount shall be adjusted in line with changes in the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the detail of the Bill. Section 1 contains the short title, collective criterion, construction and commencement provisions. Section 2 contains definitions. Section 3 provides for repeal of existing legislative provisions set out in the first schedule to the Act. Section 4 provides for the payment of expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Bill when enacted.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that the Minister may, subject to the expressed conditions, following the required consultation with the Minister for Public Enterprise, designate a company formed under the Companies Act which has as its principal objectives the transmission by terrestrial means of analogue television and sound broadcasting services provided by broadcasters and digital television services provided by the multiplex company, the promotion of the development of multimedia services and the promotion of electronic information services, including internet services. RTÉ will be required to transfer its existing transmission infrastructure to this company in exchange for a shareholding in the company. RTÉ shall not transfer any such shareholding without the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance. In addition the Minister may, by order to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, require RTÉ to divest itself of the shareholding in the company.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that on a date specified by the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, the director shall be required to issue licences to the transmission company in relation to the transmission equipment which has been the subject of a transfer from RTÉ and to RTÉ in relation to equipment which has not been the subject of such a transfer. If in the event that there is a delay between the designation of the new company and the granting <Col N="45" /> of licences by the director, it is proposed to allow the transmission company to begin immediate transmission by providing that the rights and obligations set out in RTÉ's existing licences will operate and have effect as if they had been granted to the transmission company.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that the transmission company will be licensed and regulated by the director under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts. When licensing the transmission company, the director may attach whatever conditions the director feels is appropriate including the conditions relating to the imposition of charges by the transmission company on broadcasters and the multiplex company. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt the section makes it clear that the director shall not be prevented from granting further digital transmission licences to either the designated transmission company or any other person.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that the Minister may, subject to the expressed conditions, following the required consultation with the Minister for Public Enterprise, designate a company formed under the Companies Acts which has as its principal objectives the establishment, operation and maintenance of six digital multiplexes, that is to say the six electronic systems which combine programme material and related and other matter for transmission by the transmission company, the entering into arrangements with RTÉ, TG4 and TV3 for the transmission of their programme material and related and other matter in digital form by the transmission company and the promotion of the development of multimedia services and information services including the internet.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that the multiplex company will be licensed and regulated by the ODTR under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts and the provisions of this Bill. RTÉ, TG4 and TV3 will be guaranteed access to multiplex capacity and the Minister will have the power to direct that multiplex capacity be reserved for Northern Ireland broadcasters. In addition the section provides that the ODTR can regulate charges imposed by the multiplex company, that RTÉ, TG4 and TV3 can decide whether their allocated multiplex capacity will be delivered via a dedicated multiplex or by an equivalent capacity and that the ODTR may issue further multiplex licenses.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the change of the name of the Independent Radio and Television Commission to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. Section 11 provides that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland shall endeavour to ensure that broadcasting services made available in the State under the Bill, or the Radio and Television Act, 1998, best serve the needs of the people of the island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 12 enables the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to enter into digital content contracts with broadcasters for the provision of programme material to be transmitted by digital terrestrial means by the multiplex company designated under section 8. Section 13 provides that <Col N="46" /> the transmission company will be obliged to carry, if requested to do so, the analogue free-to-air broadcasting services of RTÉ, TG4 and TV3, the digital services supplied by the multiplex company and the analogue sound broadcasting services of RTÉ and independent sound broadcasting contractors. The transmission company may also impose charges in relation to the transmission of these services.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides that the multiplex company must carry, if requested to do so, the digital free-to-air broadcasting services of RTÉ, TG4 and TV3 and may carry digital services from other broadcasters and electronic information service providers. The provision also allows the multiplex company to impose charges on the broadcasters it carries, on its customers in relation to services other than the free to air services of RTÉ, TG4 and TV3 and in relation to the provision of the apparatus required to receive DTT transmission, that is to the set top boxes.</P>
    <P>Section 15 is designated to offer the transmission company and the multiplex company some protection with regard to programme material or data which is carried on the DTT or analogue networks over which neither company has effect control.</P>
    <P>Sections 16 and 17 deal with electronic programme guides, otherwise known as EPGs, which are defined as a means of providing information in relation to the schedule of programme material on a digital broadcast service. It is expected that EPGs will be essential to allow viewers navigate through the array of services that will be available by way of digital transmission. Consequently there is a provision requiring ease of access to information regarding the broadcasting services provided by RTÉ, TG4 and TV3 and certain of the services provided in the North. The commission may also enter into a contract for the provision of an EPG covering the DTT, cable and MMDS platforms and may direct that this EPG be carried on these platforms. Accordingly if the commission is not satisfied that viewers are being provided with easily accessible information on indigenous broadcasters, it can bring this provision into effect.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for the application, subject to necessary modifications, of certain fundamental existing legislative provisions contained in the Radio and Television Act, 1988, to new broadcasting services provided pursuant to contracts entered into under this Act.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides for the preparation by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland of codes and rules to be complied with by broadcasters with respect to programme material. The commission shall, following a wide consultation process, prepare codes in relation to the taste and decency of programme material and broadcast advertising, sponsorship and other commercial promotion including advertising, direct or indirect, to children. The commission shall make rules in order to promote the enjoyment of broadcast services by persons who are deaf or hard of hearing and <Col N="47" /> persons who are blind or partially sighted. The commission shall also prepare a code in respect of a broadcasting service that has as one of its principal objectives the promotion of the interests of any organisation.</P>
    <P>In relation to this section, I was particularly anxious to ensure that the use of children's advertising be specifically addressed by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. To this end, the provisions are designed to ensure that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland will deal with the preparation of a code on children's advertising as a priority. In the preparation of such a code, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland will be obliged to undertake a wide consultation process, having regard to any existing research, or commission its own research and consider the merits or feasibility of banning advertising directed towards children of a specified age.</P>
    <P>I regard the role of the new Broadcasting Commission of Ireland in this regard to be of such importance that I propose to oblige the commission to report to me on its progress within one year and every three years thereafter. These reports will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that I have been able to contribute to the implementation of the national children's strategy which was recently launched by the Taoiseach. This strategy recognises for the first time, the importance of giving children a voice in matters which affect them. Indeed the first national goal for children is that &ldquo;children will have a voice in matters which affect them and their views will be given due weight in accordance with their age and maturity&rdquo;. The strategy goes on to recognise that one of the issues of concern to children is the impact of information and communications technologies. These technologies include television, videos, video games and the Internet.</P>
    <P>The strategy recognises that research on the impact of such technologies on children is under-explored. Proposed actions in this area include the commissioning of research of the impact of a wide range of technologies on children and that the public and private sectors working in information and communications technologies should develop in partnership a code of ethics in relation to children's issues. I believe that my approach to the issue of advertising directed at children is practical and is not only consistent with but actively supports the aims set out in the strategy.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides for the co-operation by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland in the preparation of non-technical codes or standards with respect to the transmission of information by any electronic means, other than by means of broadcasting, including the Internet. Section 21 provides that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland shall enforce Parts II and V of the Bill when enacted and the codes and rules and contracts made thereunder.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> Sections 22 to 27 provide for matters relating to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission. Section 22 provides for the appointment, remuneration, resignation and removal of the chairman and members of the commission and provides for gender balance among the members.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides for the supply by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of staff, services, accommodation and facilities for the performance of its functions and for the payment of the expenses of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. Exceptional expenses of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission may be reimbursed by the Minister to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland from television licence fee revenue.</P>
    <P>Section 24 provides for the grounds for complaint to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, which comprise the existing grounds with the addition complaints of breaches of the code regarding taste and decency of programme material. The section also provides for the procedures for making complaints and the procedures to be followed by the commission in investigating a complaint.</P>
    <P>Sections 25 to 27 provide for annual reports by the commission, for recording of programme material by holders of content provider contracts and for the completion by the commission of existing investigations.</P>
    <P>Section 28 provides additional clarity and detail in respect of the public service character of the national television and sound broadcasting service provided by RTÉ. The basic requirement is that the service provided by RTÉ shall comprise a comprehensive range of programmes in Irish and English, shall be free-to-air and shall be universally available in so far as is reasonably practicable. Television licence revenue shall be, and commercial revenues may be, used by RTÉ for the purposes of fulfilling its public service remit.</P>
    <P>Section 29 provides that in addition to its national service, RTÉ may provide local, community or regional services. Section 30 provides that, in addition to its public service broadcasting remit, RTÉ shall have the power to offer special interest subscription or pay-per-view programme services &ndash; secondary broadcasting services &ndash; and to transmit programmes by electronic means other than broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Section 31 provides for the continuation of the current regime in relation to the approval by the Minister of advertising time on RTÉ broadcasting services, which are not subject to a contract with the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, and specifically includes teleshopping within this regime.</P>
    <P>Section 32 provides for an amendment to section 6 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976, under which RTÉ is required to record every broadcast and to make such a recording available to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission in the event of a com<Col N="49" /> plaint. The amendment will require RTÉ to record visual as well as audio material.</P>
    <P>Section 33 provides for an amendment to section 4 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993 which deals with the annual amounts which RTÉ must make available for independent television productions. Paragraph (b) of the section provides that the amount to be made available in the financial year 2001 shall be £20,000,000. The other provisions of the section provide that, in subsequent years, this amount shall be adjusted in line with changes in the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>Section 34 provides that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland may authorise the television programme service contractor, TV3, to provide additional broadcasting services by means of a variation made by it to the contract which has been entered into under the Radio and Television Act, 1998 in respect of its existing service.</P>
    <P>Section 35 provides that any television programme service contracts entered into or renewed by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland after the commencement of this section shall include a provision that the definition of &ldquo;independent television programme&rdquo; has the same meaning as that provided in the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>Section 36 provides for the entry by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland into satellite content contracts with persons for the supply of programme material to be transmitted as a broadcasting service by means of a satellite device. The commission may charge fees for such contracts.</P>
    <P>Section 37 provides for measures in respect of the transmission and retransmission of programme material by means of cable and MMDS systems. Specifically, the section provides that only properly licensed broadcasting services may be carried on cable and MMDS systems. It also provides for the notification of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland in respect of the transmission or retransmission of broadcasting services, and for &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; status for the television services of RTÉ, TG4, and the television programme service contractor, namely TV3, national sound radio services and community channels on cable television systems. TV3's &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; status on MMDS systems is maintained.</P>
    <P>Sections 38, 39 and 41 are designed to enable the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to enter into local content contracts with persons for the supply of programme material for local interest, community and commercial channels to be transmitted on cable and MMDS systems. The commission is empowered to make a community channel &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; on the local cable or MMDS system.</P>
    <P>Section 40 provides that the commission may carry out an assessment on the needs of a community in respect of broadcasting with regard to the availability of production facilities, training <Col N="50" /> and resources to the community to best serve its interests.</P>
    <P>Sections 42, 43 and 44 provide for the establishment of TG4 as a statutory corporate body on a day, which the Minister may appoint. It is the intention that these provisions will be brought into effect at the optimum time.</P>
    <P>Section 45 provides that the function of TG4 shall be to provide a national television broadcasting service catering for the expectations of those whose preferred spoken language is Irish or who otherwise have an interest in Irish. The service shall have a public service character similar to that to be provided for in the case of RTÉ in section 28 of the Bill, with, of course, special emphasis on the Irish language service.</P>
    <P>Section 46 provides that the general duty of TG4 shall be similar to that of RTÉ by virtue of section 17 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 as amended by section 13 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976. Section 47 provides a statutory basis for the supply by RTÉ free of charge to TG4 of one hour per day of Irish language programming.</P>
    <P>Section 48 provides that the approval of the Minister will be required for the total time per year of broadcasting by TG4. This provides for the continuation of the current position. Section 49 provides that the approval of the Minister will be required for the daily and hourly times devoted to the broadcast of advertising and teleshopping by TG4. Again this reflects the existing position.</P>
    <P>Section 50 provides for the application, subject to necessary modifications, of certain fundamental existing legislative provisions contained in the Broadcasting Authority Acts, 1960 to 1993 to TG4 as they apply to RTÉ under the existing law. By virtue of the application of section 21 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, TG4 shall have the power to appoint advisory committees or advisors.</P>
    <P>Section 51 provides for the payment by the Minister of Exchequer funding to TG4. Sections 52 and 53 provide for transitional provisions in relation to TG4, including the transfer to TG4 of land, property and other rights and liabilities of Seirbhísí Theilifís na Gaeilge Teoranta. This company is the wholly owned subsidiary company of RTÉ, which currently provides the TG4 service.</P>
    <P>Section 54 provides for the separation of accounts and moneys in respect of secondary broadcasting services provided by RTÉ and TG4 in addition to their national public service broadcasting services.</P>
    <P>Section 55 provides for general matters relating to content provider contracts entered into by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland under the Bill, and section 56 provides for the charging by the commission of fees for applications for contracts.</P>
    <P>Section 57 provides for offences in relation to the supply of programme material for the purpose of its being transmitted as a broadcasting service otherwise than in accordance with a con<Col N="51" /> tent provider contract, offences in relation to the &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; requirements on cable and MMDS systems and offences in relation to the requirements to notify the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland of services transmitted or retransmitted on cable and MMDS systems.</P>
    <P>Section 58 provides for the payment by the Minister of Exchequer moneys to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland in respect of its expenses. This arises from the repeal provided for in section 3 of the Bill of the power of the Independent Radio and Television Commission to impose financial levies on independent broadcasters under section 14(4)(f2&gt;b) of the Radio and Television Act, 1988.</P>
    <P>Section 59 provides for the operation by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland of a scheme of capital grants to local and community radio stations in respect of their transmission costs to be funded from Exchequer moneys up to a maximum total of £500,000 to be provided to the commission by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 60 provides that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, when considering the award of a sound broadcasting contract, must have regard to the extent to which the applicant complied with any sound broadcasting contract held by the applicant before the date of making the application. In addition, this section also obliges the commission to notify the applicant of the reasons for refusing an application for a sound broadcasting contract.</P>
    <P>Section 61 provides for an increase from 14 to 30 in the number of days in a period of 12 months for which the commission can licence a temporary sound broadcasting service. Section 62 provides for amendment in respect of the grounds on which the commission can authorise a derogation by a broadcaster from the minimum requirement of 20% of broadcasting time to be devoted to news and current affairs programmes.</P>
    <P>Sections 63 and 64 are designed to bring the pension provisions of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, in relation to RTÉ, and the Radio and Television Act, 1988, with regard to the Independent Radio and Television Commission, up to date.</P>
    <P>Section 65 provides that the existing prohibition on broadcasting advertising directed towards a religious end will be relaxed to allow advertising of newspapers, periodicals, etc., and notice-board type advertising of religious events or ceremonies where the language used does not address the merits of a particular faith or belief or of becoming a member of any religion or religious organisation.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule contains the list of enactments to be repealed by section 3 of the Bill. Sections 18A, 18B and 18C of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, provide for the establishment, functions and duties of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission. Essentially, the powers of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission are being restated for clarity in the new legislation. <Col N="52" /> Section 19 of the Act provides for the hours of broadcasting on RTÉ radio and television services to be subject to the approval of the Minister. Sections 3(1), (1A) and (1B) provide for that, and the Minister may make an order directing RTÉ to refrain from broadcasting any matter which, in the opinion of the Minister, would be likely to promote or incite to crime or tend to undermine the authority of the State.</P>
    <P>Section 11(3) and (4) of the Radio and Television Act, 1988, provides for the extension of the powers of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission to the independent radio and television sector. Section 12 of the Act automatically extended the scope of any order in force under section 31(1) to independent broadcasters under the 1988 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 14(4)(f2&gt;b) of the Act provides for the payment by independent broadcasters of financial levies to the Independent Radio and Television Commission. This requirement is being dropped. Section 4 of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, provides for the drawing up by the Minister of a code dealing with advertising, sponsorship and other forms of commercial promotion in broadcast services which shall be complied with by RTÉ and independent broadcasters. This will now be a function of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993, provides that the maximum daily and hourly advertising times on RTÉ broadcasting services shall be subject to the approval of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule provides for standard provisions in relation to the establishment of TG4 as a separate statutory body, including the appointment, remuneration, resignation and removal of the chairman and members of the body, and the requirement for gender balance among the members. Provision is made for the employment of, and the devising of, a superannuation scheme for staff, including a chief executive. Provision is also made for TG4 to present annual reports and accounts.</P>
    <P>Senators will agree that the Bill is a major legislative initiative. The introduction of DTT will provide the best opportunity to ensure that digital television services are rolled out to as much of the population as is feasible. It will provide the best guarantee that at least our existing indigenous television services will be available in digital form, free at the point of reception on a universal basis, or as near to that concept as is feasible.</P>
    <P>In addition, DTT has the capacity to provide information services <i>via</i> television sets to viewers. The companies to be designated under the Bill will be required to have, as part of their objectives, the promotion of multimedia services and the development of electronic information services, including those provided by means of the Internet. In this way the Bill will ensure that the maximum opportunity to partake in the information society is provided to as many people as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="53" /> I look forward to hearing the contributions of Senators to this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I must declare an interest in that I am a shareholder in Radio Kerry. I was among the founding directors who established the company and successfully applied to the Independent Radio and Television Commission for the licence to provide local radio to the people of Kerry.</P>
      <P>I welcome the debate on the Bill and note the Minister's comments and aspirations for the effective roll-out of digital broadcasting. I deeply regret that it has taken the Minister so long to progress the Bill and that the legislation is likely to be enacted close to the second anniversary of its introduction. However, I appreciate that the Minister has had her difficulties with the legislation. What we are presented with now is a rather hybrid Bill which is unlikely to be remembered as the legislation which best achieved clarity of thought or expression. In short, this is a bad Bill.</P>
      <P>As we enter the digital age, a number of clear public policy objectives must underpin such important legislation on broadcasting and broadcasting policy. First, we must ensure that all members of the public are able to benefit from the digital era and are not left behind. Many households along the western seaboard feel entirely neglected by recent developments in broadcasting. The recent migration of &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo; from RTÉ to TV3 was greeted with dismay by many ardent soap fans who were unable to receive the TV3 signal in their local areas. It must be an important tenet of public policy that all of Ireland must benefit from digital broadcasting, not just the areas where commercial broadcasters see a commercial imperative to roll out their services. I am sure the Minister has no difficulty in accepting this basic principle.</P>
      <P>Second, it is of vital national importance that we encourage and sustain the important role of RTÉ as the national broadcaster. We have been excellently served by RTÉ since 2RN was first established in the 1920s. The quality and standard of home produced broadcasting that we see daily from RTÉ is unparallelled and it must be encouraged and sustained. As with many national enterprises operating in an increasingly globalised environment, RTÉ will face considerable commercial and cultural challenges with the advent of digital broadcasting. Faced with formidable and well resourced competitors operating in an increasingly international environment, it will be important that RTÉ is sustained and nurtured by Government. The benefits of a dedicated national public service broadcaster with specific public interest objectives, must be recognised in an environment where we are being continually barraged by such cultural gems as &ldquo;The Gerry Springer Show&rdquo;, &ldquo;When Animals Attack&rdquo; and &ldquo;Temptation Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two important aspects to this matter. First, RTÉ must be in a position to offer high <Col N="54" /> demand and high quality programmes to viewers. In the bidding war for key programmes RTÉ will always be at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> international competitors. Second, surely TV broadcasters offering such high quality dross as previously mentioned must not be automatically conferred with the same rights, assumptions and privileges on &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; status as those who offer content with a genuine public service or public interest objective. I will return to this later.</P>
    <P>It seems immensely generous of the Minister to confer such exalted status on what is low quality content. The automatic &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; status conferred on commercial broadcasters in the context of this Bill must also be subject to review. In fairness to the commercial broadcasters, there must also be closer examination of the public service remit conferred on RTÉ to ensure it stays faithful to the public service mantle conferred on it by the Oireachtas and that it is run effectively and efficiently to provide value for money.</P>
    <P>A third public policy issue concerns the role and status of the independent broadcasting sector. From first-hand experience, I have witnessed the hugely important and significant role the independent local radio stations have assumed since they were first licensed by the Independent Radio and Television Commission. They provide a vital public service and should be encouraged and sustained. One of the major issues for local radio stations concerns the expiry of their licences in the years ahead. There is much uncertainty and unease about the expiry of the licences. Staff are uneasy about their employment prospects and investment decisions are difficult for stations to make in the knowledge that the renewal of licences will be subject to the uncertainties of a milk round system. The Independent Radio and Television Commission should at least carry out some assessment of the performance of the local stations in the context of their contractual and statutory objectives and the outcome of this review should influence the Independent Radio and Television Commission in deciding whether to re-advertise the licence for the franchise involved. The Minister has offered something in that regard and I think she accepted an amendment in the Dáil, but there is still concern about it based on legal advice. The Minister can see how difficult it is to continue to develop a service in terms of capital investment and so on and stations can be placed in an impossible and invidious position.</P>
    <P>I see considerable advantage in allowing the independent broadcasters to have some role in a new digital transmission company. If RTÉ, as the national broadcaster, is going to retain its stake in the new entity, it is important that other broadcasters should be facilitated with involvement provided no competition law issues arise. I have serious concerns about issues of transparency and public accountability with this legislation. Many functions are reserved to the Minister and there are other instances where public participation and accountability are not fully encouraged or <Col N="55" /> facilitated. In broadcasting, more than in any other sector, it is imperative that the public is involved in the decision-making process. In the current environment, broadcasters shape and influence the way people develop their responses to cultural, political and social matters. It is imperative that public participation and accountability are encouraged in all aspects of the regulation of broadcasting and broadcasters.</P>
    <P>It is wrong, for example, that the Minister retains the right to appoint the companies likely to run the digital transmission and multiplex companies. The Minister also retains the right to appoint the members of the RTÉ authority and set the licence fee for RTÉ. Surely, these powers are inappropriate in current circumstances and should be devolved to a competent authority or body. For example, I would see much merit in the prospective appointees to the RTÉ authority being asked to appear before the Oireachtas committee on heritage and the Irish language so that they could outline their experience and give an insight into their visions for broadcasting in Ireland. Likewise, the Oireachtas committee on heritage and the Irish language would have a useful role in addressing the RTÉ request for a licence fee increase. Is it right that RTÉ's existence and survival depends on a decision that the Minister alone will make? This is a ferocious power vested in the Minister alone. I wonder is the Minister happy with this.</P>
    <P>There must also be an argument for addressing the issue of consistent regulation of broadcasting in Ireland. Arising from this Bill, it now appears that broadcasters could be regulated by up to five different regulatory authorities &ndash; the Minister, the RTÉ Authority, the Broadcasting Commission, the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and the ODTR. There must be a public interest imperative in ensuring that we can achieve consistent regulation across all broadcast platforms, albeit by reference to different public policy objectives in different instances. I detect that some of the independent and commercial broadcasters feel that consistent regulation would best achieve the general public policy objectives that this Bill endeavours to achieve.</P>
    <P>Another key area which the Bill needs to address effectively is the role of Irish programme makers. While I note that the Bill provides for £20 million to be dedicated to Irish programme makers, I think it will be necessary for the Minister to take other significant steps to create an atmosphere that is conducive to Irish programme and film makers. Part of this can be achieved by using the &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; status on cable and MMDS more effectively and subjecting automatic &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; status to some analysis on the grounds of programme context. If broadcasters were encouraged to use Irish produced programmes in order to acquire &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; status, this would, doubtless, assist Irish programme and film makers. I do not subscribe to theories that suggest that RTÉ should be the sole repository <Col N="56" /> for Irish made programmes while other channels are free to offer whatever content they wish without scrutiny or review.</P>
    <P>The delay in rolling out this Bill is very serious. We are faced with a situation where the legislation needed to establish DTT in Ireland is only coming onto the Statute Book two years after its introduction. We must then commence the process of establishing the digital transmission company and the multiplex operator. This will, doubtless, take until the end of the year to achieve. It looks as if it will be the middle of 2002 before Irish consumers will see the first hint of DTT. This is simply a disgrace. It is incumbent on the Minister to ensure there are no further delays and that the Bill does not present any future hostages to fortune that will need to be resolved by the courts. I know that some commentators have expressed concern about the manner of establishment of the digital transmission company and raised the Century Radio spectre as a disturbing precedent. We have also seen the inordinate delay in the roll-out of the new mobile phone service in Ireland as a result of a cumbersome selection mechanism for awarding the licence for the new operators. This has directly disadvantaged Irish consumers.</P>
    <P>I see a large number of potential legal potholes into which this Bill might yet fall before the DTT is established in Ireland. The manner of selection of the DTT transmission and multiplex companies is a lawyers' charter. I understand the cable companies have expressed serious legal reservations about what they perceive to be a discriminatory regime in the Bill for differential charging provisions across platforms &ndash; in other words, one platform can impose charges while another is prevented from doing so. This gives rise to serious concerns under EU competition laws. Given that such clear potential obstacles to the roll-out of DTT can be identified at this stage, it is incumbent on the Minister to try to anticipate and address these concerns rather than wait until the courts or the EU Commission intervenes and places the whole timescale back another 12 months. The Minister will not be thanked by the people if obstinacy overrules prudence on this issue.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Minister is unaware, or at least disregarding, of the great success of local broadcasting to date, and the lame deference to the idea of localised television services in Part V of the Bill suggests as much. It seems that local services, if they are introduced, will be conveyed only to those who enjoy and pay for MMDS or cable. This accounts for about 650,000 homes out of 1.1 million or more. Those areas not served by these systems are to have no local service and those who cannot or will not pay for a cable or MMDS connection must also do without it. It is also the case that the charge by cable or MMDS will itself constitute a barrier to establishing these services because the local broadcasters will not have confidence that they will reach a sufficient audience. What is the objection to reserving a <Col N="57" /> multiplex, or even half a multiplex, for local services? Is it that somebody, whether in the Minister's Department, the ODTR or RTÉ, got the engineering wrong? Is it too late to correct this? Can I look forward to viewing Kerry TV on the same channel frequency as the Minister will view Clare TV? </P>
    <P>In the matter of stimulating investment, creating jobs and adding to the range of broadcasting available to the viewer, local services have considerable advantages over national channels. They tap into local investment which would not otherwise be available to broadcasting, they open whole new streams of advertising revenue which national stations cannot access due to price and, in audience terms, they provide cohesion within the community. I am assured there is nothing inherent in DTT that prevents the reservation of a multiplex for this purpose. It simply requires that the transmission system is built appropriately. Should we not now include an obligation on the designated transmission company to deliver this vital and exciting service and leave the provision of it to the wit and ingenuity so manifest in the success of local radio?</P>
    <P>Localisation might solve another long-running problem of the Minister's predecessor's creation. I refer to the vexed matter of the deflector groups which serve communities that would otherwise be denied access to multi-channel television. As I understand it, these groups have been temporarily licensed by the ODTR and those licences may well be extended for a further year. It also seems that when the DTT system is switched on, some at least of these groups will have to cease their activities. This has to do with the allocation of frequencies base spectrum, as it is called.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of unhappiness in many communities that an adequate local system is to be displaced by the heavy handed imposition of a national system. Some more sensitive consideration of localisation could guarantee these groups a continuing part in local broadcasting services and in all probability resolve this long-running and deeply felt dispute.</P>
    <P>In this context the Bill is not reassuring to the outlying communities which have been grossly neglected by Irish broadcasting. I see nothing to guarantee them inclusion in this wonderful new system. Is it possible that in one stroke they will be deprived of their existing community-organised service while not being included in the new service which has displaced it? I should like the Minister's formal answer to that question. As I understand it, something of the order of 40% of Gaeltacht homes cannot receive TG4, which is absurd. The Minister is not only responsible for broadcasting; she is also Minister for the Gaeltacht. Will she ensure that this neglect is made good before the new system is introduced?</P>
    <P>The whole issue of access to multi-channel services and particularly the main UK services remains mysteriously unresolved by the Bill. There is provision in section 9 (6) for a multiplex to be reserved for material supplied by the rather <Col N="58" /> curiously defined &ldquo;person who provides a broadcasting service in Northern Ireland&rdquo;. There is however nothing to guarantee that this &ldquo;person&rdquo; will provide the services to which we have become accustomed, namely, BBC, UTV and Channel 4. As the Minister presents the Bill in this House she may be reserving a multiplex to BSkyB and Rupert Murdoch for all we know. This is a serious flaw that requires correction.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify a few matters similarly ignored in the Bill? Will this &ldquo;person&rdquo; pay carriage fees to the multiplex operator to carry their signal as we see that our own broadcasters must? If not, they will be at a substantial advantage over our local broadcasters. If they pay such fees will the Minister not have created the most unholy copyright mess? What will be the position when RTÉ transmits a UK programme to which it has bought Irish rights, and the multiplex operator re-broadcasts the same programme on the original UK service? Will that multiplex transmission not infringe RTÉ's rights? Who should sue whom in those circumstances?</P>
    <P>Thus far I have concentrated on the DTT system in terms of television broadcasting as we have known it. It can, as we know, provide a great deal more. Can the Minister explain what interactive service the system will offer and compare the services so offered to those that will be available through cable or MMDS services? It seems the way her Department and the others concerned with the engineering of the system have decided to configure the DTT system has ignored a fantastic opportunity to bring the benefits of interactivity to all the people. In doing so the Minister is doing two things. Firstly, those with the funds and access to cable systems will have far greater access to data. The less well-off and those living in the more outlying districts will have a great deal less access. In doing this she is greatly exacerbating both polarisation in society in terms of distribution of wealth and further disadvantaging rural communities. This issue has very serious social and educational implications. I ask her to attend to it.</P>
    <P>It is in the Minister's power to require that this new technology is so configured as to provide interactivity at a level exceeding that achieved by most domestic Internet users. It will cost money, but unlike W.T. Cosgrave who saw the value of radio in 1926 in an impoverished war-wracked country, or Seán Lemass in 1960 who was trying to lay the foundations of our modern economy, this Government has access to resources of which those earlier legislators would not dare dream. Why then is the Minister either deliberately or recklessly denying access to such new technologies to so many who are already being left behind as our economy and our society roar forward?</P>
    <P>I said earlier this is a bad Bill. The Oireachtas waited two years for its introduction. The Minister had that time, yet it has taken another 20 months to bring the Bill this far. She might usefully have produced a consolidation of broadcast<Col N="59" /> ing legislation in that time but she chose not to. She produced this sad exercise in doing the minimum and ignoring the rest. I appeal to the Minister to take it back, do a proper job on it and return it as quickly as possible when it will be much more worthy of consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. Listening to Senator Coghlan's rather interesting contribution I could not help thinking that much of its theme was similar to that of his opposite number in the other House in his reply to the Second Stage debate. It is interesting to note that the words used were not extended to other contributions. In general, while people opposed elements of the Bill, they welcomed the broad thrust of it. That would be the consensus view here also but everybody is entitled to their opinion.</P>
      <P>In reading the Bill and the contributions I found that we are dealing with a complex, technical Bill dealing with settting up technology rather than conventional broadcasting legislation. I am not technologically minded although I know how to switch on a microphone and talk through the ether. When it comes to other elements of the technology of radio and television I have to refer to the experts. Having said that, the broad thrust of the Bill addresses the most immediate issues.</P>
      <P>As the Minister will acknowledge, this is the first major Bill since 1988. The legislation that set up Radio Teilifis Éireann is 40 years old and there have not been any fundamental changes in broadcasting legislation since then. The Minister will agree it is difficult to legislate in a fast-moving technological environment. What is fashionable today could be out of date tomorrow. We have only to look at the upgrading of PCs. One is told as one is buying a PC the chances are that it will be out of date within 12 months. It will do the work you want it to do. Obviously, we may be back here again at some future date, although I would like to think from reading the Bill that the Minister has covered all the bases.</P>
      <P>There will be greater choice as a result of technological innovation. That choice extends far beyond what the original drafters of broadcasting legislation envisaged. The Minister has addressed much of that here.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that broadcasting services should operate to a strong public service remit providing programmes of quality and also catering for minorities as well as mainstream issues. In general RTÉ has discharged that responsibility well. Television has produced some wonderful moments of homegrown talent while Radio One in particular has attempted to satisfy a broad constituency within its restrictive scheduling format.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RTÉ is seeking an increase in its licence fee. I intend to nail my colours firmly to the mast early in the debate and put on record that the Minister and the Government should look favourably but critically on this request. Put simply, if we want <Col N="60" /> public service broadcasting as outlined in the Bill we must resource it or else throw RTÉ to the tender mercy of the marketplace. In a competitive television and radio environment unless RTÉ as the national broadcaster is resourced adequately it will have little choice but to dumb down along the lines mentioned by Senator Coghlan. Sadly, I have to use as an example what I would refer to as the dumbing down of Network 2 within the national broadcasting station. It is a mish-mash of American sitcoms and the excesses of programmes that, I suggest, appeal to the lowest common cultural denominator. That is the future now unless it is adequately resourced. That may sound like a contradiction. I think I am right in saying that the individual who was responsible for reshaping and restyling Network 2 has now left this country. I am not talking like a little Englander but I always found it difficult to understand that somebody from a different culture and environment could fully understand us by transplanting himself into this culture and this environment and then trying to reshape a radio or television network from a national perspective.</P>
    <P>In the UK the development of an alternative television channel meant that BBC 1 was complemented by BBC 2, which became an arts and documentary style television transmission station with a very loyal and significant audience. Channel 4 was developed as the alternative to the mainstream ITV populist programming. It has also established itself with a very impressive track record of documentaries, films and many other aspects of good quality programming. I wish Network 2 had taken the same route. Perhaps it is not too late.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to put an end to the scandal of the two tier education system in Ireland brought about by the inequality within higher and further education and training; and demands a fair and equitable grant system to facilitate this.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to this beautifully refurbished House and I hope we will have a stimulating debate. Nobody could disagree that the education system must play a more effective role in breaking the cycle of inequality and deprivation which still exists in Ireland, despite the enormous economic advances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In theory, the primary and second level sectors in education prepare young entrants for third level education. We know that at every stage of the education system young people fall away from the path of achievement because of poverty and deprivation. It is a scandal that so many young people can be deprived of an education which would help improve their quality of life. <Col N="61" /> This is partly due to their parents' inability to meet the very real costs of ongoing education. We know &ndash; it is repeated like a mantra in society &ndash; that educational disadvantage lies at the heart of poverty and marginalisation. We also know that when other societies talked about improvements in the socio-economic realm the mantra was &ldquo;education, education, education&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is determined that every young person should have equal access to all stages of the educational process and that every school leaver should have an equal chance of receiving an effective third level education. This is not the case at present. We cannot talk about third level in isolation. I support high quality pre-school education because early intervention is essential. Early remedial intervention is also required, in addition to sufficient resources for primary schools to provide an adequate system and to ensure that disadvantaged children do not fall between the cracks.</P>
    <P>At second level Fine Gael has identified coherent policies which underline the partnership approach to embrace all those within the education system and the wider community. Tackling educational disadvantage is a priority and we have called for existing policies to be tested for their effectiveness and to ensure that the successes we identify can be built upon. One of the policies set out by Fine Gael is the establishment of an education development authority to support teacher training, new methods and new policies in school. We have pointed to the fact that over 30 State agencies provide support and advice to small businesses, their managers and staff, yet no State agency provides support and advice for schools.</P>
    <P>According to the USI policy paper on student financial support, students from poorer backgrounds &ldquo;are still grossly underrepresented in third level education&rdquo;. We all know this is true. Participation at third level by pupils from disadvantaged family backgrounds is chronically low. We have identified key policy initiatives which will help to combat this. The first is the development of a coherent alternative entry system for students from disadvantaged backgrounds who have not come through the leaving certificate points race. This would include a quota of places and a coherent accreditation system for establishing that eligibility. All third level colleges should be required to develop strategies for the successful attainment of targets in terms of the intake of pupils through this system and to integrate the students into college. Back-up services must be available for them.</P>
    <P>Third level colleges should form relationships with particular designated disadvantaged schools to ease the transition to college and provide an orientation programme to help students adapt to third level. Each year the cost of accommodation and other elements should be assessed to decide the structural amount of maintenance grants payable. Many of us who operate at county council and local government level know that timing is <Col N="62" /> an important aspect of the provision of grants. We are too familiar with cases of hardship where the up front costs of students cannot be met because they have not received the grants on time. This has been alleviated to an extent, but it is still a problem.</P>
    <P>The lack of adequate financial support has been identified as one of the most fundamental barriers for students from less socially advantaged backgrounds. Proof of this is the most recent figures which show that groups that have traditionally the lowest participation in higher education, that is, the children of other so called manual and non-manual workers, have had the lowest increase in participation in higher education. Although there have been increases in participation at higher level, the rate of increase for those less advantaged groups is far less than what is acceptable.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a great grasp of detail and he will know that income limits for grants are judged on the basis of joint parental income, regardless of whether students are financially dependent on their parents. The limits are far too low, particularly in view of the real value of the grant. Figures provided following a Union of Students in Ireland survey on the cost of attending college show that rent amounts to 41% of the total monthly budget of a student living away from home in the Dublin area. Maintenance grant increases from 1997 to 2000, inclusive, amounted to 9%, while the rent increases amounted to a whopping 94%. What does this mean for students who make it to college and try to survive on a grants system which provides a measly £49 per week? They must take up part-time work to ease the financial burden. This pressure can result in much higher non-completion rates for these students. In other words, those who find it most difficult to get to college are then faced with even more barriers to the successful completion of their courses. This is perpetuating a cycle which must be broken.</P>
    <P>A report based on a research project emanating from the Educational Research Centre in Drumcondra in August 2000 was cited in the <i>Irish Independent</i>. This suggested that within institutes of technology, the non-completion rate was on average 40% for students who began their courses in 1995. For example, of 11,175 students who enrolled in 11 institutes of technology in the academic year 1995-96, 42.61% did not finish their courses. The vast majority either dropped out in first year or failed. In engineering and computing courses, half the students did not complete their courses.</P>
    <P>According to the Union of Students in Ireland, finances are a key cause of these non-completion rates. However, there are other issues. A survey carried out by the head of counselling services at the Dublin Institute of Technology followed the progress of 262 degree students during their first two years in college &ndash; not a happy experience for some of the students. Some 40 of them experienced some level of distress by the second year, <Col N="63" /> ten were at risk of becoming severely distressed, dropping out or even at risk of committing suicide, 30 had left college and the non-completion rate over the two years was 11.5%.</P>
    <P>The most vulnerable were not necessarily students who struggled academically. The major factors were age, which I found interesting. It seems the older we get, the harder it is to change our spots. Mature students found it more difficult than younger students to adapt to student life. The second major factor was finance. Students with little or no financial support from home were also at risk. There were other issues such as unstable family backgrounds and first generation students, that is, students from families without a tradition of post-compulsory education. If one aligns that to those who are financially strapped, one can see the great problems that arise.</P>
    <P>In 1999 a study in Carlow, Dundalk and Tralee Institutes of Technology also found that finance was a central cause of non-completion of courses. Lack of finance also deterred students from accepting college places in the first place. Presumably this also deters others from attempting to secure a college place. In 1999, the Higher Education Authority published a report by Professor Pat Clancy based on a postal survey of over 11,000 students who turned down the offer of a college place from the CAO. The report showed that one in ten applicants rejected an offer because of concern about the financial cost of going to college.</P>
    <P>In comparison to the rest of Europe, Ireland is one of only six countries who give support solely to the students and, of those six, we have the lowest level of support. We have the worst system of student financial support in Europe. Grants need to be realistic, covering the basic cost of living for the students. It is not right that access to university, in particular, is still so heavily weighted in favour of the relatively well off. We do not need any more pilot schemes. We must insist that the proportion of young people going on to third level education is the same regardless of their background.</P>
    <P>Proposals from the Union of Students in Ireland are that grants should be increased immediately in line with social welfare levels to cover basic costs. I am aware their proposals would double the cost of student support schemes which amount to more than £80 million. I am aware also that the Minister is on record as saying he would favour increasing the level of grants if resources became available. I would urge him to honour that promise, as resources are available, by providing realistic increases in grants. A very good argument has been made by the USI who say this would represent real value for money. They say that if 33% of first year students in the IT sector alone are not completing their courses, this represents a loss to the taxpayer of almost £25 million. Increasing the grants substantially would help to realise the potential of our invest<Col N="64" /> ment, including savings at PLC and university level.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take cognisance of these points and realise that we cannot perpetuate disadvantage. We must use every means to ensure we have a fair, just and equitable society. Education is one of the key means to ensure this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
      <P>Before becoming a Member of the Seanad, I was a teacher for many years in a second level school in Sexton Street, Limerick, a disadvantaged area. It was a great boost to the school recently when the Minister visited it to open a science block. All my teaching life I had the experience of a tiny number of girls from that school having an opportunity to take up third level education. This is now changing, given that students have access to post leaving certificate courses run by the teachers in the school who responded to falling numbers and looked at other educational possibilities for the students who could not take up third level education, by which I mean universities and institutes of technology. Perhaps these students may have an opportunity to do PLC courses but it does not mean they do not have the intelligence to go the University of Limerick, for instance, of which I am a member of the governing authority. It is difficult to tell students they have the choice to go to third level college when we know they will not survive there.</P>
      <P>Senator Keogh referred to the fact that there should be liaison between third level and second level education. A mentoring process operates between the University of Limerick and St. Enda's whereby the university students help the second level students with their homework. They also try to give them the confidence to fill in their chief executive officer forms and apply for university places and, if they go to college, they are given a support structure within the college. This is to be lauded, but when we consider the returns in the University of Limerick, there is very little progress each year. Despite all the positive action by the second level colleges and universities, there is little or no progress. I am not saying it is all doom and gloom but things are moving very slowly.</P>
      <P>Given the Celtic tiger economy and the fact that the prospects of employment are so great, the option of taking up third level education is diminishing because economically and socially people feel they must take up employment. It was different in the past when people may have been pushed into third level education. They knew they needed further education to get employment but nowadays they are being employed instantly. If one comes from a low income family, while the grants system will enhance the prospects of going to college, it will not realistically allow a student to remain there. The prospect of employment is very attractive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received feedback from the students who are sitting the alternative leaving certificate <Col N="65" /> which one of the Members present, as part of an Oireachtas committee, was responsible for developing. I know there is a skills shortage and I accept that the alternative leaving certificate is designed to address this problem and allow students to develop these much needed skills. At present, however, we are obliged to bring in workers with such skills from overseas. We have reached a watershed in terms of whether we should encourage students to make the choice between entering the workforce &ndash; this, perhaps, is the easiest option &ndash; or taking up third level education. These students are already being enticed, on foot of newspaper advertisements, to enter the workforce. I am not saying that is not a good development but it is removing the option of entering third level education from their grasp because they have seen what happened to brothers or sisters who may have taken the plunge and who were forced to drop out not because they failed examinations but because they could not survive financially.</P>
    <P>I regularly meet past pupils who inform me that they were obliged to leave third level education because they had to work so hard to earn the money to supplement their grants and because their parents had made huge sacrifices to support them. My heart bleeds for these individuals because, as students, they worked tremendously hard to obtain a third level place. It must be very disheartening to have to leave third level education because one cannot study and work the long hours one is expected to work. Many of the individuals to whom I refer earn less than £4 per hour.</P>
    <P>I have in my possession statistics provided by the Union of Students in Ireland which show the amount of time students spend working. I do not know how any of them can combine work and study, particularly at a young age when their health may not always be 100% because they are obliged to skip proper meals and eat junk food. By and large, these students cannot continue with their studies.</P>
    <P>I had understood that the special project team investigating grants was to present its report before the end of March. I hope that still is the case. I believe the group was charged with considering the level of grant increases and also the method of payment. I spoke to a student recently who only received the grant due to her from September in January. As local representatives, we receive many telephone calls from people asking us to contact vocational education committees or county councils to find out when they will receive their grants. I do not know how people survive until they receive their grants. It is as if they do not have physical needs. This is such a complicated matter that we could debate it at length on another occasion.</P>
    <P>I represent in the constituency of Limerick East in which are situated the University of Limerick, Mary Immaculate College, the Limerick Institute of Technology &ndash; of which the College of Art and Design is a part &ndash; and many PLC <Col N="66" /> colleges. I have spoken to many students; therefore, I am not solely dependent on the statistics provided by the USI in respect of this matter. However, those statistics show that for accommodation students at the University of Limerick, who receive a grant of approximately £49 per week, pay £45 for a single room in a house with five other occupants. In addition, they spend £30 on food, £22 on electricity, telephone and refuse charges, £15 on books and college materials &ndash; this figure fluctuates at different times throughout the year &ndash; and £25 on entertainment and transport. One could argue about whether they should spend £25 on entertainment, but it costs quite an amount to go to the cinema or have a few drinks. In any event, I was shocked to discover that each week they spend £137. Even if they cut out their entertainment costs and remained at home to study, these people would still have to pay their other costs and it is unrealistic to expect them to do so on a grant of £49 per week.</P>
    <P>The level of grant available does not reflect increases in inflation, neither is it cognisant of the weekly costs incurred by the average student. It is much more attractive for some students to claim a social welfare allowance of £76 per week and a rent allowance rather than making a commitment to spending three or four years living off £49 per week. That is another consideration in respect of which I would have liked to have had more time to develop my arguments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann commends the Government for the steps it has taken to increase investment in further and higher education, to broaden education opportunities and to ensure that our education system responds effectively to emerging skill needs, thus contributing to continued economic success.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to commend the Government on the steps it has taken in respect of this matter. I have worked as a teacher and career guidance counsellor in one of the most disadvantaged areas of the north inner city and I am in a position to state that the position has changed dramatically to that which obtained ten years ago. Nothing was done by successive Governments and I do not see how Opposition Members can suddenly state that they are the people who will solve this problem. I intend to list the improvements that have been made since the Government took office. I will concentrate on only a few of these because so many have been introduced that one could spend an hour and a half listing all that has been done and what will be done in the future. I cannot agree with suggestions that nothing has been done and that we are at a standstill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, has given priority to the allevi<Col N="67" /> ation of disadvantage in higher and further education. He has done this through the provision of a special fund for students with disabilities which in 1999 amounted to £700,000 and which has risen to £1.2 million this year. That is a significant increase. The special fund operates under the aegis of the Department and provides funding to students with disabilities who are attending courses in third level institutions and those taking post-leaving certificate courses. It provides grant assistance towards the cost of special equipment, special materials, technological aids, targeted transport services, personal assistants and sign language interpreters.</P>
    <P>The Minister also increased the provision for the student assistance access fund which is administered by third level institutions and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them in remaining in college to complete their studies. A sum of £1.96 million was allocated to this fund in the year 2000. This significant increase on the previous allocation of £1.26 million will allow greater support to be immediately given to disadvantaged students.</P>
    <P>Since 1996 the Department has provided funding, through the Higher Education Authority, to the universities for the targeted initiative which is aimed at widening the access for young people from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds. This initiative involves links with second level schools which are designated as disadvantaged and includes liaison and outreach work. There are two aspects to the programmes which operate under the initiative. The first involves the provision of assistance to students to meet the points requirement for courses, thus enabling them to obtain a college place through the standard CAO entry procedure. There are, for example, monitoring programmes and summer schools for potential students. The second aspect of these programmes involves a number of special entry arrangements through which more flexible entry criteria are applied. Various supports are put in place for students entering by this method.</P>
    <P>The initiative to which I refer deals with second level schools and third level colleges. It provides after school study to help students from disadvantaged backgrounds and allows them to access and become familiar with third level institutions. That initiative was only put in place six years ago and it is now being taken on by many schools throughout the country. Parents who cannot provide study facilities at home welcome the fact that such facilities can be made available after school in order to allow their children to gain access to third level education.</P>
    <P>The national development plan makes provision for a third level access fund, the allocation for which is £95 million. This fund will meet the specific needs of students with disabilities in terms of making possible the provision of equipment and support services. It provides financial support to disadvantaged students by way of <Col N="68" /> additional support to existing maintenance grants. It also develops outreach initiatives currently undertaken by a number of third level institutions which involve links with second level schools and community groups designed to assist students to meet the points requirements for the standard CAO entry procedures and to provide complementary special entry arrangements. This project also expands the provision of particular services such as counselling and monitoring services to meet the needs of non-traditional students.</P>
    <P>Last September the Minister announced the establishment of a millennium partnership fund for disadvantaged people, providing £1 million in 2001. This fund will be administered by the Department in conjunction with area partnerships. It will build on the experience of the support schemes for students from disadvantaged families and will be operated by Dublin Northside Partnership which assists students to participate in higher education. The area partnerships will be invited to submit proposals.</P>
    <P>When the Minister established the action group on access to third level education he announced as an initial step and pending the group's recommendations, the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders targeted at those most in need. The full rates of the special maintenance grants include increases over the standard rate from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from their college and from £710 to £1,000 for students residing within 15 miles of the college.</P>
    <P>Some 40% of third level students qualify for maintenance grants and almost 120,000 students are involved in third level education. Last year expenditure on the schemes was in the region of £90 million which does not include the free fees initiative.</P>
    <P>Many more issues and projects could be outlined. In the past few years there have been significant improvements regarding the socially excluded. This Government has introduced many projects to include disadvantaged people. I see this at first hand on the ground. I work with career guidance teachers, home-school liaison officers, higher education authorities and third level institutions in defining how best we can provide easy access for students who feel ill at ease in third level education and who cannot take such places due to financial constraints. We are on target to achieve this objective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to set out the measures taken by the Government to increase investment in further and higher education, to broaden educational opportunities and to ensure we meet the skills needs of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to put this debate in perspective. Much has been done over the past three years. Many other good measures were introduced before that but in the past three years there has been an unprecedented increase of over 40% in expendi<Col N="69" /> ture on education. Last year 62,000 students sat the leaving certificate and there were 57,000 places available to them on further or higher education courses. The number and range of options for students has been increased significantly.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman welcomed the manner in which the number of PLCs have been increased. Such courses have been valuable to many students. Not every student wishes to go to university and not every student will receive the best education in a university. There are also institutes and further and higher education establishments.</P>
    <P>When this Government took office three and a half years ago there were 100,000 students in higher education. Today the figure is almost 120,000, an increase of 20%. Having expanded third level opportunities, the Government has ensured that Ireland is well within the top quarter of OECD countries in terms of under-graduate provision for traditional school leavers. This was the strategic objective identified by the de Buitléir review.</P>
    <P>Never before have school leavers had such a multiplicity of opportunities across an increasingly diversified higher education system. Having substantially broadened participation at third level, the Government is committed to ensuring equality of access and participation at that level. In further education, the numbers enrolled on PLC courses increased from 18,000 in 1996-97 to almost 24,400 in 1999-2000. Over the same period the number of approved places on Youthreach programmes run by FÁS and vocational education committees increased by 2,600 to over 7,100. The number of participants in VTOS programmes has also increased over the same period from 4,300 to 5,300 in 2000.</P>
    <P>Last year the budget for education was £3.29 billion, this year it is £3.7 billion. In 2000 the allocation for higher and further education was £865 million. In 2001 the allocation for higher and further education will exceed £1 billion for the first time. This represents an increase of 18.5% on the previous year.</P>
    <P>Since 1997 capital funding at higher level has increased from £36 million in 1997 to £123 million last year and £173 million this year, a massive increase of 370% over the 1997 figure. Expenditure on further education in the period 1996-2000 increased from £38 million to £87.6 million. It is estimated that expenditure will reach £107 million in 2001. This does not include teaching costs or PLC student grants costs. These figures show the priority the Government gives to education and its commitment to education as a means of promoting social inclusion and social and economic development.</P>
    <P>When I took over the education and science portfolio in January 2000 I pledged to give priority to alleviating disadvantage as it related to under-represented groups at third level. I have kept this pledge. I am tackling disadvantage as a priority and will illustrate this commitment with some comparative financial provisions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" /> In 2000 the allocation for disadvantaged students at third level was under £3.5 million. For 2001 I have increased that allocation by £12 million to £16 million. This is more than a fourfold increase. By any standards this represents a quantum leap in support for disadvantaged students. In addition, the provision for the Higher Education Authority now includes over £3 million for initiatives in the university sector.</P>
    <P>However, I am not content to simply funnel additional funding into the area of disadvantage. I am anxious that such funding becomes available in the context of a co-ordinated framework to promote access by disadvantaged students. Notwithstanding the significant reduction in inequality, participation in higher education remains skewed by social class, with disadvantaged students continuing to be under-represented. The goal of achieving equity in higher education is, therefore, a central pillar of my education policy.</P>
    <P>The Government has provided for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period up to 2006. This is aimed at tackling under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities. I established an action group on access to third level last September to advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote access by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities to third level education. I expect to receive the report of this group shortly.</P>
    <P>In the further education sector, a guidance, counselling and psychological service was introduced on a pilot basis in 1998 and has since been expanded. A survey conducted in 1999 revealed that more than 1,700 trainees and almost 400 staff have benefited from this service. As regards VTOS programmes, an extra allowance of £25 per week on top of social welfare payments and other allowances was introduced in September 1999 as an incentive to encourage the most marginalised to return to education and training.</P>
    <P>The provision for adult literacy has been increased substantially from a base of £0.85 million in 1997 to £10.7 million this year. Our plan is to provide £74 million over the next five years for adult literacy. This will provide for an estimated 113,000 clients.</P>
    <P>Over £1 billion will be invested over the period 2000 to 2006 on a back to education initiative aimed primarily at adults in the population who have not completed upper second level education. This will be provided through the expansion of Youthreach, traveller, post-leaving certificate courses and the vocational training opportunities scheme options on a part-time basis. An adult information and communications technologies basic skills programme will be implemented as part of this measure. Over the lifetime of the national development plan, more than 320,000 participants will benefit from the back to education initiative.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> As regards student maintenance grants, my approach has been to follow the practice of recent years and increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. In 1997 the previous Government increased the grants by only 1.6%. In contrast, last year I increased them by 5%. This Government has also ensured better treatment of mature students studying at third level by revising the schemes so that, with effect from the 1999-2000 academic year, all eligible mature students now qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of grant, which is £1,775.</P>
    <P>I also announced late last year that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants and other student supports to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. Issues relating to the implementation of the team's recommendations will be addressed when its report has been completed.</P>
    <P>The development of the post-leaving certificate courses has been one of our great successes. During the life of the previous Government, there was definitely a two tier system in operation &ndash; eligible higher level students qualified for free fees and maintenance grants while their counterparts in PLC courses did not. We fulfilled our pledge in the programme for Government and ended the total neglect of this sector by the previous Government. Accordingly, since September 1998 participants on all PLC courses now have free fees and they are eligible to apply for means tested maintenance grants. The rates of grant, income limits and other criteria for eligibility are similar to those which apply to the third level student support schemes. In 2000 the cost of this measure amounted to £7.830 million. In this academic year there are 24,900 full-time PLC places available compared with 18,700 in 1996-97.</P>
    <P>The free fees initiative under which the State meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses has made a real difference in the lives of many parents and of their children who wish to attend higher and further education. Last year expenditure on free fees was in the region of £158 million. When combined with the cost of other student support schemes, the total cost to my Department in 2000 was almost £250 million.</P>
    <P>The Government also introduced special tax incentives in the 1999 Finance Act to encourage the provision of student rented residential accommodation. This was in recognition of the difficulties being encountered by students with rent costs and following consultation with third level colleges. The availability of tax incentives in the past resulted in the provision of a significant number <Col N="72" /> of student residences. As the tax relief will be available for expenditure up to 31 March 2003, the opportunity exists to create significant additional accommodation for third level students. As indicated in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government will be evaluating the impact of these tax incentives and will consider further action in the light of the results of the evaluation. These tax incentives are intended to increase the availability of dedicated student housing and represent a targeted response to the underlying issue of an accommodation shortage. These Government incentives have been highly successful. As a result, there are now 1,925 bed spaces completed and 10,744 in planning. This gives a total of 12,669 bed spaces being provided through the direct action of the Government as a result of the tax incentives.</P>
    <P>A number of important tax reliefs have been introduced in recent years in respect of fees paid for third level education for approved full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in approved private colleges, approved part-time undergraduate courses in approved private and publicly funded colleges, approved full-time third level courses in other EU member states and full-time and part-time approved postgraduate courses in private and publicly funded colleges in the State and similar courses in a university or publicly funded college in another EU member state.</P>
    <P>I launched the designate National Qualifications Authority of Ireland last November. The authority will establish and maintain a framework of qualifications based on standards of knowledge, skill or competence to be acquired by learners in all institutes, colleges and places of further and higher education and training. It will also facilitate lifelong learning and promote access, transfer and progression for all learners, including those who have special needs. An important feature of the work of the new authority will be to ensure the recognition of Irish qualifications internationally and of outside qualifications here. It is also my intention to establish the Higher Education and Training Awards Council &ndash; HETAC &ndash; and the Further Education and Training Awards Council &ndash; FETAC &ndash; on a statutory basis within the next few months.</P>
    <P>The inextricable link between education and economic development is well recognised. A prerequisite to sustaining the unprecedented rates of job growth experienced over the recent past is the ongoing output of highly qualified personnel. Without the expansion of our education system, the recent growth experience would not have happened. However, it is not sufficient to expand educational provision in isolation. We must ensure this expansion is relevant to the changing business environment and the emerging skills needs.</P>
    <P>In this context, the Government established the business education and training partnership in November 1997. The partnership's role is to <Col N="73" /> develop strategies to tackle the issues of skill needs, manpower forecasting and education and training for business. The partnership has provided a framework within which business and education co-operation can be fostered and channelled into joint action. For its part, the Government has responded quickly and positively to each need identified and has allocated substantial additional funding, both capital and current, to provide extra places in PLC courses and at third level to meet the skills needs of the economy. In the PLC sector, I provided £2.1 million to equip 37 centres to deliver courses in applied languages and information technology and electronic technician programmes.</P>
    <P>New institutes have been established in Blanchardstown and Dún Laoghaire, and the Tipperary Rural Business and Development Institute has been opened. The range of courses offered has been increased dramatically and links with industry have been developed to ensure the relevance of the programmes offered. The accelerated technician programmes, which were introduced by the institutes of technology in January 1998 in manufacturing technology, have since been expanded to include information technology. Building on the success of the accelerated technician programmes and summer courses I am making provision for the launch of a new technician programme in the near future. This programme, the institute trainee programme, will aim to further develop national skill provision in areas identified and emerging skill shortages. The institute trainee programme will be a study and work based programme and will involve close partnership and co-operation between industry, employers, institutes of technology and the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>In the area of apprenticeships the Government has taken steps to enable qualified apprentices to adapt more readily to the increasing demands of the current labour market while also providing opportunities for further education and training. Since 1996 the total apprenticeship population has been increased from 6,500 to over 24,000, an increase of 270%. These are dramatic and huge increases. To cater for this rapid expansion, apprenticeship provision in the education sector has been increased significantly. In the 1997-98 academic year we had capacity to train 4,000 apprentices in the institutes of technology. This capacity was increased to over 9,500 in the academic year 2000-01, a 130% increase.</P>
    <P>Our competitive advantage is firmly rooted in the strategic development of the economy as a knowledge based technologically advanced one. This requires the development of our knowledge capital, which is our human capital, namely, our people. The Government inherited a situation where the level of funding for third level research in Ireland was among the lowest in the OECD. Clearly, this is not consistent with our economic and social policy needs and aspirations. Recognising the strong link between investment in the research and innovation base of the economy and <Col N="74" /> sustained economic growth the Government is intent on creating a world class research environment in our higher education sector. Investment in research in recent years has been increased significantly. There was no dedicated funding for research under the last Government. Under the national development plan this Government is providing £550 million for research in the education budget alone over the period 2000-06.</P>
    <P>The measures I have outlined are proof of our unmatched and undeniable commitment to education. The increased investment is a very clear demonstration of the importance the Government attaches to the role of education in promoting equality of opportunity and social and economic development. We will forge ahead with our plans in education to tackle social inclusion and the skills needs of our buoyant economy. We aim to ensure that every young person has the opportunity and support to benefit fully from either higher or further education and training. From what I have outlined in brief it can be seen that there has been an enormous increase in investment in further and higher education. It is crucial at this stage that we provide support for those who are seeking further education and training as well as those seeking higher education in the universities. We have made outstanding progress to date and will do much more in the years ahead le cúnamh Dé.</P>

      <P>The Minister ended with the words &ldquo;le cúnamh Dé&rdquo;, with the help of God. There was another old expression which said with the help of God and a toothbrush, and I think in the light of what the Minister said, he might need the toothbrush as well as the help of God.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment Senators Keogh and Jackman for tabling this most timely motion. Like my colleagues on the Independent benches who represent the universities, I am sure we all received material from student officers. I received material from the education and welfare officers in Trinity College, making a very strong case along the lines of the motion. There is no question that in the middle of the period of the Celtic tiger we are developing a two-tier society. I am sure this is not what the Government wants, but it is happening. We see it dramatically in the health service, as illustrated on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; during the week, and we see it in education. The current maximum level of the grant paid to students whose parental home is more than 15 miles away is £49 per week. A copy of <i>Trinity News</i> shows a person sitting over a banner which says &ldquo;How would you like to try to live on £49?&rdquo;. That is the maximum grant while many qualifying students only receive £9. There is a mass of people outside the system. Thousands of students struggle every year to survive on pathetically low maintenance grants which do not even cover rent, while others get no assistance. What would happen if they all went on social welfare, even for six months? If they did <Col N="75" /> so the cost to the Government would be much more.</P>
    <P>The cut off limit for parents with less than four dependent children is £20,200. If both parents are working this represents an hourly rate of £5.50, which would be a scandal. Obviously, we have a two-tier system which must be addressed. No amount of waffle of statistics will cover the fact that such a situation exists and affects students.</P>
    <P>Without doubt there has been some improvement. It is clear that from the mid-1980s there was a detectable and consistent rate of increase of access from the most marginalised groups, but this has dramatically slowed down in the past six years, an unparalleled irony. We are in the most booming economy in Europe and we continually pay tribute to the fact that the driving engine of it is our education system in which we have invested substantially since the 1960s. However, we are still not doing what is required. This is not just the view of students or the university representatives in the House. Rather it is a view which has been expressed by people such as Garret FitzGerald, who looked at it from the point of view of an economic statistician. The title of his article in <i>The Irish Times</i> in support of the thrust of the motion read &ldquo;We preserve exclusive third level education at our peril&rdquo;. Indeed we do. As a distinguished visitor to the House remarked to me this evening, is it a healthy society if we continue to have judges, for example, drawn exclusively from Foxrock, one of the hidden effects of which is that we preserve a kind of class justice?</P>
    <P>I wish to quote what some other leaders of education have had to say. Danny O'Hare, the former president of Dublin City University, speaking at a commencement ceremony in 1998 said: &ldquo;I am ashamed to say university access in Ireland is still almost exclusively for the relatively well off, this in the light of article 28(c) of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child under which Ireland has committed itself to make higher education accessible to all on the basis of capacity by every appropriate means.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Provost of Trinity College, Dr. Tom Mitchell, is quoted as saying at the USI conference in March 1998 that &ldquo;the provision of grants of at least £3,000 a year to this special group of students from these particular disadvantaged backgrounds is an essential first step of any progress&rdquo;. He confirmed this view to me this afternoon by telephone. He feels that at a minimum these grants should be doubled.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the Minister and got the usual reply which put what the Government had done on record, provided the facts and figures and said that different commissions, committees and special projects had been established. I am not interested in different Governments scoring points against each other, but in students and their welfare. It is clear that the needs of students are not being met.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask a few questions. Although I welcome the present incumbent of the throne, I <Col N="76" /> am sorry that the Minister himself is not here. I am sure there will be answers from the Department although there are no civil servants present. The Minister referred to his announcement last year that he was setting up a special projects team. What has happened? It is supposed to report in March. The principal officer who was the driving force behind it has gone to the Department of Finance. The post has not yet been re-advertised. Where does this leave the report?</P>
    <P>I understand that the report of the action group on access has been completed. Has the Minister seen it? Why has he not been more forthcoming about it? Is it because, as I am reliably informed, the recommendations are that the grant should be increased to £3,000? This goes to only 7% of the student population. The Minister promised on 11 October 2000 an initial top up of £200 by January. There has been no sign of it. These are specific questions for the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister also spoke about targeting resources. They are already targeted at a small fraction of undergraduates. How much further can they be targeted? The Minister's remarks are worrying. This is an important area. There is no doubt that the most significant investment that any Government makes is in education. As the people on this side of the House have indicated, students from less advantaged backgrounds are still under represented at third level. This not the fault of one Government but currently the responsibility rests with the Minister.</P>
    <P>The recently published report of Professor Pat Clancy and Joy Wall, the fourth in a series which makes the same point, shows that colleges are failing to attract sufficient students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Progress made between 1986 and 1992 at reducing disparities between different socio-economic groups has suffered a setback. This is extraordinary considering recent economic developments. The participation rate of children of manual workers increased in that period from 11% to 23%, about half of the entrants to third level education. In the past six years participation by this group rose more slowly &ndash; barely 30% of them are entrants. Virtually 100% of children from the higher professional group become university students. It gets smaller as we go down the scale until it is a negligible proportion.</P>
    <P>There are also concealed discriminations. People from a manual labouring background are less likely to have the advantaged cultural grounding of those from a professional background. For example, books are not so available at home nor is encouragement from parents. A recent RTÉ radio programme focused on people at universities. I was particularly interested in the student at Trinity who came from the East Wall and was the first in the family to reach university. This influenced the family by encouraging the siblings to consider taking up third level education. This should be encouraged. It can be done by the <Col N="77" /> type of support discussed here. The most privileged group of children, from self-employed and professional backgrounds, increased participation most rapidly, up by 20% above the period between 1986 and 1992 to 82%. This must be close to saturation point.</P>
    <P>There is a serious point behind this motion. It has been inadequately addressed by the present Government, but I am not interested in comparing one with another. I am interested in the welfare of students. We must address the inequalities in our system. I would be grateful if in the House tonight or in written correspondence the Minister would answer the specific questions I raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate. I regret that the Minister for Education and Science could not stay to here all the contributions. However, I welcome my colleague from Cork North-Central, the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace.</P>
      <P>The issues raised are of fundamental importance. There are two aspects to consider. First is that the amount of the grant has fallen behind the cost of living, particularly for students away from home. Irrespective of which socio-economic groups attend college there is a need to increase the grant in line with the cost of accommodation and living away from home. I appeal to the Minister to target funds in this area.</P>
      <P>Students in CAO often opt for a college which they can attend from home. This is the wrong basis to make a choice for third level education and a career. If they prefer a college far from home, the size of the maintenance grant precludes this option. This is wrong and distorts free choice.</P>
      <P>To seek to relate the grant to students from certain socio-economic groups is to over simplify the matter. There is a range of factors involved in whether young people go to college besides the financial. If we are ever to make serious inroads into getting a more representative attendance at our third level institutions we will have to look at those factors. We have evidence for what I am saying. When the third level fees were abolished, that made little difference to participation at third level. Those who always went to third level, from the schools that always promoted their students for third level, continued to go without having to pay fees. The abolition of third level fees made no material difference to those whose parents and older siblings did not go to third level. There are statistics to prove that.</P>
      <P>While money is a factor in many ways, it is not the only factor and in my experience it is not the main factor. Other things must be put in place. We need to look at the experience of other countries. For example, in France there was a systematic programme in place at the upper stages of second level to encourage, facilitate and counsel students who traditionally did not go on to third level. By the time they came to entry age they were ready and willing to go to college. That has been happening in France for years and it is beginning to pay dividends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> In the United States they have mentoring systems and we are beginning to introduce them here. Students at tertiary level are prepared to come and listen to, talk to and encourage students who traditionally have not gone to college in order to induce them to change their minds and go on to third level education. We need to do these two things and we need to do a number of other things also.</P>
    <P>The battle to get young people to go to college begins very early on in primary education and is not limited to the schoolroom. In order to have a truly representative group of people at third level from areas where that has not been the practice we must seek to put education into the community. Through adult education programmes, we must build a community that at adult level values education for itself and in so doing values education for its children. We need to break down the psychological barrier that exists in families who have believed for generations that third level education is only for other people and not for them.</P>
    <P>We need to put the resources into the community. We need to create communities of education, building them up in particular areas as a scaffolding system to support young people to the point where they will want to go to college. They will be hungry for third level education where they will see the benefit in terms of personal growth, social development and career development.</P>
    <P>This is more important now than it ever was before because of the requirement for young people in the jobs market. Throughout the country there are signs in shop windows advertising job vacancies. If learning has become a slog for young people it is very attractive to give up the slog and to start earning money. They do not think in the long term. At 17, people do not think where they will be at 37; they think about having some pocket money to have more entertainment and liveliness in their daily lives without having to get money from their parents. Many of them simply take those kinds of jobs.</P>
    <P>That is a huge factor in draining people away from colleges of further education, which were thriving for the past 10 years. Those were valuable colleges for the sort of students we have been discussing this evening &ndash; the ones who did not want to or could not go to university. They did not feel that they could go to regional colleges or colleges of technology but went on to post leaving certificate courses &ndash; very often one-year certificate courses or two-year diploma courses. That led them on to various emerging jobs but those colleges are now seeing a big reduction in their enrolment. The issue raised here this evening deserves considerable additional attention from policy makers and planners. Whilst the money factor is of fundamental importance, the grants on their own will not bring to third level a cohort of people who have not come there before.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="79" /> This is a subject that I would like to see developed at greater length because it is of critical importance. Unless young people have a good standard of qualification, they will be very vulnerable in the future job market. We need to hold them in school and in college for as long and to as high a standard as we can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I will share my time with Senator McDonagh. This is a very important debate. I welcome the contribution on our side and indeed from the Minister and other speakers. Students going to college need be sure they can afford to pay the rent and to live on the very low incomes that they have. Everybody acknowledges that the grants are far too low and need to be improved.</P>
      <P>We also need to look after the health needs of those students. Some years ago all students had medical cards regardless of their parents' income. Most if not all students at third level are over 18 and are adults. I believe that all students ought to have medical cards regardless of the income of their parents. That would give security to all of them so that if they became ill they could go to the doctor and get medication if required. It is an important basic point and fundamental right. It is one that needs to be looked at again. It would be fair to everybody.</P>
      <P>As Senator Quill said, it is not just at third level that problems need to be addressed but also at first and second levels. A really important issue is the number of guidance teachers at second level and the time allocated to their classes. A school of about 1,000 students would be lucky to have two guidance teachers. Critical in the formation of students' views of what they are going to do, the careers they may follow and particularly whether they go to third level is the availability of the guidance teacher's time to advise the students. We need a significant increase in the numbers of guidance teachers so that they can guide, work with and advise all students. This is particularly true of those in the category whose prospects the Minister and all of us want to improve &ndash; people from lower income families, people from working class areas and people who have not historically gone into third level.</P>
      <P>When I went into my petrol station this morning there was a queue of ten people and there was only one person working behind the counter. There are no people to do this kind of job, either because part-time workers are not available or the wages are not good enough. In view of better jobs than the kind I am talking about, a lot of people are not finishing their second level education or are leaving early from third level. We need to support the people who have never been through this process. The people from the less well off families need to get more finance than people who are well off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a status issue in the Irish education system which pits the mainstream system against second chance education. I work <Col N="80" /> in the adult education sector and feel that the Government is not <i>au fait</i> with the difficulties. One has only to look at second chance education training centres to see those difficulties. Most centres for the Traveller community, young offenders, Youthreach and the vocational training opportunities scheme are in leased or dilapidated buildings, with many in poor condition and not purpose built.</P>
      <P>The majority of teachers on these programmes are part-time, and this makes for an unstable system as there is continuous movement of teachers as they try to better themselves with permanent positions. The teacher ratio is also disproportionate. In the VTOS, the ratio is 20:1, while in the mainstream and PLCs a 16:1 ratio prevails. A perfect example of inequality lies in the funding made available for the highly successful VTOS programmes. The total funding for a course with 20 students is £15,000 per year and this must fund the lease of the building, heating and lighting. It is a miniscule amount, leaving those involved in these programmes unable to renovate the buildings.</P>
      <P>Despite this, there has been huge success in job placement and job creation on these programmes. Students have no incentive to go to the VTOS programmes because, while they retain their social welfare allowance, there is no additional training allowance. Those on credits and dependent spouses get no payment at all. I was honoured to present certificates at a VTOS ceremony in Ballinasloe recently, and I was informed that 80 per cent of participants on this programme &ndash; about 150 people &ndash; over the last seven years had gained employment. The Industrial Development Authority tell us it costs over £150,000 to create one job.</P>
      <P>There is great inequality. These training centres have no gymnasiums, no recreation facilities, no sports fields. It is time the Government put an end to the scandal of the two-tier education system that has brought about this inequality. The entire adult education process must be looked at. The Minister may mention different Green Papers, White Papers and various promises, but I want to see action. I emphasise the hugely successful but under-funded VTOS programme. I hope the Government will respond positively to this worthwhile Fine Gael motion.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Wallace, to the House, and I am glad to see that he is fit and well again. I commend the Government for the steps they have taken to increase higher education grants. These will broaden educational opportunities and help meet the emerging skills requirements vital to maintaining our economic success. The grant fund increase for students with disabilities has increased from £700,000 in 1999 to £1.3 million in 2000 and that has enabled 500,000 students to avail of grants, up from 300,000 in 1999. The fund is to assist students with disability attend courses <Col N="81" /> at third and post-leaving certificate level. It provided much-needed aids in the area of special equipment, special materials and in technology.</P>
      <P>Technology has been targeted by this Government over the past three years. The funding given to special and primary schools for computers and laptops is an example. As someone associated with a special school, I have seen the benefits of this policy for children at primary level. These children had no way to fulfil their potential but now, with the aid of technology, they can develop in a meaningful way, as Senator Quill has also said. Children with disabilities can see their potential, as can their teachers, and that is in no small measure to do with technology funding.</P>
      <P>Special transport has been targeted by this funding, while it was previously overlooked. Disabled students often failed to take advantage of available facilities as transport requirements were not in place. If they got to the required location, there were environmental impediments to school access. Personal assistance, without which it is impossible for many to attend schools, is also targeted. These matters are being put right, although there is a great distance to go. We have to ensure that the playing field is level and that disabled people have the same access as the able-bodied to all facilities. Stanford University literature suggested that a liaison officer for people with disabilities was helpful. This system attacked discrimination within their network and the Minister should consider the Stanford example. Funding for students with dyslexia is also welcome.</P>
      <P>One of the schools in Senator Costello's and my area, Cabra, has benefited from teacher supports and computers. I welcome the funding provided through the Higher Education Authority to the universities to widen access for people from disadvantaged area. It involves links with second level schools that are designated as disadvantaged, liaison and outreach work. In 2000 the funding for this was almost doubled, and this has and will have major significance in the lives of students living in those areas.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Norris that example can often be given to a smaller child by an older child. If a younger child sees his or her older brother or sister benefiting from the education system, that will be the springboard for those from disadvantaged areas to find their way into third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister announce the introduction of the millennium partnership which involves third level schools, industry, communities and other agencies interacting within communities. It is a welcome development and I commend the Minister for it. He suggested that approximately 40% of third level students qualified for maintenance grants out of 120,000, but that is not enough. More needs to be done to bring a greater number of students into the network. The Minister increased the income threshold limit by 5% in the 2000-01 academic year and he also increased by 5% the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in <Col N="82" /> respect of other family members who are considering entering third level or advanced education.</P>
    <P>Senator Keogh mentioned the difference between primary and secondary school levels, but another inequality concerns voluntary secondary schools which are not funded on the same basis as community and comprehensive schools. A submission will be sent to the Minister in respect of the Blackstock report which has examined this issue. It is only fair that all secondary schools should be treated in the same way. Funding should be provided for basic necessities, including insurance, secretaries and caretakers. No secondary school should be without a secretary or caretaker. These areas of inequality should be examined and I know that will be done. I commend the Minister for all his good work and I look forward to having many more debates with him concerning education.</P>

      <P>The motion refers to a scandal, and this matter qualifies as a scandal for two reasons. First, in terms of inequality at third level, there has been no significant improvement. Despite all the attention that, allegedly, has been paid to this issue over the past 20 years, the figures show that access rates have improved only marginally. Third level education is still the preserve of those students who come from well-off families. Second, it is a scandal because the importance of third level education is increasing all the time. In the past, a third level degree was something nice to have, no more than that. It has always been the guarantee of a better job and higher earnings throughout a career, but now it has become much more. Increasingly, it has become a necessary feather in one's cap in order to progress beyond the basic stage in almost any occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time has come to reassess our efforts in this area. For too long we have been saying, &ldquo;Of course, we're not doing enough but at least we are moving in the right direction and making progress&rdquo;. I want to hear the Minister say &ndash; he did not say it tonight, although I was impressed with what he did say &ndash; that what we have been doing has not worked and we are not making worthwhile progress in that direction. I listened to what Senator Ormonde and the Minister had to say about steps being taken and progress being made. The Minister is determined to do something about this problem, but if we are honest with ourselves we should realise that while access programmes are all very well, they are not making an impression on the programme. Similarly, we should admit that free fees for university education have no relevance to the people who remain shut out of third level education. Free fees <Col N="83" /> work to the benefit of the well off, not the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>We should not lay the blame for this situation solely on the current Government, as the motion states, because previous Governments have failed on this issue also. We should be moving forward decisively on two fronts, the immediate and long term. In the immediate future, the key to increased participation is a totally revamped grants system, and I agree that the motion before the House is correct in that respect. The current grant is simply not enough. It is not enough just to remove the financial barrier that stands between many young people and their entry to third level education. The level of grants should not only properly reflect the living expenses of the student, but should also recognise that when a student is attending college it means an income is foregone to their family. Given the current state of job opportunities, that means that much more income is being foregone than in the past.</P>
    <P>The current system of means testing for student grants needs to be revamped to remove the anomaly whereby farmers' children can qualify much more easily than others. That point has not been referred to in this debate. Solving that problem is easier said than done, however, but someone &ndash; I believe it has to be the Minister &ndash; must grasp that nettle if we are to have equality.</P>
    <P>In the longer term, it remains as true as ever that the road to third level education begins on the first day at school, or even at pre-school age. From the beginning the attitudes and accomplishments that will decide whether children set their heights on third level education are rapidly being set in stone at an early age. For that reason, we cannot separate the participation problem at third level from the wider problem of disadvantage in education generally. One leads from the other as surely as night follows day. When I became involved with the leaving certificate applied, which was referred to earlier by Senator Jackman, I was surprised to find that the national target for 2000 was for 90% of children to finish second level education. I was disappointed because that meant that one in ten would not finish school. The year 2000 has come and gone, yet the real problem turned out to be worse because we did not even reach that target. Disappointingly, we only reached 80%, which means that two out of ten students do not have the opportunity of finishing second level education.</P>
    <P>Show me a student and I can tell from what stream of our society he or she comes. It remains as true for students completing second level education as for those entering third level. What must happen for this fundamental problem to attract the serious attention it deserves? We must set our sights on achieving greater participation in education for students from disadvantaged areas. The Minister's heart is in the right place, but let us see him determined to achieve that goal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Quinn for sharing time with me. I know the Minister has much to congratulate himself about, but I wish he would explain why grants are not being centrally distributed. At present, local authorities and vocational education committees administer grants, yet it is extraordinarily difficult for people to work out what they have to do to obtain these grants. Into the bargain, local authorities frequently cannot even tell the Department to how many people they are giving grants. In addition, grants may not be paid until after Christmas. &ldquo;Live horse and you'll get grass&rdquo; is the old saying, but what are those students supposed to do during the autumn months which can be some of the most expensive in a student's career? I am sorry the Government parties tabled this amendment.</P>
      <P>Senator Keogh made a strong point about the two-tier system. I met one of those in that system when I went into a local shop tonight and came across a history student at Trinity College who is working there every evening. Those who have to work to support themselves in college are educationally and socially disadvantaged. Their personal development in college is not the same as those who do not have to work. The £49 weekly grant is impossible to live on. It is automatically assumed that parents are giving money to their children at college, but that may not be the case. It is easier for farmers' children to get grants than those from much more deprived sectors.</P>
      <P>While all the universities have access programmes for those from disadvantaged areas, especially for those who may have missed out on education the first time &ndash; mature adults as well as young students &ndash; it is important to remember that these schemes are local. What is someone from the Trinity catchment area supposed to do if they want to study hydrology and marine biology which are only done in UCG? They have no possibility of getting on one of these access programmes.</P>
      <P>I was at a meeting in Trinity last night at which we give out the money we have raised for student activities. It is supposed to help the student clubs and to encourage the drama society but we end up having to raise money to give grants to people because they cannot get one through the grant system operated by the State. This is a very serious issue given the number of students working to put themselves through courses which are 30 hours per week or, if they are in the professional schools, they maybe even more when one takes tutorials and practicals into account. While much is being done, much more remains to be done. I do not like the idea of students having to beg from the welfare officer of their students' union. It is degrading for a person coming into adulthood to find themselves in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that one child in an area going to university may give encouragement but I do not think we should forget the &ldquo;Educating Rita&rdquo; syndrome where great jealously was caused in an area. One night in Trinity I spoke to a girl from an area where she was one of the only people <Col N="85" /> ever to go to university and it was socially quite a hard struggle to keep up with that. Senator Quill talked about going in at a much lower level and telling people that this is their right and that they can expect to go on. However, students are degraded when they have to go to other students to look for money when they eventually make the huge educational leap by getting into one of these courses.</P>
    <P>I was very surprised the Minister did not mention the need to encourage people to take the basic sciences at second level. The lack of people taking physics, chemistry, applied maths and maths is a very serious problem. These are the skills needed for the pharmaceutical industry and the computer industry which has become so important to this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have come a long way over the years in our education system and it is mainly thanks to the present Government but also to Governments over the past 30 years which, through bad times as well as good times, although particularly during the very bad times in the 1980s and early 1990s, allocated funds under extreme difficulty and with scarce resources. It is one of the two things that has changed the Ireland of the late 1950s to 1960s to the Ireland of the 21st century. No matter what country we visit &ndash; I came back from a world trade exhibition in France last week &ndash; young Irish people are sought after. To be Irish today is, as young people say, hip and cool.</P>
      <P>We have shown the way and all Governments can take credit for the great education system we have. I remember only too well in the late 1950s when I finished school that there was no money for books or to go on to second level. That was the norm at the time. Almost 80% of my class at primary school finished school for good at that stage but then one only really starts to learn when one enters the university of the world. One is forever learning, particularly in the computer and technological age in which we live. To its great credit, it is this Government's intention to create new cities anywhere we have a regional technical college, from Letterkenny, Sligo, Athlone, Carlow to Waterford. This is where the brain power of our country lies. We are supporting the young people of the Ireland of the 21st century.</P>
      <P>A lot still needs to be done. Senator Keogh tabled this motion which I welcome as it is the first Private Members' motion tabled in 2001. The amendment tabled in my name under the supervision and care of our spokesperson, Senator Ormonde, must also be considered. I know this Minister will meet the challenges. He has put in place many worthwhile projects, particularly for disadvantaged students, which I welcome. I commend the Government on the good work it is doing and may it continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion. It is worthwhile debating education at any time because, while a lot of progress has been made <Col N="86" /> and the Minister outlined the number of schemes and projects in place and the amount of funding put in over the years, there is still a very serious situation in terms of inequality at all levels of education, particularly in relation to access to education and grants. Senators spoke about how the self-employed and the farming community have an advantage in terms of access to grants, although the grants are inadequate in any case.</P>
      <P>As a public representative representing Dublin Central, the biggest problem I experience is disadvantage and the inability of any Government to address that in terms of increasing the percentage of people from disadvantaged areas accessing PLC courses, further education and higher education or to address adult education where adults in the community have lost out on education over the years.</P>
      <P>I do not like saying it but the situation is deteriorating. The Celtic tiger is plucking children from school during transition year and during the leaving certificate applied when they are out in the community on work experience for a week or two weeks. The employer attracts them with money which they never had in their pockets before. They work overtime and then they leave school without fulfilling the educational requirements to enable them access further or higher education. This is compounded by the lack of resources or support mechanisms at all levels of the education system. Our pre-school education system is an absolute scandal. There is no national pre-school, crèche or early school level of education. There are no opportunities for children in disadvantaged areas to do their homework and to have a structure process to enable them to do so. That is missing and there is no support for that in the community. In fact, I have tabled a motion on the Adjournment to be taken this evening to deal with this in the Sheriff Street area.</P>
      <P>The whole area of education is unstructured. There is no holistic approach to education. Our structures do not allow education to deal with these problems. It is fine if one comes from a middle class background where parents have enough money to put children through pre-school, Montessori and so on and where there is the motivation. That, however, is not the case for 20% of the child population which never has the chance to access third level education and nothing is being done about that. Children are dropping out of school for a number of reasons, such as employers wanting to get them into dead end jobs in the short term but then leaving them high and dry, or their inability to keep up with the subjects they are studying. There are no education officers on the ground and no link between the primary and second level schools nor between second level and third level to ensure that gap is bridged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the items mentioned by the Minister are desirable but they must be related to our proposals at the coalface, to the youngsters to see how they are working. Faced with unemploy<Col N="87" /> ment, we set up the local employment scheme. It catered for those who were long-term unemployed and tried to bring them into the workforce on a one to one basis. We have never attempted to do that in education nor have we any mechanism to enable resources to be made available for those youngsters who are facing difficulties. In terms of the White Paper and the Green Paper on adult education a fine structure is being proposed. We had the White Paper six months ago on adult education. So far as I can see, there is nothing on the Statute Book that deals with this. What is happening with it? There are no guidance teachers in adult education where they are badly needed.</P>
    <P>In my constituency the Dublin Institute of Technology has been waiting for the past four or five years for the promised delivery of a new campus in Grangegorman. The land is lying idle while the Department of Education and Science and the Government cannot get their act together to deliver on that campus which would be of considerable benefit to further and higher education in the area.</P>
    <P>We have not tackled inequality in education. We project ourselves to the world as the young, educated nation of Europe. That is correct for that proportion of the population that is virtually on automatic pilot but for the proportion of the population that has always had difficulties of access, that problem is not being addressed. That is where the challenge lies. We need to look much more carefully at the situation. I do not think there is the will within the Department of Education and Science to come out of its ivory tower and come to grips with the problems of educational disadvantage in the community, to put in place the new structural mechanisms that are required. Until they are put in place we are throwing money at the problem and paying lip service to it. I have no doubt everybody involved is dedicated to what they are doing but we are not addressing the issue and resolving it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, to the House. About 18 months ago we witnessed the closure of the Fruit of the Loom factory in north Donegal. There is much to be learned from that. The most important single issue was that a large number of those out of work, following the closure of that factory, had not finished their leaving certificate. Therefore, they found the whole retraining business almost impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The world has moved on. A third level or higher qualification is now an absolute requirement. A post-leaving certificate qualification is an absolute requirement in terms of moving on. Given that we have failed to convince any Government of the need to tackle disadvantage, could we take a different line tonight and appeal to the greed of people? Unless we invest in our young people there will be no viable future. The reality is that unless we recognise it is to the <Col N="88" /> advantage of the State to have an investment in the education of young people, in other words to make the business of studying and being a student economically viable and economically attractive, we will lose out. There is a huge problem in that area. For many young people, unless parents can afford to pay for them they cannot afford to remain at college. This is happening at a time when there is plenty of work and there are plenty of job opportunities. It is easy to divert a young person away from the world of study towards the world of work without qualification. These are the people who will fall on the slag heap in a number of years' time when industry has moved on, developed or shifted abroad. They will not be in a position to gain from retraining and will not have a qualification to move on. That is the reality.</P>
    <P>The future for Ireland, the post-recession future, will be dependent on our investment in research and development. Investment in research and development means investment in people. Investment in people means the education of people, particularly at further and third level. Unless we get people through that system we will not gain. We are talking about people from across the community.</P>
    <P>I want to focus in on the area of disadvantage. I ask colleagues when discussing education for people from underprivileged and disadvantaged areas to remember there are two sides to the story. There is the one that is regularly articulated about the fairness and the unfairness of society and there is another issue. There are the extraordinary talents, gifts, style and experience of children from disadvantaged areas that would bring a new dimension to the area of research and development, which is about innovation, coping, being creative, finding ways out of problems and moving forward. We are losing out as a community by not encouraging and supporting the educational opportunities at further and higher education for students from economically underprivileged areas.</P>
    <P>It seems completely wrong, in terms of the amount of money being invested in our future, that we do not invest in the real seed bed of progress, the young people who will create the new ideas and the new industries and wealth of a future nation. That means making it attractive and economically viable for people to continue in third level education. I urge the Minister of State to take that message back to Government. The students' unions throughout the country which are raising this matter are doing a great job. They should be encouraged to speak louder, to take a sharper interest and to insist on a response. They should point out that it is in the interests of decision-making and power mongers to recognise that in the absence of a throughput of students the future will be bleak. In priding ourselves as the island of saints and scholars, we need to put our investment in scholars.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> I believe in education. Education is liberation, it is creativity, it is the way to develop industry. The first basic economic principle is that one needs a well educated and healthy population. To be well educated, there must be State investment. I ask the Government to support the motion, to move forward and give hope to our students. We have reached the situation where a post-leaving certificate, is only a starter qualification and it needs to be improved upon.</P>
    <P>The real issue for our economic and social future is investment. It is the way in which we will climb out of whatever recession will inevitably come. Now is the time to invest in education, not in five or six years' time when we see bright young people who left or did not go to college because they were attracted away by jobs in industry where they did not need qualifications. They will be unemployable in the future and will be a drain and a strain on the whole community. We can anticipate that problem now as well as safeguarding our future. I support the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all those who contributed to the debate which was lively and stimulating. I am sorry the Minister was unable to be present for the entire debate, even though I welcome my old friend, the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob. The Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, was also present. It is good that a variety of people have heard the general debate. The Minister outlined a litany of measures that have been taken. Nobody will gainsay what has been done. We are involved too much in pilot schemes. We do not want any more pilot schemes but action that works.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed to improvements, but he missed my point. I am concerned with equity in society and not having a two-tier system. The figures prove that people from more disadvantaged backgrounds have a very low uptake of third level places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is totally simplistic to suggest this issue is based solely around the provision of grants. Many contributors agreed that the levels of maintenance grants are far too low. It adds to students' <Col N="90" /> difficulties and means they must work with the result that they are educationally and socially disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>If we are to be fair and equitable we must work from pre-school upwards to achieve the type of education system that embraces all of our children. It has been said that the cream of society always rises to the top. Those who are well off and well looked after often think they are the brightest and the best and believe they will rise to the top of the education system. We must embrace and encourage those who do not have such advantages to ensure that they are also the cream of society.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonagh made excellent points on the VTOS, yet it is ignored to a great extent. We are not concerned merely with the advantaged few at university but with the whole third level system. We need to ensure that people have access to third level. As Senator O'Toole pointed out, the greater the skills and education people acquire the better the life they will have. It also means that the economy is better served.</P>
    <P>We must not let a two-tier system prevail within this society. It is unfair and inequitable. We are losing out on the talents and skills of those people who would add to our society in so many different ways. I am not concerned merely with economic activity but with the impact on society.</P>
    <P>The tone of this debate will give much comfort to those students who have the potential to complete third level education, be it in institutes of technology or universities. If we are to have the type of society to which we aspire, we must encourage them. I enjoyed this debate and I hope the Minster has heard what has been said.</P>
    <P>We must move away from pilot schemes. If children are attending third level we should ensure that they remain there. We must also ensure that they do not eke out a mere existence, but that they have the opportunity to live and participate in third level life and blossom as individuals. That would make an enormous contribution to our society.</P>

    <Title>Broadcasting Bill, 1999: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate on the Bill was adjourned I was referring to the need to properly resource public service broadcasting if we, as a nation, wish to have such broadcasting. Public service broadcasting is a cherished concept in Ireland and throughout Europe and the Minister referred to the protocol in the Amsterdam Treaty in this regard. Cultural values and the ethos and reflection of a society's view of itself are important elements of public service broadcasting. Unless we adequately resource such broadcasting in a competitive environment RTÉ might as well shut up shop and dumb down. Without a properly resourced budget, RTÉ will have no choice but to follow that agenda.</P>
      <P>In an environment where, at the touch of a button, viewers can access every subject under the sun &ndash; or should I say satellite &ndash; who is to say that the RTÉ we have come to know, love and hate in equal measures will not be subsumed into an ocean of mediocrity and eventually sold off by a future Government? That is not beyond the bounds of possibility. That Government could be populated by a new generation of politicians raised on a diet of quiz shows, soap operas, sex comedies, parading as social commentary in many cases, and, horror of horrors, Graham Norton wannabees. For Senators who do not watch Channel 4 or ITV I will not explain who Graham Norton is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="93" /> I have an insatiable interest in radio and television. I have been a radio junky since I was big enough to twiddle the knobs on an old Bush radio in our kitchen which opened a channel to a wider world outside small town Ireland. Hospital dramas, US cop shows and costume dramas are among my favourite television preferences. However, I do not watch &ldquo;Eastenders&rdquo;, &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo; or &ldquo;Fair City&rdquo; because, like many colleagues, my lifestyle means I keep missing episodes. I rely on my 11 year old daughter who is interested in Irish and Australian soaps to keep me informed of the gory details.</P>
    <P>I support RTÉ's policy of buying such programmes which bring immense pleasure to many people. However, there is a problem with geographic coverage. The loss, if I can use that word, of &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo; by RTÉ to TV3 has meant that people in peripheral regions cannot see the programme, much to their disappointment. My wife comes from Castletownbere and almost all of the Beara peninsula has gone dark as a result of the loss of &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo; from RTÉ to TV3 as the latter is not available on the peninsula. This sometimes reminds me of my own part of the country as people in this region feel neglected and disadvantaged but I am not sure if the Minister can do anything about this problem.</P>
    <P>The first director general of the BBC, Lord Reith, was not a man one would invite to a pyjama party as he was a dour Scot. He defined the concept of public service broadcasting as an obligation to inform, educate and entertain, a definition which was liberally sprinkled in the debate in the Dáil. Some argue that, for much of its existence, RTÉ sought to achieve the first two at the expense of the third.</P>
    <P>Noel Andrews, a brother of the late Eamonn Andrews, was one of my first colleagues in broadcasting and taught me a great deal when I first joined RTÉ. He told me that when he started in the early 1950s there was a philosophy among RTÉ middle management that one did not allow crooners such as Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra on the sacred airwaves of Radio Éireann. For many years the station did not have such records in its library until an inventive librarian began to surreptitiously include them in the purchasing orders. This gives an indication of the Civil Service, bureaucratic or &ldquo;granny&rdquo; view that crooners were not good for ordinary listeners.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to my relationship with the authorities in RTÉ which has at times been fraught with difficulties in a career which stretches back over 20 years. Even before I started broadcasting, RTÉ had a weekly country music show hosted by Noel Andrews which was my first break in radio. I will be eternally grateful to many people in RTÉ, sadly most of whom are retired or moved on, who gave me the break I needed. My overall relationship with those with whom I worked and continue to work in RTÉ is excellent. I pay tribute to the professionalism and high standards of programming, particularly in radio sport and a <Col N="94" /> wide variety of programmes on Radio 1. That is no reflection on Lyric FM or 2FM.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the popularity of 2FM or Radio 2 as it was when I started. However, will the Minister consider whether, after 21 years of wall-to-wall pop music, there is a need to examine the public service remit as it applies to 2FM? This issue regularly comes up in conversation. Vested interests in local radio often raise this issue because they believe 2FM does not discharge its obligation to provide 20% news and current affairs programming. However, they operate under a different legislative model.</P>
    <P>When I started in Radio 2, and for the first five years of its existence, the evening schedule included a diverse range of programmes offering traditional Irish music, jazz, big band and country music. However, in the mid-1980s the authorities took the decision to revamp Radio 2, change its name to 2FM and turn it into a wall-to-wall pop music station. I have often questioned why that decision was taken as the station was offering the perfect balance in the national broadcasting family. In the absence of an alternative music channel, the station was a dedicated music channel offering pop music at peak listening times between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., responding to the needs of young people, while the evening and late night schedules were devoted to minority tastes.</P>
    <P>It is sad that this mix was allowed to change. Due to its very restricted scheduling, Radio 1 cannot be all things to all people. This has been part of the difficulty and the criticism of Radio 1 because it tends to try to please everyone but falls between too many stools. Without going into the technicalities, it is a bit like government in that every hour of the day has its own constituency, each of which jealousy guards its turf. This might help explain why some programmes end 15 minutes before or after the hour. News and current affairs, agriculture, light entertainment and so on traditionally occupied blocks of time. This is what I mean by a very restricted structure.</P>
    <P>The new commission might offer an opportunity to review this decision. I am not attacking 2FM which is doing a wonderful job within its remit. However, it might review and expand its schedule. I have always believed that the 1979 legislation which established the station did not fulfil the complete needs of the radio listening public. It responded to the popularity of pop pirate radio stations. It set up an all music station which catered for 30% of the listening audience. That is the figure to which Radio 1 would admit. What about the other 70%? It does not have an alternative music channel. If one looks at the plethora of new stations which have come on stream, it is difficult to find what might be called the more moderate form of music or an alternative music style.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated her support for public service broadcasting and has asked consultants to forensically investigate RTÉ's current licence fee application. I fully agree with this approach. It poses fundamental and relevant questions. For <Col N="95" /> what will the money be used? What specific areas of programming will benefit? Will consideration be given to setting up a programme policy unit to brainstorm the next generation of programmes which, the Minister has stated, will operate to a strong public service remit and will provide schedules of quality and diversity which cater for minority and mainstream tastes?</P>
    <P>I am not telling tales out of school when I suggest that there may be a widespread perception that there is a fund of creativity in RTÉ which is bursting to get out. In my experience a lot of the ideas and inventiveness come from outside in rather than from inside out. That is not to cast aspersions on those creative people within the station who have been producing and continue to produce excellent programming. However, there have been occasions when there have been extreme valleys of inactivity in terms of creativity and inventiveness. The Minister addressed this in other aspects of the legislation in relation to TG4 when she set up advisory councils and so on. It may not be within the Minister's brief but perhaps the commission might be nudged in the direction of doing something in the interests of listeners and viewers.</P>
    <P>The challenge facing Ireland's national broadcaster is as I have outlined. Those within the station would say they are carrying out that remit successfully. However, some viewers and listeners would argue otherwise. RTÉ's executives are currently undertaking a nationwide tour of public meetings where they are seeking feedback from the public. I welcome this initiative, although anecdotal evidence suggests it is getting a rough ride at the meetings so far. I hope this is not a cosmetic exercise to flatter the Minister in sanctioning a fee increase. I am afraid I sometimes belong to the school of conspiracies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

      <P>Never.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I am a sinner. It seems coincidental that RTÉ is embarking on this nationwide consultation process at a time when it is looking for an increase in its licence fee and when we are debating the Broadcasting Bill. However, I hope these meetings produce a positive result and that proposals and ideas emanating from the public will not be confined to the file marked &ldquo;pending&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The biggest single criticism levelled at RTÉ in all my years of broadcasting is that it will not listen, that when it is wrong it will not admit it and that when it finds a successful programme formula it takes it off. A joke circulated around RTÉ during the period of the Jacobs Awards to the effect that if one won a Jacobs Award for being associated with an RTÉ programme, the chances were his or her contract would be terminated shortly afterwards. It is as if the decision-makers within RTÉ are afraid of creating stars, of nurturing the talent it creates and of being defensive about the success of its front of house <Col N="96" /> people. It is a strange phenomenon, unique to Ireland, unlike our British colleagues who continue to create minor and major celebrities, thus ensuring a wide diversity of programme styles which is what creative talent brings to broadcasting. I sound like I am being defensive all the time but if one looks at the new talent emerging from a station with a monopoly, one must question its structures or attitudes.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will also consider the radio dimension. While one of the sections provides for transmission of existing RTÉ and local stations, one section seems to indicate that it may allow more digital stations in radio. Digital radio has the capacity to ensure consistent quality across all terrains. That is an important dimension where Ireland's topography is concerned. Digital radio will also provide studio quality transmission which will be a boom to those music lovers among us. It will also provide unlimited diversity of programme choice. I have been a firm supporter of full radio deregulation. Why, for example, should the business of Government be to limit the choices which technology allows? Limiting the number of radio stations smacks of a culture that mother knows best. Such diversity of programme choice would recognise the public service remit.</P>
    <P>I am also conscious of the extra demands that would be placed on existing providers, particularly local radio stations located in the more dispersed areas of Ireland. In common with my colleagues in the other House and on all sides of this House, I take this opportunity to acknowledge the outstanding contribution which local radio has made and continues to make to the quality of life in Ireland. The Minister will remember that one Deputy likened the arrival of local radio in 1990 to the arrival of rural electrification 25 years ago. It was an apt comparison because it is an indication of the tremendous impact local radio has made on life in Ireland. It may seem like hyperbole but he was not too wide of the mark. As a broadcaster on the national station who lives in rural Ireland, I constantly cast envious eyes at the standard of professionalism in broadcasting at local level and at the response of local radio to the needs of the people it serves. Long may it continue.</P>
    <P>I do not hold any brief for the carve up of the Dublin region as a result of the 1988 Act which was deeply flawed in this regard. This happened long before the Minister took over and it is not within her brief. It is appalling that a city of more than one million people should have had only two radio stations, both of which abandoned any pretence at reflecting a public service remit, including a spurious contempt for the 20% news and current affairs obligation. They are now what they always intended to be, namely, wall to wall pop. They are two of the greatest cash cows ever produced in this country as a result of legislation. The stations 98FM and TodayFM have consistently refused to encourage local ethnic talent and have slavishly followed the agenda of the multi<Col N="97" /> national record companies in their attempt at the globalisation of music. I am delighted the Independent Radio and Television Commission has finally woken up to this appalling uniformity of radio broadcasting in our capital city and sought greater diversity of choice not only for Dublin but for the wider Dublin region which has within its area two thirds of the population of Ireland. I wish every success to the new players in the Dublin market, Lite FM, the new dance music station for young people which will come on air shortly and the successful bidders for the next special interest licence which will be decided in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of some regret that the decision to provide a pop station in Dublin in 1979, which responded to the then pirate station mania, ignored the other 70% of the population who would have welcomed an alternative music station along the lines of Britain's most widely listened to radio, BBC Radio 2. It says its core audience is aged 50 plus. It was a missed opportunity and placed an intolerable burden on the existing structure of Radio 1 which has barely changed since the days about which I spoke earlier.</P>
    <P>The provision of a third national channel is a matter for the Minister and the Independent Radio and Television Commission. With the honourable exception of Eamon Dunphy's, &ldquo;The Last Word&rdquo;, Today FM is not much different from the path transmitted by the existing Dublin pop stations. Worse still, at least the Dublin stations know they are local, while the Today FM presenters believe they are local rather than national. They do not seem to have any real knowledge or feel for the Ireland outside the pale.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of a fund to provide transmission infrastructure to local and community stations. The abolition of the local radio levy has been welcomed by all the radio operators. The amendment to the 1993 Act obliging RTÉ to make a specific sum available for independent production in line with the consumer price index is also welcome. That will be £20 million this year. I would like to think that at some stage the Minister might consider moving it away from the consumer price index. The cost of production is rising at such an enormous rate I am not sure that linking it to the consumer price index and the modest increase that will generate will address the creative nugget, the independent sector. RTÉ has commissioned some marvellous programmes from the independent sector since this initiative was introduced. It is a question of resources. I know it has been fixed since this initiative was introduced but perhaps the Minister might review it at some stage. Rather than linking it to the consumer price index, she might consider giving a specific sum of money which would be in keeping with current costs. While the increases are welcome, they are modest.</P>
    <P>I fully acknowledge the huge cost of producing one hour of television drama. I ask RTÉ to com<Col N="98" /> mission more drama, both historical and contemporary. Ireland has a rich heritage of drama and there is at least one, if not more, amateur dramatic society in every county. It should be a condition of any new licence increase that RTÉ television's output of drama be significantly increased. The country is full of themes and it saddens me that some of our best stories have yet to be dramatised while others, such as the recent co-production, &ldquo;Rebel Heart&rdquo;, were a grave disappointment. I share David Trimble's views that the series was flawed, but for entirely different reasons. I do not know what he had to worry about. I thought it was boring and out of context. Indeed, I feel sorry for British viewers, many of whom were exposed for the first time to one of the most traumatic periods in our history and who were left with more questions than answers. It is not the first time that momentous events in Irish history have received such treatment, usually at the hands of non-Irish broadcasters, and in one famous case, film makers. I hope RTÉ takes a more hands-on approach to sensitive themes such as those portrayed in &ldquo;Rebel Heart&rdquo;, at least to ensure historical accuracy and to explain in so far as one can within the confines of television drama the exact context so the viewer can best understand and enjoy it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's wonderful initiative in reserving one of the six proposed multiplexes for terrestrial broadcasting in Northern Ireland, and I hope our British friends will quickly produce reciprocal arrangements for the carriage of their platform of broadcasters established on this side. It is vitally important that we talk to each other as frequently as possible and in as many ways as possible and what better way than through the medium of television?</P>
    <P>In this context I must express disappointment at a recent report by a group of non-governmental agencies which was published in the media in the past two days tending to portray this part of the island as intolerant and lacking an understanding of the Unionist-Orange position. What particularly saddened me was the highlighting of the Angelus on television and the presence of religious symbols in schools and hospitals as being somewhat divisive and creating a sense of discomfort for non-Catholics who visit Ireland. As someone who has had the marvellous privilege and opportunity as a legislator to visit many different countries and cultures, especially in the Muslim world, it would never occur to me to comment on the religious practice or symbols of the majority of the population of such countries. Have we gone down the road of political correctness to such an extent that we are now being asked to apologise for what and who we are? I have no wish to question the bona fides of the groups who prepared this report, but they have done a grave disservice and probably have done more to contribute to the further divisiveness of Irish society than to the healing of it.</P>
    <P>I grew up in a Border county and most of my mother's family and relations come from counties <Col N="99" /> Fermanagh and Tyrone. Since I was a small child I have been a frequent visitor across the Border. I was always conscious of the second class citizenship of Catholics in Northern Ireland, but I was fortunate to grow up in a small town in County Leitrim where there were significant numbers of Protestant friends and neighbours. I grew up in a warm and loving environment and in an atmosphere that was free of prejudice, ignorance and intolerance on both sides, an atmosphere which I am very happy to say remains to this day &ndash; I live 30 miles from the Border.</P>
    <P>However, if the report is saying what I believe it is, namely, that we are intolerant of the Unionist tradition, then what better way of breaking down the barriers of divisiveness, ignorance and prejudice on both sides than through the medium of television? Therefore, I commend the Minister for her initiative in the Bill and hope that technology will achieve for a future generation tolerance, understanding and equal respect, irrespective of class, creed or colour. That is how I and the vast majority of people in the South and on the island have been brought up.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section which will oblige the commission to make rules in order to promote the enjoyment of broadcast services by people who are deaf, hard of hearing and those who are blind or partially blind. These are the little things that sometimes slip through. As a radio broadcaster I have been conscious since I started broadcasting of the great enjoyment radio brings to those who are blind or partially blind and of the denial of such enjoyment to those who are deaf or hard of hearing. In this respect I would welcome the extension of subtitled programmes to all parts of the schedules.</P>
    <P>The Minister in her reply on Second Stage in the Dáil responded to several criticisms of RTÉ programmes by deflecting responsibility for actual programming to the RTÉ Authority. I fully understand from where the Minister is coming &ndash; she is only repeating what previous Ministers have said in this regard. I know she has addressed the issue of competence, obligation and responsibility, but surely if the authority is not discharging its public service remit in the spirit and language of the Bill, then the Minister has a duty to investigate. Who decides if RTÉ is discharging its public service broadcasting remit? How can it be evaluated if the programming schedules, which are exclusively decided by RTÉ management for the most part and not by the authority which in my experience tends to rubberstamp the decisions of its line managers, are ignored? I suggest there is insufficient transparency and accountability in RTÉ. There is no mechanism to allow somebody say a programme is rubbish and should be ended, or to ask why other programmes are not being featured. In nearly all cases the radio and television management operates in a sheltered and protected environment. If they were employed in the private sector they would be subject to performance evaluation, as are all the local and com<Col N="100" /> mercial stations. As my colleague, Senator Quinn, would say, he bases his business on performance evaluation; he would not last otherwise.</P>
    <P>To put it simply &ndash; I have often argued this in real terms &ndash; because of RTÉ's unique position in broadcasting, whether there is one person or one million people listening to or viewing a particular RTÉ programme, I suggest &ndash; it may sound harsh &ndash; the people who make the decisions on those programmes continue to draw their salary at the end of the week and in nearly all cases will work at the station long enough in a variety of different roles to draw their pension. I am not aware of any RTÉ executive or manager responsible for bad programming who has been fired for that reason or who has had their contract terminated. I pay tribute to Helen Shaw who has certainly adopted a very radical approach and has shaken up what might have been a somewhat lethargic football team, and I wish her continued success. Directors are appointed for a specific period under contract and when the period is up it is either renewed or, as happens in many cases, the executive is relocated to another part of the organisation. I have no difficulty whatsoever with this, because they are good people and I am not saying there is anything wrong with them. Rather I am talking about institutional structures.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that all those under whom I served and those with whom I have been familiar in their respective management roles in radio and television have discharged their duties and responsibilities to the best of their ability. I am only questioning the Minister's responsibility in the context of discharging the public broadcasting remit. One would argue strongly that the Minister has a responsibility to programming, especially in the proposed highly competitive environment where public service broadcasting will be the exception rather than the rule. For example, does the Minister believe that the current scheduling on Network 2 is discharging a public service remit? Why, for example, does it not devote even one night of its programming to documentaries or to programming from which people of all ages could learn instead of an endless diet of imported American comedies and movies? Why, for example, is a night not dedicated exclusively to Irish programming on Network 2 in the same way that there are dedicated nights for American soaps and comedy? Similarly on 2FM why is there not at least one news type programme per day which would report on issues which would be relevant to its target audience, namely, young people, which would inform and educate as well as entertain? We are all talking about the young vote yet the national broadcaster to which people are tuned in in huge numbers has no actual news, features or civics programme. It should be noted that BBC Radio 1 has regularly been broadcasting such programmes for its young audience.</P>
    <P>The tendency worldwide is for the dumbing down of radio and television programmes. That is why the oasis that is public service broadcasting is protected under the protocol in the Amsterdam <Col N="101" /> Treaty, among others. Is RTÉ's traditional record of programming excellence, as well as that of the BBC on these islands, which has generated a warm affection for the institutions despite our criticisms of content, to be threatened? I understand the decision to change the style of Network 2 was taken by a non-national who has since left the station, which figures. This is not a rant against non-nationals involved in our media. In fact, Irishmen and women have made a major contribution to the development of British broadcasting, and I am proud of them all including Graham Norton from Tipperary. There is a distinct difference between British and Irish culture, although one would not believe that looking at some of the cross-fertilisation of that culture in certain parts of Ireland through the following of Premiership football as well as the goings on of a community in the north-west of England and the east end of London. I know what the reaction would be if a non-national was appointed head of English, German or Italian television, so why should it be any different here?</P>
    <P>This is extremely important legislation and in a sense is a watershed. We are moving into an entirely new technological environment and I wish the legislation well. The Minister has argued her case very well and, like her, I will be very interested to see how the debate unfolds. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I also welcome the Bill. They say that on the stage one should never follow an animal or a child. In debating broadcasting one should never follow Senator Mooney. His knowledge, foresight and background show so many years of experience he is difficult to follow. There are a number of points I want to make. In the fifties, even before Senator Mooney was involved in radio&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;I was involved with Radio Luxemburg. My father's holiday camp in Skerries had a 15 minute programme every Sunday. I also had the pleasure of appearing on Granada Television for the same holiday camp in the 1950s.</P>
      <P>This Bill has challenged me because when I looked at it I had to remove the commercial deregulation hat that I normally wear. I had not thought through the benefits, success and objectives of public service broadcasting. With the arrival of digital broadcasting, the way we structure our broadcasting faces radical challenges. I had never understood them. At home we recently acquired an array of television stations and we have an array of radio stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nature of competition in broadcasting has radically changed. We are approaching a situation where it will be possible for the customer not simply to receive a few channels, as Senator Mooney and others have said, but scores or even hun<Col N="102" /> dreds. This change will end the era of massive audiences for any one programme, even &ldquo;Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?&rdquo; which the whole country seems to watch as it once watched &ldquo;The Late Late Show.&rdquo;  The days when the whole country switched on the same television or radio programme are numbered. Viewing in the future may become an individual activity rather than a collective one.</P>
    <P>A second change is that the scale of costs of setting up the technology for digital broadcasting puts it outside the public sector, especially when commercial forces will be ready to provide this investment. We need a structure like the one in this Bill. I have no problems with the route the Minister proposes. I leave it to others to examine the Bill in detail. My concern &ndash; and I know it is shared by the Minister &ndash; is that in the new digital era, public service broadcasting should not only survive but thrive. There is no doubt that digitalisation of television will also bring increased commercialisation. The vast number of channels on offer will be commercial, supported by advertising or sponsorship, and underpinned by the basic commercial objective of selling goods or services.</P>
    <P>The State can impose basic rules of behaviour and the Bill provides for codes for programming which will be laid down by the Broadcasting Commission. However, this activity is essentially negative. The codes will, rightly, only tell broadcasters what they may not do. They will not tell them what they must or should do. The codes will put reasonable boundaries on commercial activity.</P>
    <P>That is not the end of the story. In addition to commercial broadcasters, we must always have public service broadcasting. If it is to survive we must recognise that it faces new conditions. Section 28 of the Bill defines public service broadcasting from a legal point of view. It is a simple matter of why broadcasting takes place at all. Commercial broadcasting may inform, entertain and educate but the basic reason underlying its activity is to make money through selling goods or services. All else is a means to this end. In public service broadcasting, these means are ends in themselves. A public service broadcaster sets out to inform, entertain and educate for its own sake.</P>
    <P>This a profound and very worthwhile difference. There should be room for both and we must create a structure for this. If we consider the history of broadcasting, we appreciate the enormity of the change public service broadcasting faces. Radio began here as a public service. The BBC was the world leader. In America it was the other way. Broadcasting was commercial in its rationale and ethos and is still so. Public service broadcasting is small. In Europe public service broadcasting was dominant, but in more recent years it has existed side by side with commercial. Public service broadcasting remained a giant while being part of a duopoly or a triopoly but was still a big player.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> In the digital era, it is important to realise that public service broadcasting will be a much smaller player. Its national importance will not be reduced but its relative size will. Therefore we should make it as important as possible. It must not go down the slippery slope of trying to compete in size terms.</P>
    <P>For the public service ethos to survive and thrive in the digital era, we must accept the distinction between importance and size. We should seek to divest our public service broadcasting of anything which interferes with its basic ethos and focus on what only it can do. We must replace an emphasis on quantity with an emphasis on quality.</P>
    <P>I want to see something happen that is very difficult to achieve. It is the opposite of empire building. One of the leading British business people spoke at a Marketing Institute function last night about the globalisation of business and the notion of the bigger eating the smaller, giving little chance to the small one to survive. However he believes this is not true. In business the faster is eating the slower. The hare is surviving when the dinosaur is not. It is not a question of size but quality rather than quantity. We have such an exaggerated respect for growth that we fail to realise that growing an organisation is what the Americans call a &ldquo;no-brainer&rdquo;. In order to grow an organisation, just stand back &ndash; it will grow of its own accord. With each passing year it will extend its tentacles into every place they can reach. All of a sudden there is an empire.</P>
    <P>In the commercial world there is a limit to it because there is a corrective mechanism which stops that. It is called the market. Failure in the marketplace often forces companies to retrench &ndash; to retreat to what they are good at &ndash; otherwise they do not survive. Failure often compels them to rediscover the reason they came into existence in the first place. This applies to a commercial organisation in any business anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>Public service broadcasting does not have that corrective mechanism. It just continues to grow. Public service broadcasters, here and elsewhere, are notorious empire builders. It happens almost everywhere. The further they reach out their tentacles, the looser their grip becomes on the reason they are there in the first place.</P>
    <P>For many years I have known people who were employed at RTÉ. They did not necessarily work at RTÉ. Perhaps that is unfair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very aware of that. I have known people who have worked at RTÉ at many levels. The bigger the RTÉ empire became, the unhappier its people became; the bigger the empire became the more the organisation spent its energy looking inwards on itself rather than outwards towards its customers. This is the first time I have used the word customer on this <Col N="104" /> occasion. I am not talking about commercial customers but rather public service broadcasting customers.</P>
      <P>The bigger the empire became, the less central became the focus on its ultimate reason for being in existence &ndash; the making of programmes. Programmes became just an element in a wider corporate web. We have often heard that hospitals would be great if it were not for those patients. The same is true in my own business. What a great business it would be if it were not for all those customers. That seems to happen in every organisation as it gets bigger.</P>
      <P>The arrival of the digital era offers our public service broadcasting a rare chance &ndash; perhaps its very last chance &ndash; to reinvent itself and rediscover its roots. Will it take this opportunity? I do not know. However, it will be influenced by the legislative framework that we provide and this will affect the outcome.</P>
      <P>There are three connected items that may point us in the right direction. The digital era removes from public service broadcasting the need to be all things to all men. The contributions earlier by the Minister, Senator Coghlan and Senator Mooney confirmed this. It also removes the need to deliver massive audiences. The very nature of digital broadcasting means that those monolithic audiences will become a thing of the past. Each broadcaster is not one of a handful but one of scores or maybe hundreds eventually, which will compete for audiences.</P>
      <P>Leading on from that is a further conclusion that I believe is inescapable. Public service broadcasting in the new era must turn its back on advertising and commercial sponsorship. It cannot serve two masters and market forces always win out in the end. When there was only one television service it was an acceptable solution to mix public service and commercial broadcasting in one channel. Even with two perhaps it was possible. When there are hundreds, it will be fatal to undermine the basic public service rationale by contaminating it with commercial factors.</P>
      <P>I am arguing that RTÉ should stop taking advertisements and rely for its revenue only on its licence fee. I note that the EU Competition Commissioner believes it is unacceptable for publicly funded broadcasters to compete for advertising with broadcasters who do not get anything from the licence fee. We might find ourselves forced into this approach by Europe, whether we like it or not. I believe it would be a good thing.</P>
      <P>What of RTÉ's argument that it would need to more than double the licence if it were to forgo its revenue from advertising? The answer is very simple: roll back the empire. Forget about being all things to all men. Focus on producing a small number of high quality programmes. There are many talented people who could provide excellent public service broadcasting on a budget far smaller than the yield from the licence fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I wish the Minister well. I ask her and the House to bear in mind that the structure we create in this legislation will largely <Col N="105" /> determine the quality of our public service broadcasting in the future or whether indeed the concept will survive at all.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney addressed the issue of funds allocated to independent television producers. The Minister has allocated £20 million to independent television producers. This is a fixed sum rather than a percentage of the broadcasters' television budget. Is it the Minister's intention that the £20 million correspond to 20% of RTÉ's programme budget? Is this within the spirit and, intentions of the Broadcasting Act, 1999? I have no ulterior motive in asking this. Is it her intention to keep a watching brief and will she undertake to review this system if the sector begins to fall below 20%? Should we use this system at all? If we could remove advertising totally from RTÉ and say its function and objective were different, then maybe this would force it to reduce the size of its empire and would focus its attention on the objectives of public service broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's Bill and I welcome this debate.</P>

Tugaim faoi ndeara go raibh an tAire cúramach chun dul i gcomhairle le an-chuid daoine a bhí páirteach nó ag saothrú i gcúrsaí craolacháin. Tá sin thar a bheith tábhachtach. Cé go ndúirt an Freasúra inniu go raibh meascán de smaointí sa Bhille ní hé sin atá ann ar chor ar bith ach gur éist an tAire le daoine a bhí ag obair ar an talamh. Tá sé an-shoiléir d'éinne a thuigeann cúrsaí craolacháin go bhfuil sin tábhachtach.</P>
      <P>Many people have referred to the importance of public service broadcasting. It is an exceptionally powerfully medium and while it has huge potential, it also carries huge responsibility. It is not simply a matter of enabling people to provide a service, or transmitting that service to a general population.</P>
      <P>We can look back on 75 years of public service broadcasting represented by RTÉ. I was fortunate to have dealt with virtually every director-general of RTÉ television since it came into existence. The role we played during that period was to get the message home to RTÉ executives that they were the servants of the people, not owners of the service. All the great debates on urban councils, county councils, community councils and newspapers happened because people believed that they were the owners of the service. They were not consumers but citizens being served, and that service was provided through Government funding. RTÉ did an exceptional job as the pioneer in public service broadcasting, and while many of us were critical, we were quick to praise when RTÉ did something particularly good in response to the needs of the people. It was from that period that RTÉ provided a service second to none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="106" /> I would not fully agree with Senator Mooney's response to the recent series &ldquo;Rebel Heart&rdquo;. I watched virtually every episode of that programme and, while I could see flaws from a dramatic point of view, I thought it was challenging from a historical point of view, especially in relation to the situation on this island today. People from outside Ireland might have a less jaundiced view of the Irish because we tend to be our biggest critics in most matters.</P>
    <P>Many RTÉ programmes reflected what was happening in the world outside. The consultative process which RTÉ is currently undertaking is similar to the process undertaken when Joe Barry was director-general. I attended quite a few of those consultative sessions, and I liked them. Those present were in a fighting mood and did not attend just to feel happy or to pat somebody on the back. They came because they felt passionately about the broadcasting service. When RTÉ provided people with the opportunity to give their views, they argued for improvements in areas felt to be inadequate or not representative.</P>
    <P>RTÉ was the pioneer of local radio. Its members travelled the country with an outside broadcast unit before local or community radio existed. The station provided that OB unit to various towns so they could put on local radio for one week and I participated in my home town of Cashel. I remember local sportsmen coming forward with reminiscences and the local drama society putting on a serialised version of <i>Knocknagow</i> for that week. It was the first time that people had a taste of what it meant to be involved in broadcasting and to have an opportunity to control that powerful medium. In some ways RTÉ set up rival competition for itself, but it sowed the seeds of local radio and indicated to communities what could be achieved.</P>
    <P>There is occasional criticism of RTÉ, particularly in the area of public affairs. There are times when it is felt there are personalised agendas within RTÉ, and that is not part of the duty of a public service broadcaster. The approach to the various referenda is an example, and one always gets the feeling that the approach to debates is not neutral. Whatever RTÉ personnel feel, they should ensure there is balance in what they do. A lack of balance irritates people, whether it affects a minority or a majority view. I am glad the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, is endeavouring to ensure balance is achieved.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;standard&rdquo; has been used and that word could represent the different viewpoints. It could apply to the various programmes as well. Viewers and listeners do not all have to feel happy with the views expressed on a current affairs programme, but if RTÉ is seen to be acting as a political instrument in its own right, and with its own agenda, that will do it no good. It will detract from the talent it has and its good reputation.</P>
    <P>I would be disappointed if the status and role of RTÉ was diminished because we have com<Col N="107" /> mercial stations in competition with it. The average citizen might think that the only comment they can make on commercial television is to turn over to another channel. In the case of public service broadcasting, they see it in totally different way. They do not accept the glib advice that was given some years ago that they can always turn the knob. That was a simplistic response from people who held responsible positions. RTÉ has to listen to what is being said and to the letters it receives. One letter to RTÉ is the equivalent of 500 people holding a similar view, it is said. If 1,000 people wrote in, one can work out the mathematics for oneself. RTÉ did not always react as it might on hearing public opinion.</P>
    <P>We had a debate in this Chamber about an episode of &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; to which I took personal exception. I was watching television in a family environment, when a comedian appeared on the show and made a joke about the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. It was the most horrifying, offensive piece of broadcasting I had ever seen. Gay Byrne aired an apology for what happened the following week, and that was the correct approach. If, as a broadcasting service, RTÉ has stepped out of line in a major way and it realises that the community has been offended or not serviced or reflected in a proper manner, it should come out, not with a formal apology, but to acknowledge the fact that a mistake has been made. I would see absolutely nothing wrong with that on an ongoing basis. I certainly do not expect it from commercial broadcasting, but I am saying that as a friend and supporter of RTÉ.</P>
    <P>I would like to see RTÉ funded in a manner in which it can maintain the status, role and service which it is capable of providing. It is no longer sufficient to say that viewers get what they want. I remember, at least 25 or 30 years ago, sitting down with the then director-general of RTÉ. At the time I did not understand what satellite broadcasting might mean for the future, but I knew we would not remain in an isolated situation where television was concerned. I remember making the point then that it would make a lot of sense for RTÉ to develop the loyalty of its listeners and viewers. That loyalty could have been developed by instilling in them a sense of pride in what they are, the attributes and talents they have and their distinctiveness. RTÉ could have been cultivating those things in a very subtle manner. Had it done so it would have an exclusive audience because outside stations would not be at the source of their talents and strengths. To some extent RTÉ did respond to that, but not as much as it might have, and it is now paying for the fact that it did not develop that loyalty at a time when it had less competition.</P>
    <P>TG4 provides an example of what I am saying and I am delighted to see that it is intended to constitute the station as a statutory corporate body. Apart altogether from the Irish language which is a very important aspect of this issue, TG4 has the opportunity to revisit where RTÉ <Col N="108" /> was in years gone by. It has an opportunity to benefit from that same environment. If it does so and does not become overly worried about trying to increase its audience figures too quickly, it can establish itself as a quality station. The viewer numbers are increasing and one reason for this is that the people responsible for TG4 can see quite clearly that they have to think professionally. They must be tuned into the younger generation because if they are not they will miss out on a major part of the market and will not cultivate that market for the future.</P>
    <P>In the short time that TG4 has been in existence it is clear that whatever mistakes it made in the early stages have been corrected very quickly. Standards are now predominant in that service which has a very good young professional face. I do not know how one weighs value for money in matters of this kind, but it should not all be weighed in a commercial sense. I would like to think that where funding is required for a service of that kind, it will be helped in every possible way because the competition is so great.</P>
    <P>As always, the Minister has been sensitive and aware when it comes to attitudes to Irish culture generally, both in the context of the Irish and English languages and the cultural perception of a broadcasting service. Bearing in mind our cultural contexts past and present, there is more goodwill now for the Irish language and culture than there was 25 years ago. One need only look at the polls on attitudes to the Irish language coming from parents and young people to see that it is able to score up to 70% or 75% support. That would not have been the case in the days of the LFM when there was antagonism towards the language and people saw it as a political football or an obstacle to their careers. We must respond to those changed attitudes in all our public services.</P>
    <P>I am always proud to quote the major survey on the living arts in Ireland, which included what might have been regarded as ancient music. The survey, which dealt with all the living arts, showed that Irish traditional music was the premier pursuit of all ages, classes and geographic locations in the country. That is not take away from the other living arts that were also surveyed, including classical and pop music, but traditional music came out on top. That would not have been the case 25 or 30 years ago. If we do not reflect those changes within the broadcasting service, not only are we not being fair to our own people but also we not being very commercially minded either. There is a market in the culture itself which has to be reflected.</P>
    <P>One might say that the issue of Northern Ireland is more political than broadcasting, and it is. At times it can be difficult to understand that on a small island such as ours there are areas in the North of Ireland which do not have access to RTÉ, yet they can receive other television signals from all over the world. Nothing is more important than people listening to other people's points of view and we in the Republic have been <Col N="109" /> very mature in that regard. From the early stages no obstacles were placed to outside views coming in. There is a certain degree of that in the North and it came home to me in a recent conversation. I would like to mention the person's name but I will not because it involved a private conversation when I was in the company of a well known loyalist politician and his wife. In a very low key discussion we made reference to Clare, but the politician's wife said she had never heard of that county. It is unbelievable that a person living up the road had come through an education system which deprived her of knowing the geography of the Republic of Ireland. She also came through a broadcasting system that, back in those years, for some reason or other, secured her against knowing such details. That frightened me. We are talking about various policies which will develop harmony on the island. She was apologetic about it and was not in any way acrimonious. The particular meeting to which I am referring was a very friendly one.</P>
    <P>Above all else broadcasting, and particularly television, has a very important role to play in harmonising views on the island, bringing people together and making us realise that we share many of the same aspirations, challenges and difficulties. It is a pity, however, that we seem only to be able to do it through megaphone diplomacy which is usually a knee-jerk reaction to some recent incident and does not allow for the imparting of information. I hope that any development in that sphere will take place quickly.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a case for local radio which serves people well. It reflects what people are doing and has a constituency with a definite focus. Such diversity is not always possible in bigger areas. There is a fear of instability among independent broadcasters, although I am sure that is not the Minister's intention. Standards have to be maintained and obviously there can be no question of an automatic renewal of licences. At the same time, however, one would like to think that the Broadcasting Commission will ensure that those who have a track record of high standards and who reflect what is happening in the community, would be recognised for what they have done. Community is not only about geography, it is also about specialist interests and we should see community radio in that context.</P>
    <P>The words &ldquo;Irish quality&rdquo; have been used. It would be very sad in Ireland, where we have a very educated, discerning and highly confident young population, if we in some way took from them the very thing which made them distinctive and inspired them and their parents on to success and put it into some plastic environment as far as broadcasting is concerned. I do not think they will thank us in the years to come when their children have been deprived of that influence. I hope the idea of Irish quality will be kept to the fore.</P>
    <P>In regard to the idea of directing the broadcasting service at young children in particular by using the type of advertising which can only be <Col N="110" /> described as exploitation, with very often no constraints whatsoever, it is very important that the Minister's intention is fully followed in that area. I know the Minister intends to take that matter further. I have always been dismayed at the fact that young people are so vulnerable to that type of advertising and that pressure is put on parents to respond to it. We have let that develop over the years and I hope something be done in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to hear that the likes of religious newspapers and so on can be advertised. I still remember the argument in regard to<i> The Irish Catholic</i> when it sought to advertise on radio but was refused. On the same day a book of very disreputable standing, containing very salacious type material, was advertised on that station, yet <i>The Irish Catholic </i>could not be advertised. If I interpret the legislation correctly, there will be a relaxation in that regard. I thank the Minister and look forward to the next Stages of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire. Is comhartha mhaith é go bhfuil sí fós i láthair agus é comh déanach, agus go bhfuil sí ag éisteacht go foighneach agus go haireach go dtí seo.</P>
      <P>My good friend, Bob Quinn, formerly of RTÉ, was one of the people who educated me about language and its use. He pointed out to me, for instance, that it is illegal to have political advertising. If one puts an advertisement telling people to buy Nestlé products, that is legitimate advertising. However, one cannot put an advertisement telling people not to buy Nestlé products because it exploits women in developing countries by trying to persuade them to use milk substitutes rather than breast feed their children, which is much healthier, because that is political advertising. One can put an advertisement persuading people to buy something because that is not political advertising, but one cannot put an advertisement persuading people not to buy something because that is political advertising. That is clearly wrong. We have to think through our vision of things.</P>
      <P>Huge multinationals have resources to persuade us and there is subtlety in a lot of their suggestions. The image they portray of themselves is vastly more benevolent than the St. Vincent de Paul Society. The reality of the human experience of their operations is quite different, yet it is impossible for organisations which would campaign against these people to use the media, even if they had the money, because we do not allow political advertising. Advertising which increases the prestige of major commercial organisations is political advertising, as is advertising which tries to persuade people that these companies are not worthy of our respect. It is one thing if they advertise their products but when they advertise themselves, whether it is the ESB with its wonderful self-serving of itself or Iarnród Éireann, these are political advertisements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I get older, I get more left wing in the sense that if I am asked to state my political position, I <Col N="111" /> think I am increasingly of the anarchist tendency on the left because I am profoundly suspicious of all authority. I am not aware of any authority that has not been abused. Therefore, when I say I am tired of hearing talk about communications revolutions, it is not because I have tired of revolution but because I have tired of the illusion of revolution, in particular the talk about broadcasting revolutions.</P>
    <P>There were two communications revolutions, the first was film, because of its portability, and the second was radio, because it was long distance. I think television was simply a refinement of radio. I know all the differences, but the real change was the instantaneous communication that radio made available. The other real change was film which made moving images available. Everything after that was a refinement.</P>
    <P>I was vigorously of the opinion, for instance, that the Internet was an interesting and exciting new concept but was not the revolution many people thought it was, and the marketplaces of the world have come to a similar conclusion at last. The reason is that we are not isolated creatures living in boxes who will stay at home all day clicking on a mouse buying items. An element of what we do in life is social. In the same way, it was predicted that cinemas would close down because of the video revolution, but the opposite has happened. People have asserted that there is something extra to a film than watching it at home, and the extra is the social nature. We are social creatures. The idea of some of these revolutions is, to say the least, overstated.</P>
    <P>I could go on forever about the function of television and I am sure Senator Mooney could as well, and I suspect Senator Ó Murchú could if he had time. We are all wonderful on the rhetoric. The words &ldquo;inform&rdquo;, &ldquo;entertain&rdquo;, &ldquo;educate&rdquo;, &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; and &ldquo;stretch&rdquo; are all fine rhetoric and we all believe in these things. One of our functions and that of the Minister is to ensure all those things continue to be part of television because if we left it to the marketplace, much as I admire Senator Quinn, we would not have all those things because the market does not work nearly as efficiently as its advocates suggest. It is a wonderful method of creating wealth but it is a very poor way of creating diversity. The market does not create diversity because entry costs are too high in many cases and much gets left behind.</P>
    <P>The crude reality of what many people would make of television is what I read by an American commentator whose name I cannot remember. The commentator said that television, as a medium, has a primary function, that is, to sell audiences to advertisers. It sounds awful but if one thinks of the function of mainstream television in the United States, that is what drives it, that is, the selling of audiences to advertisers. What happens in between only has a purpose to the degree to which it sells audiences to advertisers. I do not believe that is what television or broadcasting is about because I do not think that <Col N="112" /> is what human beings are about. We look around for other ways to communicate and when we do that, we end up with an inevitable decline, as has happened in many countries in terms of the proportion of the population that watches television. That is one of the problems they are having in the United States where the numbers of people watching television is dropping and they cannot figure out the reason. I have a totally unscientific view as to the reason &ndash; they are taking away from people the sense of involvement and they are making them feel like they are simply the ham in the sandwich between advertisers on the one side and audiences on the other. The audience is only part of a manipulation to sell.</P>
    <P>The most important quality future broadcasting must offer is diversity and pluralism. I strongly agree with Senator Ó Murchú in that pluralism is not just Catholics tolerating vigorously the rights of others to be different, it is also others accepting that Catholics have values that are equally entitled to be cherished and respected. I say this as one who has been on a different side on virtually every controversy over the last 20 years from the official Catholic Church. I have no patience with a reversed intolerance which flips over from the horrible anti-tolerist culture when I was a young person to a different kind of anti-tolerism which simply says &ldquo;we now have a whole new set of values which we will not allow to be articulated without being mocked&rdquo;. RTÉ does not do that very well.</P>
    <P>RTÉ is the most provincial station one could imagine except that its province is Dublin. It is an incredibly provincial station with a set of values which are based in Dublin. I shall give an example I have quoted in the House before. The alleged expert on sport on 2FM commented once, and Senator Mooney will probably remember this, that the Waterford hurling team were down to ten men because they had a man put off. We should not have people dealing with sport on our national broadcasting service whose instincts are so far from the understanding of life of ordinary people. It is not a question of censorship, it is a question of competence. 2FM has an obsession with the sports of the minority in the State. As the GAA will say, it is difficult for Gaelic games to get serious attention on 2FM. British soccer is one thing but to suggest there is a huge audience dying to hear who won between Longford Town and Bray Wanderers defies all reality, given the audiences they have.</P>
    <P>I am a great believer in diversity but I will not be manipulated by a Dublin based, Dublin focused, Dublin obsessed broadcasting station into believing these are the values of the nation at large. I still believe in public service broadcasting because so long as we have a public service broadcasting company I can work to change its vision but I cannot do so if it is not there. That is why I support passionately public service broadcasting and the right of myself and Senators Ó Murchú and Mooney and anybody else to tell <Col N="113" /> them where they are wrong, because they are profoundly wrong.</P>
    <P>I remember another genius on 2FM asking somebody why he was up early on a Sunday morning. Of course it would be impossible on RTÉ to point out that perhaps 60% to 70% of its listening audience was up early on a Sunday morning because they happen to be going to Mass. One does not talk about that on RTÉ any more. There are a whole series of values, one of which disappoints me. That nearly 40% of the population still vote for Fianna Fáil is difficult for RTÉ to comprehend, as it is for me, but that is a different issue. There is a succession of facts about Irish life &ndash; that nearly 70% of the population go to church every Sunday, that the dominant sporting organisation of free choice of the Irish people is the GAA, that 40% of the people vote for Fianna Fáil &ndash; that RTÉ, because of its incredible Dublin focus, has a difficulty with. That affects all of us because it makes it impossible to have the dialogue with ourselves that we ought to have about what we are doing with Irish life. I still believe in public service broadcasting and believe strongly in RTÉ.</P>
    <P>On the topic of its Dublin obsession I shall quote a couple of figures. I had a row with &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; and because of this I have not been on it for about seven years. However, that is a separate issue and I enjoy things like that. I did a quick check because I was annoyed. In a period of about 15 months from the beginning of 1998 I went through all the non-politician panels to find that almost 90% of them were Dublin based. There are three universities outside Dublin. There are newspapers outside Dublin. Yet 90% of the people &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; think have something worthwhile to say about Irish life were based in Dublin. I say this to politicians: if one takes out frontbench spokespersons and the Ministers, the vast majority of the politicians it has on are Dublin based. The young Deputies chosen to speak to the nation are based in Dublin. I think it is an incredibly provincial view of Ireland. People in Cork, before my time and for a while afterwards, were accused of having this extraordinary belief that the community of people who live in Dublin were representative of Ireland at large. They are part of Ireland and are an important strand of it but they are not Ireland in a whole series of dimensions and it is a great pity. This is being bitchy, but it is late and I am entitled to be so &ndash; the eminent Senators from Trinity, behind me here, are permanent fixtures on many of RTÉ's programmes, whereas mere representatives of three times as many graduates like myself and Senator Quinn are not in such a privileged position. RTÉ is riddled with this Dublin elitism. I was supposed to meet it today but I had something else to do so I did not. This extends to all sorts of things.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" /> Senator Ó Murchú mentioned <i>The Irish Catholic.</i> We should have radio stations which are run by religious groups, subject to the same laws as everybody else. I have no idea why one of the most church-going countries in the world is probably the only one that does not have legitimate, mainstream, legalised religious broadcasting. There is an incredible prissiness about what we allow and I agree with Senator Mooney. There is much room for diversity. To the extent that technology allows, the limit of the number of radio stations here should be the limit of the number of people who are prepared to do something different. I do not want us to open up 100 radio stations all doing the same thing. Anybody who is prepared to put money into broadcasting, particularly in radio which is becoming a low cost media, and do something different, whether it be dance music, world music, all talk shows with the gay and lesbian society or whatever is within the laws of the land, should be allowed do so, otherwise we are saying we are afraid of ideas.</P>
    <P>If one switches on the radio after 6 o'clock it is difficult to believe there is much diversity available apart from what RTÉ does with its various channels. I am glad the Minister is looking at the issue of children's advertising. Because of the amendments I hope to table, I will give her some encouragement in that matter. I said at a meeting this morning that we like to look back at 100 years ago or 50 years ago and wonder at the things that were tolerated &ndash; 150 years ago children of nine and ten years of age would be at work. I believe that in 100 years' time people will look back and wonder how civilised societies, such as those of western Europe and North America, allowed their children to be bombarded with such a range of manipulative advertising, based on the assumption that children were open to manipulation. It should be banned. There is no other way. It is ironic that secular pagan Sweden would be the most enthusiastic advocate of this rather than the countries which would strike poses about their concern for children but not be able to face the commercial reality. The famous phrase that is attributed to an executive in a private television channel is quite simple, ban advertising to children and we drop children's programmes. There are regulatory ways of dealing with that. It is inherently wrong.</P>
    <P>A number of radio stations opening around the country are defining themselves as very narrowly focused. That does not bother me. They are youth stations for the 15 to 25 age group, in particular. Any radio station which has as part of its target audience people who are under 18 should not be allowed to have any advertising related to alcohol. That means that all these radio stations will probably close down because they are not there to provide a service but to sell that audience to advertisers. The idea that one could have a radio station which specifically says part of its audience is under 18 and which would be driven to a large <Col N="115" /> extent either directly or by sponsorship, breweries in particular, is profoundly wrong. I do not worry about young people in terms of drug taking, but I worry about their scale of drinking.</P>

      <P>This matter is of considerable concern to the Sheriff Street community. St. Laurence O'Toole's primary school, Seville Place, has a crèche and a pre-school is located there. The crèche deals with young children from the age of 18 months to three years, while the pre-school deals with pupils from three to five years. The Department of Education and Science proposes to refurbish the primary school, to commence this June, with an expected timescale of 12 months.</P>
      <P>Provision is being made for prefabricated buildings in the yard of the primary school while no provision is being made for the pre-school, the crèche or the after school project, which is located in one of the two rooms that were assigned in the earlier days to the current pre-school and crèche facility. Expansion was made in that direction as the numbers diminished.</P>
      <P>The primary school needs considerable refurbishment. This should have been done years ago and it should have been made brighter and more attractive. At present it resembles an almost prison-style building and it badly needs upgrading. The problem is that there is no place to locate the pre-school, the crèche or the after school service. That means that almost 100 young children will be deprived of a service if something is not done about it.</P>
      <P>What is required is an interim arrangement at least for the school year. The emphasis is on a more holistic approach to education and the provision of funding by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in terms of capital grants for premises. The Department of Education and Science should consider the provision of permanent premises. It should not be left in limbo where it is not known from day to day whether a service will be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What steps is the Department prepared to take to ensure that the children in the crèche, the pre-school and the after school will have a premises and that their parents will be satisfied that they will receive the services, both educational and child care, which they are getting at present? As far as I am aware, no provision has been made in the plans by the Department to address the refurbishment problem. If this is not addressed it will be a matter of concern to the community involved and I have no doubt it will be protested <Col N="116" /> to in the most substantial terms in the Taoiseach's constituency. I hope the Minster has good news to report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Senator Costello has given me the opportunity to outline to the House the position regarding refurbishment work to be carried out at St. Laurence O'Toole's primary school, Seville Place. The management authorities of the school applied to the Department of Education and Science for grant assistance towards improved accommodation. The Department subsequently approved a major refurbishment project to proceed to architectural planning and a design team was appointed to advance the project through the various stages of the planning process. The project is at an advanced stage of architectural planning and it is intended to begin construction when this has been completed.</P>
      <P>The question of providing on-site temporary accommodation for the teachers and pupils of the primary school during the construction phase is currently under consideration and the Department will shortly be in contact with the school about this. However, it is a matter for the school authorities to address the accommodation needs of the crèche and pre-school as the Department does not provide capital funding for such facilities.</P>
      <P>With regard to the funding of schools generally, the Senator will be aware that significant progress has been made by the Government over the past three years in eliminating substandard schools. The project at St. Laurence O'Toole's primary school is part of this ongoing process and the Department's priority is to ensure that the permanent accommodation at the school is upgraded as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>I am not. The Department is providing pre-fabricated buildings for the primary school pupils but is providing nothing for the crèche and the pre-school, both of which have been in place for years.

      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for affording me the opportunity to raise this important matter. The nursing home in Lisdoonvarna, County Clare, is one of the oldest health establishments in the county and has been in existence for over half a century. Unfortunately, the sisters had to close the home at the end of December last. Prior to closing they were not allowed by the health board to admit patients since June 2000.</P>
      <P>Many discussions and meetings have been held. One very crucial meeting was held between the five Oireachtas Members from Clare and senior executives of the Mid-Western Health Board in their head office in Limerick. At that meeting a very clear commitment was given to the five Oireachtas Members from County Clare, including the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, who holds a constitutional position. The commitment given was clear and definitive, that is, that the health board was not prepared to take over the running of the Stella Maris nursing home nor was it prepared to purchase it. However, it would be prepared &ndash; this followed many discussions and connecting with other health boards such as the North Eastern Health Board &ndash; to put in place a certain package. A commitment was given to the five Oireachtas Members that they would subvent 35 beds for the care of the elderly to the tune of £200 per bed for a minimum of ten years. Given that this was stated openly and clearly to the five Oireachtas Members from Clare, needless to say, it was soon conveyed by us to the action committee, the Friends of Lisdoonvarna Stella Maris nursing home. The result was that people who had not previously shown interest in the nursing home then did so.</P>
      <P>A fundamental principle is at stake here. First, a commitment was given to the Oireachtas Members from Clare on which it now appears the health board is reneging. Second, the health board agreed that there was a need for this facility in north Clare given the demography of the area and the disproportionate number of elderly people in the area. Given that the home had to be closed down by the end of December for legal and labour law reasons, they also gave a commitment that having placed the patients elsewhere &ndash; some patients were placed outside the county in County Galway &ndash; they would be returned to Stella Maris as soon as it was opened. What happened since is dishonourable, despicable and totally unacceptable.</P>
      <P>As a public representative from Clare, I will not stand for the way the Mid-Western Health Board is treating the people of north Clare or indeed the Oireachtas Members from Clare. When potential purchasers contacted the health board it responded:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" /> The position the Board must take in regard to your proposal, which is similar to the position already taken with the other party is that the Board cannot enter into any prior agreements/arrangements with a prospective purchaser of a closed Nursing Home. In addition, the Board cannot guarantee that it will enter into any arrangements with any new owners of the former Nursing Home should the former Nursing Home be purchased for the purpose of operating it as a Private Nursing Home, then, the Board will be prepared to discuss options for the contracting of services by the Board, as appropriate, but without any prior commitment whatsoever on the Board's part.</P>
    <P>It issued the following press release yesterday to the local media in Clare:</P>
    <P>We are informed that one prospective purchaser is said to be at an advanced stage in the purchase of Stella Maris. Such a purchase, if finalized, will be done without any commitment on the Board's behalf to contract nursing home beds from the new proprietor. The Board has not, and will not, enter into any prior arrangements with any prospective purchaser of the former nursing home, Stella Maris.</P>
    <P>This is all very fine and, needless to say, one cannot operate in a nebulous situation; one must have something concrete with which to deal. However, I believe the commitment given to the Oireachtas Members should be publicly stated and restated so that it is not just confined to a purchaser who has the capital to purchase and who does not actually need a letter of comfort to support raising money in the bank if he or she chooses to purchase. By adopting this position, the health board is automatically excluding people who have not the necessary capital to buy the property without a commitment of any nature, while the actual need and requirement for beds exists, which it has admitted.</P>
    <P>My request to the Minister of State is very clear. On 1 December the Oireachtas Members had a meeting in Limerick with senior personnel from the health board in their offices. That evening they were sending a submission to the Department of Health and Children seeking the type of financial support required and making the proposal in writing to the health board. As far as I am concerned, we were given to understand that the goodwill, intent and commitment were there to do this. We will not accept the way we are being treated from the point of view of providing proper care for the elderly of north Clare. These people deserve to be left in north Clare and not shipped off somewhere else, or out of the county in some instances. The health board has acknowledged this fact.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister of State to do one very simple thing, that is, to check the proposals which were sent to his Department on 1 December and, having checked them, to get on to the health board to stop the duplicity as far as the Stella <Col N="119" /> Maris nursing home is concerned. He should tell the health board to stop playing games to the advantage of one person over another. If arrangements were put in place subsequent to the purchase, it has played games to automatically exclude others. If public money is involved, there should be transparency and accountability. It is imperative for the Minister of State to ensure there is fair play in relation to who purchases the property. This will automatically ensure fair play for the elderly of north Clare when it comes to the provision of a proper and competent service, operated by capable and competent people.</P>
    <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for affording me the opportunity to raise this very serious matter. It is serious because of the nature of the issue and the fact that public representatives deserve to be treated better by their health board than has been the case to date. These letters and press statements totally renege on the word given to us on 1 December in Perry Street, Limerick.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Taylor-Quinn for raising this issue which has been raised also by Deputies Killeen, Daly and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the Stella Maris private nursing home is a privately owned facility, operated by the Sisters of Charity of Our Lady of Evron. I understand the order decided to dispose of the property on the open market and a closing date of 31 December 2000 was set. I have been informed by the health board that prior to its closure residents found alternative accommodation and any person who experienced difficulty was assisted by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health board has advised that interest has been expressed by prospective purchasers in the Stella Maris private nursing home. However, as this transaction will be conducted on the open market, it will be a matter for decision and agreement between the vendor and the purchaser. While the board has no direct role in any sales negotiations, should a purchaser decide to reopen the nursing home as a going concern, the board has advised that it will then be prepared to dis<Col N="120" /> cuss options under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board to determine its priorities for the provision of health services in its area within its revenue allocation as notified in the annual letters of determination. In this connection, additional revenue funding provided for services for older people has been increased significantly in recent years. For example, in respect of the Mid-Western Health Board, the amount of additional funding has increased from £180,000 in 1997 to £3.573 million in the current year. In the case of the nursing home subvention scheme, the amount made available rose from £1.169 million in 1994, the first full year of the scheme, to approximately £4.5 million in 2001. The Department, therefore, is awaiting further communication from the Mid-Western Health Board in regard to this whole issue.</P>
