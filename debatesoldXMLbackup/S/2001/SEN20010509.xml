      <P>I have received notice from Senator Glennon that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to commission a comprehensive feasibility study as to the potential development of the existing military aviation facility at Gormanston Aerodrome for conversion to a civil aviation facility, prior to a final decision being taken on the aerodrome's future.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Tom Hayes of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide adequate accommodation for the Gaelscoil in Clonmel, County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Valuation Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage, with the contribution of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and of all other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes and on which Senators may share time; No. 15, motion 24, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Business, if not previously concluded, will resume thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I first of all wish the Minister for Foreign Affairs a speedy recovery after his unfortunate accident last Friday as he was going from this House where he had been performing so well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to raise two issues on the Order of Business. I request a debate in the fairly near future on Northern Ireland. Events are moving very rapidly there and it is a long time since the House has had an opportunity to debate the issue. Many Members on all sides would like to hear the Taoi<Col N="822" /> seach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs and air their own views.</P>
    <P>I also ask for an urgent debate on the whole question of sports policy and sports funding. I am thinking in particular of the situation in the Football Association of Ireland, which is about to receive fairly massive injections of State funding. We read very disturbing reports of the extraordinarily incompetent and shoddy way in which that organisation runs its own financial affairs. We read of massive six-figure payoffs to people who have been clearly guilty of a breach of their duties, if not worse. We see a veil of secrecy surrounding the activities of that organisation where cover-ups seem to be the name of the game over a long period of time. Yet, this is the same organisation which is to be entrusted with huge amounts of public funding. It would be important and useful if we could have a debate on the whole question of the criteria which apply to the funding of sports, sporting organisations and the entailed accountability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader gave a commitment that he would have a significant debate on education when time permitted after dealing with the issues relating to the referenda. Members of the House have called for different aspects of education to be debated, from adult education to drugs education and other areas. The issue of the rights of children with special needs, because of all that has happened in the area of education in recent times, has been raised on both sides of the House. It would be very important for the Members of both sides of the House to indicate their views and their understanding of the importance not just of access to education but also participation in the process.</P>
      <P>Education is a bit like the Ritz Hotel &ndash; anybody can walk in but if you do not have the money, you cannot properly participate in what is happening. We must ensure that this area of participation includes people no matter what their special needs. I ask for an all-day debate which could be structured to deal with certain aspects during certain times of the day and that the Minister should take questions. The education area attracts more motions on the Adjournment than any other. It would be useful to have a directed and controlled debate in this House on the topic over the course of a day. I ask the Leader to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to bring to the attention of the Minister for Defence and the Marine my concerns in relation to the sale of Clancy Barracks which is being touted abroad for a giveaway price of £20 million. The local authority concerned, Dublin Corporation, and the Dublin City Manager, have already indicated that they wish to purchase the barracks at a reasonable price just as they have also indicated a desire to purchase church lands which are now increasingly being made available, in order to deal with the enormous crisis of homelessness <Col N="823" /> and the issue of social housing in the city. It would be a terrible shame if almost 17 acres of prime land within the Dublin Corporation area&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I interrupt Senator Costello for a moment. The subject matter of the Private Members' motion will give the Senator an opportunity to discuss these matters. The points he is now making could be made more appropriately during the Private Members' debate this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly appreciate the Cathaoirleach's being flexible enough to allow a debate on this issue.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Transport to come to the House. Once again there is an industrial dispute and a crisis and we have a Minister who, ostrich-fashion, says that it is no concern of hers. What is the purpose in having a Minister if at a time of crisis she washes her hands of it and says it is somebody else's problem? Her attitude is that they started it so let them settle it. Perhaps the Leader would ask the Minister to come into this House and explain why she is not prepared to take any initiative in trying to resolve this dispute which last year caused revenue losses of £50 million and endless problems for the ordinary commuter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I support that call. Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Public Enterprise to come into the House and demonstrate to us what can be done to tackle this industrial relations problem which seems to be endemic to Iarnród Éireann and, like Mount Etna, is liable to erupt with far-reaching negative consequences at any time? The story of Iarnród Éireann is a sad saga of low pay, low morale, poor management and poor motivation. Some root and branch action will have to be taken in the interest of every citizen and in the interest of the tourism sector which has suffered severely due to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. Something has to be done and I want that matter discussed comprehensively, calmly and reasonably in this House with a view to taking corrective action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader if he can give us an indication when there will be action with regard to implementation of the Human Rights Convention into Irish law. Once again today we were criticised by a senior judge, Judge Catherine McGuinness, for our tardiness in not having done this. Speaking of the Oireachtas, she says, you would wonder what they are at. Perhaps the Leader will be able to tell us what we are at and what the Government proposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly support Senator Costello's call with regard to the rail strike, but I do not think we should pillory the Minister before we hear what she has to say. In my opinion, she is a particularly good Minister and the union situation should be looked at. It is outrageous that an inter-union dis<Col N="824" /> pute should hold the businesses and the passengers of this country to ransom in the way it is being allowed to happen. I look forward to our colleagues in the ICTU using their good offices to resolve this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's call for a debate on children with special needs. This is a matter that comes up regularly in the Seanad as part of other debates when we are looking for extra remedial teachers or on Matters on the Adjournment concerning these children. I would particularly welcome such a debate because I have been asked to make the keynote speech at a conference on this subject. I would like, as a Member of the Oireachtas, to go to that conference and say that we in the Oireachtas take this matter seriously and are prepared to say something about it.</P>
      <P>May I say to my colleague, Senator O'Toole, who used the old platitude about going to the Ritz, that anybody can go into the Ritz but there is a problem once you get in. I was there not too long ago and if they think you have an Irish accent they give you a teapot with a thick spout so that the tea dribbles all over the place. You have to be very careful and indicate you are Irish and that you would know a thick teapot when you see it&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris, this is very interesting but it is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and would insist on an English teapot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought for a moment Senator Norris was going to remind us about the famous silver teapot that was presented one time. If it is still in working order, perhaps it could be used in the Ritz for Irish guests. That would definitely be an Irish teapot.</P>
      <P>I am sure colleagues on all sides of the House would wish our colleague, Senator O'Toole, well in his capacity as vice-president of ICTU. He made an excellent contribution on the &ldquo;News at One&rdquo; programme today which was fair minded and moderate. I hope that attitude will prevail in the discussions tomorrow. It is an extremely difficult point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join Senator Manning in calling for a debate on sports funding. I am somewhat taken aback at what I can only refer to as an astonishing attack on the FAI. Every major sporting organisation here has at one time or another been pilloried for its lack of administrative expertise of one sort or another. Everybody in the House will know I acquire some of my paltry income from work as a sports journalist. I am a sports person and like many Irish people I follow a variety of sports, not least Gaelic, soccer and rugby among others. Senator Manning's remarks seem to be a veiled <Col N="825" /> attack on the initiative the Government has taken. It is yet another example of old Irish begrudgery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Two chief executives in a row have been fired and there has been a £250,000 payoff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator may raise a question for the Leader on the Order of Business. This type of debate is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. My question is in the context of the remarks that have been made and the justification for a debate. We have listened to Senator Norris, my distinguished friend and colleague, who as usual has expounded on a wide range of subjects on the Order of Business. Well done to him, we all enjoyed it. It would not be a debate&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>These matters can be dealt with during the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate I am seeking is not about an attack on a sporting organisation that is trying to do the best it can for young people with the help of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will have adequate opportunity to make these points during the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but it is about sports finance and I hope the Leader, in responding to the request, will frame the debate so that it will not be seen to be one-sided or an attack, veiled or otherwise, on one sporting organisation because of what I believe to be a magnanimous gesture by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should please resume his seat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the issue of Irish women in prison. I ask the Leader of the House to make representations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs about Irish women in prisons in Northern Ireland. Professor Monica McWilliams, MLA, exposed a disgraceful situation in Mourne House, the women's prison in Northern Ireland, where 60% of the warders are men. This is totally against international policy, which suggests that only 10% of warders in women's prisons should be men, and <i>vice versa</i> in men's prisons. This problem did not exist in Armagh prison where there was trouble enough. I would be grateful if it could be debated in the House, but if this is unsuitable, I would be very glad if the Leader would raise it with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Education and Science my hope that the Government will respond very quickly to the outcome of the ASTI's discussions today. I join Senator O'Toole in seeking a debate on edu<Col N="826" /> cation for children with special needs. Two sessions ago, I was promised a debate on autism and appropriate education, which could be included in the debate on children with special needs.</P>
      <P>The saga of contaminated blood seems to continue. There have been reports that the Mid-Western Health Board has had to recall 715 patients to have their blood groups checked as a precaution. I am extremely concerned and I feel that this should be discussed in the House.</P>
      <P>With many others from Munster, I had to commute from Limerick today and I agree with Senator Quill that the Minister should come here so that we can debate the ongoing industrial problems in Iarnród Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's request for a full debate on the many aspects of education. Senator O'Toole referred to children with special needs. This debate should be extended to include the success or otherwise of the Breaking the Cycle programme and review how the disadvantaged are faring under the new schemes available at all levels. This is particularly worthwhile now that we are reforming the Vocational Education Act of the 1930s and it would be an opportunity to have a debate before taking that Bill in this House. I hope this can take place before the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The demise of rural post offices will drive another stake into the heart of rural Ireland. More Government business must be put through the network and the services need to be expanded and enhanced. The sooner the Minister makes the appropriate arrangements the better. Some time ago Senator Manning called for a debate on the Flynn report on post offices. Such a debate would be extremely timely and I call on the Leader to arrange it for next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's call for a debate on education. Perhaps the Leader will consider including that as part of the issue of school bullying, on which I have so often called for a debate.</P>
      <P>I support the call for the Minister for Public Enterprise to come to the House and was somewhat surprised and amused to hear Senator Costello's contribution. The Minister seems to be damned if she does and damned if she does not &ndash; she cannot win no matter what she does. Bringing her to the House would be a marvellous opportunity for fair-minded Members to articulate the many achievements of the Minister. It would be an ideal opportunity for Senator Costello, as a lifelong member of a trade union, to call&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer if Senator Glynn did not address his remarks to Senator Costello. The Senator should address his remarks to the Chair. It is not in order for a Senator on either side to engage with another Senator on the Order of Business. Questions or requests should <Col N="827" /> be put to the Leader who will reply at the conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the relevant union is affiliated to the Labour Party, maybe Senator Costello will have a word with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Leader a number of times when the promised disability legislation will come to the House. I note from the Government's programme of legislation that this will not happen before the summer recess. In that context I ask for a debate on disability and equality in which we could raise in particular the concern of people with disabilities that they are not receiving the type of training necessary to include them in the workforce, especially in the technology sector. If we are to be inclusive in terms of people with disabilities, we must in fairness give them the type of training which will ensure they are able to participate in the workforce to the fullest possible extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Public Enterprise not to come into the House under any circumstances as it would be inappropriate for her to come for a debate on an industrial dispute. The Tánaiste is the person who should come to the House for such a debate. We should not be discussing an industrial dispute for which there is no ministerial responsibility, as has rightly been said, but the role of trade unions in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the problem we are currently facing. What happened to the clause for industrial peace promised barely weeks ago when the phantom document, the pay deal, was signed? There has been a strike in Aer Lingus, by train drivers and by ASTI since that promise of industrial peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ross has made his case for a debate on the role of the trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us have in the House the Tánaiste, whose responsibility it is, to discuss the trade union movement which holds much power and which is being abused by some elements.</P>
      <P>The case we are currently facing is not cut and dried. We should be very careful not to automatically blame the smaller unions in this dispute. There is a problem and the disproportionate damage they are doing to the economy and the people is appalling, but we should acknowledge that the ATGWU has a case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should not pre-empt the debate he is seeking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="ÜfcMr. Ross ÜfcMr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not doing so. These people have a case and that is why a mature and sensible debate in the House should take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Manning in asking for a debate on sport and its organisation. The relationship between sport and business is such that many people are making a fortune from what was considered sport. The change from an amateur to a professional system is causing problems in all sporting organisations, be it the GAA, the IRFU or the smaller groups. I called for a debate after the Olympics, but we did not have a full debate on the matter at the time. It is appropriate that we now have such a debate. The relationship between sport and business is such that it is difficult to work out how to associate, for example, the premiership or first division of the League of Ireland with smaller clubs. There are more soccer teams&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter can be explored in detail during the debate which has been sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be a general debate without recrimination because young people and the future of sport, not the future of the business at the top echelons, are important.</P>
      <P>In view of the huge escalation of violence in the Middle East, I ask the Leader for a debate on the issue. The violence is escalating on a daily basis and we should at least have a say on what action might be taken. We cannot condone the recent murder of a baby and the apparent murder of two Israelis yesterday. We must have a debate on the issue and have our voices heard before the situation in the region blows up, which is likely to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has made his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely ask for a debate on the issue in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's request for a debate on sport which should include all aspects such as sporting scholarships and so on. This matter has never been debated in either House, therefore, it should be included in the debate.</P>
      <P>I would also like to raise the issue of motor insurance which has been raised on previous occasions by several Senators. A recent survey showed that young people are now buying motor bikes because they cannot afford to insure cars. I ask the Leader of the House to arrange for a special debate as a matter of urgency on the whole issue of car insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Senators who called for a debate on sport and I wish to outline the genuine commitment of this Government to community groups and sporting organisations <Col N="829" /> throughout the country, particularly in peripheral and Gaeltacht areas.</P>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the rail strike and draw attention to the concerns expressed particularly in relation to the Munster area where rail services to the south have been seriously affected by the rail strike. I recognise the input of my colleague, Senator O'Toole, in regard to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. I come from the west of Ireland which suffered ten weeks of withdrawal of services last year, unlike any other part of the country. There is a serious need for the trade unions involved in this dispute to realise the consequences of their actions for people throughout the country who are suffering and need to travel to the west to transact business. I ask all those involved in the trade union movement and the Minister to seriously look at the consequences of this dispute, including the rights of the public which are being trampled on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support the calls for the Minister to come to this House for a debate on industrial relations. I join in the sense of outrage and anger which currently exists among the public in relation to the issue. It appears that the ghost of ILDA will haunt the nation for a second year in succession. It is more than a coincidence that those involved in ILDA are now predominantly involved in the present dispute. We must have a debate on industrial relations in this Chamber because people will not tolerate such disruption for a second year. The west of Ireland is just recovering following ten weeks when there were no tourists in that region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just responding to the sense of annoyance and outrage in the west and throughout the country as a result of this dispute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in calling for a debate on sport. It is essential when the debate takes place to draw a distinction between the commercial element of sport, which I would describe as show business, and real sport, with which we all grew up and entails honest athletic endeavour on the part of ordinary people. Sport has changed dramatically and become hugely commercial in recent years. We tend to think of sport as what we see on television but that is not the case. There are hundreds of thousands of people still involved in honest amateur athletic endeavour and that is the sport we should seek to cultivate. I look forward to the Minister coming to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join other Members in calling for a debate on industrial relations, particularly given the current difficulties with the rail system. The time is long gone when a small group of people should be able to hold the country to ransom. I am aware of students who missed examinations yesterday at <Col N="830" /> the end of their college year through what appears to be a relatively petty row between very small groups of people. I am not unduly concerned whether it is the Minister for Public Enterprise or the Tánaiste who comes in, but the time has come for essential services such as the railway system to be dealt with as such in our industrial relations machinery.</P>

      <P>I support the call for a debate on sport. One of the major issues in this regard relates to purchasing land for community purposes, particularly sports facilities, in growing towns. It is impossible for community groups to raise the hundreds of thousands of pounds being demanded for an acre of land in growing towns, particularly on the east coast. That is a major issue that must be addressed.</P>
      <P>I also support the call for a debate on industrial relations and transport in particular. There is a lot the Government can do. It should allow everybody to use bus lanes when the train drivers are on strike. There are thousands of extra cars coming into the city in the past few days, yet they cannot use the bus lanes. It is disgraceful and unacceptable that the unions are monopolising transport and the life of the community. I condemn what they are doing. The ICTU should have a proper writ which should be respected and obeyed.</P>

      <P>Senators Manning, Mooney, Lanigan, Burke, Chambers, Glennon and O'Dowd called for a debate on sports, the Government's sports policy and the Government's achievements over the past four years in relation to sport. This would be a worthwhile debate and I will have the Minister present for it in the next two or three weeks if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators O'Toole, Norris, Jackman, Ormonde, Glynn and Kett called for a debate on education. The new VEC legislation, which is currently going through the Dáil, will be passed before the summer recess.

    <P>Senator Costello commented on the sale of land at Clancy Barracks. As the Chair correctly pointed out, the Senator will have ample opportunity tonight to make his case, but if he and other Members still feel strongly enough that not enough time has been given to this we can revisit it in the future.</P>
    <P>Senators Costello, Quill, Chambers, Caffrey, Glennon and O'Dowd expressed great concern about the current rail strike and the difficulties that is posing for practically everyone in the community. Senator O'Dowd called for bus lanes to be reopened to all traffic, as journeys which took an hour and a half now take two and a half hours, as we found yesterday and today. There is certainly an onus on everyone concerned.</P>
    <P>The generosity of people throughout the country in every line of business during the foot and mouth crisis was responsible and heartening, to say the least. Summer trade is beginning, businesses are trying to relaunch and various things are happening. The Taoiseach reopened Dublin Zoo a few days ago and the St. Patrick's Day festival is taking place on the weekend after next. We are trying to let the world know Ireland is open for business and the tourist season has started and is in full swing.</P>
    <P>We know negotiation and consultation will be the order of the day and I call on Senator Costello to use his influence through his party to see if something can be done about this dispute. I welcome whatever help he can bring to this delicate and serious position in which workers, employers and Government employees find themselves. It is a serious state of affairs and something that should be addressed immediately.</P>
    <P>I will pass Senator Norris's views to the Minister. I join Senator Mooney in congratulating Senator O'Toole. I can certainly pass on Senator Henry's views to the Minister.</P>
    <P>We share the views of Senators Jackman and Coghlan in relation to post offices which are the backbone of rural communities. I look forward with interest to hearing various proposals on how post offices can play a more leading role, considering banks are changing their policies, communities are enlarging and the population is increasing in many areas. Emigration is no longer a factor and 45,000 people are joining the workforce every year. There will be a need for an improved post office service, so I support fully the request made by Senator Coghlan.</P>

    <Title>Valuation Bill, 2000: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators will be aware, the Bill is the first comprehensive valuation legislation introduced since the 1850s. It is designed to modernise, streamline and improve the operation of the valuation system, which was the basis for the collection of slightly more than £450 million in local authority rates in 2000.</P>
      <P>The legislation will remove deficiencies that have built up over the years in the valuation system, bring the system into line with the contemporary commercial environment and make it more transparent and equitable for the ratepayer. A key motivation for introducing the legislation is to allow a valuation of commercial and industrial properties to take place in all rating authority areas over a period of years; a national valuation has not been undertaken since the middle of the 19th century. By this means, a uniform and equitable valuation base will be established and anomalies will be removed. There will be a return to the use of full net annual values, rather than the confusing fractions arrangement that is operated at present.</P>
      <P>Provision is being made in the Bill for periodic valuations to be undertaken in all local authority areas on a five to ten year basis. This will ensure that valuations are kept in line with changes in market values and provide for fairness and equity between ratepayers.</P>
      <P>Increasing local authorities' rates income through a valuation is not the purpose of the new legislation. To put this beyond doubt, provision is made for the capping of the increase in the overall rates income of a rating authority area in the year in which the first valuation is used for rating purposes, to a percentage not greater than the increase in the consumer price index.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the new legislation will enhance the opportunities for ratepayers to be involved in the valuation process from an early stage. In addition to retaining the existing multi-tiered appeals system, it introduces, at the initial stage of the valuation process, a new consultative phase. The consultative phase means that in future ratepayers will be notified of the Valuation Office's proposed determination in respect of their property before it becomes effective for rating purposes. The ratepayers will then be given an opportunity <Col N="833" /> of making a submission to the Valuation Office, if they so wish, about that determination. The Valuation Office will be required to take into account any such submissions received before the valuation certificate is issues and valuation list amended or published.</P>
    <P>The Bill is comprehensive legislation which provides for the repeal of existing valuation legislation and its replacement by modern legislation for those elements of the current valuation system it is proposed to retain; a valuation of all rateable property in the country on a rolling basis &ndash; this means the valuation of individual rating authorities in a planned sequential manner, it is planned that the whole country will be valued over a period of five years and that there will be subsequent valuations at regular intervals thereafter; the continued use of net annual value &ndash; NAV &ndash; as the basis of valuation and a return to the use of full NAV; and the continued exemption from rates of a wide range of properties currently exempt from rates. Such properties include domestic property, agricultural land and non-residential farm buildings; land developed for forestry, horticulture or sport; State-occupied property; certain properties of a cultural nature such as non-commercial art galleries, museums, libraries, national monuments and legally designated national cultural institutions; property used by charitable organisations exclusively in a non-commercial manner for charitable purposes and property occupied by An Taisce; and bed and breakfast accommodation and self-catering accommodation. However, I am ensuring that aparthotels will be subject to rates.</P>
    <P>The main changes proposed in the rates are the extension of the current exempt status enjoyed by most schools on the basis that they are not established or conducted for profit and-or are State-funded to those universities or other third level institutions on the same basis which are not already exempted from rates; confirming the rateability of VEC offices and the rating of those non-commercial State-sponsored bodies and agencies not already paying rates, such as An Bord Pleanála; the rating of the administrative offices of the health boards and Teagasc; the full rating of all harbours, except those in State occupation; the current fixed-term relief from rates for the mining and land based petroleum extraction industries is being abolished; repealing the existing arrangements for valuing Irish Rail and allowing for the option of globally valuing that organisation; and an exemption from rates for property used to breed and rear fish is being applied.</P>
    <P>In addition the Bill provides for the streamlining of the valuation process and providing ratepayers with a formal opportunity to be heard in the process of determining rateable valuations; new, or revised, valuations to be effective for rates purposes immediately from the date of being put on the valuation list rather than, as currently, from the beginning of the following rating year; enhanced powers for the Valuation Office to obtain information relevant to the valuation <Col N="834" /> process and to obtain access to property for valuation purposes; the continued use and updating of existing valuation lists until such time as new valuation lists are made available from the initial valuation proposed in the Bill; and giving the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the power to specify the maximum rates income for local authorities in the first year in which a revaluation is effective for rating purposes. Furthermore, the Bill re-enacts various provisions relating to the Commissioner of Valuation and the Valuation Tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been in gestation for a number of years. In 1995, an interdepartmental review of the rateable valuation system was undertaken by the Department of Finance, the then Department of the Environment and the Valuation Office. This review was prompted by the need to carry out a thorough study of the valuation system and to consider options for improving it before any work commenced on comprehensive valuation legislation. The findings and the recommendations of the review group have significantly influenced the drawing up of the Valuation Bill.</P>
    <P>The existing valuation legislation provides for the valuation of all fixed property, including land and buildings. Valued also is incorporeal property, defined as property with no physical existence, such as tolls, easements, fishery rights and other rights over property. The Valuation Office has responsibility for the valuation system. Rates are no longer collected on domestic property, as a result of the provisions of the 1978 Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, or on agricultural land, as a consequence of a 1984 Supreme Court decision, although both of these categories of property are still included in the valuation lists. Therefore, the commercial and industrial sectors now effectively constitute the rateable valuation base.</P>
    <P>The basis of assessment for valuation purposes is the net annual value of a property. The NAV of a property is equivalent to the annual rent, exclusive of all payments in respect of rates, taxes, repairs and insurance, which a property could reasonably be expected to command. The rateable occupier, the person who has to pay the rates, is the person in the immediate use and enjoyment of the property, that is the tenant or the owner in certain cases. Rating authorities and ratepayers have the option of having a property listed for revision. As no national valuation has been carried out in the last century and a half, this revision process is effectively the only way in which the valuation lists have been changed in the intervening years.</P>
    <P>The principal recommendation made by the interdepartmental review group was that a valuation of all rateable property should be undertaken. The primary objectives of such a valuation are to remove anomalies in the valuation lists, to establish a uniform and equitable valuation base and to lessen the risk of any eventual challenge to the valuation system. Anomalies are widespread in the valuation lists. This is principally <Col N="835" /> because no national valuation has been carried out since the national valuation of all property between 1852 and 1865. The rateable valuation of a property had been intended to be equivalent to its net annual value, but over time the rateable valuation increasingly represented a smaller and smaller fraction of the net annual value. It is necessary to update the valuation lists to eliminate any anomalies as they form the base on which a substantial part of locally raised revenue for local government is levied. This will be done through a national valuation based on the new legislation.</P>
    <P>The proposed valuation, the first general valuation since the middle of the 19th century, will be a significant undertaking. Accordingly, the Bill provides that the valuation be carried out on a rolling basis. This means that each rating authority area will be separately valued as part of a planned sequential valuation of the whole country. The sequence will depend on the judgment of the commissioner of valuation, who will decide which rating authorities are most in need of a valuation. Each rating authority area will have its own base date, by reference to which valuations will be determined.</P>
    <P>Uniformity between valuations will be established on a rating authority basis, whereby all valuations in a rating area will be uniform relative to one another instead of having a national uniformity, whereby all valuations in the State would be required to be uniform with one another. Between valuations, uniformity will be maintained on a rating authority basis. Such rating authority uniformity will be much easier to establish and maintain than a national uniformity, thus making it easier to ensure that ratepayers will be treated equitably. It is estimated that the valuation will be completed in about five years and will be more easily and safely managed under the approach of a rolling valuation, which was also favoured by the interdepartmental review group.</P>
    <P>Using this approach, the commissioner of valuation will have the power to make an order for the valuation of a particular rating authority area. The base date, by reference to which valuations will be determined, will be designated in the commissioner's order and will be specific to that rating authority area.</P>
    <P>A valuation will impact on ratepayers in two ways. First, the rateable valuation of a ratepayer's property will no longer be expressed in terms of a fraction of the property's net annual value, but will be expressed in terms of the property's full NAV. Second, the rateable valuation base is likely to be redistributed within the rating area, with some ratepayers' bills increasing and some ratepayers' bills decreasing.</P>
    <P>A return to full NAV was recommended by the interdepartmental review group as a means of improving the ease of comprehension and transparency of the valuation system and as the most appropriate basis of valuation for commercial and industrial property. The concept of NAV has <Col N="836" /> been used since the inception of the valuation system in both Ireland and Great Britain. When the valuation system was reformed in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, NAV was retained as the basis of valuation. The continued use of annual values has several advantages as both ratepayers and valuation practitioners are familiar with the concept and use of NAV in determining rateable valuations. The concept and use of NAV are familiar also to the courts and there is readily available evidence on which NAV can be based. Annual values are generally sufficiently stable to provide a predictable and reliable revenue base for rating authorities.</P>
    <P>It is considered that a return to using full NAV may cause the level of rateable valuations to increase on average by the order of three hundredfold or so, although the increase on individual properties will vary considerably. Consequently, the rate in the pound charged by local authorities will be reduced sufficiently to offset the increase in rateable valuation and hence deliver a revenue neutral outcome, subject to some adjustment for inflation. Therefore, provision is being made for a cap to be placed by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on the increase allowed in overall rates income of a rating authority area in the year in which the first valuation is used for rating purposes, to the increase in CPI.</P>
    <P>A valuation, however, will lead to a redistribution of the rates burden between ratepayers, reflecting changes in the property market that have taken place over the years. Because of the multiplicity of relevant factors involved, the precise effect of a valuation on individual ratepayers' rates bills cannot be indicated before the valuation has been completed.</P>
    <P>The Valuation Act, 1988, provided for the option of assessing public utilities within the framework of a global valuation. In essence a global valuation involves a simultaneous nationwide valuation of a public utility's total property as opposed to the separate valuation at different times of a public utility's individual properties. In the Bill, the global valuation provisions have been retained essentially unchanged. However, the prescribed method of valuation currently applicable to all global valuations has been removed. Public utility undertakings assessed under the global valuation provisions will be valued on the same basis as all other property, that is on the basis of NAV.</P>
    <P>It is intended that after the completion of the first national valuation, subsequent valuations of rating authorities will be carried out at regular intervals to ensure that the valuation base is kept up to date. Accordingly, the Bill requires the commissioner to complete a valuation of a rating authority area no earlier than five years and no later than ten years after the previous valuation of that authority area was completed.</P>
    <P>The current valuation system has a revision process whereby ratepayers and rating authorities can apply for the revision of the valuation lists to <Col N="837" /> take account of any change in circumstances of a property. Such a change in circumstances would include a change in use, an extension or contraction of a property and any other factor that might have relevance to its rateable valuation or for its rateable status. The Bill provides that a revision process will be retained in the new valuation system. It would obviously be unfair to a ratepayer to have to wait until a valuation takes account of any change in the circumstances of a property and any lower rates bill that would result from a consequently lower rateable valuation. Similarly, a rating authority should be able to charge rates on any increased value of a property and on a new property without having to wait until a valuation is made.</P>
    <P>Under the current valuation system, a ratepayer or a rating authority can appeal a determination by the Valuation Office, first to the commissioner of valuation and, second, if dissatisfied with the commissioner's decision, to the valuation tribunal. Both of these appeal provisions are being retained, as is the option of an appeal to the High Court or Supreme Court on a point of law. However, the Bill augments the formal appeal process with an earlier phase, called the consultative phase, during which the ratepayer will be notified of the Valuation Office's proposed determination before it becomes effective for rating purposes, and will be given an opportunity of making a submission to the Valuation Office, if he or she so wishes, about that determination. The ratepayer will have 28 days within which to make such a submission to the Valuation Office before the valuation certificate is issued and the valuation list is amended or published.</P>
    <P>The time period for appeal to the commissioner against a valuation certificate issued by the Valuation Office is also being increased from the current position of 28 days to 40 days. The time limits for appeals to the valuation tribunal at 28 days and to the High Court at 21 days remain unchanged. Therefore, under the Bill the time period from when the ratepayer becomes aware that a valuation or revision is being undertaken to the date by which he or she has to appeal to the commissioner will be considerably increased compared to the present position.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that an individual applying for a revision or appealing a Valuation Office decision will now apply directly to the commissioner on the matter rather than going through the relevant local authority as at present. Appeals to the valuation tribunal will continue to be made directly to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that State-occupied property will continue to be exempt from rates, that is, Government offices, Garda stations, Army barracks, prisons, State-occupied harbours and canals occupied by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The commercial sector, in particular IBEC and the Dublin regional business alliance, has made representations that State-occupied property should be made subject to rates. While having some sym<Col N="838" /> pathy for that viewpoint, I would point out that rates have never been levied on property occupied by the State but that a contribution in lieu of rates was paid to local authorities from the 1870s until 1987. The contribution was then subsumed into the rates support grant, or, as it has been known since 1999, the local government fund.</P>
    <P>Making State-occupied property subject to rates would have to be on the basis of &ldquo;clawback&rdquo; measures from the local government fund being put in place to compensate for the significant rates income that certain local authorities would derive from State-occupied property. It must also be recognised that the local government fund has increased considerably in recent years. Rating State-occupied property, with &ldquo;clawback&rdquo; measures from the fund being put in place would almost certainly result in no reduction in the rates paid by current ratepayers.</P>
    <P>I should stress that the Valuation Bill, while continuing to exempt State-occupied property from rates, provides for the commissioner of valuation to value these properties in the first revaluation following enactment. This will allow for rates to be collected in respect of these properties should Government decide at a later date to pursue that course of action.</P>
    <P>I will now turn briefly to the individual parts of the Valuation Bill. The Bill consists of 13 Parts and five Schedules. Part 1 contains provisions of a general nature, including the interpretation section, and issues such as fees and expenses. Part 2 sets out the terms and conditions of office of the commissioner of valuation, the delegation by the Minister to the commissioner of certain functions and the procedures concerning the delegation of functions by the commissioner. Part 3 refers primarily to Schedule 2 which sets out the terms under which the valuation tribunal will continue to operate.</P>
    <P>Part 4 deals with property to be valued. It provides for the definition of relevant property to be valued and the categories of relevant property that will and will not be rateable under this Act. It sets the time from which the Act will become effective and the discretion the commissioner has to value contiguous relevant properties occupied by one occupier as one unit or in valuing one relevant property capable of being occupied separately.</P>
    <P>Part 5 provides for the valuation process and contains provisions relating to the valuation order to be made by the commissioner to undertake the valuation of a rating authority area. It also contains provisions relating to the subsequent publication of the valuation list and the issuing of the valuation certificate to each occupier prior to the publication of the valuation list to allow for submissions to be made to the valuation manager, who will be charged with the responsibility of overseeing the valuation process. The process of allowing the occupier to make submissions regarding the proposed value of his or her property, which have to be taken into account before <Col N="839" /> the final value of the property is set, is, as I have already mentioned, commonly referred to as the consultative stage.</P>
    <P>Part 6 of the Bill makes provision for the revision of a valuation list in respect of a particular property or properties between valuations of the relevant rating authority area. It also provides that the revision officer, who is deemed responsible for undertaking the revision, will issue a valuation certificate or written notification of his or her decision within six months of appointment. This Part provides again for the consultative stage to be part of the revision process, as in the case of the valuation of a rating authority area.</P>
    <P>Part 7, which is a reasonably long Part, provides for an extensive appeals process to which I already referred earlier. The Part provides that the occupier of the property in question, an occupier of other relevant property in the same rating area, a rating authority or an interested third party can appeal in writing to the commissioner in respect of a property's valuation. This also applies in respect of determinations by revision officers. The appellant must specify the grounds on which he or she considers the rateable valuation as determined is incorrect and what the rateable valuation should be in his or her opinion. This Part also provides that an occupier must be informed if his or her property is the subject of an appeal by some other person.</P>
    <P>The commissioner of valuation is required to make a decision within six months of receipt of an appeal. A further appeal against the commissioner's decision can be made in writing to the Valuation Tribunal. The tribunal is again required to issue its decision within six months of receipt of an appeal. There is a subsequent right of appeal to the High Court and Supreme Court on a point of law. This Part also provides that in relation to decisions by either the tribunal, High Court or Supreme Court in connection with a property, the valuation list will be amended as appropriate, and this will extend to similarly circumstanced properties if so required.</P>
    <P>Part 8 requires the commissioner to produce an annual report to the Minister for Finance in connection with the exercise of his or her functions, and for the Minister to cause copies of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. It also requires public bodies to supply information to the commissioner if they believe such information would lead to an amendment of a valuation list in respect of a particular property. This will apply primarily in the case of rating authorities, and where State-occupied property, which is not subject to rates, is vacated.</P>
    <P>Part 9 gives statutory authority to existing valuation lists as it will be some time before they are all replaced as a result of the valuation of every rating authority area. The revision and appeals process outlined in the previous Parts will also apply to existing valuation lists.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="840" /> Part 10 provides for certain ancillary powers to be granted to the commissioner of valuation and his or her officers. These include that information as requested from an occupier of property must be supplied, if so requested, and must be updated by the occupier as appropriate. It also repeats the power to enter property for the purpose of carrying out the valuation function.</P>
    <P>Part 11 provides for and defines the net annual value basis of valuation. It also provides that if, in determining the NAV of a property, a method of valuation relying on the notional cost of constructing or providing the property is used, then NAV shall be an amount equal to 5% of the aggregate of the replacement cost, depreciated where appropriate, of the property and the site value of the property. This Part also provides for the global valuation of public utility undertakings.</P>
    <P>Part 12 provides for a cap to be placed by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on the increase allowed in overall rates income of a rating authority area in the year in which the first valuation is used for rating purposes to the increase in CPI. Part 13 includes various miscellaneous and transitional provisions. It also removes the anomaly whereby mines and rights to drill for and extract petroleum become rateable only seven years after opening or commencing in the case of mines, and 20 years in the case of petroleum. It provides in certain circumstances for prosecutions and penalties. It also provides for a procedure whereby a valuation can be determined in respect of a property, even if it is listed in Schedule 4, that is, relevant property not rateable, if such a valuation is required for legal reasons relating to enjoyment or entitlement of that property.</P>
    <P>There are five Schedules to the Bill. Schedule 1 sets out the enactments to be repealed as a result of the amendment and consolidation of the existing valuation code. Schedule 2 deals with the construction, membership, terms and conditions of office, staffing, powers and procedures of the Valuation Tribunal to be established under section 12. It broadly repeats the conditions applying to the current tribunal. Schedule 3 lists the categories of relevant property which will be valued and which, in most cases, will be subject to rates. Schedule 4 lists categories of relevant properties which are not to be rated. Schedule 5 lists the categories of plant to be valued as part of a property.</P>
    <P>The Bill is the first comprehensive valuation legislation introduced since the 1850s. It is designed to modernise the operation of the valuation system, to remove deficiencies that have built up over the years to bring it more into line with the contemporary commercial environment and to make the system more transparent and equitable for the ratepayer. It will allow a valuation throughout the country to take place, the first since the middle of the 19th century. Such a valuation will enable a uniform and equitable valuation base to be established and anomalies to be removed. It will also allow a return to full net <Col N="841" /> annual values. Provision is made for regular valuations every five to ten years to prevent the system from becoming outdated to such an extent in the future. It enhances the appeals process and provides the opportunity for ratepayers to be involved in the valuation process from an early stage.</P>
    <P>I must again stress that the Bill is not designed to increase the rates income of local authorities and, therefore, provides for a cap in the overall rates income in the year in which the revaluation takes effect. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. The Bill has four main objectives &ndash; to review the law relating to the valuation of properties which is based on 19th century legislation; to facilitate a revaluation of all rateable property in the country; to make the valuation system more transparent to taxpayers and rating authorities; and to define clearly the categories of properties which are rateable and non-rateable.</P>
      <P>To facilitate the revaluation of all rateable property, it is proposed under the Bill that a commissioner of valuation should oversee a complete revaluation of the entire country. This can be carried out either on a national basis, involving simultaneous revaluations in all local authority areas or, alternatively, and probably more realistically, with a review of local authority areas being dealt with at the same time or even individually. This process may create an imbalance between different areas and, if possible, a revaluation of the entire country should be carried out at the same time to avoid possible distortions between areas.</P>
      <P>It is of great concern to the business community because it is of the view that distortion in competitiveness will result if a lengthy rolling revaluation process takes place. A business operating in the Dublin area, for example, having gone through a revaluation itself, could be at a considerable competitive disadvantage compared to a competitor outside the city which may not be scheduled to undergo revaluation until well into the future &ndash; as much as five years later. Such timescales are not wholly unexpected given that 150,000 establishments will have to be revalued.</P>

    <P>To initiate the revaluation process, the commissioner will make an order to be known as the valuation order in relation to each local authority area. The valuation order will state the base date at which all property is to be valued and the date of publication of the valuation list. This list has to be published within three years of the valuation order. A revaluation certificate stating the value of the property, as determined, is to be issued to the occupier of every property included in the valuation list not later than seven days before the publication of the list. It would be helpful if the rating authorities were to receive the final valuation list in August or September each year for greater forward planning in the preparation of estimates of expenses. It would, therefore, be beneficial to rating authorities if valuation list publication dates were to be agreed between the <Col N="842" /> commissioner of valuation and the individual rating authorities.</P>
    <P>A very important element of the Bill is that it proposes to introduce an element of consultation between the Valuation Office and the ratepayer in the revision process. A request to have a property listed for revision is currently sent to the local authority involved. Under the new legislation a request will be sent directly to the commissioner of valuation. He will then appoint a revision officer who, following inspection of a property and calculation of its estimated rate of valuation, will then send a copy of the proposed valuation certificate to the ratepayer. The ratepayer, in turn, will have 28 days in which to make representations on any matter about which they feel aggrieved.</P>
    <P>In an effort to allay the fears of ratepayers who may see the introduction of this legislation as a means by which rates will be increased, the new legislation proposes to introduce a capping system for the rate in the pound for local authorities. It is proposed that the cap will be in the region of 5% &ndash; it is 9% at present &ndash; and that involves a little reduction for local authorities.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that the commercial rate base should be expanded to include all Government buildings, apart-hotels and certain categories of bed and breakfast establishments. I am pleased to note that on Report Stage in the other House the Minister introduced an amendment regarding apart-hotels. I also am thankful that in regard to the membership of the valuation tribunal, the Minister of State continued the principle set by an amendment in my name to the Ordnance Survey Ireland Bill, 2001, which he accepted. He said in the debate in the other House that this practice would be continued in future Bills and I welcome the progress we have made in that area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for saying so.</P>
      <P>The Bill should be amended to provide that bed and breakfast establishments with six or more rooms available for guests should be liable for rates on that portion of the premises. This would not adversely affect smaller establishments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Third Schedule also retains the existing exemption of State properties from rates. Rates should be levied on all State property and if central Government legislates that Government properties be exempt from rates, then the Government should pay full compensation to local authorities. I note that the Minister of State stated in his speech that he has received representations on this matter from IBEC and the Dublin Regional Business Alliance. While he stated that rates have never been levied on Government properties, nevertheless an income was paid to local authorities in lieu of rates on Government <Col N="843" /> buildings from 1870 until 1987, and he stated that this contribution was subsumed into the rates support grant. If rates were levied on Government property, the main beneficiary would be Dublin city because the greater proportion of Government properties are in this city but as the Government's policy of decentralisation comes into effect, other parts of the country will be making the same case I am making here &ndash; that the Government should make a payment in lieu of the full rate.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State stated that the payment was subsumed into the rates support grant, but that payment, which I acknowledge is not the responsibility of the Minister of State, has fallen well behind because the Dublin Corporation is not receiving anything like what it received previously for Government properties under the rate support grant. This is something which should be looked at because the city of Dublin must provide all the services for people who use Government properties as well as providing services for people from outside the city who come to use its services. No payment is provided for that service which Dublin city must provide for the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>It should also be remembered that the State is no longer exempt from the planning process and Departments must now prepare budgets which reflect the full extent of administrative costs, one of which would be the cost of occupying the property. Therefore there is some basis for providing for a increased payment for Government properties.</P>
    <P>The Bill is laudable in many respects. The proposals, however, will effectively impose a greatly increased workload on the already stretched resources of the Valuation Office. It may be in recognition of this fact that the Bill fails to set down a date for start of the first revaluation and provides only notional time scales for subsequent revaluations which the commissioner is not statutorily obliged to fulfil.</P>
    <P>The new legislation is definitely an improvement on the current position but whether it is sufficiently farreaching is a question which still must be answered. This is a technical Bill which can best be dealt with on Committee Stage. I certainly will table amendments on Committee Stage and I hope I will be as successful as I was on the last occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, to the House. I recall talking to him on many occasions about this Bill over a year ago. It has been in the pipeline for a long time but I am delighted to see it before us now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many business people fear measures which will increase the fixed costs of doing business. I know the Minister of State is very conscious of this, so much so that in the first page of his speech he stated that the objective of the Bill was not to <Col N="844" /> increase rates for business people or people trying to make a living but rather to make the system more transparent, modern and streamlined and to improve the operation of the system. This system was the basis for the collection of over £450 million for local authorities in 2000. No doubt a system which has not been changed since the 19th century really needs to be looked at and that is the purpose of the legislation.</P>
    <P>It is important to make all such legislation transparent and equitable for the ratepayer. The Minister of State has identified this and he has spoken about the motivation from outside the Houses regarding the key objectives of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that there has not been a national valuation since the middle of the 19th century, and that has led to many anomalies in the system and to a lack of uniformity and equity throughout the system according to local authorities. It will be interesting to see the change in that regard. Recognising that it will not be easily achieved, however, the Minister of State has recognised that this must be done by way of a roll-out scheme.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate, in order to put it beyond doubt, that provision is made for the capping of the increase in the overall rates income of a local authority in the year in which the first valuation is used for rating purposes. I welcome this cap. It will make life a little more comfortable for business people, particularly those in smaller towns and villages around the country.</P>
    <P>The issue of imposing rates on bed and breakfasts was addressed by Senator Doyle and in the Dáil. It was interesting to read the contributions made by a huge number of Dublin Deputies who argued that the problem was different in Dublin but seemed to ignore the fact that that may be no reason to introduce legislation which would impose rates on bed and breakfast accommodation. When one goes outside the Pale or Galway city centre, one sees how people have benefited from operating bed and breakfasts and what that business has done for many families. Indeed, there were many people who made it to college or secretarial school because their fees and accommodation were paid for by the mother who was able to run bed and breakfasts for a couple of weeks during the summer. These people were able to make a few pounds through this worthwhile addition to tourist accommodation.</P>
    <P>While I accept there is certainly some need to look at the area of licensing bed and breakfasts, this must be given careful attention. There is a need to recognise that circumstances in Dublin are different from those in the rest of the country. In too many instances, the solution provided to a Dublin problem has badly affected the rest of the country, but I do not wish to go into the specifics of that. While I have no objection to apart-hotels being subjected to rates, I certainly would have grave concerns about imposing rates on bed and breakfast accommodation. With the consultative process, it is possible to identify guesthouses and bed and breakfasts which are being run as mini-<Col N="845" /> businesses, where the family does not live on the premises, it is being run by a manager and the premises were built for that purpose only. However, many bed and breakfasts contain five or six bedrooms which have become available for bed and breakfast use because the family has grown up. Even in such a situation, I would be concerned if people felt that any bed and breakfast with four or five rooms should be rated. I appeal to the Minister, and to whomever might be involved in the future, to recognise in any licensing system the different status of bed and breakfast businesses, both urban and rural.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the rolling valuation approach and the Minister has quite rightly identified that there would be no possibility of having this for the country as a whole. It is to be carried out on a rolling basis and each rating authority will be separately valued as part of a planned sequential valuation. One of the good things about this approach is that, as we move from one rating authority to another, there will be lessons learned which can only improve the process provided it is open to review, amendment and further review to ensure it is working.</P>
    <P>Uniformity between evaluations will be established on a rating authority basis whereby all valuations in a rating area will be uniform relative to one another instead of having a national uniformity where all the valuations in the State would be required to be uniform with one another. Recognition that we cannot have uniformity across the nation is very important because a business at the far end of County Galway, in Letterfrack or Roundstone, will be run in a different way and encounter different problems from businesses in the city of Galway or further afield in Athlone or Dublin. It is important that we see uniformity but not necessarily national uniformity and I therefore welcome the approach taken.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke comprehensively about the impact on ratepayers and the basis of valuation. People are not sure how the system operates or what it means. I am a little concerned about one of the things the Minister says and I ask him to address it in his reply. He talks about the likelihood of the rateable valuation base being redistributed within the rating area, with the bills of some ratepayers increasing and those of others decreasing. While we will always be delighted to see the bills coming down, we may see some bills going up. Are we talking about a redistribution within a local authority area where one street will pay more money and another will pay less? That needs to be clarified. We need to know if, where there has been a huge change, it falls within the cap. For instance, as Quay Street has become the restaurant centre of Galway city, is that to mean all the premises on that street face a hugely increased valuation, with other areas getting a decreased valuation? Where does that fit in with the cap and the commitment we are giving to try not to increase rates?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="846" /> While we currently have a revision process, which allows ratepayers and rating authorities to apply for a revision of the valuation lists to take into account any change in circumstances, it is currently being changed so that it will take account of the new valuations system. I welcome that. As the Minister says, it is obviously unfair to a ratepayer to have to wait until evaluation takes account of any change in circumstances of a property for a lower rates bill to result.</P>
    <P>People do not understand the appeals process and how valuations are worked out. There are companies, operating mainly from Dublin, who write to companies offering to make a valuation of rates which they will submit to the local authority. They say they do this type of work all the time for various local authorities and they offer to seek a reduction in rates. Their manner of doing business is often very confusing and not transparent, perhaps purposely so. I would like to see a voluntary code of conduct for people who are utilising this legislation to provide a commercial service. They must be open and transparent and operate in a manner that does not cause confusion. I have been approached by older people, in business for a long time, who have received letters from these companies indicating a significant increase in rates due to the new valuation and offering to solve it all for perhaps 10% of the amount of the money the company will save their customer. That way of doing business is not very competitive, nor is it transparent. Perhaps regulations are needed to put in place a code of conduct.</P>
    <P>The Bill completely ignores information technology. I would like to see all of the information we are putting together, all of the processes and how they work, available on a website. As in the case of the Revenue Commissioners, a fully electronic system should be in place whereby, if a person so wished, all dealings could be done with the Valuation Office on the Internet, or by e-mail, and all the information needed would be available on a webpage. People do not mind paying a tax provided they can see its justification and I suggest that, in association with the local authorities who are benefiting from rates to the tune of £450 million, it should be possible to show on a website what the money is used for in each of the local authorities. We need a programme of co-operation between local authorities, for instance between Galway Corporation and Galway County Council, to launch webpages showing business people what the money has done for them.</P>
    <P>People should be able to see what they are paying for, given that we are moving from the 19th century to the 21st century. Let us embrace modern technology and use it is as much as we can as a shop front for the Government and the Valuation Office, open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. It would also be of importance to foreign companies who want to know what they have to do to set up business here, what they would be getting involved in, what rates are and what they do for <Col N="847" /> the local community. Perhaps this is not the appropriate legislation, but I ask the Minister to consider putting that in place.</P>
    <P>The Minister says the ratepayer will be notified of the Valuation Office's proposed determination before it becomes effective for rating purposes and they will be given the opportunity of making a submission to the Valuation Office. The ratepayer will have 28 days within which to make a submission before the valuation certificate is issued and the valuations list is amended or published. Would the Minister consider increasing the time allowed? We are changing the appeals time from 28 days to 40 and I suggest we consider investigating on Committee Stage whether people need longer than 28 days in which to make a submission. If we can deal with the issues in the first 28 days we do not have to enter a lengthy appeals process. Why not think about an increase from 28 days, if not to 40, to an equal number on either side of the argument?</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned State properties being exempted from rateable valuation. I understand that while at this stage it does not make great sense that money comes from one side of the Government to another, the Minister has recognised that in the future it may be entirely possible for Government and State properties to be rated and rates to be levied on them. To this end he has set up the valuation of such properties. If a future Administration decides to impose rates on State properties, that has been covered by this legislation. That is an indication that the Government is planning for the future.</P>
    <P>Local authorities can make decisions as to what bodies are exempted from rates. One of the important elements of the recycling process is the charity clothes shop. These charity shops are operated by volunteers on a not-for-profit basis. People donate surplus clothing which is recycled through sale and the money raised goes to the charity concerned. In an effort to encourage this area of recycling I ask the Minister to consider rate exemptions for those types of premises. I know that some local authorities do not exempt these shops from rates but instead write off the rates bill at the end of the year. If we wish to promote waste management, we should allow an exemption from rates for these charity shops.</P>
    <P>The Minister has outlined very comprehensively the various sections of the Bill. It is a Bill designed to modernise the operation of the valuation system, to do away with the difficulties and deficiencies which have built up over the years. It will bring the system into the 21st century. I hope the Minister will take note of my comments and I look forward to dealing with the Bill on Committee Stage. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I also welcome the Bill. It is important that legislation which is approximately 150 years old is being updated. All pre-1922 legislation <Col N="848" /> should be updated. Any legislation passed in the middle of the 19th century is well beyond its sell-by date and requires updating.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to put a valuation on or to revalue the business and industrial properties in the State which are appropriate for revaluation and to identify those which are exempt from valuation. It would be appropriate for us to look at the valuation process in terms of extending, if possible, the commercial rate base. It seems to be a conundrum that the Government has not extended the valuation process to include certain areas. This is the first legislation in nearly 150 years and it gives the opportunity for the Government to listen to the concerns of local authorities.</P>
      <P>The commercial rate as it stands, certainly in Dublin, is the basis for a large part of the funding that goes towards the running of the city. The wider the base, the less the percentage increase that will occur on an annual basis. The greater the distribution, the greater the equity of the system.</P>
      <P>I think we could set the good example here. The Government could accede to the request from the local authority for a full commercial rate to be levied on Government buildings. While it is proposed in the legislation that a rateable valuation would be put on Government property, it is not proposed that the Government would pay the levy. I cannot imagine how a rateable valuation is struck and then an exemption is granted to a particular body. It is a contradiction in terms. The Government may well think that all this money is transferred from the State to the local authority and so is kept within the family, but these are funds which are required for the operation of the local authority. This situation must be determined once and for all. Government buildings should be subject to a rateable valuation which would then be reflected in the commercial rate struck. This is not just a matter for a city like Dublin which has the major amount of the State's premises.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has a huge decentralisation policy in which he proposes to decentralise &ndash; I do not know if this is still his intention&mdash;</P>

It will mean that each local authority would benefit if a commercial rate could be levied on those buildings. Such a move would be very desirable and very helpful to those of us in Dublin Corporation. We could have avoided service charges on refuse disposal this year if we had the commercial rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The business sector which produces all this unnecessary waste is getting away scot free in many areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 80% of the waste is domestic waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The agricultural sector produces a huge amount of waste and the construction sector produces about 50% of it. This sector is not paying rates of any sort for the disposal of waste, yet it is responsible for filling up landfills to a far greater degree than the miserly amount contributed by poor householders. We are paying sufficient central taxation which should deal with this matter rather than setting up another hotch-potch of charges.</P>
      <P>We have been using the commercial rate to fund local government. We are operating with the Government refund grant and with the service charge. This is a mishmash in terms of the funding of local government. The Department of the Environment and Local Government makes a considerable input. We should look at some form of consolidation of the funding of local government and consider how it could be funded jointly by a commercial rate with either a local tax or part of the Exchequer funding that would be pooled and made available to local authorities. What we are getting at present is unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>As well as Government buildings there are guesthouses and bed and breakfast establishments &ndash; substantial businesses, given the booming tourism industry &ndash; which are not paying their fair share. Is it proposed to impose a valuation rating on these businesses? It is important that there is a receipt of moneys by the local authority in respect of services which it is necessary to provide for the tourism industry as well as the receipt of funds from central Government. Clearly this area is appropriate for future valuation.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if agricultural land should be exempt. In virtually every farm, agri-business is the order of the day. I do not know how we can distinguish between agricultural land, domestic property and land developed for forestry, horticulture, sport or State-occupied land. That whole area of agri-business will have to be looked at afresh. Where agricultural land is developed for trading purposes and there are receipts, value added tax and so on it will have to be looked at as a business and should be subjected to the valuation procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another widespread phenomenon is professional activities and businesses run from domestic property. The most obvious is private rented accommodation. There has been a huge growth <Col N="850" /> in profits for landlords whose premises are not subject to valuation and a commercial rate. I see no reason businesses of this nature should not be rated and subject to valuation. All types of other professional activities such as those conducted by lawyers and barristers are being carried out from what are termed domestic premises. That whole area will have to be looked into because it is a business operation.</P>
    <P>Are private educational establishments covered by this legislation? Recently there has been phenomenal growth in such establishments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>They are rated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear that. They are commercial undertakings.</P>
      <P>My other concern is how the valuation process will work. This notion of a rolling phase valuation process will create enormous problems and may result in areas being revalued while others would be subject to the previous valuation, with a resulting imbalance in terms of payment and competition. It may create a headache for local authorities which are trying to get their house in order not knowing whether in the coming year chunks of their property base will be revalued. How are we to deal with a five year rolling valuation and prevent unfair competition occurring in areas that may have been revalued while an adjacent area or property may not be revalued for three or four years? How will the treasurer of a local authority compile the budget for the coming year if the local authority does not know what areas will be included for the revaluation process, given that he does not know the extent of the income coming through? Perhaps the Minister would respond on that issue.</P>
      <P>I regard the system and the rateability base as <i>ad hoc.</i> I have no doubt the system proposed will extend the base but it is still fairly strong on exempted areas. When Dublin City Centre Business Association conducted a survey of inner city property it discovered that only two-thirds of what could be reasonably construed as rateable property was actually rated and that the other property was not subject to rateable valuation. I do not know whether it presented a copy of its survey to the Minister of State. It suggests there are many anomalies in the manner in which business is conducted. The figure quoted was 150,000. How does one determine the businesses in operation &ndash; many of which are non-registered &ndash; ranging from landlords, who are registered if they so wish, to small operations set up as family businesses and other operations that do not pay much attention to normal procedures and where there is little or no follow up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What type of census of rateable property to be valued will the Minister of State put in place? Will he carry out a survey of the entire country? Given that it is 150 years since the last legislation surely it is time to conduct a comprehensive survey of all businesses, industrial properties, agricultural properties and professional type proper<Col N="851" /> ties from which businesses or industries operate. How will it take place? Will it be part of the rolling process? The Minister of State mentioned a consultative process where people will be asked to respond. We would like to have as broad a base as possible so that all would be satisfied when the process is complete that everybody is in the net and that it is fair. That is the kernel of the matter.</P>
    <P>This should not result in an increase in the commercial rate. The Minister of State has indicated that such is not his intention. It is an updating and an upgrading of the system which has been in operation until now but if it fails to ensure that the valuation process is as extensive as it should be and that the exemptions are kept to a minimum, there is a danger that this legislation will not fulfil its intention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions. As Senators have said, this is important and significant legislation, which is long overdue given that we have not had primary legislation in this area since the middle of the 19th century. It is important that the valuation base be put in line with modern legislation, which is what we are doing.</P>
      <P>All Senators raised similar issues. Senator Doyle asked about a rolling valuation rather than a national approach. The revaluation of individual rating authority areas is provided for in existing legislation and such revaluations have been carried out in Dublin and Waterford. The mechanism in the Bill by which the commission initiates a revaluation is an enabling provision to provide the maximum operational flexibility. It provides for both a national valuation and a rolling revaluation that allows the commission to revalue one, all or a number of rating authorities at any time.</P>
      <P>When coming to a new valuation base it is important to understand that a whole local authority area will be dealt with in its entirety. The local authority area will know well in advance that this is happening. Just because new valuation legislation is in place, a local authority will not reduce the income from the rates applied. That simply will not happen. When I went around the country with the roadshow, as we called it, many local authorities and businesses expressed concern that this legislation would be used to significantly increase the income of local authorities to the detriment of the ratepayer.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello, Cox and Doyle suggested valuing Government property throughout the country. I am very sympathetic to that view. When I was drafting the Bill, in discussions with my officials in the Valuation Office and the Department of Finance, it was one of the issues we discussed at length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody really knows the extent of the State property and nobody could accurately predict what it might mean for overall income or how it <Col N="852" /> would be broken down throughout the country. The figures vary enormously. I was not satisfied that the State should have no idea of the value of its property. That is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>As Senator Cox said, I have moved to have all State property valued. When this is complete, I will know the rateable value of all State property. Dublin will be the major centre for State property. Senator Costello stated that local authorities could do with the extra money. There would be no extra money even if I were to allow State property to be fully valued today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it would not. As I mentioned earlier, I am ensuring that the rates income will not increase because of this Bill. If I included all State property, it would have the effect of lowering the rates on everybody else. It would not increase the rates income to local authorities in Dublin, for example. Senator Costello said that we will widen the rates base and this is true. However, I intend that this will have the effect of lowering the rates for everybody else. The net effect will be neutral.</P>

This issue was raised by people throughout the country who did not want this Bill to be used as a vehicle for local authorities to gain a substantial increase in rates income. I am capping it in a way that, when the new valuation takes place, local authority income can only equate to the previous total rates intake plus a CPI increase. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government will implement that figure. I believe that Senator Doyle said it was 9%&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a flat rate at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but it could be back to 3% or 4%. That is an important safeguard for businesses throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Under the old system, through no fault of the commissioner of valuation or his officials, the ratepayer was regarded as being at the end of the process. I never liked this as the ratepayer is the most important person in the process and should be centrally involved in setting the rates. That is being done in this Bill. I have reversed the process and placed the ratepayer at the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cox mentioned the 28-day limit, but that is only for the appeal. The process will go on long before that when the ratepayer will be in contact with the valuation officer. They will have 28 days to go into the consultative phase if they disagree with the rateable valuation the office has set. In the event of such a disagreement, the rate<Col N="853" /> payer will be able to put his or her valuation on a property, the two will meet and, I hope, resolve the matter. The ratepayer is very important in the whole process.</P>
    <P>The three Senators who spoke are involved in local authorities and appreciate the complex calculations involved. Under the new system, if a property has a rental income of £100,000 that will be the basis of the rateable valuation. The local authority will have to adjust its current system. It could not be £30 or £40 in the pound, or even higher, as is the case in some authorities under the new system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is lower in others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be down to £2, £3 or £10 in the pound under the new system. It will be more transparent and more easily understandable. A ratepayer will know what the person next door is paying. This information will be fully available so that people will not feel that they are paying much more than others. Some people wind up others by pretending that they are paying much less than they are.</P>
      <P>The Senators raised the issue of winners and losers in the system. There have been major shifts especially in the five county borough cities and particularly in Dublin where there have been changes in the commerciality of properties and different streets have become fashionable for shopping. When the new valuation is done we will see an adjustment in that. Some people will see an increase in their rates, but they have probably been underpaying substantially for years. Those who have been unfortunate to have paid too much in rates for some years, based on the old inflexible system, will benefit under the new system. It will shake out reasonably fairly across the board.</P>
      <P>I am happy to see the commissioner here today, which is indicative of the commitment the Valuation Office has to the Bill. The office has listened to what Senators and Deputies have had to say in order to understand their fears and concerns.</P>
      <P>When the valuation of the country has been completed in five years, we will no longer be in a situation where it will take another 150 years for another valuation. We will continue to roll out the valuation in different areas so no area will have a gap between valuations of longer than ten years. This means we will have a fully functional, up to date, transparent and open system which will be to the benefit of ratepayers and everybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authority in Galway is just coming to the end of its ten year period of being free of rates in the context of urban renewal, and I wonder how this will impact in terms of the capping being imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an important point. In different local authority areas there will be certain <Col N="854" /> exemptions with new properties coming into the system, a good example of which is that mentioned by the Senator. Local authorities should not suffer however. Such properties will be added to the rates base. I emphasise that overall the object of the Bill is not to create a windfall for local authorities. There is a difference between the valuation base and the rate of valuation authorities, namely, local authorities, and different issues arise.</P>
      <P>Senators Cox and Joe Doyle mentioned exemptions for charity shops, an issue I closely examined. I met with representatives of charity shops and we went through the issue in detail. The administrative headquarters of charities are rates free. Rates will apply on a property where a commerical activity takes place. Even though the money collected on such properties is put to exceptionally good use, I cannot base rates on what money is used for. If I did, everybody would be presenting uses for the profits they make. I should also point out that some charity shops sell new and not just secondhand goods, while I know of a charity shop which sells secondhand goods but is competing with a secondhand shop which is 50 yards away. One must be fair and balanced and I think I have gone as far as I can and I have explained this to those involved in charity organisations. In fairness they recognise and accept that the Government's approach has been through the taxation system which we have substantially improved in the past few years in favour of charitable organisations. It is not the function of the valuation legislation to enhance their position, laudable as that might be.</P>
      <P>Bed and breakfasts and apart-hotels, which were debated at length in the Dáil, were raised. Deputy Noel Ahern and others raised the issue of apart-hotels on Committee Stage in the Dáil. It is clear these properties are an adjunct or part of a hotel, and the Deputies asked if I could include them. I was happy to return on Report Stage, as Senator Doyle acknowledged, and make a provision to include apart-hotels. However, I am not including bed and breakfasts. There is much to be done in that context before we could apply rates, and I think the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation is examining licensing, etc., which must be taken into account. His Department will be responsible for a range of issues.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle said payments to Dublin Corporation from the local government fund are falling behind. The local government fund has improved enormously and I do not think there is a member of a local authority who has not said to me that the past few years have been a boon for local authorities in terms of the money&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>For some local authorities. A mechanism has now been put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin has done well. The economic income <i>per capita</i> for Dublin is 119%. The rest of the country would aspire to coming close to the great wealth that exists across the board <Col N="855" /> here. On a serious note, the local government fund has fundamentally improved things and is a much better system than the rate support grant. The boom in the car industry and motor taxation has improved it.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello raised the issue of State property. Effectively if I included State property, I would face a clawback from the local government fund, so there would have been no net gain. Because we do not know the value of the entire State property portfolio in terms of rate valuation it was hard to make a judgment call on it. I insisted on moving forward and allowing all State property to be valued. Inevitably this leads to possible obvious conclusions as to what may happen in the future, but we must prepare the ground to do it. Senator Costello spoke of an inherent contradiction, but the reason this is being done is that it has never been done before. At the end of the process, Senator Costello as a councillor will have a much stronger and more knowledgeable base on which to place his arguments when the information becomes available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The total rates base will be capped. Obviously if a business person is concerned about any of the services being offered they can get in touch with the Valuation Office to find out the position.</P>
      <P>Senator Cox made an interesting point when she spoke about the potential use of IT. The most modern and up to date technology in the world will be used in this valuation process. Otherwise it would not be possible to do it in the timeframe set out. The point made by Senator Cox about IT, the website, etc., is not an issue for the Bill but I am sure it has been noted by the commissioner. I know the Valuation Office is very keen to be as open and transparent as possible and to get out the information required by people, and I think Senator Cox's suggestion is very good and could be taken up and examined.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello spoke about the base for rateability. For the first time the Bill specifically clarifies properties which are rateable. This cannot be found in a specific piece of legislation. It will make the entire process more transparent. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is also drafting legislation parallel to this Bill with regard to the rating authority and he may have views on exemptions or flexibilities which local authorities may require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> Senator Costello made a point about landlords. All rates legislation is based on the occupier or beneficiary of the property paying the rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

      <P>I hope I have covered most of the issues raised by Senators. There will be an opportunity on Committee Stage to tease out some of the finer points in the Bill and I look forward to that debate.</P>

    <Title>Defence Forces Modernisation: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Minister for Defence report on the progress of his modernisation programme for the Defence Forces and that he outline his proposals for the future development of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach. It is opportune to review what has taken place in the last few years under the stewardship of this Minister and Government. It is important to note the vast improvements made not alone in the equipping of the Defence Forces but in the lifestyle expectations of anyone embarking on a career in the military service. In that context it is appropriate to refer to the White Paper which sets out the policy for defence for the next decade with a view to ensuring an appropriate level of defence capability, having regard to the changing defence and security environment both at home and abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chapter 1 sets out the overall context in which the White Paper was prepared. It provides for the <Col N="857" /> restructuring and reorganisation of defence within the existing broad level of resources to ensure the State has the Defence Forces it needs. This builds on the progress already achieved since 1996 with the existing reform programme to develop sustainable and affordable Defence Forces in the long term. The key goals of the White Paper development programme are to provide a light infantry based force with an appropriate level of all arms capability, to provide sufficient forces and capability to meet needs at home and to make a significant contribution abroad, to put in place a more cohesive and better equipped force than exists at present and to provide significant additional resources regarding equipment and infrastructure broadly within the existing level of financial allocation.</P>
    <P>These goals require the creation of a balanced and flexible military organisation which has sufficient depth in terms of personnel, doctrine, training, organisation and equipment to meet expected future needs. The current organisation provides a strong starting point but a broad process of continuous change will be needed to ensure the State has an effective and efficient defence capability relevant to its needs. This poses a demanding management challenge. However, the Defence Forces have shown in the past that they have never been slow to meet a challenge and have always had the &ldquo;can-do&rdquo; approach necessary to meet this challenge.</P>
    <P>Chapter 2 describes the defence and security environment which is regarded as generally benign. At the international level, significant changes have taken place since the end of the Cold War, giving rise to new challenges. These changes are accompanied by developments at the institutional and political levels. The EU response to the new environment includes provision for Petersberg Tasks in the Treaty of Amsterdam. In the home context, the progress under the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent political developments continue to offer firm hope for a lasting peace, I hope that continues to be the case.</P>
    <P>Chapter 3 describes defence policy. There will be a continuing need to ensure that Ireland has conventionally organised Defence Forces capable of operating alongside military forces from other countries in a peace support role and of responding to the uncertainties and challenges of the changing environment. Chapter 4 sets out major new plans for the development of sustainable and affordable Defence Forces to ensure that they are capable of meeting the challenges of the emerging defence and security environment and to fulfil the roles laid down by the Government. This will involve the provision of a Permanent Defence Force of 10,500 personnel, a reduction of 1,000, and the conversion of over £20 million in resources from the pay to non-pay areas. In addition to these pay savings, extra resources will also be generated from the sale of properties outside of barracks which are surplus to requirements. Together this represents an <Col N="858" /> investment fund of £250 million for new equipment and infrastructure, a far cry from what we were used to in the past when we were the poor relations among our EU counterparts when it came to defence, and defence equipment in particular.</P>
    <P>The Air Corps and the Naval Service will be developed and new equipment provided. The policy of continuous recruitment will be maintained and a new personnel management development programme will be put in place to ensure that a career in the Defence Forces is attractive.</P>
    <P>Chapter 5 describes the development of the Defence Forces Reserve. An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil, or FCA, will become the Army Reserve, as the FCA wished, and together with An Slua Muirí, the Naval Reserve, it will be developed and improved.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the White Paper is well under way. The Chief of Staff is currently preparing a plan to restructure the PDF in accordance with the Government's decision on overall numbers. The Minister's intention is to have the plan finalised and implemented by end 2001 in accordance with established Government policy.</P>
    <P>The White Paper recognises the importance of the career dimension and provides for the preparation of an updated and very comprehensive Defence Forces integrated personnel management plan to address this and related issues. The Chief of Staff is currently drafting that plan and the process is well advanced. A key feature of the plan will be a continuation of the policy of regular recruitment which is now in place in order to achieve an improved age profile in the Permanent Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Implementation plans are being put in place for the Air Corps and Naval Service, including new organisation structures and investment in new ships and new aircraft. Proposals for the development of the Reserve, including the FCA, are being advanced through a countrywide consultation process including that Reserve.</P>
    <P>We hope to have the implementation plan early next year providing for new organisational structures, better training, better equipment and the possibility of overseas service. It is expected that the plan will have a six year timeframe due to the complexities involved, In the latter context, £400,000 has been spent recently or is committed to Columb Barracks, Mullingar.</P>
    <P>As implementation of the White Paper proceeds, its critics are seeing that they got it wrong and that the process has real value. I understand that the Minister will explain the White Paper and modernisation process in more detail and I look forward to that. The Minister will also address the area of the evolving European Security and Defence Policy, or ESDP, and the Partnership for Peace. Our involvement in these is often misrepresented, sometimes through a genuine lack of understanding and sometimes by those with a particular political agenda who take a perverse view of the European Union and our place in it. It is important as we face into the ref<Col N="859" /> erendum on the Treaty of Nice that we get our message across so that people can make up their minds on the facts and not because of some misrepresentation of those facts.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the Treaty of Nice poses no threat either to our long-standing commitment to the UN in the cause of international peace nor does it, or our involvement in the ESDP or PfP, pose any threat to our policy of strict military neutrality. The Minister for Defence and the Government will advocate a strong &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum on the Nice treaty.</P>
    <P>This debate gives us an opportunity to pay tribute to the men and women of our Defence Forces for the excellent work they have done and continue to do at home and abroad. The foot and mouth crisis is a good example of the contribution the Defence Forces make at home. The Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, has used a pro-active and hands-on approach to set the headlines. It makes me proud to stand here today to say that this Minister serves in a Government which has done well to keep this abhorrent curse from our shores. We commend all who have helped to achieve this.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces, together with Department of Agriculture officials, the Garda Síochána, Civil Defence, responsible farmers and the people of Ireland in general have made enormous efforts to ensure the disease does not spread. Members of the Defence Forces have been rendering assistance to the civil authorities by operating additional checkpoints along the Border area with members of the Garda Síochána; they are also assisting in the port of Dublin. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the important contribution of the Defence Forces to the national effort in trying to curb the spread of foot and mouth disease.</P>
    <P>It is also important to note that we need to sustain the improvement in our Naval Service to protect our fish stocks. The Air Corps must be financed to ensure it is able to supply a much needed service when called upon. It is always there to step into the breach when required.</P>
    <P>The overseas picture is one of considerable achievement when we consider Ireland's record of United Nations service. A high price has been paid by the men and women of the Defence Forces while on active service for the UN. I regret that 82 members of the Defence Forces lost their lives on peacekeeping duties, including 44 in Lebanon. This is the highest price a country can be called on to pay in defence of peace and justice and a price that has been paid courageously and with great honour by the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>For a small country, our Defence Forces have earned an unrivalled reputation as peacekeepers in south Lebanon, Congo, Cyprus, East Timor, Kosovo and other places of conflict around the world. In each of these areas it has been proved that our Defence Forces make a real difference. I know the modernisation programme will ensure we can continue to make that difference. It is important to note there were 867 members of the <Col N="860" /> Irish Defence Forces serving overseas on 3 May 2001.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to compliment the Defence Forces and especially Deputy Michael Smith who, in four years as Minister for Defence has brought about great changes and given the Army a new lease of life, not that it needed one. Morale in the Army has always been high, despite its critics. I exhort the young boys and girls of this country to consider a worthwhile and fulfilling career in the Army.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and welcome the Minister to the House. Since the White Paper was published, the Government and the Minister for Defence have recognised the need for substantial changes within the Defence Forces. It is also recognised that we need a modern and well equipped Permanent Defence Force suited to the needs of a modern and young country and able to participate within the UN, work within a European framework and play its part in a greater and expanded European Union with an enlarged membership. It is important that the force satisfies the needs of a developing country like Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Government's methods and investment show that it has strongly supported the need for change. It is working towards a modern force that works alongside other European countries in areas like peacekeeping and policing and underpins the development of democratically processed institutional changes in other countries. I compliment the Minister on his investment of £250 million in the Permanent Defence Force and on his courage in rationalising human resources and property portfolios. I recognise that commitment, wisdom and management were needed to bring about and oversee change, particularly in an Army participating within the context of world peace.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined the Government's idea of how the Army should be developed for the future. Ireland has changing priorities and needs, such as the need to develop fishing in a way that demonstrates a responsibility for fish stocks. Investment in the Naval Service and recognition of our role as a country on the western periphery of Europe are central to the Government's commitment to the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The White Paper recognises the important need for a career structure in the Defence Forces, focusing on the Army in particular, so that there is fulfilment within the forces. Low morale can sometimes develop as a result of a lack of new recruits and initiatives. There is a need for a long-term strategic plan to create an incentive for people to participate in a greater way and which will cause them to feel rewarded for their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must recognise the role the forces have played in peace initiatives, the underpinning of democracy in other states and the protection of human rights. Governments have committed to those specific areas, as is realised worldwide. We have played an important and significant role in <Col N="861" /> foreign affairs development and contributed at European and international level. Our participation in the United Nations and the recent recognition of our right to be there demonstrate the expansion of our important role at European and world level.</P>
    <P>The Nice treaty looks to an expanded and enlarged Europe. It is a challenge for Ireland to aid institutional change in countries where democracy has never existed. The peripheral nature of our location on the western seaboard means that Europe is important to us as an economic entity and for the expansion of trade. We are duty bound to share our experience with other countries who are about to go through similar change. The Nice treaty provides an opportunity for us to show a genuine recognition of the obligation to share, participate and lead the way in working with other countries. We must meet the opportunities that exist for us as we are dependent on world markets and we need to trade. Ireland is a peripheral western European country on the Atlantic Ocean, so we need Europe. There are opportunities for us as well as for the applicant countries. Some of the scaremongering of other political parties regarding our defence and peacekeeping roles as part of the United Nations does a disservice to the nation and to the case for Ireland to share in the prosperity of the European Union and in its enlargement.  </P>
    <P>As an ex-member of the national reserve of the FCA, I am aware there is a need to expand the role of the FCA to ensure it has a wider function. There is a need for civic pride here. Civics is very much on the backburner of our educational system. The FCA could play a greater role, as it has developed leadership skills among many young people. I refer to the expansion of the FCA not in investment terms but in terms of its function and the important opportunity it gives young people to develop self-discipline, gain knowledge of civic law and recognition of the State, institutions, Government and politics. Its function could be enhanced and expanded. From speaking to the Minister, I am aware he recognises the role it could play and that it would provide a great opportunity for many young people.</P>
    <P>We are a modern nation that has achieved tremendous change and prosperity in the past 25 years as a member state of the EU. Membership of the EU has given us a great opportunity. We have mastered our future, held on to our culture in terms of our language and music and used the opportunities presented to develop our agriculture and tourism sectors.</P>
    <P>An expanded Europe under the Nice treaty is the future for Ireland. We have shown in the past we can play our part in the European Union. We have given the lead, taken on responsibility and created opportunities for ourselves. Our experience of investment here as a result of our participation in an enlarged European Union has enhanced our prospects for the future. I take this <Col N="862" /> opportunity to ask the Irish people to support the Nice treaty in the referendum on 7 June.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Ms Taylor-Quinn Ms Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and compliment Senator Glynn on his speech, which was very much a departmental speech. I was wondering was I in the real world or in cloud cuckooland because what he said is different from the reality. He talked about the modernisation of the Defence Forces and the wonderful work that is taking place &ndash; the Minister is looking at me rather awesomely &ndash; but the reality is very different. There are many orders for equipment on paper, much documentation and many files, but if one visits a battalion in any brigade in any barracks across the country one would learn the story is very different. There are many demoralised soldiers within the infantry and demoralised personnel within the Naval Service and the Air Corps. The modernisation that has taken place in the Defence Forces is nil. There is a great deal of demoralisation among its members.</P>
      <P>The White Paper has been repeatedly mentioned in terms of its contents. That so-called wonderful White Paper is the greatest hogwash, as the people who should have been consulted on it were not. The military were not consulted on it. It is a Department of Defence document that justifies a reduction in Army numbers so as to buy equipment. The submissions made by the Army, whether by officers, soldiers, or other personnel at whatever level, were not considered or incorporated in the White Paper. It does not reflect the views of the military. It is a document drawn up by a number of civil servants who do not have an ounce of military blood in their veins or any sense of what it is like to serve within a military establishment. The submissions by the Army were not deemed suitable to be incorporated into the White Paper.</P>
      <P>To quote the White Paper is a nonsense. It is not a document that promotes reform or modernisation, it is a justification document to reduce the size of the military, and to suggest otherwise is hypocrisy in the extreme. I am disappointed it has been referred to in the manner in which it has on the floor of this House this evening.</P>
      <P>Let us be honest. The officer corps is represented by RACO. The Minister attended the AGM of RACO some time ago. As a result of the strong speech made by the president of RACO at that meeting, the Minister got up on his high horse and since then has refused to meet the representative force of the officers of the Army. Let us call a spade a spade. The morale within the Defence Forces is poor. They were not consulted on the White Paper. When they got an opportunity to address it, the Minister got up on his high horse and the first thing he and his wonderful officials did was threaten to evict RACO personnel from their offices in Park House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relations between the Minister and the Department of Defence and the military are at an all-time low. There is no point trying to put <Col N="863" /> putty over it and pretend it is otherwise. The Minister and the Department and the military are two separate entities. The level of communication between them is minimal. The arbitration group has its offices in Park House. The Department of the Defence is on one floor and the military is on another floor, and at no time is there interaction between the two bodies. The Department of Defence does not relate to the chief of staff or to the military what is happening. Let us make no mistake about it, that is the reality.</P>
    <P>Approximately 40 armoured personnel carriers are on order and one or two of them may be about to come into the country. There is a need for about 80 to 100 armoured personnel carriers, but only 40 are on order. Does the military know where those carriers will be located, how many of them will remain here or whether some of them will be used by battalions who go on overseas duties? Where will personnel train in the use of those armoured personnel carriers? They cannot have manoeuvres on the Curragh as it has been deemed an SAC. Does the Minister propose to purchase property where personnel can conduct manoeuvres in these carriers or does he intend to send soldiers overseas to get training in the use of them? The military does not have an idea what is proposed. One would love to be inspired as to what is going on in the Minister's head or in the head of the Secretary General of the Department of Defence.</P>
    <P>The military does not know what battalion will be drawn for the rapid reaction force, which is a commendable force and one I fully support. It is vital and essential that our personnel are trained to the appropriate level and have effective skills to enable them to operate at any level in any part of the world, particularly within the European Union. It is vital they are well equipped and well trained, but is it intended to draw a battalion for the rapid reaction force from within one brigade or from all three brigades? Will the battalion be drawn from the eastern brigade one year, the western brigade the next year and the southern brigade the following year? Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on how he proposes to draw a battalion for that force or how he expects the chief of staff or the military to do it as they have no idea as to his thinking on this matter.</P>
    <P>We have a wonderful Air Corps, but the planes are about to fall apart, although new planes are on order. PricewaterhouseCoopers was asked to report back on the needs of the Air Corps in 1996, but it did not report until 1998 as its initial report did not suit the Department of Defence. The initial report submitted was honest and recommended significant additional investment. When what the Department wanted was not contained in the initial report, it asked PricewaterhouseCoopers to rejig the report to suit its agenda. PricewaterhouseCoopers eventually submitted its report in 1998.</P>
    <P>Orders have been placed for a variety of new aircraft for the Air Corps, which now has many <Col N="864" /> newly trained pilots who cannot clock up sufficient air time hours. Does the Minister intend to send them overseas to do so? If he were in Baldonnel last night, he would have seen aircraft flying until nine o'clock and young pilots having to queue for their turn to fly.</P>
    <P>To talk of modernisation and the high morale of the Army is senseless and dishonest because the Minister is not addressing the fundamental issues. His comments on the Army are bureaucratic hogwash. Military life is about action, manoeuvres, equipment, drill and getting things done. The Department of Defence is piling up paper, but from the points of view of the various barracks, there is no evidence of modernisation whatsoever. Rather than participating in PR exercises, will the Minister take the matter more seriously, account for the fundamental issues and discuss them with RACO? </P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. Coming from County Kildare and the environs of the Curragh, I am particularly pleased to take part in this debate and acknowledge the work done by the Government since coming to office in 1997. The White Paper on Defence set out the Government's modernisation plans for the Defence Forces and identified the key areas of priority. These are to develop a light infantry force with all-arms capability, to ensure sufficient strength of numbers to meet domestic and international responsibilities, to significantly improve the availability of equipment and to provide, from within the Department's allocation, the necessary financial resources to achieve the aforementioned goals. The implementation of the White Paper proposals is already well under way.</P>

      <P>I will speak particularly about capital investment and recruitment. My colleagues have given the broad picture, but I will refer to some specific issues, particularly the Curragh Camp. I compliment the Minister and his Department on the action they have taken in this regard. For many years, the Curragh Camp existed as a testimony to the State's lack of investment in the Defence Forces. The camp declined over many decades into what might be regarded as a derelict site because of lack of maintenance and funding. I recall a local authority debate on the introduction of the Derelict Sites Act, during which I rather facetiously suggested that the Curragh Camp was the location in the county that might best be included in a list of derelict sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That has now changed dramatically because of the intervention of this Government and the actions of the Minister. Construction and refurbishment projects, valued at more than £33 mill<Col N="865" /> ion, are well under way. These include, among other things, better student accommodation, improved mess facilities and the provision of a new swimming pool and gymnasium costing over £6 million, which is due for completion later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ó Fearghail</NameTxt>
      <P>These are positive actions by the Government. By any standard, this is a remarkable level of investment. It is proof that past neglect is being rectified by this Administration. The Curragh Camp is being regenerated and transformed. Additionally, further developments for the Curragh and Coolmoney camps have been proposed and are due to be undertaken later this year. They require an expenditure of nearly £20 million in addition to the £33 million already mentioned.</P>
      <P>I commend the Department for entering into a partnership arrangement with the Department of the Environment and Local Government regarding the provision of a new and improved sewage treatment system for the Curragh Camp, a system that would service many of the neighbouring villages. It is urgently required and I urge the Minister to proceed with it as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Chapter 4 of the White Paper addressed the issue of barrack closure. As a local representative, I was less than enthusiastic, to put it mildly, about the closure of Magee Barracks in Kildare and Devoy Barracks in Naas. The disposal of these and other valuable properties has provided the opportunity to create a significant investment fund for new equipment and infrastructure. Given the successful disposal of Devoy Barracks in Naas, will the Minister, as a matter of urgency, propose a plan for the early disposal of available lands at Magee Barracks, where the local community is very supportive of the prospect of the 60-acre site being developed? Since the closure of the barracks, the local community has experienced much of the pain and none of the gain that had been anticipated. The sale and development of this strategically important property would be important, not just in the context of the development of that part of County Kildare. It would also boost the Minister's investment fund by the order of £15 million.</P>
      <P>When the White Paper was first published, there was much controversy about the proposal to reduce the overall strength of the Permanent Defence Force by 1,000 to 10,500 personnel. Given today's labour market, the challenge that we face is the task of maintaining the existing strength and being able to sustain a successful ongoing recruitment campaign. On 14 March, the Minister launched a major recruitment drive aimed at bringing 800 young people into the Defence Forces this year.</P>

      <P>Undoubtedly, such an intake would be a huge boost to the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service. It must be demonstrated that the Defence Forces can, and do, offer a clear and attractive career path if such a recruitment campaign is to be a success. The five-year contracts currently on offer are unhelpful in terms of recruitment. I ask the Minister to examine this.</P>
      <P>The Chief of Staff, who now has full responsibility for recruitment, is now preparing a plan to restructure the Defence Forces in accordance with the Government's decision on overall numbers. I wish him well in his endeavours. It is of paramount importance that an integrated personnel management plan capable of early implementation is brought forward. Such a plan must be in place to ensure adequate intake and to retain existing expertise and experience among the ranks of those now approaching the end of their 21 years of service. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <P>I will discuss the issue of the role of women. I think it is 20 years since women entered the Defence Forces and I remember the early struggles regarding facilities and sleeping requirements in barracks. I watched very carefully a programme on the subject last week and we can be very proud of the women depicted in it. That is not to say that I would ever be sexist in any way. The Minister must realise I would never be so. Obviously, one must praise the males as well. It was considered to be too daunting an area for the frailer sex at that time. The women in our Army, Naval Service and Air Corps have done us proud. Senator Ó Fearghail referred earlier to recruitment and I believe that the role of women in the Army could be emphasised in a more positive manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the new equality laws I note that the Garda have dropped the height requirement. It is generally agreed that being tall and large does not necessarily mean that one has a greater ability to defend oneself or attack another. One can probably use more brute force, but brain and brawn do not always go together and small wiry people, such as Senator Ó Fearghail and others, would be as well able to defend anybody as larger and more strongly built people. I wonder why the height requirement is <Col N="867" /> part of a modernisation process. Worse again is the one inch height differential between men and women. It is a simple, practical thing but it does keep some people out of a service they want to join and would be proud to serve in.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister enlighten me on the Army deafness problem which has dogged the Defence Forces in recent years? Nobody would deny it exists despite all of the jokes at the time. If I remember correctly the Minister promised an inquiry, or was it a tribunal? Tribunal is a word I dislike as we have a plethora of them. I think an inquiry, perhaps an internal one, was promised but I do not think that problem has been finally resolved.</P>
    <P>I refer to the sale of Clancy Barracks, a most valuable asset to our Defence Forces. I am giving my age away by saying I can remember when the former Griffith Barracks was used as an interim accommodation base for people who could not get houses. Regrettably, Dublin is again in a similarly appalling state with regard to homelessness. I listened carefully to the Minister when he spoke on the radio today about his hopes for Clancy Barracks. I would not see anything wrong with many of the aspirations expressed, but I would be concerned about accountability as to where the profits from this sale go, with regard to the Defence Forces and their benevolent societies. Would there not be room in a barracks of such an age for a refurbishment programme to provide a centre for homeless people, such as exists in Finland, purely on a night-only basis? I referred recently in this House to the awful experience of 15 people who could not find night lodgings. It would be the right thing to do as a lot of money will be made from the sale of this prestigious site.</P>
    <P>When I was in the Curragh Camp recently I thought I was back in the early 19th century in view of the accommodation. I went into it by mistake when I was looking for the Cottage Hospital and ended up in the Curragh Hospital. It did not do me any harm to have that small tour.</P>
    <P>I want to ask about the sale of Gormanston in view of the fact that the Air Corps base happens to be in my constituency. A large number of constituents from Clondalkin have a proud tradition of working and serving in the Air Corps. Does the Minister have any good news for us with regard to improving Baldonnel, with regard to equipment in particular? I know that is close to the heart of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am not here to be critical but to point out, as I have done to other Ministers, in the manner of a school report that the Minister has done very well but must do better. It is the role of every Minister to do the best they can for the honour of holding their position and the people they serve. I remember when the Defence ministry was not considered to be the plum one, but the Minister has served excellently in the role. We should laud Defence Forces personnel who have represented our country abroad with such dignity and are highly thought of by the other countries that they <Col N="868" /> serve with when they are abroad on foreign missions.</P>
    <P>For that reason I am going to end on a realistic note. I appreciate that we always have to work to a budget, but I find it strange that the chief of staff is in charge of everything but the budget. Is it not the case that it is the Secretary General of the Department who is the main holder of the purse strings? If I am wrong then there is no better man than the Minister to correct me.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister and the Defence Forces well in any modernisation programme and I hope my points with regard to women, funding and Baldonnel in particular will be taken on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Cúis mhór áthais dom teacht go dtí an Teach seo agus caoi a bheith agam éisteacht leis an díospóireacht agus na cuspóirí atá agam a chur os comhair an tSeanaid. I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak about the progress of the modernisation programme for the Defence Forces and the future development of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps.</P>
      <P>The modernisation programme is set out in a very comprehensive way in the first-ever White Paper on Defence which I had the privilege and honour to publish on behalf of the Government in February last year. Our decision to publish a White Paper met fully the commitment we made in the action programme for the millennium. This commitment reflected our belief that there was a growing public awareness of the importance of defence issues and of the need for Ireland to take a more considered view of our defence and security environment, particularly in the context of developments in the European Union.</P>
      <P>The main White Paper objectives in relation to the Defence Forces were to provide a medium-term policy framework within which defence policy could evolve, to set out a clear strategy for the next ten years, and to provide for the continuation of the reform programme of the Defence Forces consistent with the national and international security environment and the state of the public finances. I believe the White Paper addresses these objectives in full. It sets out the strategy for defence for the next decade and builds on the modernisation process begun in the 1990s. It also maps out a development process which will ensure that the Defence Forces are geared for the evolving defence and security environment.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to say that Senator Taylor-Quinn in part of what she said brought home to me why Clare missed so many opportunities in the league final in the first quarter of an hour.

      <P>&mdash;the fear of tackling the problems associated with the hearing claims. We said at that time if they were not tackled it would be likely to cost the country in the region of £1.25 billion, which would have done enormous harm to the image and potential of the Defence Forces. I am happy to tell the House that, with strong support from the Opposition throughout my administration, it now looks like it will be about one-fifth of that figure. We are not setting up a tribunal but, instead, negotiating settlements at a fairly speedy rate. If that were to go wrong, we would return to my original proposal. Fortunately, we have had a great deal of co-operation and while it is not over, thankfully it has moved off the main agenda, allowing us to concentrate on other areas.</P>
      <P>Previous Administrations operated a stop-go recruitment policy which was very detrimental to the Defence Forces which did not have a constant inflow of young people. We decided to reverse that policy and have constant recruitment.</P>
      <P>In terms of the female contribution to the Defence Forces, which I acknowledge has been significant and continues to grow, there were 36 female staff when I took over. That has risen to 440, which is still a small number in relative terms. I intend to look again at height requirements, which I have already reduced somewhat for female entrants. I am bound, however, by the Medical Corps, which believes that real health dangers, notably back complaints, arise below a certain height level due to the type of equipment which must be carried in training, specifically in the Glen of Imaal, and on United Nations missions. I accept that minimum height requirements prevent otherwise eligible people from entering the forces. We need to get this matter right.</P>

      <P>The Chief of Staff is preparing a plan to restructure the Army in accordance with the Government's decision on overall numbers. My intention is to have that plan finalised and implemented by the end of 2001 in accordance with the Government decision. It is important that we put the new organisation in place and move ahead with the modernisation of the Defence Forces. It is equally important that the new organisation offers rewarding and challenging careers to Defence Forces personnel.</P>
      <P>The White Paper recognises the importance of the career dimension and provides for the preparation of an updated and very comprehensive Defence Forces integrated personnel management plan to address this and related issues. The Chief of Staff is currently drafting that plan and the process is well advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Getting the organisation and personnel policies right is critical. It is equally critical that the Defence Forces are adequately equipped to undertake the roles assigned to them. The objective is to acquire, maintain and manage equipment and weapons at the appropriate level of operational readiness in a cost effective manner. The strategic focus of the investment programme <Col N="871" /> for the period 2000 to 2010 is the acquisition of a broad range of equipment in order to achieve a balanced increase in operational capacity throughout the Defence Forces. In this context, it will be necessary to prioritise and reconcile the equipment and infrastructure requirements for the Army, the Air Corps, the Naval Service and the Reserve Defence Force within the total resources available. Basic to the plan is a multi-annual budgetary strategy which is vital to achieving value for money.</P>
    <P>Defensive equipment and infrastructure are expensive and I am anxious that their provision will impose no more of a burden on taxpayers than is absolutely necessary. With the support of my Government colleagues, and in line with the White Paper, I have been able to earmark an unprecedented £250 million for investment in new defence equipment and improved infrastructure. That investment programme is being funded from payroll savings consequent on the reduction of Defence Forces numbers and from the sale of the six barracks whose closure was announced in 1998. It is expected that well in excess of £50 million will be raised from the sale of these barracks.</P>
    <P>There are in addition a number of other lands within the Defence portfolio, including Gormanston about which I made a recent announcement, which are located outside of the permanently occupied military barracks and posts. The Government has decided, again in line with the White Paper, that the necessity for these properties be examined and that only those required for essential defence purposes will be retained. Those identified as surplus to requirements will be disposed of by sale or otherwise and the proceeds will be invested in Defence Forces equipment and infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The investment programme provides over £100 million for the development of buildings and other infrastructure at military installations. It also provides for new ships and aircraft and for about £25 million over three years for investment in light infantry tactical vehicles, modern effective anti-armour weapons, night vision equipment, engineer equipment and medical field equipment. There will also be a pistol replacement programme.</P>
    <P>This investment is additional to £40 million for a new fleet of 40 armoured personnel carriers for the Army, the first batch of which has been handed over while the remainder will have been delivered by January 2002 almost two years ahead of previous expectations, over £10.5 million for new tactical VHF radios and over £6.5 million on specialist transport cargo vehicles deployed to KFOR and new troop carrying vehicles such as four by fours and three quarter tonne trucks.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the development of the Air Corps and the Naval Service. I am very pleased to say that we have been able to make substantial progress on both fronts. An implementation plan for the future of the Air Corps has been agreed in <Col N="872" /> line with the policy parameters set down in the White Paper. The plan also reflects the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations made by Price Waterhouse and provides for a new organisational structure based on a division between operational and support elements with a total manpower of around 930, service level agreements with principal clients such as the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and measures to address personnel training and retention.</P>
    <P>The consultants also recommended relocation of Air Corps headquarters to Baldonnel and this was implemented in January 2000. As implementation of the plan proceeds, I have been able to allocate about £55 million over three years for the purchase of new aircraft for the Air Corps from the £250 million investment programme already mentioned. Special priority is being given to the procurement of new medium lift helicopters. The tender competition for the provision of the helicopters is well advanced and it is expected that the Department will be in a position to place a contract later this year.</P>
    <P>An implementation plan for the Naval Service provides for development of the service based on the provision of a modern eight ship flotilla. There will be a process of continuous investment and vessel replacement to ensure that the flotilla is capable of meeting the tasks assigned by Government.</P>
    <P>On a day to day basis, the primary activity of the Naval Service is providing fishery protection services based on outputs agreed with the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources which has policy responsibility for fisheries protection. The plan is framed within that context and also addresses the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations made by Price Waterhouse. A recommendation for the relocation of Naval Service headquarters to Haulbowline was implemented in December 1999.</P>
    <P>In keeping with our commitment to the Naval Service and the provision of an eight ship flotilla, we commissioned a state of the art offshore patrol vessel, the <i>le Roisin</i>, in December 1999 at a cost of £22 million. In addition, we hope to take delivery next month of a second new fishery protection vessel of the same type. This will be named the <i>le Niamh</i> and will be a replacement for the <i>le Deirdre</i> which has reached the end of its economic service life. This will mean that two ships will have been purchased for the Naval Service during the lifetime of this Government. The last purchase was made in 1984.</P>
    <P>The White Paper provides that the overall strategy for the development of the Reserve Defence Forces will be based on the report of the special steering group which reported in 1999. The recommendations in the report give us a general basis on which to proceed.</P>
    <P>Last year I published the report of the steering group and launched a consultative process to seek the views of members of the Reserve in advance <Col N="873" /> of drawing up an implementation plan. It is estimated that the implementation of any necessary structural and organisational change will take approximately six years. I mentioned earlier that a key objective of the modernisation programme is to provide sufficient forces and capabilities to meet needs at home and to make a significant contribution abroad. I do not have to remind anyone of the enormous contribution the Defence Forces have made to peacekeeping over several decades, often in very difficult missions. Indeed, 82 of our personnel have paid the ultimate price for peace in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, Ireland's commitment to collective security has been pursued through the United Nations. The contribution of the Defence Forces to UN missions since 1958 has been a great source of pride to successive Governments and to the people. Earlier this month, the Taoiseach and I reviewed the last Irish battalion to leave for service with UNIFIL in south Lebanon and he spoke of the pride of the Irish people in the Defence Forces. They have earned an unrivalled reputation as peacekeepers in diverse locations. We are determined to play our part in seeing that reputation maintained and developed.</P>
    <P>The Government, contrary to misguided speculation, remains determined to continue to contribute actively to UN peacekeeping. Our future contribution will take into account the changing and more complex nature of peacekeeping, which involves additional tasks such as humanitarian assistance, the protection of human rights and civilian police work.</P>
    <P>Since the end of the Cold War the UN has been responding to an increasing number of conflicts. Where appropriate, it has encouraged regional organisations to use their own potential, under a UN authorisation, to carry out peace support missions. Ireland's participation in SFOR in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in KFOR in Kosovo is a clear example of this development and of European Governments co-operating to prevent conflict and maintain peace.</P>
    <P>It is a lesson of the appalling events in the Balkans that we need to be able to move quickly and effectively in response to humanitarian crises. In its emphasis on co-operation, and not on confrontation, the new patterns of security co-operation reflect values which have always been at the heart of Irish foreign policy.</P>
    <P>It was the Amsterdam treaty, as approved by the Irish electorate in May 1998, that defined the operational focus of the EU on tasks of peacekeeping and crisis management, the so-called Petersberg Tasks. Based on the provisions of the Maastricht and Amsterdam treaties, the Union's practical approach in this area was guided first by the Cologne European Council in June 1999. Through decisions taken at successive European Councils in Helsinki, Feira and Nice, the Union has gradually set up decision-making structures so that it can undertake humanitarian and crisis management tasks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="874" /> Ireland, in common with our partners in the EU, is participating in these structures and can bring a great deal of expertise to bear. In particular, we can offer the wide experience we have acquired in the humanitarian and crisis management area through our participation in UN missions. In this way, we can play a constructive role in promoting peace and stability in Europe.</P>
    <P>As part of the response to potential future crisis management challenges, the European Council in Helsinki in December 1999 set the EU headline goal, a voluntary goal to deploy within 60 days and to sustain for at least one year military forces of up to 50,000 to 60,000 persons capable of the full range of humanitarian, peacekeeping and crisis management tasks. The objective is to achieve this goal in 2003.</P>
    <P>At the capabilities commitment conference last November, EU member states formally committed forces to the headline goal. Member states were invited to identify the ways in which they would contribute to this voluntary goal. In our case, the commitment of up to 850 members of the Defence Forces was authorised. Participation by members of the Defence Forces will only arise in clearly defined circumstances, namely, when UN authorisation is in place and when the terms of the relevant Irish legislation have been met. Our commitment to the headline goal is, therefore, fully consistent with Ireland's approach to overseas peacekeeping and consistent with our foreign policy traditions.</P>
    <P>Any offer which we have made will not prejudice in any way the fact that participation in any Petersberg mission remains a sovereign decision to be taken by the Government. The Government will decide on a case by case basis whether, when and how to commit troops and other resources to any mission. This will apply whether the mission is of the traditional UN type or is led by a regional organisation with UN authorisation.</P>
    <P>In this context, I have said and I repeat that none of this impacts adversely on our policy of military neutrality. The Government remains firmly committed to Irish military neutrality and sees our involvement in the European security and defence policy as fully consistent with our policy in this area. The Government has consistently made clear that the consent of the people in a referendum would be required if the issue of joining a mutual defence guarantee were to arise at any stage in the future. Let me also repeat that the EU headline goal is emphatically not a standing army. The EU's High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Mr. Javier Solana, emphasised this in a speech to the Institute for European Affairs in Dublin last year when he said:</P>
    <P>All member States are agreed that the Union is not in the business of creating a European Army. That is quite clear. The European Security and Defence Policy is not about collective defence. The Union has no ambition to take over or duplicate the work of NATO.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="875" /> What is more, these facts have been repeatedly recognised by the conclusions of successive European Councils, including most recently in Nice.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is the description of the EU headline goal as a rapid reaction force that has created doubts or the scope for mischief-making. What the EU is doing is putting together a pool of capabilities which provides the Union with the means to carry out the Petersberg Tasks. The national elements can only be deployed on foot of decisions by each potential contributor. The question of a UN mandate for identifying, developing and organising these capabilities does not arise. However, when it comes to participating in a particular operation, let me repeat and underline that Irish troops will only take part in an operation with a UN mandate. I reiterate that this participation would require Government decision and Dáil approval.</P>
    <P>Another question often asked is whether Partnership for Peace has any role in preparation for the EU headline goal. Ireland's decision to join PfP was taken independently and with the approval of Dáil Éireann. There is no institutional link between PfP and the EU but PfP is, nevertheless, relevant to the Petersberg Tasks. Essentially, our participation in PfP is designed to enhance interoperability with other states, thereby facilitating our capacity to undertake the Petersberg Tasks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other neutral EU states which participate in PfP, Ireland will use the mechanism of PfP's planning and review process to assist in planning for the Petersberg Tasks. The development of the EU's capability to carry out the Petersberg Tasks should be seen in the context of the range of instruments available to the EU, including diplomatic and economic measures. European security and defence policy is not only about developing military capabilities, it involves developing a spectrum of tools which the EU can have at its disposal with the objective of making the Common Foreign and Security Policy more effective and more visible. In this connection, the development of the EU's conflict prevention and civilian crisis management capabilities have a central role to play.</P>
      <P>A key challenge will be to enhance the Union's ability to prevent conflict. The European Commission recently published a communication on conflict prevention paper which outlines the variety of political and diplomatic options available where the situation in a particular country or region looks like deteriorating sharply. The Swedish Presidency of the EU fully recognises the central importance of conflict prevention and the subject will be a prominent theme for the Gothenburg European Council in June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="876" /> I spoke earlier about Ireland's proud record in UN peacekeeping. With the development of European security and defence policy, as I have outlined, one might ask how the UN and the EU link together. Are there contradictions between the two approaches? The answer is that one complements the other or, to put it another way, they are mutually reinforcing. The UN has encouraged regional approaches to peacekeeping and recently there have been discussions between representatives of the UN and the EU on peacekeeping and crisis management issues. Close co-operation between the EU and the UN is developing on these matters.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the arguments put forward by those who seek to exclude us from the forms of regional peacekeeping which the UN Secretary General is seeking to develop. There is no contradiction between Ireland's participation in UN missions in, for example, Lebanon, and our involvement in UN mandated operations in the Balkans.</P>
    <P>From Ireland's perspective, what the EU is doing in identifying capabilities is in many respects similar to what has been happening at another level at the UN with the UN standby arrangements system in which Ireland participates. This is the mechanism for co-ordinating the peacekeeping contributions of 88 countries and almost 150,000 personnel.</P>
    <P>The developments I have outlined are based on the provisions of the Amsterdam treaty. I would, nevertheless, like to mention the relevance of the Treaty of Nice in the security and defence area. The Treaty of Nice, on which we will have a referendum on 7 June, has made only limited changes to the existing provisions for the Common Foreign and Security Policy which are intended to make it more coherent, more effective and more visible. These limited changes are the deletion of references to the Western European Union and the provision of a basis for the Political and Security Committee in Brussels.</P>
    <P>At the time of the Amsterdam treaty, it was envisaged that the Western European Union would play a key role, acting on behalf of the EU, in the area of crisis management and conflict prevention. However, given the development of the Union's capabilities in this area, the role of the Western European Union has diminished. The deletion of the clauses concerning the Western European Union reflects the latest developments and the desire to update the treaty.</P>
    <P>As the European Union will now implement any decisions it takes in this area, the Treaty of Nice also provides for the replacement of the existing political committee based in Brussels. The new committee will assume functions relating to the conduct of the common foreign and security policy. As part of its responsibilities, the Political and Security Committee may exercise, under the authority of EU Foreign Ministers, the political control and strategic direction of crisis management operations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> Let me be absolutely clear on this issue, the Treaty of Nice contains no other security and defence provisions beyond the very limited changes which I have just outlined. It in no way expands or alters the scope of the Petersberg Tasks provisions as contained in the Amsterdam treaty and as already approved by the Irish people. In setting the position out in some detail, I hope that I have clarified matters. There is nothing in our participation in the European security and defence policy or PfP, or in the Treaty of Nice, which should alarm anyone with concerns about our commitment to the UN and our policy of military neutrality. There are no dangers there. In looking at the treaty, therefore, I would strongly urge people to focus on the real issue which is about enlarging the Union in the interests of Europe and Ireland.</P>
    <P>No one could argue the fact that EU membership has been overwhelmingly and directly to our benefit. As the Taoiseach pointed out recently, our net receipts from the CAP have amounted to close to £20 billion while the good use to which we have put EU Structural Funds has been a significant element in our recent social and economic transformation. Membership of the European Single Market has been crucial in positioning Ireland as a key player in transatlantic trade and investment. Our commitment to the disciplines of EMU has brought interest rates down to what are, in terms of recent history, remarkably low levels.</P>
    <P>The EU has been good for Ireland in direct material ways but it has been important in other ways also. When we joined in 1973 we were consciously opening ourselves up as a society as well as an economy and the balance sheet has been overwhelmingly positive in this area too. EU membership has allowed us to play a role in the wider world which would have been impossible otherwise. It has modernised our approaches to issues across the socio-economic spectrum and helped us to widen our horizons.</P>
    <P>I am sure that on 7 June when the people go to the polls on the Nice treaty, they will vote solidly in favour of enlargement. I believe they will appreciate that, while the enlargement of the Union which the Nice treaty makes possible may, at first glance, seem to be of little direct concern to Ireland, it is in reality very important indeed. First, Ireland, as a trading nation, has done well out of the existing Union. An enlarged Union, a greater Single Market, will be very much in our interests. Second, it is in Ireland's interests, both political and economic, for the whole continent of Europe to be prosperous, stable and democratic. Third, as a country which for many years had to pursue freedom as the highest national goal, we should have an instinctive sympathy for countries which were denied their freedom for so long.</P>
    <P>Ireland was fortunate to have been able to escape the worst effects of World War II and the Cold War. This should not prevent us from wanting to do all we can to support those who were less fortunate than we were and to give them the <Col N="878" /> same chance we got. We, too, will benefit from the distinctive contribution they will make to a wider and more diverse Europe.</P>
    <P>The basic thrust of the &ldquo;No to Europe&rdquo; argument is always the same &ndash; that we will be swept aside and overwhelmed within Europe. This betrays a fundamental lack of confidence in Ireland and the Irish people as well as a remarkable blindness to the realities of our experience to date in the EU. In essence, the issue revolves around what one considers to be the purpose and limits of sovereignty. We see the true sovereignty of the Irish people as being not a theoretical concept but a measure of how successfully we can protect and promote our basic national interests and our social and economic well being as a people. We believe that our consistent and bipartisan policy towards the EU over the past 30 years has done far more to achieve both purposes than any narrow policy of isolationism would have done.</P>
    <P>In the real world, all countries, especially small ones, operate within very considerable constraints. As the Taoiseach said recently, nobody can pull the curtains and tell the world to go away. Now more than ever, the need for the effects of globalisation to be managed and balanced is strongly apparent. We face challenges which respect no frontiers.</P>
    <P>Those who argue that the Treaty of Nice will decisively shift the balance within the Union towards the bigger states and will create a two tier Europe with Ireland in the second group have got it wrong. Likewise, in regard to what is called enhanced co-operation or flexibility, those who foresee a two tier Europe have got it wrong, just as they did with the Amsterdam treaty which initially introduced provisions of this kind. Where the Union as a whole does not wish or is not able to move ahead on a given issue &ndash; with 27 members, it is easy to see how this might happen &ndash; it will be slightly simpler for a group of members to do so subject to a range of safeguards. The Nice treaty will be good for Europe and good for Ireland as an integral part of a prosperous, peaceful and diverse Europe, and I urge a strong &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.</P>
    <P>I thank the Seanad for the opportunity of setting out the progress we have made with the Defence Forces modernisation programme and our plans for the future. As Minister for Defence, my overall objective has been to ensure that the country has Defence Forces and that the organisation continues to be one in which the people are proud to serve. We have had to take hard decisions to guarantee future success but those decisions are paying off and we can face the future with confidence. I wish to pay special tribute to my Department, to the Defence Forces and to the Civil Defence organisation for the contribution they have been making to dealing with the containment of the foot and mouth crisis. The Defence Forces, in particular, have played a key role in support of the civil authorities in helping to avert what could easily have become a disaster.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="879" /> I thank the Senators who tabled the motion and who addressed it here. Sometimes in the course of a debate like this there is a little banter but I want to say, seriously, that I appreciate the cross-party support which I have received for many of the changes which we have tried to implement in recent years. It has made my task easier. At the end of the day we are all contributing to making the Defences Forces stronger and better equipped, to providing them with better accommodation and to making them better able to face the challenges which arise in the future.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Chathaoirligh, I have a suspicion that if one of the Members of the House launched into a two page speech on the referendum on the Nice treaty in the middle of a debate on the Defence Forces, we would have been reminded by you to return to the topic under discussion. However, we will continue the hospitality of this House and forgive the Minister.</P>
      <P>I always describe myself as a critical europhile and I have no desire to be in the ranks of the lunatics of the British Tory Party, but there are huge issues to be asked about the democratic basis of some things which are happening in Europe. There is also a wonderful sin of omission which is practised by most people in Ireland, which is, that the cash benefit to this country from membership &ndash; leaving out the alleged benefits, some of which are real and some of which are imagined &ndash; is always stated as £20 billion.</P>
      <P>I asked somebody about six years ago to ask a question of the then Minister for the Marine about the estimated market value of fish caught in the Irish zone by non-Irish registered trawlers. According to the figure he gave me, which, as he said himself, was based on ball park figures, at current prices one could say that about £750 million worth of fish are caught per annum by trawlers fishing in our waters by permission of the Common Fisheries Policy. The ball park figure &ndash; I would happily put it plus or minus one-third &ndash; for the amount of fish which we gave away is actually about £20 billion. I do not say that that is an argument against anything we did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was huge debate in 1972 and the point was vigorously made that we had hopelessly negotiated fisheries. We did that in order to gain the benefits of the CAP, which, as anybody who <Col N="880" /> had read even the first chapter of a first year economics textbook would know, could not last without major reform. There is another side to all of these arguments and popular engagement would be greater if people were not always sold a one-dimensional perspective.</P>
    <P>I do not want to launch into a debate on the Nice treaty, but the Minister glides over strange assumptions. Let me put one, which is worthy of debate, before the House. One of the reasons for the institutional changes of the Treaty of Nice is that it has been asserted, and assumed, that a Commission of perhaps 35 members would be unwieldy and unworkable. This is a Commission which would be based in one building, share a secretariat and all common resources but would be too big. However, we are to have a Council of Ministers which will not share the same secretariat, which will not have offices in the same building, or share the back-up the Commission could call on, and we are told it will work fine. Someone, from somewhere or other, should explain to ordinary, simple people like me why a Commission which has a single focus, purpose and common allegiance could not work with 35 members while a Council of Ministers with perhaps 35 different allegiances, 35 different views and perhaps 30 different languages will work well. I have never figured it out but, that said, let us return to the topic.</P>
    <P>I gather from the exchanges after I arrived that, yet again, Fianna Fáil promised something in an election manifesto and then discovered the realities of life upon taking office. Fianna Fáil promised there would be no closures of barracks, but my good friend, Deputy Wall, Labour's chief spokesman on defence, assures me that it did.</P>

      <P>I return to a matter on which I know the Minister has made some vague promises and nothing has been done. It is the extremely serious issue of the disappointing and distressingly high incidence of homelessness among former members of the Defence Forces, particularly among single men who do not have a family network to fall back on. This is recognised and reported on. I gather the Minister has acknowledged the problem, at least informally on some occasions, and has undertaken to assist voluntary organisations. It is the Minister's job to take the initiative on this real tragedy. If they are anything, the Defence Forces are institutions and when people spend 20 years in them, identify with them, they can become institutionalised. Retired personnel never truly leave the Defence Forces and they carry that with them. In particular, single people who retire can become quite lost and a significant number of them &ndash; I do not want to make it any worse than that &ndash; end up in circumstances we should not allow former members to end up in. It is up to Government to take the initiative while accepting any voluntary assistance. The least the Minister can do, with so much surplus property available, is offer a site to any group that would provide long-term shelter to former members of the Defence Forces who would otherwise end up in accommodation we should not be proud was lived in by people who may have taken considerable risks on our behalf.</P>
      <P>Another issue I am interested in is the housing problem. It seems strange in Dublin city to have 20 acres owned by the Department of Defence at Clancy Barracks while the local authority is crying out for land on which to build social and low cost housing.</P>

      <P>There is a case for advancing the Local Government Bill and getting around its problems because there is obviously a problem of accountability, from what the Minister is saying.</P>
      <P>We should be particularly careful about what our defence policy is. The former leader of Fine Gael, Deputy John Bruton, was characteristically honest when he said that it is difficult to distinguish peacemaking from war making, as it involves the deliberate use of force, by an external body, to separate warring factions. If anyone wants, I will produce the quote so we need not argue about it. That may or may not be a necessary thing to do, but the people are entitled to that level of honesty about what the Petersberg Tasks entail. Nobody has been prepared to elaborate on what those tasks mean. We know what they do not mean courtesy of the former Secretary General of NATO, Mr. Javier Solana, who, unhappily, has been made EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. I liked his quotation. Many of the hierarchy in the European project are often more blunt than people here. He said that the European security and defence policy is not about collective defence and I accept that. At this stage it is not. Then he says the Union has no ambition to take over or duplicate the work of NATO, the clear implication being that Europe's defence is obviously undertaken by it. It is astonishing that Europe, while it talks about having a defence presence of some form, would associate a project driven by democracy and human rights with a military alliance which does not have either as a precondition of membership. That military alliance tolerated the membership of a Greek dictatorship, of a fascist Portuguese dictatorship and of Turkey, which intermittently pretends to be a democracy though it has never really been a functioning one.</P>
      <P>There is a challenge for the EU to present to NATO. If it is to maintain this increasingly close relationship with NATO, the EU should demand of it the same as it demands of every country wishing to be a member, which is that only democracies need apply. The idea that you need to subvert democracy to defend it is a nonsense. If that nonsense were disposed of then many of the reservations a lot of us have about the direction of the rapid reaction force could well be allayed.</P>

    <P>We have been well served by the Army, both at home and abroad, but that proud record has <Col N="883" /> not always been rewarded. It is not so long since the image of the Army was of a body of men who were poorly housed in ramshackle, old buildings which were the legacy of the garrison towns of another administration. They were poorly equipped, poorly paid and very poorly looked after. That situation was tolerated for years. Indeed, some of the very best folklore to come out of the Irish Army are the tales told of the group which was sent to the Congo in the early 1960s. It was sent with clothing which was the equivalent of Aran jumpers to a country with an equatorial climate. I hope the stories they tell will not be lost and will be written down. We tolerated such a situation in respect of making decent provision for people who were doing a decent job for their country.</P>
    <P>I am very glad the position has been radically and dramatically turned around and that visible improvements have been made, not in a haphazard or offhand manner, but on foot of a well thought out strategic plan, worked out by an independent body, PricewaterhouseCoopers. This has been incorporated into the Army culture by means of the White Paper. Visible improvements have taken place and I will not shed any bitter tears if a few barracks are closed down.</P>
    <P>I can cite an example from my locality. Money that accrued from the closure of Fermoy barracks was used for the improvement of Collins barracks in Cork. The conditions of work for the personnel there were absolutely appalling. The barracks has been significantly and substantially upgraded in recent years. The mess, living quarters and operational areas are a credit to the Army. The personnel there now have premises that suitably reflect their effort and their endeavour.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ryan about former Army people who become homeless. It could be that the structured Army regime means that some people cannot cope without it. It is a sad testimony that there is a small cohort of such people for whom proper after-care provision is not made. This is the main point I wish to make to the Minister. He should make it his objective to consider this problem. It is a poor reflection on us if we do not make better provision for people in that position. They were servants of the State who served the State well.</P>
    <P>I am aware of what former Army people can do in the community. I am a local authority member for the Mayfield area of Cork and Collins barracks is just a stone's throw from my home on Wellington Road. I acknowledge the enormous contribution both serving and retired Army people make to community effort and endeavour. Twenty-five years ago, an Army person started the Mayfield Boys' Brass Band. Long before it became a fashionable theory, young people were taken off the streets, they were given musical instruments and were taught to read music. That band has grown and developed over the past 25 years. It is now the Mayfield Brass Band, comprised of boys and girls, and it has brought a great <Col N="884" /> deal of musical honour to Cork city and to its own locality. That was the brainchild of a former Army band member.</P>
    <P>I have seen enormous good work done in athletic clubs and community associations, by Army people who bring their own ethic of order into areas where chaos, vandalism and hooliganism exist. They endeavour to exert a good influence on young people growing up in a very troubled time, even though this is above and beyond their call of duty.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with Irish participation in the rapid reaction force. To deny that there is a need for Irish participation in that kind of activity is to close our eyes to the atrocities that were committed in the Balkans in recent years. We remember the appalling slaughter and savagery that took place in Kosovo and in all that region, the destruction of that wondrous city of Sarajevo, which was razed to dirt and dust. As a member of the EU, Ireland could not stand by and refuse to make some contribution to peacemaking and peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred to a quotation from Deputy John Bruton which I found extremely puzzling, this notion that if one is making peace, one is also making war. I was a teacher of history and in my experience of history, the war always seemed to come first and peacekeeping forces moved in afterwards in an effort to make peace on foot of the war. It would be a good subject for a good debate on a long winter night. I regret that rhetoric is used to denigrate Ireland's peacekeeping efforts abroad, efforts which are well-intentioned, well-directed and carried out with extreme professionalism. I am proud of those efforts.</P>
    <P>This year sees the end of Ireland's association with the UNIFIL force in Lebanon, after long and distinguished service. I salute and thank our forces in Lebanon. They brought credit to Ireland and have done us proud. My key point to the Minister is the need to make proper provision for former soldiers where the need arises. The number who are homeless and derelict is not great. We should ensure that proper provision is made for them. The Minister should investigate the provision of accommodation and proper care for them. Service in the Irish Army should be properly acknowledged, properly recognised and decently rewarded. I applaud the Minister's efforts and I am aware that it was not always easy. The introduction of change is never easy, but not to bring about change is to do an injustice to people who would benefit from that change at the end of the day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and this debate in Private Members' time. I pay tribute to the many people who have given tremendous service in the Defence Forces. Lip service was often paid to the Defence Forces and they were taken for granted and at times some of their contributions may not have been recognised for what they were. It is interesting to note that <Col N="885" /> in times of bus strikes, foot and mouth disease and various other problems the first solution is to send for the Army. At all times it has been able to respond even in areas where it did not have specific training. It provided a back-up service recently following the outbreak of foot and mouth disease.</P>
      <P>The Minister's comments are welcome. I hope his proposals for restructuring will come to fruition. He mentioned the key goals of providing a light infantry-based force with an appropriate level of all arms capability and sufficient forces to meet needs at home and to make a significant contribution abroad and to put in place a more cohesive and better equipped force than exists at present. Our forces abroad have given tremendous service, in Lebanon, Kosovo and the Congo, going back to the late 1950s when we first provided support in peacekeeping duties. That is something for which the Irish have been recognised in the areas in which they participated.</P>
      <P>I heard the Minister speak on the radio yesterday about Clancy Barracks. I recognise that some barracks may be surplus to requirements. I hope that whatever is erected there will be of benefit to the city. I also hope there will be a certain amount of social housing and that it will not be all office blocks. I ask that the money generated be used to assist in the provision of better equipment and in upgrading staff quarters and, in particular, that the accommodation for Army privates and those in the lower ranks be brought up to standard. While improvements have been made more needs to be done.</P>
      <P>There is one matter on which I could possibly take issue with the Minister. It concerns the omission of the Army Equitation School. Knowing the Minister's background he would be four square behind it. Given that it is in its 75th year I understand there will be a celebration. Even before we hit the news in our peacekeeping efforts, there were the famous Army teams&mdash;</P>

This school needs funding. It has had some great successes and I pay tribute to the various riders, some of whom have been household names.

While there is quite a commitment involved in buying horses I hope the Minister will accept this suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="886" /> This side of House welcomes the debate. If there have been criticisms I hope they have been constructive and that they will be taken on board. I pay tribute to all those people who have paid the ultimate price, at home and abroad. Mention of the Naval Service, the Air Corps and helicopters bring to mind the recent tragedy in Tramore. If the Minister is getting some of these high powered helicopters we shall need well trained personnel to operate them. It is important that the best equipment be obtained and that the best training be provided.</P>
    <P>We welcome the debate and support the basic terms of the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate gives us an opportunity to discuss what is happening in the Defence Forces and to compliment them on what they have done for this country over many years. The Minister has been involved in much of the angst and the political toing and froing which took place during the drawing up of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report. No matter where in Ireland there was a barracks or military installation, there was concern about the future of the Defence Forces. I compliment the Minister on what he has done. The implementation of the plan in terms of the numbers that have been set will ensure a modern, up to date, well trained and well disciplined Defence Force.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt there was a need to upgrade the equipment the Defence Forces need in the pursuance of their duties. They have had a broad range of duties. Their military duties are of paramount important but their back-up service to civil society has also been of major importance. Whenever there was an emergency the Army reacted in an organised manner and played a major part down through the years in helping the Garda, the fire brigade and so on. As Senator Cosgrave said, in times of strikes or floods they assisted the civil power and must be complimented.</P>
      <P>The investment programme for the Army, the Navy and the Air Corp is a major investment by any standard and fulfils the needs of what is a small defence capability. Much has been said in recent weeks and much will be said in the next few weeks about the rapid response force. We had the argument on PfP in recent months. The rapid response force is a necessary element in the Treaty of Nice. When people look at the military capacities around Europe they set on a figure. That figure takes in all the armies within the European Union. There are armies which are not standing armies; there are armies which are part standing. There were countries where there almost had to be a referendum to get people to enlist in the Army so that something could be done. The situation in the Balkans brought home to us in Europe the need for a rapid response force. It would not be feasible for our whole Army to get involved in any specific operation. We can use our expertise to join our allies and go into areas where peacekeeping and management are needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="887" /> When we signed up for Partnership for Peace, some people said we were being forced into a European army which was associated with NATO, but nothing could be further from the truth. We were given a period of two years during which we could decide what strategy we would adopt within PfP.</P>
    <P>In the post Cold War era there is a need for a rapid response force. I hope the people will endorse the setting up of this force. It is merely a continuum of what happened for many years when we responded to United Nations requests to go to places like the Congo, the Iran-Iraq border or the Lebanon. We have been all over the world and have performed extremely well.</P>
    <P>Those overseas missions have been of tremendous importance to our Defence Forces and allowed them to gain expertise. They allowed us to get away from the insular attitude that prevailed years ago when I can remember judges saying: &ldquo;Join the Army or go abroad&rdquo;. That has changed dramatically and there is now pride in our Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>If a crisis arises, we will be able to commit 850 members of our Defence Forces, not all of whom need to go at once. We cannot get involved without the operation having a United Nations mandate and the Government would need to seek Dáil approval. That is a protection that we all hope will continue.</P>
    <P>There must be more focus on conflict prevention in Europe and throughout the world. This has been given a high profile under the Swedish Presidency. Too often we have to send in a fire brigade but the fire may have been smouldering for many months before the conflict arose.</P>
    <P>I again thank the Minister for coming into the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Fianna Fáil group and the Leader for putting down this motion. In the course of the enactment of any policy it is important to have a review of progress and this House is the appropriate place for it. Senator Taylor-Quinn referred to a Department statement. Those of us who have a finite memory find it important to use the prop of pen and paper and I tend to be rather human in that regard.</P>
      <P>It is important to highlight what has been achieved. However, there is more to be achieved. When Senator Taylor-Quinn spoke about training in the Air Corps, she was in full flight without wings. Whatever aspect of the Defence Forces we are talking about, whether the Naval Service, the Air Corps or the Army, it is important that we enact policies that will bring that aspect into the 20th century.</P>

      <P>The policy of continuous recruitment ensures a regular intake of new recruits, and a voluntary early retirement scheme is in place to address the very unsatisfactory age profile of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>Following a judgment of the Supreme Court the level of awards for Army hearing loss claims has reduced from an average high of about £35,000 to about £7,500. The vast majority of those cases were genuine.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to former members of the Defence Forces who have fallen on hard times. I appreciate the role played by the Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen and the Irish United Nations Veterans Association which are endeavouring to address this problem. I spoke to the Minister before about this and I know that he has an interest in it. I hope it will be possible to do something to help those people. Senator Taylor-Quinn referred to the institutionalisation of some of those people. That is consistent with what happens to people who have served for a number of years in an organisation like the Army where there is strict discipline. It also happens in the health services and many other professions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for taking this motion and the Minister for taking time to come to the House. The motion relates to the feasibility of developing Gormanston Aerodrome in County Meath as a possible site for a civil aviation facility. In commending the motion to the House, it is worthwhile putting on record the history of the aerodrome in Irish aviation.</P>
      <P>It was opened as an airfield in 1917, 84 years ago, by the British and in 1919 employed 651 people, 65 of whom were pilots. These are remarkable statistics given that we consider aviation to be a creation of the 1950s and 1960s. It achieved infamy locally and nationally in 1920 as the base for the notorious Black and Tan raid on the adjacent town of Balbriggan, known as the sack of Balbriggan. It was taken over by the Free State Army in 1922. From 1946 to 1986 it was an Air Corps base and is currently in use as a training facility for Air Corps pilots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="889" /> The site at Gormanston contains approximately 270 acres and is bounded on one side by the Dublin-Belfast railway line and on the other by the main Dublin-Belfast road. It has existing aviation infrastructure which lends the venue in a unique way to development as a potential aviation site. It is also surrounded by unlimited acres of relatively flat land with a very low level of development. In the 1940s Sir Billy Butlin recognised it as the place in Ireland with the lowest rainfall, a situation which the locals say still pertains. He built his Mosney camp one mile from the aerodrome in 1946. The prevailing wind is south-westerly, which lends itself perfectly to an approach by air from the sea.</P>
    <P>The uniqueness of the opportunity is particularly contextualised when one considers what we in north County Dublin refer to as Collinstown, better known as Dublin Airport. In stark contrast to the facility at Gormanston, Dublin Airport will process 14 million passengers this year. In recent years this number has been increasing at a rate of one million per annum. The often criticised facilities, we are told, are capable of dealing with 20 million passengers per annum. Subject to full development of facilities and infrastructure, we are told the campus has a possible capacity of 40 million passengers per annum. Currently, the throughput is 14 million and the airport is expected to be at full capacity within the next five years given the current infrastructure.</P>
    <P>It is all very well increasing capacity and adding facilities, a situation beloved of many developments, but I suggest that while processing up to 20 million passengers through the current infrastructure at Collinstown may be relatively feasible, we must consider the congestion it will cause in the air. Currently there are major difficulties over Portmarnock, the principal approach for air traffic into Collinstown. To achieve the projected passenger throughput at Dublin Airport requires the equivalent of a dual carriageway in the air over the residential area of Portmarnock. There are already major problems there, particularly in relation to noise pollution, without referring to issues of safety. There has been a doubling of air traffic over the past ten years over the Portmarnock conurbation. There are also major access difficulties on the ground which do not require elaboration for anybody who has travelled the M50, and we are aware of the billions of pounds being spent on a light rail link to Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>Dublin Airport directly employs 8,000 people while 12,000 are indirectly employed in the immediate vicinity of the airport. The airport accounts for 2% of our GDP, making it an industrial giant. It requires careful attention to ensure the relatively uncontrolled development currently taking place does not lead to a deterioration in the services and facilities provided at the airport with a consequent impact on employment. The airport is fast approaching capacity and in the context of lead-in times for developments of this nature, four to five years is very little. I am here <Col N="890" /> to urge the Minister to facilitate in every possible way the investigation of Gormanston as a viable site for a second airport which, by common consent, is required in the greater Dublin area. My reasons for doing so are worthy of repetition.</P>
    <P>Gormanston Aerodrome is bounded on the north and south by hundreds of acres of relatively undeveloped and flat land, ideal for airport use. The site is bounded on the west by the Dublin-Belfast road, with immediate access to the M1, and immediately on its eastern perimeter by the Dublin-Belfast railway line. The aerodrome is 45 minutes by rail from Dublin and 75 minutes by rail from Belfast. There are currently two stations within one mile of the control tower at Gormanston.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is immediately adjacent to the Irish Sea, with unlimited scope for runway extension out into the sea, as has been done at numerous airports throughout the world. I mentioned earlier the prevailing south-westerly wind is ideal for east to west access over the sea, thereby not causing any difficulties for adjoining conurbations. From a training and access point of view, the fact that the area has the lowest rainfall in Ireland will certainly strike a few chords with those who were involved in the development of Knock and Cork airports, both of which we were told could be totally unviable because of the low cloud level.</P>
    <P>Gormanston is a very comfortable hour's drive from south Dublin, from the Border with Northern Ireland and it would bring one very close to Mullingar inland. The Minister's friends in Ryanair have made a fortune over the years working from airports such as Stansted in London, Beauvais near Paris and Charleroi near Brussels, all of which are in the region of an hour from the major city they service. Not only is Gormanston just 45 minutes from Dublin but it is a mere 75 minutes from Belfast, the two major cities nearest to the facility.</P>
    <P>In my opinion Gormanston is highly viable as a civil aviation facility. It is incumbent upon us all to ensure an appropriate investigation is facilitated at this stage and that we are not in either House in five or ten years' time discussing the lack of aviation infrastructure in the greater Dublin area and referring to Gormanston aerodrome as being aviation's Harcourt Street line. It would be a travesty if we were to allow that to happen. I urge the Minister of State to give my motion every consideration and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator Glennon on raising this important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had the hope for a considerable time that a flying training facility for commercial pilots would be established in Ireland. Commercial aviation is a central element of the success of our island economy and I would like to think that a career in flying would be a realistic option for our young people. The ability to train for a commer<Col N="891" /> cial pilot's licence in accordance with international standards would be a very welcome addition to our aviation infrastructure and would eliminate the need for our young people to travel abroad for training.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, my Department, together with the Department of Defence and the Irish Aviation Authority, investigated the possibility of encouraging private sector interests to establish a school for training commercial pilots at Gormanston. At that time there was a very obvious synergy for maximising the use of the aerodrome by civil aviation in addition to its use by the military authorities. This type of joint occupancy is well established in other countries. In circumstances where the facilities were expected to continue to be required for military use, it would have been practical to facilitate civilian activities at Gormanston at a price that could be afforded by the private sector activities. From the perspective of the Department of Defence, the income from the civilian activities would have been a useful addition to defence funding that would otherwise simply not have been available.</P>
    <P>In this context during 1999, as a result of an initiative by myself and the Minister for Defence, a media advertisement invited proposals from parties interested in promoting and operating a flying training centre at Gormanston military aerodrome on a commercial basis. A number of expressions of interest were received from the private sector and these were examined by a steering group representative of the two Departments and the Irish Aviation Authority. The general conclusion was that there would be considerable financial risk attached to the oper<Col N="892" /> ation of a training centre for commercial pilots as a stand-alone activity without support from a wider range of flying activities such as private pilot training, leisure flying and general aircraft maintenance. My Department was recently in contact with the parties that had expressed interest in response to the 1999 advertisement and it is clear nothing has happened in the intervening period to alter the earlier conclusion.  </P>
    <P>Now, however, the underlying economic circumstances have changed very markedly with the Minister for Defence's recent announcement that the Air Corps has concluded Gormanston Aerodrome is no longer required for military flying and will be offered for sale. Members of the Seanad will be aware that the Government has approved a major investment programme for the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence envisages that the proceeds of the sale of the Gormanston land will make a major contribution to financing that programme.</P>
    <P>Naturally I would be pleased to see private interests bidding for the Gormanston facilities with a view to continuing flying activities there. My understanding is that the Gormanston land is likely to be worth considerably more for non-aviation purposes so that, unfortunately, this may not be a realistic prospect.</P>
    <P>Clearly the situation now needs to be reassessed very carefully in light of these recent developments. However, I would be very disappointed to lose the possibility of a commercial flying school being established at Gormanston and I will be consulting further with the Minister for Defence on the matter.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 10 May 2001.</P>
