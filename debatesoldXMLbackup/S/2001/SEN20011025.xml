      <P>I have received notice from Senator Mooney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the progress which has been made on a resolution passed by County Leitrim Vocational Education Committee regarding the possibility of renting accommodation to accommodate the new PLC course at Lough Allen college, Drumkeeran, County Leitrim, and to outline the decision that has been taken on the provision of grant assistance for computers for this class.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to address immediately the serious situation in Meelick national school, County Clare, in relation to accommodation, health and safety regulations and general facilities.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business for today is No. 1, statements on homelessness, to be taken between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 12 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes, and No. 2, statements on Northern Ireland, to be taken between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes. Senators may share time. There will be a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday a number of Senators asked for a debate on Aer Lingus and the Leader <Col N="530" /> undertook to try to get the Minister to come into the House today. I am sure he has tried, but he has not succeeded. Perhaps he could indicate what is the position because Members would like an update from the Minister.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, when does the Minister&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I got a little ahead of myself calling the Leader Minister. When does he expect Committee Stage of the Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 2001, to be taken? It is my understanding that a significant number of Government amendments will be introduced on Committee Stage which means the Bill was not fully outlined on Second Stage. I want to ensure a raft of Government amendments are not introduced the day before the Bill is taken, which has happened previously. I ask the Leader to ensure adequate time is given to the Opposition.</P>
      <P>In the other House a major package of radical reforms is about to be unveiled concerning its operation in terms of sitting hours and so forth. Has the Leader given consideration to doing the same in this House? I refer to a root and branch examination of the House, not simply a review of Standing Orders. Will he consider establishing a small committee shortly in order that such work could begin during the lifetime of this Parliament?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether I noticed a shudder going through the body politic when the Leader of the Opposition referred to the Leader of the House as &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>A deep shadow certainly passed over the House.</P>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on Aer Lingus, a matter raised by Senators yesterday and again by Senator Manning this morning. It must be recognised that decisions relating to the company are urgent. We should certainly hear what the Minister has to say as there is a significant need for information. This morning's newspapers are reporting that the trade union leadership is not revealing the full facts to its members. However, the trade union leadership is as committed to making Aer Lingus work as anybody else, but needs information to engage with Government on the best plan.</P>
      <P>I refer to an issue raised yesterday. When the Criminal Assets Bureau was established by the Oireachtas many fine contributions were made in the House regarding investment in ensuring crime was rooted out and hiring the best legal brains to do so. The CAB's senior legal adviser is leaving, which is an appalling development. I will not go into detail or mention the person's name.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will recall my ruling yesterday on this matter. It is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and can be raised in another manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought about raising it on the Adjournment, but since the post had been established by legislation I though that would be inappropriate. Will the Leader consider asking the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come into the House to establish whether it would be appropriate to amend the CAB legislation? Benchmarking of the post to which I refer with a similar post in the private sector would result in a higher level of remuneration for the person involved. Every Member would agree with this. We are handcuffing ourselves. We are losing the ship for a hap'worth of tar. The House has adopted a single-minded approach to crime and I ask the Leader to raise the issue with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Buckley report has dealt with remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator O'Toole's comments on the Criminal Assets Bureau which was established under one of the finest Bills that has ever been introduced. Anything that prevents the bureau from operating fully should be dealt with expeditiously.</P>
      <P>Senators called for a debate on Aer Lingus yesterday and the call is being repeated this morning because events are changing almost daily. The plan to save the company has changed utterly since the Minister for Public Enterprise was in the House last week and it is appropriate that she should return to inform us about what is the state of play.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs into the House to discuss the reports on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; yesterday and in newspapers today about a young Irishman who has spent five to six months in a jail in Thailand? It is reported that he is shackled 24 hours a day and lives in atrocious conditions, that bail has been refused and that no one knows when he might be released. He does not seem to have received much help from State agencies or the Department of Foreign Affairs. When an Irish citizen is held in such conditions it is appropriate that the diplomatic service should deal with the case. On this occasion, the mother of the man in question stated that very little had been done for him. I ask the Leader of the House to find out what is being done by the Department of Foreign Affairs. Perhaps the Minister would make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two headlines in the editorial column of the <i>Irish Independent </i>this morning, one stating, &ldquo;Ignore the Begrudgers&rdquo;, and the other &ldquo;Crackers&rdquo;. The former headline refers to the Northern Ireland peace process, the latter to the cost to the State of the visit by the Chinese Premier and his delegation to Ireland. The headline &ldquo;Ignore the Begrudgers&rdquo; does not sit easily with me. When they are talking about <Col N="532" /> giving the representatives of the biggest nation in the world some modicum of hospitality &ldquo;Crackers&rdquo; is an unreasonable description. I think they might have mixed up their headlines. I would be interested to know how much the <i>Irish Independent </i>and Sir Anthony and Lady O'Reilly spend on entertaining each year and whether they &ldquo;Ignore the Begrudgers&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Senator Lanigan, this is not relevant to the Order of Business. Do you have a question for the Leader of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant to begrudgery though.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not begrudge Sir Anthony his title. He was a very good rugby player &ndash; I can say that much for him. I ask the Leader of the House for an urgent debate on Palestine when we return. I refer to the <i>Sunday Independent </i>and an article by Eilis O'Hanlon in which she writes what could be described as a press release from the Israeli Embassy headlined &ldquo;Little Known Facts About the Middle East&rdquo;. She lists a series of inaccuracies and lies. It is a total misrepresentation. This was published in the paper without any comment from the editors. I waited for some form of rebuttal from somebody, but none came. It is imperative that we have a debate on the Middle East because of what is happening there. The Israeli Government has used the aftermath of the events of 11 September to do things to the Palestinians that they could not have done beforehand. They have cocked a snook at the world as they have gone about their activities. They have said that they will not stop the assassinations. They are entering Palestinian territory and assassinating anybody remotely connected with acts against the Israeli Government. They say that Yasser Arafat is responsible. Twenty-five years ago, the PLFP under George Habash was fighting against Arafat and now the Israeli Government under Ariel Sharon is saying that Arafat must take out the PLFP. There is no way that will happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>These are all points that can be made in the debate the Senator is seeking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the current problems in international affairs are related to what is happening in Palestine. I ask for an urgent debate on Palestine when the House returns. If the Palestinian question were eliminated from the world stage we might have a recognition that international terrorism does not derive from there exclusively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Senator Lanigan has supported my call yesterday for a debate on the situation in both Palestine and Israel. I look forward to that and hope that it will be conducted in a balanced fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time is too short for the debate on Northern Ireland and I cannot agree to it. Fifteen <Col N="533" /> minutes for each spokesperson will take an hour and there will be another hour when speakers will have ten minutes each. More than six people will wish to contribute on this important debate, particularly in the light of the developments of the last few days.</P>
    <P>I also support my colleague and neighbour, Senator Costello, with regard to the case of Mr. Wesley Higgins who is in prison in Thailand. Unlike the so-called &ldquo;Columbia Three&rdquo;, he travelled on a valid passport. He was robbed by some local Thai people, was desperate for money and foolishly stole a camera worth, I suppose, £100. The authorities said initially that they would release him for £4,000, then the figure went up to £8,000 and now they will not release him at all. He has been in jail for nine months. Surely that is excessive for stealing a camera. One wonders what action was taken against the Thai people who were the original source of this incident. It is a regrettable case and I am glad that Senator Costello raised it because I think we should protect our citizens and not just a couple of Shinners who are off in Columbia.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed we do not have the Minister fro Public Enterprise here this morning. We are to break for ten days and I do not know what will happen in the intervening period before we return. We have already seen that 35% of Aer Lingus will be sold to private individuals and investors. It is creating tremendous stress and strain on workers, particularly in the west and midwest where the viability of Shannon Airport is key to the life of the region. It is a major issue and we are concerned. Must we now wait for another ten days before we know exactly from the Minister what is happening? All we have to go on are newspaper accounts which are inadequate to our information needs in terms of debating the matter in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister for Public Enterprise does not need to be defended by anybody because she is a very robust politician but it is somewhat unfair constantly to personalise this very serious issue. The Minister, in tandem with the rest of the Government, is doing an excellent job in extremely difficult circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader of the House if he would consider bringing the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to the House in the context of the CLÁR initiative. The Leader himself referred to this because part of his own constituency in Westmeath is included in the selected areas under the social and economic disadvantage criteria that he has launched under CLÁR. It is timely, in the run up to the budget, because of the serious concerns expressed in the areas that are covered by CLÁR as well as other disadvantaged areas that infrastructural developments under the national plan may somehow be curtailed. I re-emphasise and reflect the view of an overwhelming number of us who are waiting for better infrastructure, roads <Col N="534" /> and water and sewerage services, that there cannot be any curtailment of the national development plan because of the economic conditions.</P>
    <P>I refer the Leader to a letter that appeared this week in an edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> from a former civil servant who was responsible for setting up the original county development teams in which he emphasised and pointed out in great detail the reasons the Government should ensure there is greater parity between the regions and that the way to do this is to make sure the national development plan implementation is not in any way curtailed. This is vital to the future prosperity and economic viability of the west, the midlands and those areas of social and economic disadvantage. I plead with the Leader to find time to have a debate and bring the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, who is doing a fine job, to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the large number of calls for debates on various issues in this House, which is very healthy. Many of them come from the Government benches which is even healthier. I wonder why we cannot have those debates. One of the reasons is that, for some extraordinary reason, we are not sitting next week. The Leader owes it to the House to explain that.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>There are numerous subjects on the Order Paper which need to be discussed. There is a large number of calls for debate from Senator Lanigan and other Senators on the Government side and for some reason we are taking a week off. There is no explanation for this. The only explanation I can find is that there is a bank holiday next Monday and that, because there is a bank holiday, we need to take a whole week off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>We are entitled to some sort of privileged week. There is an old-fashioned idea in the Civil Service that people are entitled to a privilege day after a bank holiday. We are extending it to such an extent that we are giving ourselves a week off. The Dáil is also taking a week off and there are 11 Seanad Bills with the Dáil. We should not accept this. We should demand that the Dáil sit to consider the legislation we have sent to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>We are entitled to send a message to the Dáil. They read out a message from the Seanad from time to time. We might put an addendum to suggest that if they sat more often they might be able to consider our legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Leader to answer and not bypass the question. Why is this House not sitting next week? Why is the British ambassador not here answering questions about Sellafield next week? We have the time if he has the time. The Leader has refused several times to answer that question.</P>
      <P>I agree with the people who have said that we should discuss Aer Lingus, this week, next week or the week after, before we all go on holidays for the mid-term break. It is important to clarify what Senator O'Toole said. He said that there is a misconception that trade union leaders are not telling the full truth to their troops. There is nothing new about that &ndash; trade union leaders have never told the full truth to their members. That should not be an aspect to the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Lanigan's call for a debate on Palestine. The situation there is deteriorating day by day. The Israelis are murdering Palestinians and directing their campaign against people while the Palestinians direct their campaign towards the cause. In a similar fashion, in the Six Counties the Nationalist violence was always directed towards a cause while Unionist violence was directed against people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Senator Ross's concerns about having so little time for debate. Last night at the health debate I pointed out that there are numerous reports laid before the House which are never debated. There was no time in two hours to go into most of them.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on maternity services, which was not dealt with last night. Perinatal mortality figures have not been produced since 1993, which is unbelievable. These figures are a combination of stillbirths and infant deaths in the first week of life, the most important of international figures regarding the health of a nation. Developments in maternity services appear in piecemeal fashion with midwifery units set up in various areas and suggestions that Holles Street Hospital move from its present location. It is important to see the plan of the Minister for Health and Children in this area. I hope he will come into the House for the debate.</P>

      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's call, as I supported Senator Cregan's call yesterday, for a debate on the Criminal Assets Bureau. Everybody has hailed the excellent job this body has done. What has happened there is far too serious a matter to be treated lightly. The Leader should take it up with the Minister and request that he come before this House for a proper discussion.</P>
      <P>I also support the calls for a debate on Aer Lingus, encompassing Shannon Airport and its future. This is a matter about which everybody in my part of the country and along the west coast is deeply concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Jackman, Ross and Coghlan have all called for statements in the presence of the Minister. Unfortunately she is not available and sends the message that at the first opportunity she will return to the House to update us on her position. Despite our efforts it was not possible to have this today due to the Aer Lingus problem.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning wished to know when the Committee Stage of the Pensions Bill, 2000, would be taken. It will be at least three weeks and I give an undertaking to have all the amendments before Senator Manning and the spokespersons and leaders of the Opposition before then.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning also spoke of major reforms for the Seanad. The Select Committee will sit immediately after the Order of Business this morning to discuss the matter. Everyone wants an enhanced Seanad. Much of the work done here over the last three or four years, especially legislation which was initiated, has been very welcome.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole, Costello and Coghlan spoke of the Criminal Assets Bureau and events there in recent weeks and I will pass their views on to the Minister. It has been suggested that the relevant legislation be amended to allow for these difficulties. If they are legitimate the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will not hesitate to do this, as we know from experience.</P>
      <P>I will pass on the views of Senators Costello and Norris regarding the person in prison in Thailand to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Senators Lanigan, Norris and Lydon called for a debate on the Middle East. This should happen the week we return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mooney called for a debate on the CLÁR programme. The Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, is in my home town of Castlepollard today and this evening. I share the Senator's views regarding the NDP. Better services, including sewage, roads, water and small industrial units, are needed in the battle to ensure that people in rural areas are able to play their part in the community. As stated yesterday, An Taisce has issued an alarming statement about houses being built in rural areas, which is a serious challenge facing us all as legislators. I welcome the Minister of <Col N="537" /> State's plan and he will be in the House at the earliest opportunity the week after next.</P>
    <P>Senators Ross and Henry spoke of matters on the Order of Business. Over the last three weeks, many calls have been made to have important issues discussed in the House. I have done my utmost and the record will support that. Consistency must be the order of the day. Anyone who <Col N="538" /> wants to see who made the contributions on the Bill before the House yesterday should take a look at the business of the day.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry called for a debate on the maternity services in the presence of the Minister. Time shall be set aside for this.</P>
    <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the Order of Business be agreed to.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to address this House on the issue of homelessness. Homelessness is one of the most important social issues facing us today and tackling it effectively poses an enormous challenge. Despite the healthy state of our economy in recent years, there are still a large number of people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. The assessment of housing needs undertaken in March 1999 indicated that there were more than 5,000 homeless persons. In 1996 the national total of homeless persons was assessed at 2,500. The increase between 1996 and 1999 is not, however, directly comparable because of a broadening of the definition of homelessness. I was anxious to ensure that all sectors were agreed on what we termed &ldquo;homeless&rdquo;. The definition, accepted by everybody broadened the scope and therefore led to a marked increase in the number of those defined as homeless.</P>
      <P>The next assessment of housing needs will take place in March 2002 and we should then have a better picture of the extent of homelessness. It is not the case that all those who were assessed as being homeless are living rough on the streets or staying in emergency hostel accommodation. Some people assessed as being homeless might be residing with friends or relations, but without their own accommodation.</P>
      <P>There is no escaping the fact that there are too many homeless people. The Government is totally committed to dealing with the problem of homelessness and has made considerable improvements in the way the problem is addressed. We now have a more comprehensive approach. In May 2000, I launched the Government's integrated strategy on homelessness, which for the first time provided for a co-ordinated response to homelessness. The strategy recognised that homelessness is not just about a lack of living accommodation, but that the health, care, welfare, education and training needs of homeless persons needed to be addressed in a co-ordinated manner if the problem of homelessness is to be tackled effectively. Unfortunately the lack of living accommodation is not the only problem in the lives of those who are homeless. Health and welfare problems are also widespread and it is essential that these issues are properly addressed as part of the solution to enable homeless people achieve independent living in their own communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key element of the Government's strategy is that homeless action plans are to be drawn up at local level. This is to be done jointly by the local authority, health board and voluntary bodies and will clearly chart the services that exist for homeless persons and outline the services that are <Col N="539" /> needed. Under the action plans these needs will be identified over a three year period and there will be responsibility for providing each service and the funding needed. The plans for Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Kilkenny, Clare, Cavan, Carlow, Meath, Offaly, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow are completed and work is well under way on the plans for other areas. I expect they will be completed shortly.</P>
    <P>While the scope and detail of the action plans will vary, they will make appropriate responses to the level of homelessness in each of their areas. I am satisfied that there is a strong commitment among all the agencies involved to addressing the needs of the homeless. In the past, the position was more a case of leaving homelessness to be dealt with by the voluntary bodies. In fairness to those voluntary bodies, they did a lot with limited resources at their disposal. I take this opportunity to thank the many voluntary organisations which have been involved in this work for their diligence and compassion and for the tremendous results they achieved in difficult circumstances. They now work in co-operation with local authorities and health boards and together they have put in a tremendous amount of time and effort in drawing up these strategies.</P>
    <P>Current funding has already been increased by £6 million per annum to increase bed-night contribution rates to voluntary bodies and to fund other support services such as settlement and outreach services. Additional funding of £6 million has been made available by the Department of Health and Children to fund the provision of in-house care in hostels providing accommodation for homeless people.</P>
    <P>Both the statutory and voluntary sectors have welcomed the Government's strategy for providing, for the first time, an integrated response to homelessness at national and local level. It has been particularly welcomed by the voluntary sector as it recognises the valuable role the sector plays in meeting the needs of homeless persons. The preparation of local action plans directly involves the voluntary sector in the planning, co-ordination and delivery of services to the homeless.</P>
    <P>In addition, the strategy, for the first time, clarified the roles of the local authorities and health boards in the provision of services for homeless persons. Local authorities are responsible for the accommodation needs of homeless persons and for accommodation related services such as settlement and outreach support programmes. Health boards are responsible for the health, care and welfare needs of homeless persons, including the provision of in-house care in hostel accommodation. This is an important clarification of the responsibilities of local authorities and health boards and means it is now clear to both the statutory and voluntary sectors who is responsible for what and who will fund which services. The voluntary bodies have welcomed this clarification. While it may take some time to <Col N="540" /> ensure all the measures in the strategy are firmly established and working effectively, I am anxious to ensure services for homeless persons are improved in the meantime.</P>
    <P>At the same time as local authorities, together with health boards and voluntary bodies, have been working on their action plans, some considerable improvements in services to homeless persons have been implemented. An important example of an immediate improvement is the significant increase, in line with recommendations in the homeless strategy, in funding to many voluntary bodies which provide accommodation and related services for homeless persons. In some areas, settlement and outreach services have been developed to work with homeless persons and assist them into suitable long-term accommodation.</P>
    <P>My Department recoups 90% of the expenditure incurred by local authorities on payments for homeless accommodation. It is expected that expenditure by my Department, through the local authorities, on accommodation and related services for homeless persons will be about £20 million this year, compared to about £12.5 million last year. This represents a sevenfold increase on the £3 million spent in 1997. The current average bed-night payment by local authorities to voluntary bodies is around £10, which represents a significant increase on the previous payment levels to voluntary bodies. The increases have been widely welcomed to assist in operational costs and improve quality standards. The bed-night rate to a voluntary body in the Dublin area, for example, which was £3.30 in 1997, is now £13.</P>
    <P>Another example of an improvement taking place involves Dublin Corporation which has been working with bed and breakfast accommodation providers to improve the quality of accommodation. Anyone who now uses bed and breakfast accommodation in Dublin has 24 hour a day access to it. Security has also been improved at these premises and the residents have access to laundry services. While everyone acknowledges that bed and breakfast accommodation, the use of which will be phased out as part of the homeless strategy, is not the most appropriate type of accommodation for homeless persons, it will continue, of necessity, to be availed of in the absence of other suitable accommodation.</P>
    <P>An important element of the Government's strategy is the provision of additional accommodation and a greater variety of accommodation types to cater for the varying needs of homeless persons, including homeless families. In particular, additional transitional and move on accommodation will be provided to enable people to move out of emergency accommodation, whether bed and breakfast accommodation or hostels, into accommodation more suitable to their needs. Bed and breakfast accommodation to accommodate homeless persons on an emergency basis will be used less and less as alternative accommodation becomes available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" />A key underlying philosophy of the Government's strategy on homelessness is that it is essential homeless people are helped as much as possible back into independent living in the community. This is accepted by all the agencies involved in working with the homeless. It will be possible to achieve this objective with some of those currently homeless. There are, however, quite a number of homeless persons who have been homeless and living in hostel accommodation for long periods and, unfortunately, have become institutionalised to the extent that they are now unable to cope with the demands of independent living in the community. In these cases, the appropriate response is to provide them with sheltered living accommodation. There are some fine examples of excellent sheltered accommodation where the residents are supported in group living arrangements. This type of accommodation is now needed to a significant extent to move homeless people out of emergency hostel accommodation.</P>
    <P>The homeless action plan for the Dublin area was published last May. It represents a comprehensive response to homelessness in Dublin. It must be comprehensive because the greatest concentration of homelessness is located in Dublin, principally between the canals, and the anonymity of the city inevitably attracts homeless persons from other parts of the country. Plans for implementing the measures in the Dublin strategy are well under way and a specially dedicated homeless agency has been established and is now fully functional. The agency's brief is to oversee the delivery of the action plan and co-ordinate the delivery of services to homeless persons by both statutory and voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>The overall aim of the Dublin plan is to eliminate long-term homelessness and the need for people to sleep rough by 2010. This is a challenging goal, but the agency has the capacity and determination to achieve considerable success in meeting this challenge. It will take time. Effective preventive policies and services will be developed in order that the risk of a person or family becoming homeless will be minimal. Where homelessness does occur, the objective is to ensure it is short-term and all people who are homeless will be assisted into housing appropriate to their needs.</P>
    <P>The plan charts ten key measures. These include measures to prevent homelessness; improved access to advice, information and referral services; measures to reduce street homelessness by two thirds; improvements in emergency accommodation through the provision of additional hostel and refuge places; improved settlement and outreach services to enable people to move out of homelessness; additional transitional and long-term housing accommodation; improved access to mental health, counselling and support services; improvements in social welfare and community welfare services for homeless people; the development of access to education, training and job opportunities, and research into <Col N="542" /> the causes of and solutions to homelessness in order to continually improve services. These measures chart a comprehensive way forward.</P>
    <P>The plight of people sleeping rough on our streets is one of the most visible signs of homelessness today. While many claim the number of people sleeping rough is increasing, particularly in Dublin, there are indications that not all the people who appear to be homeless and living rough on the streets are in fact homeless. This has been borne out by the experience gained from a new service introduced in Dublin last Christmas. Dublin Corporation now operates a night time bus service which brings homeless people sleeping on the streets to hostels and other emergency accommodation. While the service has been successful and become an essential part of services to homeless people in the Dublin area, Dublin Corporation has become aware that some people, who have the appearance of being homeless on the streets, are not homeless and mainly on the streets for the purposes of begging. Its operators also come across a number of people who refuse the service being offered. This can happen for a variety of seasons such as a dislike or fear of hostels or the fact that alcohol or drugs are not allowed on the premises.</P>
    <P>These problems need to be addressed and will be addressed as part of the Dublin action plan, particularly through a street outreach service which will work with people sleeping rough. Gaining the confidence of someone sleeping rough and perhaps abusing alcohol or drugs takes time. This is an essential prerequisite to establishing stabilisation measures because there is no quick fix to eliminating street homelessness.</P>
    <P>Long before the Dublin action plan was devised, I recognised the urgent need to address the plight of those people who were sleeping rough. Many of them have chronic health problems resulting in many instances from abuse of alcohol and drugs. The Government had no hesitation in agreeing to my proposal to have two high support hostels provided for homeless drug and alcohol users. The Minister for Finance provided £5 million in his 2000 budget for this purpose. It is a matter of considerable regret to me that these services have not yet been established in the Dublin area. Dublin Corporation and the homeless agency have, for some time, been trying to source suitable premises for these hostels without success. However, a site has now been secured where it is proposed to provide medium to long-term high support accommodation for street drinkers where they will be able to drink in a controlled environment. These hostels are called wet hostels. Care and support services will also be available in the hostel to help them get back into a more stable lifestyle. Dublin Corporation and the homeless agency are still trying to source a suitable site for the second hostel but are finding it extremely difficult to secure a suitable premises without the prospect of meeting significant local objections.</P>
    <P>Everyone has a role to play in ensuring that the <Col N="543" /> most vulnerable in our society are provided with the accommodation and support they require and in this regard I hope I can count on the support of Senators at local level to ensure that accommodation for homeless persons is provided and supported. A range of accommodation for homeless persons is currently being developed or has been provided recently. Extensions are being built onto existing transitional and long-term accommodation at Maple House in the city centre and the Dublin Simon sheltered accommodation facility on the North Circular Road. Respond, a voluntary housing association, is developing a major facility on the north side of Dublin, while the Society of St. Vincent de Paul is developing another sheltered facility on the south side. A youth Foyer project is being built in Marrowbone Lane. All these facilities will provide much needed long-term sheltered accommodation for homeless persons. These developments will enable homeless persons to move to accommodation that is more suitable to their needs and will also free up spaces in emergency accommodation.</P>
    <P>I have focused to a considerable extent on homelessness in Dublin because this is where the greatest extent of homelessness occurs. It is the case, however, that there is homelessness in almost every part of the country to varying extents and measures are being taken to address it more comprehensively.</P>
    <P>In Cork, there is a wide range of emergency accommodation and referral services for homeless persons in place. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Cork Simon Community operate emergency accommodation. These services will be expanded and enhanced through the Cork action plan. As a first step, Cork Corporation is in the process of providing transitional accommodation to assist homeless persons move out of emergency accommodation.</P>
    <P>In Galway, my home city, a range of accommodation and services for homeless persons is provided by the COPE umbrella organisation, Galway Simon and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. These services have improved dramatically since 1997 and now include resettlement services and a range of transitional and supported housing. In addition, Galway Corporation last year purchased a building for use as emergency accommodation for homeless women and children. When renovated, it will provide much needed facilities for women and children in Galway as existing facilities are very limited. The building is already in use. Approval has also been given for a liaison worker to undertake a pilot project to assist homeless women back into independent living and back into the workforce. This is a good example of an integrated approach to homelessness, where all the needs of the person, not just accommodation, are catered for.</P>
    <P>In Limerick, a new Foyer accommodation facility is to be built shortly. This facility will provide supported housing for young adults while at <Col N="544" /> the same time providing training courses for them. Limerick Corporation has acquired two buildings which it intends to develop to provide additional accommodation for homeless persons. In Waterford and Drogheda, settlement services have been established to assist homeless persons back into independent living. This is just a snapshot of some of the additional services for homeless persons which have been developed in recent years or are now coming on stream.</P>
    <P>In our efforts to break the cycle of homelessness we must also invest in prevention strategies because if we do not do so, we will always be dealing with the symptoms rather than the causes. As part of the overall homeless strategy, the Government gave a commitment to prepare a preventative strategy to tackle key groups at risk of homelessness. In particular, those leaving institutional care, whether custodial or health related, are very much at risk of being homeless. This equally applies to young people leaving care for the first time. The Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children, and Education and Science, have prepared individual strategies and they have been co-ordinated into one overall strategy under the auspices of the cross-departmental team on homelessness. I intend to publish this strategy very shortly.</P>
    <P>The strategy will contain measures to prevent homelessness among adult offenders, young offenders, those leaving mental health facilities and acute hospitals, and young people leaving care. The main theme throughout the strategy will be the need to ensure that no one is released from any type of State care without appropriate measures being in place to ensure that they have a suitable place to live with the necessary supports, if needed. A comprehensive strategy on youth homelessness will be published next week by the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, who has responsibility for children.</P>
    <P>There have been some real improvements in accommodation and services for homeless persons and we will continue to see these improvements as the local action plans are finalised and implemented. The Government has set out a clear framework and there is a genuine willingness all round to tackle homelessness. I hope the fundamental groundwork that has been laid will secure an effective and lasting response to homelessness. I believe I can count on the support of this House for the measures which have been taken and I very much welcome the interest of the House in this very important national issue.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State has used semantics in his speech in an effort to diminish the problem. He said that the numbers have not really doubled, but by changing the wording there are now more people defined as homeless. I say that it is the reverse, the numbers have doubled since 1996 and as a result of that, the definitions encompass them. This is the reality of the situation, the numbers have simply doubled.</P>
      <P>Since last October there has been a 60% increase in the numbers of those sleeping rough in the Dublin Corporation area. That cannot be changed by semantics. That is a fact. The measure of the humanity of any nation is how it treats the people at the lowest level. Those people do not vote because without a permanent address they are disenfranchised. Without a vote they have no voice. We must be their voice. It seems to be a case of taking them away and hiding them. The reality is much wider than the position the Minister of State described.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has not taken responsibility. He spoke about Galway and he is very familiar with that city. The local authorities there have done great work lately. To update the Minister of State, last Monday the corporation agreed an extension of 13 rooms to the hostel for homeless women. That is not true of every local authority. An action plan was demanded from 30 local authorities and to date only ten have been submitted. It is the responsibility of the Minister of State to ensure that those action plans are introduced, and again he has failed in that regard.</P>
      <P>Last November the figure for people sleeping rough in Dublin was 202. Those sleeping in bed and breakfast accommodation numbered 1,200. There are at present 700 beds and the next official census will not be held until 2002. The figures have increased dramatically over the past few years and by 2002 they will be frightening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ask ourselves what is the best way to solve the problem. This is a complex problem because the reasons people are homeless are diverse. Young people who are homeless generally come from homes where there is incest, violence, drug taking or criminal activity. To solve the problem of homeless is not that easy. Everybody agrees that the solution must go back to the community because if it does not, the young people concerned will driven from their communities into city centres. As the Minister of State is aware and any Member who has sense knows, city centres are where most of the drug taking happens and where there is ready access to drugs. The young people concerned are driven from their communities to an area in which it is much easier to partake in prostitution, criminal activity and drug taking. We must go back to the community to help to solve the problem of homeless. The approach to solving this problem must be case managed and multidisciplinary. Anyone involved in the care of the homeless in voluntary or statutory bodies will tell one that the problem is solvable. It will not be solved, however, by throwing <Col N="546" /> money at it, but by a common sense approach and the allocation of money.</P>
    <P>We are not living in Calcutta. This is not Rio de Janeiro. In this age of the so-called Celtic tiger, to use that awful term, it is a sad reflection on all of us that people are sleeping rough in our country. I read an article recently by the Jesuit priest, Fr. Peter McVerry, in which he brings home the reality of the situation. When we pass someone sleeping on the street we feel we must step around them, ignore them or feel abhorrence, pity and regret about their situation. All are natural reactions. Fr. McVerry wrote that he stopped to listen to what a homeless man had to say. He said to the man that he was from County Tipperary to which the man replied he was and how did he know. Fr. McVerry said he had recognised the accent and talked to him for a while. When leaving the man reached down and picked up money that had been thrown to him and said, &ldquo;Thank you, Father. This is from the people who don't care.&rdquo; That was a telling remark. People who do not care throw money at the homeless and it is a case of out of sight, out of mind.</P>
    <P>Fr. McVerry wrote that we must restore dignity to the people concerned, that we must believe that they have a role to play and assist them in playing it. We must intervene at the earliest possible moment to try to prevent them from leaving their communities. Local gardaí will know the families involved and their circumstances, as will social workers who will be on a first name basis with them and, perhaps, able to prevent them from leaving home and assist them in turning towards a way of life that would give them some dignity. The Government has failed to do this.</P>
    <P>It well worth our while to thank voluntary groups such as St. Vincent de Paul and the Simon Community which have done such work on a voluntary basis during the years, often without any or very little assistance, and often highlighted facts to politicians and forced them to take action. We often forget the work of these voluntary groups. There are people in statutory bodies who see their work as a nine to five job and there are those in employment in social welfare who have sincere sympathy for the people with whom they deal. We must always remember those who, on a voluntary basis, have looked after someone whom we forgot to look after.</P>
    <P>There are a number of recommendations, some of which the Government is implementing, but there are others that the Minister of State must make. He will have to focus on those and say that the Government will end homelessness within a particular period. He needs to set a target date and say that we can do so within that period. We know how to do it. There have been enough reports on homelessness. We have all the material we need. We know the causes of the problem and the answers to solving it. The answers are there if the Minister of State was to really concentrates on the problem. If the Government is concerned about those at the lowest level in our society, this problem could be solved within ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on the subject of homelessness. I am pleased a Senator asked that this session be set aside to discuss it. My colleague, Senator Coogan, referred to the fact that I would deal mainly with Dublin issues.</P>
      <P>With respect to the Minister of State, his speech is an aspirational work of fiction, a fairytale of Dublin rather than a fairytale of New York. I attend an advice centre every Monday morning and I am beginning to call it a &ldquo;lack of advice centre&rdquo;. The only people I have seen for the past year and a half are generally young homeless women. I had the experience during the summer months of trying to get a young mother who was sleeping in a hedge in a field &ndash; not in rural Ireland, but in Dublin &ndash; into accommodation. I am very disappointed at the lack of movement from the homeless agency. I paid great attention to what the Minister of State said and all I heard him speak of were measures, strategies and proposals, but nothing concrete. If anything, the situation in Dublin is critical.</P>
      <P>An amazing thing happened to a young couple who came to see me. They are the parents of two children and decided to marry. When they got married the wife lost her single mother's book. As her husband was on a CE scheme, they lost a large portion of their rent allowance. They are homeless because they got married. It is a strange country, is it not? The reason I speak about them is that the husband is not allowed into the same hostel as his wife and their two children. The thinking that prevails in situations such as this must be examined. Somebody should be shot for making decisions such as that.</P>
      <P>This is probably one of the most complex issues. Years ago families appeared to be stable. If they were not, they kept it well hidden. There was no such thing as a 12 year old opting out and going to live on the streets.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the ignoring or closing of eyes, hearts and minds to what is out there and plain to see. How can I know all about this? How can I know that in my council area there are 91 homeless people on the housing list? They are all priority cases, but none of them has a hope of being housed for about a year and a half because we have 4,800 on the ordinary housing waiting list. Somebody is telling porky pies, to put it nicely, or what has happened is that social change has come so rapidly that social problems have emerged under our noses.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is the man who has the job of dealing with the issue. As a tenth, 11th or 12th generation Dubliner, I am ashamed of my city. I am ashamed to pass homeless people on our streets. I do not agree with what Fr. McVerry wrote in his article. People give money because they feel so helpless to do anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea that we will all provide homeless accommodation in our areas is an excellent one. If necessary, public consultation should be done away with in order to put people into shelter. We are talking about a basic human right, shelter. I <Col N="548" /> cannot understand the reason everyone is waking up to this now. Why will there be a three yearly review of the problem when the numbers of homeless are growing daily? </P>
    <P>I cannot understand the reason the cold weather hostel in Dublin is closed every year in April when the tropical weather arrives, and in case Members did not notice, it lasts until October. That ridiculous situation prevails regardless of the weather. This affects the very men about whom the Minister of State spoke, those who appear to have alcohol and other lifestyle problems.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak to the Minister of State. I wish he would return to the House to give Members an update on the current situation with regard to the provision of accommodation by the homeless agency. All I see is a plethora of advisers, agencies and reports. I will still turn people away next Monday morning and tell them I cannot help them in any way.</P>
    <P>I do not know when the Minister of State last received a report on bed and breakfast accommodation, but nobody is being sent to such accommodation at present. People are being sent to hostels and separated from their husbands and partners. Hostels are not nice places to live. The bed and breakfast option would be wonderful if it was true.</P>
    <P>The current situation is, to put it mildly, Dickensian. It is a scandal and a national shame that people are living like this in a burgeoning economy. The issue should be tackled. I agree with the Minister of State that the local authority is the place to start. There is no point sending somebody from the back end of Clondalkin to the North Circular Road, which involves getting two buses, to bring their children to school. I often wonder if anybody has bothered to talk to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about this issue and I am trying to do something about it. The Minister of State is aware he will receive the support of the House for practical measures that will become operational, but not for fantasy forecasts of what might or could happen at some stage, before we all die.</P>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire. It is evident from the Minister of State's statement that there is a comprehensive plan to tackle the problem of homelessness. It is also evident that this is underpinned by a personal sense of compassion on the part of the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that homelessness is a great scourge. It removes the individual's dignity and hope. The nature and definition of homelessness have changed. It is an organic problem; one does not reach the end of it. Nobody can define the categories who will fall into homelessness or claim to be able to solve that aspect of the problem. Members will remember from their schooldays the nostalgic and sentimental poem, An Old Woman of the Roads, by Padraic Colum. We can <Col N="549" /> recall its heartfelt sentiments. The woman would like to have the security of a home and describes what that means to her. The poem is imagery from other days, but the basic problem is still the same for the individual.</P>
    <P>Changes in society have exacerbated, to a large extent, the problem of homelessness. During the years I have watched many television documentaries on the subject, documentaries which were made in both this country and abroad, particularly Britain. These documentaries gave an incisive understanding of what homelessness meant. The image was not always that of the old bag lady who gathered all her worldly possessions in plastic bags and pushed them from place to place in a cart or pram. We realised that many of the homeless were young people who came from affluent families, but, due to pressures in society, peer pressure or pressure in the home, decided to leave home and no longer had any contact with it.</P>
    <P>I have spoken on the issue of missing persons no longer in contact with their families on several occasions in the Seanad. One need only look in bus and railway stations and on the poles outside this House to see posters appealing for information on such people. Some of the names are easy to remember because I have been looking at them for the last 12 months to two years. We do not know whether the people concerned are alive or dead, whether they are homeless or whether anybody is looking after them. There are exceptionally large numbers of these people and it is evident that many of them come from well off homes. It is not, therefore, a matter of them being deprived in a social or economic sense. There are other social issues involved.</P>
    <P>I have visited the United States virtually every year for the last 30 years. On my first visit in the late 1960s and early 1970s I could never understand when I saw people lying on the side of the road the reason nobody would stop to help them or find out what their problems were. I began to realise that this was the lack of compassion which sometimes accompanies affluence. There is also the element of people not wanting to &ldquo;get involved&rdquo;. I could never imagine the same thing happening in Ireland, but it has. People will look at deprived people on the street, but not stop to help. Those who were prepared to help, the religious orders, have been denigrated and demonised. They were always available to help. They would identify the problem cases and find locations for them. They were prepared to help through their personal service, commitment and dedication, but that is no longer available.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State correctly pointed out that he was successful in sourcing the necessary finances, not just finance for the usual cases of homelessness. Many of the difficulties arise from drug and alcohol abuse and often the people concerned do not want help for various reasons. Perhaps they are claustrophobic about hospital conditions or could not imagine themselves going into a drug free zone. Even in those cases, the <Col N="550" /> Minister of State came up with answers. It is a pity that where the finance was provided in Dublin it was not used urgently and that the type of hostel which the Minister of State had envisaged was not put in place to help those cases. After all, they are the cases who will continue to sit on the bridges of Dublin.</P>
    <P>An effort was made to carry out a fire brigade action by providing a night transport service for people sitting on the street, the recipients of our sympathy at a distance as another Member described it. Again, it was discovered that many of the people at whom this service was directed did not avail of it. In some cases, the people concerned were not homeless, but simply begging on the streets. However, even the most immediate problem of people requiring help and assistance on a given night has been attended to.</P>
    <P>We need to look into our hearts. Dublin is considered to be a difficult area because of the size of the population and the number of homeless people and the fact that the city will attract homeless people because of the promise of anonymity. We should appeal to Senators to provide leadership in their communities on this issue. It is easy to point fingers, but let us look into our hearts and examine if we have responded in a meaningful way to the difficulties which exist. Dublin Corporation has been to the fore in many ways, but in other parts of Dublin, in the greater county area, the first signal we get when we attempt to do something is that somebody is going to object. What is the reason for objecting? The people are not going to be discommoded and there is no immediate threat to the community. However, for some strange reason, the shutters are drawn down, compassion goes out the door and there is no effort to consolidate goodwill within the community.</P>
    <P>It behoves every public representative who will talk about the needs of the homeless and the need for compassion to have the courage to put their head above the parapet and provide leadership. Often that is all a community requires. If there is no leadership, it is left to the scaremongerers to claim the community will change and that people of disreputable character will be put in its midst. That is not a Christian attitude, or community minded. Above all, in the long term it will exacerbate the difficulty. Anybody who thinks one can simply turn a blind eye to this problem and expect it to go away or to be pushed into somebody else's area is wrong.</P>
    <P>An effort has been made in most smaller towns and communities to adopt a partnership approach to solving this problem. Local representatives do not seek headlines in local newspapers by reacting to minority representations that have been made. They are prepared to provide leadership in their own right. Similarly, communities generally indicate a willingness, within reason, to respond and to help.</P>
    <P>In 90% of cases, homelessness has nothing to do with people of a disreputable orientation. <Col N="551" /> Homeless people are those who are unfortunate enough, for social, economic or other reasons, not to have a roof over their heads. Addressing this problem is not as simple as coming up with a plan and providing the finance to implement it. We may have to look beyond the issue of homelessness, at the social problems we discuss in this Chamber every day on the Order of Business and when we discuss legislation.</P>
    <P>Every Senator admits that the serious problems of society are increasing. The levels of discipline and control that once applied to young people no longer apply, by and large. Using our affluence to provide money for young people often pushes them away as we saw recently in the terrible cases of those who died after losing contact with their families. Young people may become involved in crime or other misdemeanours.</P>
    <P>Homelessness is a serious problem about which Senators should unite, irrespective of politics, location or ideology. Instead of pointing fingers, we should try to help in any way we can. This can only be done if more voluntary agencies are brought on board. Compliments have rightly been paid to groups like the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Simon Community of Ireland and I wish to add the religious orders to that list. All voluntary groups, including community based organisations whose main brief is not in the area of homelessness, can help fight this problem. I come from Cashel, a town with a population of 3,000. There are 37 community organisations in Cashel, including meals on wheels, the Legion of Mary and the GAA. There is a great deal of goodwill among those who work for such organisations. They often have a finger on the pulse and can spot problems before they are publicly manifested. We need to bring such groups on board.</P>
    <P>Resources are important but we must also ensure that adequate accommodation is provided. When I was a member of Cashel Urban District Council I was involved with the housing priority list. The biggest danger for those on the list was that they might lose their priority place, but that is no longer the case in most towns as there has been a huge improvement in the provision of public housing. Interim accommodation arrangements can also pose a problem. We should not view accommodation in hostels or in bed and breakfasts as the end of the road. Advisory and counselling services should be provided to see if people can be brought back to their homes, where their parents want them to be. This debate should focus on helping homeless people to regain their lives and reinstate their hopes, not in temporary accommodation but in places where they can be established permanently.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the Minister's statement, fair minded people cannot say that all aspects of homelessness, including recent difficulties, have not been addressed, that homeless people have not been helped and that resources have not been provided. It is a big issue and there is no point in saying that a line can be drawn under certain <Col N="552" /> measures to represent a solution. Homelessness is an organic difficulty which must be seen in the greater context of social changes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I listened to his speech in my office. He has suffered a barrage of criticism on this side of the House, but that is politics. The criticism reflects, however, the feeling that there is an urgent need to address the problem directly and specifically. I take comfort from certain aspects of the Minister of State's speech, but I am sure he will agree that a great deal remains to be done.</P>
      <P>It is pleasing that the problem of homelessness will benefit from substantial budgetary increases in the next few years. The effect of an enlargement of funding over five years, for example, from £10 million to £20 million, may be reduced by inflation and increases in the cost of providing services, especially in the fifth year. The Minister of State mentioned a plan that charts ten key measures, one of which deals with the goal of a 66% reduction in street homelessness. Is that a pious aspiration or a clearly defined target for which mechanisms have been put in place? The Simon Community of Ireland, which supplied me with an excellent briefing, has refused to co-operate with the Government in some areas because it failed to receive a clear targeted commitment to reduce homelessness by 50%. There seems to be some conflict or confusion between the statements. I am also pleased to see that Dublin Corporation operates a night bus service, bringing people sleeping on the streets to hostels, which is a good and decent initiative.</P>
      <P>Homelessness is a huge problem. I plan to rely heavily in my speech on the briefing I received from the Simon Community as the figures it contains make stark reading. A survey carried out in Dublin in October 2000 showed a 60% increase in rough sleepers since 1997, despite Government claims during the last four years. A national local authority tri-annual count showed that the numbers of homeless people doubled between 1996, when there were 2,501 such people, and 1999, when there were 5,234. The next tri-annual count, due in 2002, will undoubtedly show a further spectacular increase. Experience in the United Kingdom suggests that the figures may underestimate the problem as the nature of such counts leads to inaccuracies. According to the local authority count, two thirds of homelessness occurs in Dublin, which is a pretty shocking indictment of the capital. There is a strong possibility, however, that the figure underestimates the incidence of homelessness outside Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one breaks down the numbers, a second problem emerges, that of causal factors. It is disturbing to note the increasing incidence of people on the streets because of mental illness. The Simon Community in Cork found last year that 40% of people using its emergency services suffer from some form of mental illness. It is disturbing that the majority of mentally ill people on the streets of Cork were found to be taking medi<Col N="553" /> cation without medical supervision. The Simon Community in Dublin found this year that 50% of homeless people in the capital are mentally unwell. In 2000, a report of the Royal College of Surgeons independently showed that 64% of people using shelters in Dublin could be mentally ill.</P>
    <P>The high incidence of mental illness and homelessness, especially compared to European experience &ndash; there is a substantial difference between the experience in Ireland and other European countries &ndash; is related to the lack of community care services to support mentally unwell people in their own homes, the inappropriate discharge of people from hospitals and the shortage of supported housing or housing with in-house support located in the community.</P>
    <P>An extremely high proportion of homeless people were in care and under the protection of the State when they were children. This is another reproach to society in that we were given responsibility for looking after these people until a certain age but they were then turned into the street in a condition that meant they were ill-equipped to deal with the problems of living rough and no proper shelter was provided for them. This is worrying, particularly in the context of incidents in industrial schools about which we know already where children were mistreated, abused and sent out without resources into a world with which they had great difficulty coping.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Murchú mentioned the St. Vincent de Paul Society and the religious system. I pay tribute to the work of Focus Ireland and Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy whose work has been remarkable. They carried out a survey in 2000 which found that two years after leaving care, 68% of people who stayed with the health board had experienced homelessness and that 65% of the special school population had been in a place of detention or prison. This suggests that something is wrong with the system.</P>
    <P>People have great difficulty accessing private rented sector and local authority housing. Supplementary welfare allowance claimants find that accommodation is extremely difficult to find. Landlords obviously do not want to get involved in that market. They prefer people who pay market rents and health board nominees. Homeless people are predominantly single. This means they do not even have the support and cherishing nurture of companionship. Some 70% of homeless people in Dublin are single and when one puts all these figures together, one gets a picture of catastrophe. It is representative of a person who was in the care of the State as a child and then moved onto the streets. He or she is mentally ill and without the support of a loving relationship. This is a devastating picture of isolation.</P>
    <P>Such people are difficult to deal with and I temper any criticism of the Department &ndash; I am trying to be constructive &ndash; with a realisation that each case is unique. When we were located in Kildare House, a homeless woman slept on the steps of the lobby in a cardboard box. Senator <Col N="554" /> Ryan and I tried to do something for her but she did not want to go to any other place. She wanted to be outside so all we could do for her at Christmas was to get her a couple of decent blankets. I do not know where she is now but she did not want to go anywhere else at that time.</P>
    <P>The Government has produced a cross-departmental report called Homelessness &ndash; An Integrated Strategy. Every local authority is also bound to produce a report. Some authorities have produced their reports but, according to Simon, they are a mixed bag. To date, only ten local authorities have finished their plans. Some of them, including those by Dublin, Limerick and Clare, are very good but others, including Wicklow and Kilkenny, are very bad. They avoid making specific recommendations and there is a strong feeling that they were done only so the authority could be seen to be going through the motions &ndash; preparing the report would get them off the hook.</P>
    <P>A homeless agency has been set up in Dublin but it has made a slow start. The closure of the Charles Street centre has also caused difficulties. It has left a hole in the services in Dublin that has not been filled. In terms of what needs to be done, the Government report, Homelessness &ndash; An Integrated Strategy, should be implemented in full. A national target should be set in the national anti-poverty strategy to reduce homelessness by 50%. Perhaps the Minister of State will indicate if that is covered by the statement that the Government intends to reduce street homelessness by two thirds. This may or may not be a pious aspiration, which is why I referred to it early in my contribution. Will the Minister of State give a commitment to set a target in the national anti-poverty strategy to reduce homelessness by 50%? There is also a need to review the Housing Act, 1980. This empowers rather than requires local authorities to look after homeless people. The Act should be strengthened along European norms and health boards should be required to produce a strategy to meet the health needs of the homeless.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin Simon street count 2000, the total number of rough sleepers in central Dublin for the week 15 to 21 October 2000 was 202 people. This represents an increase of 60% on the street count of 8 to 14 December 1997 and a 36% increase on the street count of June 1998. There are more rough sleepers in Dublin than the combined figures for Oxford, which had 52, Manchester, which had 44, Birmingham, which had 43, Nottingham, which had 31 and Liverpool, which had 30. The number of people sleeping rough in Dublin is greater than the combined total for Oxford, Manchester, Birmingham, Nottingham and Liverpool. This is not something about which we as a society can be happy.</P>
    <P>According to the latest UK homeless network street monitor count in January 1999, the number of rough sleepers in central Dublin was more than two thirds of the number of rough sleepers in central London &ndash; 302. There is another tragic reality <Col N="555" /> underneath that figure because a huge proportion of the homeless people in London are Irish. The total number of males sleeping rough was 163, or 81% of the total, while 8% of rough sleepers were aged under 18 years. Some 22% were aged between 19 and 25 years while 62% were aged between 26 and 50 years. Some 8% were aged over 50 years. The declining percentage is due to the fact that many of them die. I am sure that again this Christmas there will be stories in the newspapers about people dying in central Dublin. Some 94% of rough sleepers said they would take accommodation if it was available to them. There is a lack of movement on the issue of accommodation. There is a lack of emergency accommodation and adequate community care provisions.</P>
    <P>People who are mentally ill and homeless should be regarded first as mentally ill. Putting a homeless label on them does not trigger additional services or provision. That should be adopted as a principle &ndash; I am glad the Minister of State's adviser is nodding his head. That may be something on which we agree or it may just be something he has heard before because Simon has made that submission.</P>
    <P>Services for the mentally ill should be free from catchment constraints. This would avoid the problem of people being caught in margins and borders, which is not good. A report by the Eastern Health Board stated that the in-patient treatment needs of the homeless mentally ill ideally should be provided by a centralised service rather than devolved to catchment area services to ensure there is no fragmentation of service delivery. This recommendation was made five years ago but nothing has happened. Action should be taken on it.</P>
    <P>There is a further recommendation that the homeless service user should be assessed in terms of individual needs. This is obvious in view of the high rate of mental illness. It means that each person is unique. Another recommendation relates to the provision of sufficient residential treatment places for drug addicts and alcoholics. They are specifically difficult people and I agree with the Minister of State that the NIMBY syndrome often arises in this regard because people do not want them. This could be addressed by the Government ensuring there is a proper spread. I welcome these developments but I have more than a sufficiency of them around the north inner city. There would be less resistance if there was a fair spread of these institutions.</P>
    <P>The health boards should enter into dialogue with prisons and hospitals about the premature discharge of people who have difficulty coping with life on the streets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire agus molaim é as ucht an iarracht atá á dhéanamh aige chun an ábhar tábhachtach seo a réiteach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussing this topic I am reminded of a visit I made to New York about ten years ago. I was invited by some relatives to take the Circle Line, <Col N="556" /> a boat trip around the island of Manhattan that leaves from Pier 49 in New York. While we were waiting on the boat for the trip to commence, I noticed a large number of temporary buildings some distance away. I saw people moving around and taking showers in cardboard structures. When I inquired about it, my relatives told me it was a large congregation of homeless people who did not get any support from the state. They were embarrassed and said they had hoped I would not notice it. As Senator Norris said, any of us who travel to London from time to time often see people sleeping in cardboard boxes in doorways. It is important to remember that homelessness is a global phenomenon. It is not only a matter for the Third World, but for the western world. We judge society by the initiatives we take to try to resolve it. While it will always probably be with us, it is the responsibility of the State and any caring society to take steps to ensure it is minimised and that every effort is made to try to eradicate it. That will require a continuous effort.</P>
    <P>The contribution the Minister of State has made since he came to office in 1997 has been remarkable. People spoke eloquently about homelessness, but they failed to implement a coherent strategy to address it. The establishment of an interdepartmental team to investigate and report on the issue, which subsequently gave rise to the integrated strategy in May last year to co-ordinate the efforts of all statutory and voluntary organisations, was a significant step in adopting a comprehensive and positive approach to the issue. It is appropriate to use the local authorities to implement that strategy and investigate gaps in the service. It is also appropriate to conduct a periodic review of the strategy and its success every three years. The establishment of the homeless agency is another important step. I also welcome the provision of social and care workers and the intention to move away from bed and breakfast accommodation.</P>
    <P>The contribution of the voluntary organisations was mentioned by many speakers and I share the laudatory remarks about them. I am a firm believer in a republican society. It is not just the responsibility of the State to provide social services. Everyone, whether it is private individuals or voluntary organisations, has a responsibility to harness their energies. The best results are often achieved by a combination of both public and voluntary effort. We have seen exceptionally good examples of this in practice.</P>
    <P>Youth homelessness is more of a problem in cities than in rural areas. Our changing lifestyles and greater affluence mean that drink and drugs are widely available. This leads to all types of social problems, including homelessness. People may find themselves in circumstances beyond their control and may not be able to provide accommodation for themselves. It is significant that some of the reports which have been published show that most of those at risk are people who have been institutionalised. I am talking about people who have been in the care of the <Col N="557" /> State and in long-term health care, particularly in mental institutions, children in care, and those who have been in prison, which seems to be the category most at risk. If we subscribe fully to the republican ethos which underpins our democratic system, it behoves us all to play our part to reduce or eradicate the problem.</P>
    <P>While homelessness is predominantly an urban problem, it also occurs in rural areas. I have noticed in my local authority area that there is a quick response to family homelessness, which often occurs as a result of domestic violence that is, unfortunately, a feature of our society. However, local authorities are often not as quick to address the problem of individuals who are homeless. It is important not to become judgmental. People who have problems or feel alienated from society are often prisoners of their own environment and if we become judgmental, it will not help to address the issue.</P>
    <P>Many initiatives have been taken under the current strategy. Focus Ireland, to which Senator Norris referred, the Simon Community and St. Vincent de Paul do exceptionally good work. It is important that we move away from temporary bed and breakfast accommodation because that only addresses the person's night time accommodation needs. They do not have the succour or support of a family or community environment during the day. The establishment of coffee shops where people can get food and advice is important. I also welcome the establishment of a crisis desk, which is run by Focus Ireland and provides information on accommodation.</P>
    <P>The provision by the health boards of day care centres for the elderly is a positive step in terms of geriatric care. I also welcome their introduction in this area. We should extend such services, particularly for the young. It may be more difficult in the future to remedy the problems of people who are alienated from society at a young age. The establishment of day care centres for young people in major urban areas where they can interact with their peers and get assistance from social or care workers who will make adjustments to their way of life will make a significant contribution to their quality of life and their reintegration into society.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation deserves recognition for its initiatives and efforts in this regard. Senator Ridge mentioned the lack of activity in this area. It is important to extend the activities of Dublin Corporation into the neighbouring South Dublin County Council, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and Fingal County Council in order that the beneficial effects of the initiatives and efforts are felt across the city.</P>
    <P>However, the outreach service which involves people travelling around the city at night giving advice to homeless persons and liaising with the Garda, health boards and hostels is to be welcomed. If these services are resourced inroads will be made in reducing the number of homeless people which is, as the Minister of State has rightly acknowledged, at an unacceptable level. <Col N="558" /> The initiatives that have been taken are a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>All of us have a responsibility in society. Ireland has a great tradition of family support but, unfortunately, as society has become more affluent some of the values which sustained us in the past have been eroded. The provision of sheltered accommodation and family support is fundamental to resolving and reducing homelessness. I compliment the Minister of State on the various initiatives he has taken. He has worked extremely hard on this issue since taking office and I support him in his continuing efforts to reduce the effects of this blight on society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach seo freisin. I welcome the thrust of the debate thus far and I concur with a number of points made by Senator Walsh. Having a place to go is a basic issue for people but that is not always the case in Drogheda. I am not happy with the regulations that apply in regard to homelessness and I am not convinced local authority officials are the best people to deal with this issue. Community welfare offices have a long history and tradition of contact with homeless people and their families. They acquire a fabulous amount of knowledge and information to which local authorities are not privy and, in the absence of such knowledge, local authority officials face a quandary and sometimes make decisions with which I do not agree.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, people have a habit of approaching public representatives at 4.30 p.m. on a Friday rather than on a Monday morning when we would have the entire week to work with them. I have called the Department of the Environment and Local Government regarding the provision of money and accommodation to individuals and whether they can be helped.</P>
      <P>For example, last week a recovering alcoholic who used to live with his mother approached me. He had lived rough for a while but then entered Cluain Mhuire and was well looked after. He returned to Drogheda and sought accommodation. He could not get a place to stay because many landlords would not accept rent allowance payments from the health board. This is major issue. Advertisements are placed in newspapers which explicitly state rent allowance payments will not be accepted. I do not know whether that is legal. Such an advertisement is discriminatory and it should be unlawful for a landlord to refuse to accept rent allowance as payment. Perhaps one of the Minister of State's officials will examine this issue. However, the man could not get a flat because the promise of cash from the health board was not good enough. He then approached the local authority saying he was homeless and had nowhere to stay but the officials told him he should go back to his mother and friends. That is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Judgments cannot be made about homeless people in cases such as this, as Senator Walsh said. If their relationships with family and friends <Col N="559" /> have been broken they cannot go home, even if three or four family members are living in the area. More help is needed to address such cases. The man in the case to which I referred will present himself to me again later this week. Hopefully, he will have been accommodated in the meantime but the local authority should have recognised he was homeless and put him up in bed and breakfast accommodation for a number of days.</P>
    <P>Money is another significant issue. Couples who have children and are forced to move out of their parents' homes do not have money. Local authorities should provide them with a lump sum, say £300, to give them a start but instead the money is used to provide bed and breakfast accommodation. Last week it cost the local authority £700 to keep one family in such accommodation in Drogheda. This money would have been better utilised if the family had been set up in semi-permanent accommodation with proper support services.</P>
    <P>Local authorities and health boards do not engage in integrated planning and they do not interact enough. When I deal with homeless cases, I first call the housing officer, then the community welfare officer and, if necessary, the Department in Dublin. A one stop shop should be provided where the local authority and health board officials would come together. Both sets of officials are often not fully aware of what is going on in various cases, although another problem is created by people not telling them the truth. I fought hard on behalf of one person but subsequently discovered he was not using the money he was being given for accommodation and that he kept moving around. Specially trained social workers are needed to deal with families, single people and people suffering from alcohol and drug abuse who seek short-term accommodation. Putting people up for a night or a week is not enough and an integrated approach is needed.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase in the number of families breaking up and in the majority of cases the mother and children remain in the family home while the father stays in a flat or on the street. Many of these men are in their thirties, forties or fifties when this happens and they become cut off from society very quickly. They have no contact with their families, sometimes as a result of court orders, and they have no place to go to regain contact with their families. Designated areas are necessary where separated families can meet. It is important that men in this position can maintain contact with their children. Many children are unhappy because when they meet their fathers they have to walk the streets or go into pubs because their fathers have nowhere to bring them. A designated area where families can come together is a good concept.</P>
    <P>Homelessness is being addressed and significant funding is being provided but, at the end of the day, much more needs to be done. An integrated approach between local authorities and <Col N="560" /> health boards must be fine tuned. I am not satisfied enough is being done in this regard. We have no right to make judgments on homeless people. We have an obligation to deal with their needs as they are presented to us in so far as they are honest about them. Health boards have a great deal of information that is not used. I am in contact with community welfare officers and they know the families involved in homeless cases much better than anybody else. They are in daily or weekly contact with them and they are the best judges of the cases. Dividing responsibilities is a waste of time because if the local authority will not help, one must approach the health board. The health board can help in some circumstances but not in others. Let us clear up this problem.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately when crises arise on Friday or Saturday nights, people do not know where to call or what to do. We need to publish a freephone number in local papers for homeless people to call and have skilled people on the other end of the line to help and advise them. Probably most damning of all is that the choice of accommodation under this system is utterly disgraceful. I have seen flats that are stinking with sewage. The squalor and filth are indescribable. Some people have to live here because it is all that is available. If the State is providing money to accommodate families, we should insist that basic facilities such as hot water and a clean warm environment are provided, not the dreadful Dickensian conditions that people are living in. We must address this; we cannot run away from it. If we are providing money for bed and breakfast or other accommodation, it must meet basic minimum human standards. In many cases this accommodation does not meet these standards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House again. This issue has arisen consistently in this House and we have invited him here regularly to outline developments in the area of homelessness. I am heartened to see what has been happening since May with the integrated plan for Dublin. This is an effort to get the voluntary and statutory agencies to combine to form a coherent approach to homelessness. However, the area is still a disaster which is worsening by the day and I am afraid that the proposals here are inadequate to stem the flow of people into a homelessness. The agencies are incapable of dealing with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The right to a home or shelter should be a constitutional right, but it is not in the Constitution. It is a disgrace that in 1996 there were 2,501 homeless people and by 1999 that figure had risen to 5,134. We know from contacts and from anecdotal information that the situation is worsening. More people are sleeping rough. The homeless unit in Dublin last week said it feared the situation was getting out of control in terms of the number of people they are dealing with and the number of people who will be sleeping rough this Christmas with nowhere to go. Despite all the <Col N="561" /> efforts, the situation has disimproved. We are clearly not getting an adequate grip on it.</P>
    <P>The hostels, bed and breakfasts and private rented accommodation that are used are, in the main, inadequate and of poor quality. Much of it is terribly expensive and unsuitable for family needs. There is a human tragedy on the streets. We see from the figures that two thirds of homeless people are located in Dublin but the situation may be even worse. I do not intend to go into a diatribe about the awfulness of the situation other than stating that it is awful and has not improved.</P>
    <P>There are two areas that could be addressed. The word 'prison' was mentioned only once in the Minister of State's speech, yet approximately 8,000 people pass through the doors of Mountjoy Prison every year. A considerable percentage of them are people who are homeless for one reason or another. They may have been drug abusers or alcoholics, they may have committed larceny or assault or minor offences and when they are released, they have nowhere to go. There is no integrated contact between the prison service and the local authorities, the homeless unit or the Department of Health in relation to the provision of accommodation for released prisoners. There is no system in place to provide a roof over their heads.</P>
    <P>The Simon Community's statistics show that the situation is no better in relation to institutions dealing with the mentally ill. The proportion of patients who are discharged and become homeless is huge. There is no integrated system in place between the various statutory agencies and while the Dublin plan seeks to address that, there are whole areas not covered by it and I do not know how they will be covered.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation has a points system of allocating accommodation. It uses a chronological system. One must present in person at Dublin Corporation and fill out an application form to state that one is homeless. These forms cannot therefore be filled out in prison. If one is single, one will have to wait at least three years before getting a place as a homeless person. Even for a family the waiting list is a year and a half. That is not an adequate response to the problem. There should be a basic right to shelter incorporated in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>We should have a single housing authority. This multiple agency system is simple not working between the health boards, local authorities and other voluntary agencies. There are people falling between all of the stools. There is no one who is ultimately responsible and this is part of the problem. There must be somebody driving solutions and a responsible agency dealing with homelessness. It is ridiculous that the homeless unit in Dublin was closed down this spring and summer and there was just one phone available to take calls. People were spending hours trying to get through to the homeless unit. Even though the unit is open now, it is only open from 9.30 a.m. until 12.30 p.m. If people turn up after 12.30 p.m. or at the weekend, the unit is closed. An <Col N="562" /> emergency unit that is only open in the morning is a ridiculous concept. I commend the staff who work there and operate well within the constraints. People who telephone the unit are dealing with an anonymous person at the other end of the line and may be waiting a long time to get through. One never knows at the end of the process whether a bed will be available and where it will be.</P>
    <P>The adequacy of the accommodation leaves a lot to be desired. Bed and breakfast accommodation is unsuitable for families and it costs a fortune. Drug addicts are placed with alcoholics whose family members are in the same institution. There is no distinction between categories. As far as the homeless unit is concerned, if they can get a roof over their heads they are doing well. This will not do.</P>
    <P>We need a single agency and accommodation needs to be greatly improved. There should be a separate homeless unit for families. Alcoholics no longer come to the homeless units in Gardiner Street or Charles Street because they are scared of the drug addicts there. There are many difficulties, but throwing everybody together is an inadequate response.</P>
    <P>There should be an annual survey, not a triennial one. We waited from 1996 to 1999 and now we must wait until next year for the latest figures. The Minister should have given us provisional figures as the next survey is only six months away. A period of three years is too long in terms of responding to emergencies, which is what we are dealing with. There is no reason figures should not be available annually. I hope there is no hidden agenda behind this.</P>
    <P>Landlord and tenant issues must be addressed. Outrageous things are happening in this area. One must spend 20 years as a tenant before one has a single right in terms of legislation. One can be served with a month's notice to quit, followed by eviction. Judges always decide in favour of the landlord because the law is entirely on their side.</P>

      <P>I know this is the case. It happens all the time in Dublin because rents are raised constantly. The way to put rents up is to evict. I deal with the results of these evictions and so does the local authority. They take place because the landlord can get higher rent from someone else. We have no system of rent control to manage this practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the beginning of the last decade 300,000 people were unemployed. The Celtic tiger has existed since then and our unemployment levels have gone from 18% to 3.5%, which is a wonderful result. The National Economic and Social Forum was given the task of devising a mechan<Col N="563" /> ism to eliminate unemployment. It came up with a solution which everyone laughed at because they believed that unemployment could not be abolished, although it virtually has been now. The solution was that local employment services would put together their portfolios of people and every unemployed person who volunteered to seek employment would be approached personally to ensure that they made contact with business people, who in turn would provide the training, education and skills required. This was done on a personal basis, although not all those unemployed volunteered.</P>
    <P>It must be possible to assess the needs of 5,000 people individually and to address them on a personal basis. We do not need a mechanism which includes integrated plans and relationships between the statutory agencies. What is needed is individual human contact, which is lacking. The short-term and long-term needs of each individual should be assessed and a combination of responses put together. This is the only possible basis on which to deal with the problem. It is manageable if we set our minds to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I begin by thanking you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, and the Members of this House for affording me the opportunity to participate in this most timely and important debate. When I addressed this House last year, I observed that implementing the Good Friday Agreement was like climbing a particularly frustrating mountain &ndash; just as you think you are reaching the top, a new and steeper slope appears. There have been numerous occasions during the process when it seemed as though the hard work had been done, only for new issues, or old ones in new guises, to appear. Experience has made us all a little more cautious and a little more reluctant to celebrate fully each step forward. This week is different. I am very hopeful that the landscape has finally and fundamentally changed. If we collectively and urgently seize the opportunity with which we are now presented, we can and will see the Agreement implemented in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent days, genuinely historic steps have been taken. IRA weapons &ndash; arms, ammunition and explosives &ndash; have been permanently put beyond use to the satisfaction of the International Commission on Decommissioning. This is a momentous achievement. The Government always believed that the commission was the mechanism through which this most difficult of issues would be resolved. There were many who said it would never happen and who doubted our ability to overcome the serious obstacle the question of arms represented in the process, but they were wrong. There were also those who said that <Col N="564" /> unionism was not committed to the process and did not want to share power. They too were wrong. We have seen this profoundly important step receive a positive and generous response from the leadership of the Ulster Unionist Party. We welcome the return of Unionist Ministers to office. We appreciate the difficulties David Trimble faces in securing his own return but I know he is working to achieve it. When he succeeds, the door to renewed partnership in government and on this island will have been unlocked.</P>
    <P>It has taken considerable courage and leadership on all sides to bring us this far. People have taken personal risks and endured great strain. I readily and warmly pay tribute to all who have made it possible, especially those republicans who have been prepared to grapple with issues of deep significance to their movement and to their wider community, and to those Unionists who have been committed to making the Agreement work.</P>
    <P>I also extend the sincere gratitude of the Government and the people to General de Chastelain and his colleagues. The question of arms has been one of the most sensitive and difficult issues we have had to address. Because they were not in a position to resolve the question themselves, the parties and Governments tasked the commission with taking the matter forward. We deeply appreciate the conscientious and professional way in which the commission has gone about its work to fulfil its important mandate.</P>
    <P>As guns are put beyond use, it is appropriate that we also remember those for whom this has been a week of very mixed emotions. The existence and use of guns and explosives has brought great suffering and enormous sadness to far too many lives on all sides. People are still grieving and waiting for closure. For some the wounds, physical and psychological, will never heal. We do not forget them at this time. However, as we said in the Agreement, we can best honour them through a fresh start and through dedicating ourselves to the achievement of lasting peace and reconciliation. As a result of this week's events, we now have a renewed opportunity to show that politics can be made to work effectively for all the people. We cannot afford to let it pass.</P>
    <P>We recently saw the remains of ten volunteers from a different era and a different circumstance finally laid to rest with decency and honour and with the full respect of the people for whom they gave their lives. Separated from them by many decades, we can never fully know the thoughts and convictions that individually motivated them. However, we can be certain that they shared a commitment to the right of Irish people to self-determination.</P>
    <P>It has been argued, and many would agree, that partition prevented the full exercise of that right and that the people never had the opportunity to decide our own future together and to speak on fundamental and vitally important aspects of how we see ourselves and how we would wish to conduct our relationships with each other on this island.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" />Throughout the peace process and under successive Irish Governments it was a firmly held conviction that if the lessons of Irish history were to be learned and if the process of healing and reconciliation was to begin, any agreement emerging from a process of negotiation would have to right that historical wrong and that if it was to succeed, any settlement would require the unassailable democratic authority and legitimacy that only endorsement by the people, North and South, voting together could confer.</P>
    <P>In May 1998, the people of Ireland, North and South, exercising together their right to determine their future and voting overwhelmingly in favour of the Good Friday Agreement, brought a chapter in our history to a close. The people were sovereign and they spoke, embracing the principles that underpin the Agreement and pledging themselves to work to secure its implementation. It was a watershed.</P>
    <P>In voting for the Agreement, the people recognised the equal legitimacy of our differing political identities and aspirations, and put in place a political framework that would enable us to work together in partnership and peace to build a better future together.</P>
    <P>They committed themselves to the principle that constitutional change could only be brought about peacefully and with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland. They pledged themselves to raising up new institutions, creating a new dispensation in human rights and equality, normalising society and bringing about a new beginning in policing and justice and relationships on the island. After decades of conflict, the people voted for the absolute primacy of politics and for creating the context in which the gun would forever be taken out of Irish politics.</P>
    <P>In implementing the Agreement, including the resolution of the question of arms, we are carrying out the people's democratic will. It is the solemn and bounden duty of all concerned to see it through to a successful conclusion. As we know all too well, the task has not been easy. In particular, the question of arms has been a thorn in our sides throughout the process. It has provoked emotions and polarised attitudes on all sides. It became a litmus test for unionism of commitment to exclusively peaceful and democratic means. Republicans suspected it was being used to mask a deeper reluctance to embrace change, to share power and to make politics work. It dogged our efforts to move from ceasefires to talks.</P>
    <P>It is now almost six years since the Governments established an international body, under Senator George Mitchell, to seek an agreed basis for progress on the negotiations and on decommissioning. It stalled progress in the talks. It is over four years since the Governments put legislation in place and established the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning as the mechanism through which the issue could be handled and resolved. It seriously hampered our efforts to secure full implementation of the Agreement. Rightly or wrongly, the question of <Col N="566" /> decommissioning became so entangled with question of devolution that, for over 18 months we struggled to find an agreed basis on which the institutions could be established. Just as the institutions were beginning to demonstrate their immense potential to deliver real change, another crisis on decommissioning in February last year saw them brought down for over three months.</P>
    <P>In working to achieve their restoration at Hillsborough in May last year, the Governments realised that we could not continue in this manner. We needed to broaden the context and to focus on all areas where implementation had not been achieved rather than on any one issue. We identified the outstanding elements of the Agreement and mapped out how they could be progressed. In response, the IRA took a significant step, identifying the context within which it would initiate a process to put arms completely and verifiably beyond use and opened its arms dumps to independent inspection. On that basis, the institutions were restored at the end of May 2000. They operated effectively until last October when, in the absence of further tangible progress, the Ulster Unionist Party moved to prevent Sinn Féin Ministers from attending meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council.</P>
    <P>In July of this year, following the resignation of David Trimble as First Minister, the Governments and parties worked intensively at Weston Park to find a way forward to allow the four last pieces of the jigsaw &ndash; policing, demilitarisation, decommissioning and the stability of the institutions &ndash; to slot into place. At the start of August, a package was put to the parties. Particular proposals on policing, demilitarisation and the stability of the institutions were made and we said that decommissioning was indispensable. We looked to others to respond and, on 6 August the IICD reported that it had reached agreement with the IRA on a scheme for putting its weapons beyond use.</P>
    <P>That the IRA's engagement with the commission has now resulted in that scheme being implemented is a cause of the greatest satisfaction to all who have worked hard to achieve full implementation of the Agreement. A profoundly important decision has been taken by the republican movement. We have always acknowledged that decommissioning is a voluntary act. Equally, we have always said that it is indispensable, a necessary contribution to the consolidation of peace and democracy and to the creation of mutual trust. In taking the step that it has, the IRA has greatly enhanced the prospects for peace and for the full implementation of the Agreement. It is a vindication for all those who have argued for a political way forward. We need to move quickly to capitalise on this opportunity. The institutions are the democratic core of the Agreement. We need to have them fully back in business.</P>
    <P>David Trimble has now re-appointed his Ministers and has made it clear that, subject to the views of his party's executive, he will seek re-election as First Minister. I know that everyone in <Col N="567" /> this House wishes him success. Now that Ministers are back in place, we need to see each party reaffirming its commitment to playing its full part in all of the institutions and enabling the other parties to do likewise. The days of stop-start in the institutions must be finally and permanently put behind us. There will be those who will seek to play a disruptive and negative role &ndash; refusing to engage fully with the new dispensation as mandated by the people. They cannot be allowed to hold up our work. We need to see renewed programmes of work and meetings in the institutions &ndash; the North-South Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council &ndash; with Ministers participating fully in all meetings relevant to their responsibilities. In particular, I look forward to early dates being set for outstanding meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council in plenary format as well as meetings on education, health and food safety. These sectors have been particularly disrupted by the impasse and they urgently need to be able to press forward now. At Weston Park we also suggested to the parties that to enable planning and preparation to proceed, meetings and ministerial attendance should, as far as possible, be agreed six months in advance. I hope that this is a matter which the parties will implement in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the speed with which the British Government has moved to reflect the significant reduction in the level of threat that the putting of arms beyond use represents. The removal of installations in Newtownhamiliton and Magherafelt and on Sturgan and Camlough mountains is an important demonstration to people on the ground that things are moving forward and that politics delivers change. The British Government has promised a rolling process of demilitarisation, ultimately to a point where normal levels of security prevail. I look forward to that work progressing quickly. It is critically important that the people of south Armagh, west Tyrone and all areas benefit to the full from the implementation of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>Clearly it would be enormously assisted were other paramilitary organisations to follow the IRA in putting their weapons beyond use. There is simply no place for violence in a democracy. The people do not want it. The Governments will not stand for it. The world is a changed place &ndash; you are for peace or you are against the people. That is a message that must be heard loud and clear, particularly in the streets of north Belfast and Ardoyne. It is completely unacceptable for people to daily give vent to their grievances by hurling abuse and worse at the young schoolchildren of Holy Cross School. It must stop.</P>

      <P>The Agreement guaranteed the right of everyone to freely choose their place of residence and to live free from sectarian harassment. Campaigns of sectarian intimidation and <Col N="568" /> violence must not be allowed to continue. Those responsible must be caught and brought to justice. Their activities have no place in a civilised world.</P>
      <P>In a little over a week's time the Police Service of Northern Ireland will come into being and the new beginning in policing promised in the Agreement will be under way. New recruits will enter shortly. Early next year we will see their presence on the ground. The Northern Ireland Policing Board and district policing partnerships will inevitably take time to establish themselves, but their vitally important work in making the police service fully accountable to the community it serves will begin shortly. The oversight commissioner's review &ndash; to be published a year into the new arrangements &ndash; will be an important benchmark of how matters are proceeding and where changes are necessary to ensure that the Patten report is being implemented in full. We are embarking on an enormously important process of change. All parts of the community should be fully involved and enabled to play their full part. I strongly welcome the presence of Nationalists and Unionists on the policing board. It is a great shame that republicans are not there beside them, giving voice to the concerns and interests of the communities they represent. They have shown good leadership in other areas. I hope that, in time, they will come on board for the new beginning to policing.</P>
      <P>The Agreement is about replacing conflict with political engagement and overcoming the divisions of our past. It promised a new beginning in which partnership, equality and mutual respect were the basis on which relationships were to be built and sustained. It said we would strive together, in every practical way, towards reconciliation and rapprochement. For too many that vision has yet to become a reality. That this is the case has been manifest in our political difficulties which have, in large part, stemmed from our failure to build bridges of trust and confidence between the two communities. People still live apart in their own communities. There are our shops and their shops, our streets and their streets. We have yet to build the common ground on which people can live, work, prosper and thrive together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overcoming this legacy of mutual distrust and misunderstanding will be a longer-term project. Our chances of success will be immeasurably improved if it takes place in an active and politically dynamic context. We need to see the people take full ownership of the task, to see civic society fully engaged, active and vocal in its support for the Agreement and its full implementation. The business community, North and South, has a particularly crucial role to play. The potential is clearly there for a dynamic move forward in business co-operation and common action on the island. It now needs to be actively pursued. We have had a good week. We have moved closer than ever before to our goal, but we must acknowledge the distance yet to be travelled and <Col N="569" /> the critical work that remains to be done if we are truly to realise the Agreement's full potential.</P>
    <P>We should not underestimate the scale of what we have achieved in Ireland. Sitting on the Security Council one becomes sharply aware of the great number of countries in which conflict is a daily reality and in which hope is in very short supply. We do not pretend we have discovered a universal solution. We know each conflict has its unique origins, issues and solutions. However, at this difficult time for the global community, Ireland can send and is sending out a positive message.</P>
    <P>We are not complacent, but we have shown that peace can happen, politics can work and mindsets as well as guns can be decommissioned. Senator Maurice Hayes, writing perceptively in today's <i>Irish Independent,</i> probably spoke for all of us when he stated, &ldquo;Whatever way we look at it, this is one of the great days in the development of democratic institutions in Northern Ireland, in a resolution of an age old conflict, and in the potential it presents for a better and safer life for all the people there.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We also know that no process of conflict resolution will be without its setbacks and problems. The enemies of peace cannot be allowed to succeed. With the right mixture of determination, patience and good will, even what seem the most insurmountable obstacles and intractable problems can be overcome. We have been privileged to have had the solidarity of the international community in our effort. We deeply appreciate and value how our friends throughout the world, especially in the United States, have stood by us sharing our bad days as well as our good. Having received so much, we have a solemn duty to repay our debt in kind. Wherever there is conflict, there are people working for peace. Wherever and whenever we can lend a hand and help make a difference, we will not be found wanting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and compliment and thank him for a fine address. I thank all those who made possible this day and offered the people of Northern Ireland the potential of a life of political normality, peace, stability and, most of all, the chance of a new beginning. It will not be easy.</P>
      <P>Experience and history tell us that nothing in Northern Ireland is easy, that as soon as one problem is resolved another appears, words take on different meanings for different people, unexpected loopholes appear out of nowhere and that the burden of history sits heavily on too many people.</P>
      <P>Let us not forget either that sheer evil and malevolence are never far from the surface. It is visible in the example referred to by the Minister, the sectarian intimidation of children trying to go to school and in those prepared to stir up sectarian hatred in the interests of destabilising everything achieved so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would be foolish to ignore the fact that the Good Friday Agreement and all that has flowed <Col N="570" /> from it still has some very powerful enemies. Not everybody in Northern Ireland or, perhaps, in this part of the country is wedded to the peace process. There are still those who want no truck with the promised future. Other guns have yet to be silenced and further decommissioning must take place.</P>
    <P>In a strange way, it is the voices we have not heard this week which are most significant. These silent voices give us most cause for concern.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to proceed with an element of caution. We have all shared the euphoria, hype and joy before, only to see it followed, often very quickly, by the great let down.</P>
    <P>The Minister was right to thank those friends who stuck with us during the bad times as well as the good times because, even since the Good Friday Agreement was signed, there have been some very bad and bleak days when people thought the whole process would run aground. All praise, therefore, goes to those who did not lose faith in the process.</P>
    <P>It was interesting that the reaction in the North on Monday and Tuesday was low key. People are battle weary and crisis worn. They have been disappointed too often in the past and will not cheer too loudly until they see things working as has been promised. This time, I believe, things are different. All the important building blocks and preconditions for success seem to be in place and many are already working.</P>
    <P>Decommissioning is not a surrender. What we are witnessing is a victory for constitutionalism and peaceful democratic politics of the type practised by the SDLP for 30 long, difficult and unrewarding years. In a real sense everyone is a victor today, but if there is an ideological or philosophical winner, it is the mainstream parties, especially, as I have said, the SDLP because its brand of politics has triumphed. In all the spinning and euphoria it is easy to lose sight of the fact that the advocates of physical force, as they call it, have yielded and conceded to the old fashioned advocates of democratic constitutional politics. The historical traditions of O'Connell and Parnell, on which the politics of all parties in this House are based, have ultimately been the victors in the battle of ideas.</P>
    <P>These events are also a victory for the Governments of these two islands who have shown enormous patience and resolve over the long barren years. History will record the full substance of their achievements, not just this huge achievement. Working together in this process they have brought our two islands closer together than ever before and replaced the distrust of generations, indeed centuries, with genuine full blooded co-operation. For the first time in the history of these two islands, an unambiguous friendship has replaced the lingering ambivalence which hitherto characterised relations. This may not have been the objective of Sinn Féin or the IRA when it set out, but it is one of the very productive, if ironic, results of what we have all been through. We are all the better for it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" />As well as thanking the Government through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, who has been superb in all he has done in this process, I thank the Governments and leaders of the past 30 years. John Major and Tony Blair stand out among the British Prime Ministers as the only ones who tried to understand the deep nature of the problem and were prepared to devote the energy and humility required to resolve it. Every Taoiseach from Jack Lynch and Liam Cosgrave through to Bertie Ahern has raised the issues to a higher plane and given the problem of Northern Ireland his complete commitment. Nothing can take from them the contribution they have made.</P>
    <P>I thank also the civil servants. Convention dictates they should not be named but I state, as I have done in the past, that we owe them an enormous debt. They have been the true patriots of the past 30 years, working silently with imagination and dedication, unable to reply to insults, prepared to take rebuff after rebuff and willing to start all over again. They include people like Eamon Gallagher and Sean Donlon in the early days through to Paddy Teahon, Dermot Gallagher, Tim Dalton, Martin Mansergh and many more in the recent past and include those in the Minister's office who have worked so hard such as Daithi Ó Ceallaigh and Declan Kelly. The Minister is aware of the contribution they have made. It would be wrong if it was not publicly recognised by the Oireachtas and the people.</P>
    <P>Great praise is due to the leaders of Sinn Féin, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. They showed beyond doubt in these past difficult times that their commitment to democratic politics is real. They showed skill and leadership, patience and cunning in bringing the IRA with them. They have shown personal courage of a very high order and their efforts deserve to be rewarded with success.</P>
    <P>Only time will tell, although the Minister probably has a good idea of, the full story of how the IRA was persuaded to decommission. One of the factors which persuaded the however was very clear, the pressure, persuasion and plain talking of this country's friends both in and out of government in the US. They played an enormous part.</P>
    <P>The terrible events of 11 September changed everything. There could no longer be ambiguity about terrorism, no winks or nods to Libya, Colombia, ETA or any other terrorist group. That message was put across loud and clear by the friends of this country in the US. So too was the positive message that now was the time to take that giant leap forward, to take that last great risk. If the opportunity was not grasped, the patience, tolerance and support of the friends of the republican movement would very quickly wear out. It was a powerful message and it was one that had at least some effect in persuading the IRA to take that final decision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="572" />The role of the US Government has over recent years been splendid. Ambassador Haass, in particular, in recent times and Secretary of State, Colin Powell, have been of enormous help, as the Minister knows. Within Congress we have had loyal, unwavering and constructive friends, people prepared to support us and to tell the truth, people such as Senator Kennedy and Senator Chris Dodd. I also mention someone who played an important part at crucial stages in the peace process, the former ambassador, Jean Kennedy-Smith.</P>
    <P>The goodwill and straight talking of groups like the National Committee on American Foreign Policy and, in particular its chairman, Mr. William Flynn, was vital. History will show the enormity of the part played by Bill Flynn throughout the peace process. He is a rare person, somebody who speaks his mind without losing the trust and confidence of either side, be they loyalist or republican, British or Irish. This country owes him and many like him an enormous debt of gratitude. They do not ask for or expect our thanks, but without people like Bill Flynn and those around him, without their disinterested, honest and generous help, the achieving of decommissioning would have been much more difficult.</P>
    <P>We now face into the future and it is likely to be a better future than most of us could have envisaged even a few weeks ago. The institutions of the Good Friday Agreement have taken root. The Assembly has shown that it is capable of being robust. Working relationships have been established. People long denied their own Parliament have given character to the new Assembly. Those who long spurned democratic politics have seen how it can work to the good of all, as the Minister made clear in his contribution today.</P>
    <P>There is still an enormous well of distrust. The memories of 30 terrible years will not be erased easily &ndash; in many cases they can never be. There is still the unfinished business of the various inquiries. There is the task of establishing the new police force on a secure footing, central to the creation of a stable State. This new police force must have the trust of both communities. At least the way is well signalled and much progress has been made.</P>
    <P>We have reached the point where we in this part of the country, through our Government and our Parliament, and indeed the Government and people of Britain, have done all we can and all that can be asked of us. As the Minister said, we will continue to support the new democracy in Northern Ireland and we will give every assistance we can to build better relations between the two parts of the island and to help build better relations within Northern Ireland. We have done virtually all we can do and from this point on, it is over to the people of Northern Ireland to make a success of their own democracy. Only they can do that, and I have every belief that they will do so.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire. Gabhaim buíochas leis as ucht an ráitis a chuir sé os ár gcomhair inniu, ráiteas réasúnta, praicticiúil, dearfa agus dóchasach. Chruthaigh an tseachtain seo go bhfuil Poblachtánaigh, agus náisiúnaithe i gcoitinne, sásta dul i ngleic leis an gcóras sa Tuaisceart agus gur féidir leo a n-ídéil agus a n-aidhmeanna a chur chun tosaigh go síochánta agus gan aon cos ar bholg a bheith déanta orthu.</P>
      <P>Tá dualgas orainn uilig a bheith cabhrach sa phróiséas sin. Tá a fhios againn go maith cad a tharla sa tír seo le blianta fada anuas. Bhí an-deighilt idir dhaoine. Is cinnte go raibh fulaingt úafásach le déanamh ag an-chuid daoine agus nach mbeidh a shárú sin le fáil ariamh. Ag an am gcéanna, d'fhoghlaimíomar, ó bheith ag caint lena chéile, gur féidir linn ár bhfealsúnacht a thuiscint agus fealsúnacht dhaoine eile a thuiscint freisin agus gur féidir idir-ghníomhaíocht a bheith eadrainn ar son an chine daonna agus ar son an oileáin i gcoitinne.</P>
      <P>Ní hionann sin agus a rá go gcaithfidh éinne a ídéil a chur ar leataobh nó a rá nach bhfuil sé ceadaithe í a bheith mar aidhm ag duine go mbeadh an dá chuid den tír aontaithe. Tá seans níos fearr ann an tír a aontú má tá sé bunaithe ar dhea-thoil, ar chomh-oibriú agus ar chomh-thuiscint.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House today and sharing his thoughts and experiences with us in this very historic week. His statement was practical, positive and hopeful. Looking back over the decades it is evident that some people have been particularly heroic. There have been many pessimists, many people who were defeatist, many who were cynical during the bad times. Yet it was important that dialogue continued, that we had the opportunity of at least endeavouring to understand each other's point of view.</P>
      <P>At times, perhaps, this has been part of our difficulty. While we have been beset by the geographical partition in this country, which no doubt set back a day of resolution in more ways than one, there has also been partition in our minds and in our hearts. At times it was virtually impossible for both traditions to communicate with each other because of that division. There was a deep distrust of every word, every action and every aspiration. At the same time people endeavoured to keep doors open.</P>
      <P>Thirty or 40 years ago it was unthinkable that a Unionist politician would travel to Dublin and be photographed publicly talking to politicians from the Republic. It would have been virtually impossible in that period for a politician to travel from the Republic to the North and not create a huge amount of unrest. All is changed, changed utterly, and for the better. Those things belong to the distant past and now we are all able to see that we occupy a very small island, although this does not mean that we have to agree with each other's point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This week has been referred to as historic, and it is historic for many reasons. We do not have <Col N="574" /> time in this forum to dissect and analyse republican policies and philosophies from their beginnings. It would not serve any purpose, but this turning point in Irish history is different from any other sea change which has taken place in Irish history. This is because a solid foundation has been laid on which we can build.</P>
    <P>I have always held republican views and hope I will continue to do so. Virtually everybody on the island who comes from the Nationalist tradition holds republican views. Over the decades I have often tried to envisage what full independence and the unity of Ireland would mean. I am certain it would not mean the removal of British forces from this island, changing one Administration for another. I always felt independence or the pursuit of a united Ireland would be an organic development, a changing process as time proceeded. One could go so far as to say that many elements of that unity now exist in a way that does not necessarily have to agitate those who do not want a united Ireland. For instance, one can easily drive across the Border and not be aware that is the position.</P>
    <P>Both traditions in the North can sit down and work together with a sense of equality. This has inspired republicans to take the move they took this week. I find it difficult to distinguish between Nationalist and republican because to me they both belong to the same family and pursue the same philosophy. They believe they can legitimately pursue their ideals and seek out their aspirations without being coerced or obstructed from so doing. That is the reason they were prepared to operate the system as now applies in the North. During the short period of the Assembly and the Executive it became clear that there was a common decency among all people in the North, irrespective of which tradition to which they subscribed and that that common decency would be the engine of progress in the future. Ministers from both traditions worked closely together for the betterment of their people, not only the people of their constituencies, but all the people as such be the case.</P>
    <P>We have entered the realm of real and normal politics. Anybody who obstructs that progress and development or dilutes that potential which is at our disposal will do no justice to any cause they consider righteous or positive. It is easy to go down a by-road and talk of some of the more extreme happenings in the North. It is easy to recognise where generosity does not exist, but in so doing we will undermine the generosity evident and manifested, within the past 24 or 48 hours, which will create its own momentum. That would not have been possible but for the Minister, Deputy Cowen, the Taoiseach, the Government, all the political parties which contributed throughout the whole period and our friends internationally.</P>
    <P>I had the opportunity in the House to compliment the former United States President, Bill Clinton, who was courageous in a way we never experienced from a leader of America where he <Col N="575" /> was backed up by many people. I also pay tribute to Tony Blair. When he addressed the joint session of the Houses of the Oireachtas he made it clear he had a very deep understanding of Ireland's history and the difficulties and the wrongs perpetrated against us as a people for many centuries. That comes from his Irish background. It was necessary for many people of goodwill to come on board.</P>
    <P>Each Member is right to give kudos to Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and the republican movement because we must bear in mind it was the injustices in the North and the obstruction of the legitimate pursuit of aims and objects that spawned republican movements throughout every single period. If they were responding and reacting to coercion in the North, born to a large degree out of a sense of supremacy on the part of those who had the power to practise it and out of political arrogance which had no place in the civilised world, it took quite a while for the Unionist family to respond. In the process it has fragmented itself in a way that nobody could have foreseen a quarter of a century ago. There are now many brands and colours of Unionism evident in the North, much more so than within the republican Nationalist family.</P>
    <P>This is not a gloating matter. What is happening here is that a new political watershed is being created and there is no reason, no more than in the post-independence era in the Republic, a new political realignment cannot come about in the North. It should no longer be necessary for David Trimble, good man though he is in many ways, to be always looking over his shoulder at his constituency. He should look at new friends, colleagues and compatriots who are available to work with him in the new Assembly and institutions.</P>
    <P>I can see not only a window of opportunity, but a window of enlightened vision being open to us on this island. Within the next 12 months &ndash; I put it no longer than that &ndash; we could see, in a constitutional sense, many revolutionary realignments and developments on this island. We should all be prepared, with a sense of adventure, idealism and generosity, to seize every opportunity that comes our way to interact with each other, bearing in mind that the Ireland of today, the 32 counties, is not the Ireland of 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>We are sited in an international setting. As the Minister said, we hold an exhalted position on the Security Council. We have held the Presidency of the European Union. Our economic progress has been lauded throughout the world. This is not the Ireland of a quarter of a century ago. We are poised in many ways in an international context to make light of the difficulties on the island and look to that bigger picture, which is of an international dimension.</P>
    <P>We would be very ungenerous if we did not endeavour to make future developments comfortable for our Unionist colleagues in the North. There is nothing whatever to be gained by being <Col N="576" /> categorised under one particular heading. The real test of our commitment, tenacity and determination to build on what has happened this week will be our determination to look at the broader picture.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and everybody else who has been connected with the peace process. We wish everybody involved well. Those who have any doubts or feel they are being upstaged or sidelined should become part of what is now happening. It is for the betterment of Ireland and mankind and the security, contentment and development of future generations.</P>

      <P>Eight euro and eight euro make 15 pence. I welcome the Minister's statement and compliment him on its upbeat and comprehensive nature. I echo the compliments offered to all groups and bodies. I was particularly delighted to see in today's newspapers recognition for the work of the faceless civil servants in the background, to whom the Minister has given credit on many occasions. This is a time of hope, optimism and anticipation of a bright future. We should not, however, forget the fact that there are people on this island, North and South, whom I refer to as career terrorists. They have a different agenda which has little to do with progressing the needs of their people, from whatever side.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to the point made by Senator Ó Murchú about a united Ireland. I have a slightly different view of what is meant by a united Ireland. To me a united Ireland is an Ireland united in its quest for peace. We have seen this clearly in recent years. It is an Ireland united in seeking a better life for all its citizens, whatever their backgrounds, beliefs and political aspirations. It is an Ireland united by focusing on the development of the whole island and all its people and which distracts from the minor issues which feed sectarianism. It looks at the big picture to drive society forward towards a better quality of life for everybody. We must be united in this.</P>
      <P>For me a united Ireland is one where we focus and move forward on cross-community initiatives which lay the foundations of trust across communities, parties, religious beliefs and so forth. That is how we move forward. If we have a single education system, North and South, for example, that will be a united Ireland and the line that goes from Derry to Dundalk will simply be a line on a map, like other boundaries such as rivers and county boundaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It behoves us to focus on the people rather than the partitionist nature of the island. The partitionist nature of the people on our island is reflected very much by those who would articu<Col N="577" /> late most loudly the idea of a politically united Ireland. Until people have a common policy throughout the island on, for example, the Irish language &ndash; no group has such a policy &ndash; or on the way in which we run our education system in order that there is one agreed system for the island, of which nobody is in favour, there will be no united Ireland. I could name four or five objectives we should push towards which would result in a united Ireland in terms of attitude, belief and trying to achieve what is best for the development of its people. However, every time one makes a step in that direction, the people shouting for a united Ireland will be the first to stand in the way.</P>
    <P>I have asked many people to give me the outline or basis for a single policy throughout the island on the Irish language and I cannot get it. I look forward to the day &ndash; I have sought it many times &ndash; when there will be a history syllabus for the island that will celebrate the sash and the shamrock with equal strength and recognise all that goes with them.</P>
    <P>In moving from the platform and foundation the Minister has outlined in solid terms today we should look at how we can move forward from simple parity of esteem, which is already there at the upper echelons of society. More is required. This is about pluralism, tolerance and an intercultural society where we will measure the quality of our relationship with each other, not by the amount of space we give people with different views, backgrounds and political aspirations, but by the quality of the relationships between people who hold different views and beliefs. That is how we will achieve an intercultural society, which is far more important than simply getting some sort of political entity on the island. As we go forward economically and socially towards a more intercultural society, the other pieces will click into place.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on his work. The discussions that have taken place in this House have proven useful in allowing issues to be progressed. Perhaps I can develop my ideas in relation to the Irish language and the education sector. In Northern Ireland there are strong and separate Catholic and state sectors whereas in the South the Catholic and State sectors are indistinguishable. It should be possible, given the goodwill between the Churches, to at least move forward. Surely in a Christian context people could move schools forward together. A society where people are born in a Catholic hospital, live in a Catholic housing estate, go to a Catholic school, become trained teachers in a Catholic training college and return to an education system that is run by the Catholic Church keeps people apart. It is not that people intend it to be that way, but it creates that division.</P>
    <P>The same thing happens with the Irish language. I have asked many people, particularly Sinn Féin, the reason there cannot be a common policy for the island. Every time I seek such a policy I get a terribly negative response from gaelgóirí on <Col N="578" /> all sides. In Northern Ireland pro-Irish parties want people to have access to the Irish language and to have it taught in schools; in the South they want it to be compulsory. Who will grasp the nettle and put forward a policy for the whole island?</P>
    <P>It is clear what the policy should be. For the kid who wishes to move from Gaeltacht Dhún na nGall isteach go Condae Dhoire, gur cóir dó nó di a bheith ábalta dul ar aghaidh lena chuid oideachais trí Ghaeilge if that is what he or she wishes. On the other hand, the child who has been raised in Ballymena and whose family, for economic reasons, moves to Roscommon should be able to continue his or her education through English without having to do compulsory Irish. That would be a step forward. The time is ripe to take on those people who have destroyed the Irish language trín í a brú síos scórnaigh ar dhaoine and tried to choke people with the language. We who love the language must simply stand back and see it used as a weapon which divides people rather than as a cultural focus which should bring people together. I can give example after example.</P>
    <P>It is within education and cultural issues that we will bring people together into an Ireland united in its culture, focus, attitude and respect for people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas in congratulating everybody who has been involved in this process. It is such a good and laudable achievement that it is almost monotonous to echo the words of those who have spoken here and elsewhere. It is tremendously significant and I do not believe there will be a single voice of dissent in this House or any responsible section of this island.</P>
      <P>This is a fantastic victory for common sense and for peace. It is something which was thought, on both sides, to be &ldquo;never possible&rdquo;. By picking people out for select praise, one always omits others, but it is fair to pay tribute to those who started the process. It is fair to pay tribute to Deputy Albert Reynolds, who undoubtedly had an extraordinary commitment to this process. He got the ball rolling and took great political risks for peace. This week is as much his achievement as it is the Minister's; I know the Minister will not take this wrongly because they are both instruments in this process.</P>
      <P>It is fair to pay tribute to John Bruton, who did exactly the same, and others in this and the other House. It is also fair to pay tribute to the civil servants who Senator O'Toole rightly mentioned and were often accused of pursuing a political agenda and probably have done so. However, it is a good thing that there were people pursuing a political agenda on both sides with such extraordinary ability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is amazing that this day has come at all because the Northern Ireland situation has always been a very public humiliation of one side by the other. One of the problems that has always <Col N="579" /> made matters difficult is that a victory, however minor, for one side is seen as a defeat by the other and has been claimed as such.</P>
    <P>The role of this House in this long procedure should be acknowledged. The former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, started the process of appointing people from Northern Ireland to this House, which was of great benefit to communication between everybody. When he was a Senator, Seamus Mallon was involved in many controversies in this House. He educated many people, including me, who were unaware of Nationalist ways of thinking, as did other former Senators, including Sam McAughtry, John Robb and Gordon Wilson. Senator Maurice Hayes is similarly valuable to the House. Although it was controversial and unwelcome in the North at the time, it played a part in the process. We have had some mature, controversial and far-seeing debates in this House, and Senator Manning has played a leading role in such debates over the years. Looking back at some of the debates we have had, I am aware of the changes and progress that have taken place and the difficulties that have been overcome by politicians.</P>
    <P>I hope I may be forgiven for relating a personal anecdote. In 1981 or 1982, I proposed a motion in this House which suggested that members of the provisional IRA should be extradited to the North. I found that such a suggestion was politically unacceptable to all parties. It is now a <i>fait accompli</i> that people involved in violence, whether Unionist or Nationalist, should meet proper justice. I remember that political parties had great difficulty with the amendments to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, which removed the claim to the territory of Northern Ireland. The main political parties in this part of the island courageously swallowed the pill, which was not easy as politically it would have been easier to duck the question. The changes were made as part of a process in which everyone has had to make serious concessions.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that the process, which has worked so far, has taken much longer than anybody anticipated. We thought it was complete when the Good Friday Agreement was signed, but there were serious difficulties in the years that followed. On many occasions, it seemed that the process had been sunk and the fact that it was not was due to the incredible amount of goodwill and the courage of people on all sides, including John Hume and David Trimble, both of whom took huge risks with their political careers to promote a greater ideal. I unapologetically criticised John Hume at a time when I did not agree with the way in which he was proceeding. John Hume and David Trimble have been central to the success of the peace process. I have outlined the history of the process from the point of view of Seanad Éireann, as I see it. The extraordinary and welcome mixture of people in this House has meant that it has played a disproportionate role. Lead<Col N="580" /> ing personalities from Northern Ireland have brought leading ideas to bear on Senators.</P>
    <P>Looking forward for a moment, I wish to echo the comments that have been made about the future. Senator O'Toole is right that there is not much point in using slogans which mean different things to different people. The process is not all over and it is important that the next step receives huge effort from all communities. There will be massive problems on the ground in the North. Cross-community effort should be pushed by economic and business interests if the North is to receive a peace dividend. In other words, people on both sides of the Border should benefit from an increase in business and trade activity. It is staggering how little trade there is between the North and the Republic, but it could be promoted without any political difficulties. If there is one thing that will unite minds North and South, it is the making of money. We are all interested in our finances so the Governments should get together to promote trade.</P>
    <P>I wish to add a word of caution. In the context of recent events, we should respect the wishes of people of all traditions to commemorate the dead, especially those regarded as martyrs or national heroes. It would be a sign of great maturity on the part of both traditions if this could be done without protest, without difficulties and without whipping up the fear that it constitutes triumphalism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a difficult and historic day. This House has discussed the problems in the North for many years and it was sometimes said that our words did not have influence. I sincerely hope that the words spoken in the House carried a certain amount of influence. I am delighted the Minister for Foreign Affairs is here today as he has played an enormous part in recent months in continuing the negotiations that have taken place over many years. He is a straightforward Minister who calls things as they are. Under the leadership of the Taoiseach and former Taoisigh, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, has followed in a line of people who want to see an end to the problems of the North.</P>
      <P>Nothing changes immediately and nothing will change immediately as a result of the events of recent days. As the Minister said, a chapter of history has been brought to a close, but we must think about what happened in the chapter. Most Senators will be gone in the next few years. People before us worked extremely hard for a friendlier relationship between the communities in the North. It is important that we realise that the chapter is ending and that we hope the next chapter will be better for the North. People should be able to go shopping or to a hurling or rugby match without having to check whether it will be safe. The young people of the North have realised that peace is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must thank everyone who helped the peace process, regardless of whether they were British Prime Ministers, Taoisigh, members of the IRA <Col N="581" /> or members of the UUP. We must realise that what has been done in recent months is important for the relationship between Catholics, Protestants and people with no religion in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We must thank everyone who helped the peace process, regardless of whether they were British Prime Ministers, Taoisigh, members of the IRA or members of the UUP. We must realise that what has been done in recent months is important for the relationship between Catholics, Protestants and people with no religion in Northern Ireland. In the past, relationships between people of different religions in the North of Ireland were difficult. Why? They lived in the same streets but they went to different schools. Relationships between people must be developed. We discussed Northern Ireland as if it did not relate to the people there. In the past, we discussed the area rather than the people.</P>
    <P>The people of Northern Ireland are like us. They want to live normal lives with normal relationships. As a result of events in recent days, I hope these relationships can be developed. People who live in the same streets, regardless of whether they are Catholic, Protestant, Muslim or have no religion, should not have to worry about the diversity of cultures. It is most important that they can live together and I compliment the Minister, the Taoiseach, the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and all those involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the primacy of democracy. Democracy is not just a word. It is about people relating to each other in a society in which they can work together. There is at last a hope in the North of Ireland that this can happen. There was much suspicion about Sinn Féin and the IRA and their relationship. A huge number of people were afraid that Sinn Féin was the IRA and <i>vice versa.</i> We should be clear that, in Ireland, democracy has taken over from the gun and the bullet and we should all be grateful that this is the case.</P>
    <P>As an elderly Member of the Oireachtas, ageism has taken over on this matter. People have suggested the reason for change in the North is that young people have taken over. However, the amount of work done by people of my age and older in trying to bring the current position to fruition must be recognised. There is a need for young people in politics and I urge those in the Visitors Gallery to enter politics if they can. However, they should not be blind if they do so. Older people have a role to play. Nobody could suggest that John Hume did not play a part or that the SDLP has gone over the top. If it was not for the SDLP, we would not have reached today's position. Ageism is a problem in Ireland and many people are attempting to wipe out the SDLP by suggesting that Sinn Féin is the main player. If it had not been for the SDLP over the past 30 years, we would not have reached the point we are at today.</P>
    <P>The peace talks led to thoughts. People of different relationships got together and thought through the principles and practicalities. Today's <Col N="582" /> position would not have been reached without those thinking processes. We must pay tribute to everybody in the North of Ireland for coming together. I do not suggest that there will be a perfect society on this island in the next ten or 15 years. However, we have a chance of a better society where people can live, think and argue together without the need for bullets or bombs. We can win if we talk through our problems. However, we will not win if we try to bomb our way out of them.</P>
    <P>Bhí deighilt mhór idir an IRA agus Sinn Féin agus daoine eile. Mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Murchú, tá seans againn anois, bíodh sé beag nó mór, agus is fúinne atá sé an seans sin a ghlacadh.</P>
    <P>There were too many occasions on which people talked about the land instead of the people. Too many individuals sang songs that were not about democracy and instead implied that some people were better than others. Such songs should be left in the past as examples of good pieces of music. They should not be used to suggest that some people are better. I can sing <i>Kevin Barry</i> and others can sing <i>The Sash</i> but they should be considered only as songs of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have been involved in the politics of the Middle East and I have been a supporter of the Palestinians for many years. I sincerely hope the Israelis will sit down with the Palestinians and try to produce something similar to what has been done in Northern Ireland over the past number of days. If there was a relevance to the talks, perhaps the Palestinians would get what they deserve rather than what the Israelis want them to get. I urge the Minister, in his role over the next 14 days as President of the Security Council, to ask people to address the situation in the Middle East as earnestly as he did in the North of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine myself because essentially we only want to congratulate the Minister, his staff and his predecessors. A number of people were complimented and we should also remember former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds. His capacity to grasp the nettle and do some decent midlands horse trading helped get the whole show on the road. It pains me to say it but I admired the performance of Dr. Martin Mansergh on the wireless recently. I usually do <Col N="583" /> not care for what he says but on this occasion he was extremely fine in dealing with the gradual nature of the process. If one looks for everything up front, one will ruin the whole equation. By carefully, painstakingly and gradually working away while keeping as much resolution as one can, one will eventually get everything one wants.</P>
      <P>We must recognise that this is a major step. I have been against the IRA and I have opposed Sinn Féin all my life. This is not surprising, although on my mother's side, I come from an ancient Gaelic family from the same neck of the woods as the Minister. They were Southern Unionists and my father, who was English, would have been a Nationalist compared to them. However, unlike Senator Ó Murchú and Patrick Pearse, I do not feel the need to overcompensate for it. There was something shrill about some of the contributions he made, but that is work for another day.</P>
      <P>These are remarkable events which have taken place. We could not have anticipated them so dramatically or so soon but for the tragic events of 11 September. Gerry Adams and the rest of the leadership of Sinn Féin-IRA were committed in the long run to the peace process and they might have decommissioned. However, they would have found it difficult to bring their people with them and they will still find a difficulty there. The shock delivered to the world created a wave of revulsion against terrorism upon which the leadership of Sinn Féin wisely capitalised. They were also put in a bit of a corner by the so-called Colombia Three. There is a curious phenomenon that if one puts a number after someone's name, it makes them innocent. I supported the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four, but I will not support the Colombia Three.</P>
      <P>I understand the difficulties facing Mr. Adams and I understood them more the other evening after listening to Mr. Boucher-Hayes on RTE in the aftermath of the announcement when he interviewed people in the Ardoyne. I was astonished to hear eight of the ten decent sounding middle class women from that area saying they thought it was a mistake. They did not want to give up anything. The slogan they used was &ldquo;not an ounce, not a bullet&rdquo;. It is the exact obverse of &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo;, which was the Unionist slogan. One of the problems in the North, as in the Middle East, is that the two sides are similar. In the North they are both Christians from opposing traditions and in the Middle East they are both Semitic. I listened to the bands at the hunger strikers march in O'Connell Street as I could hear them in my drawing room. It could just as easily have been an Orange march with the same brutal thumping intimidation. They have a difficult situation to deal with and so has Trimble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope someone paid tribute to David Trimble here today because he richly deserves it. Like his counterpart on the other side, Martin Mansergh, I never cared for him. The sound of his voice irritated me. It also seemed that he was mean, <Col N="584" /> begrudging and parsimonious and there was no generosity. When he did his little jig on the Ormeau Road or the Garvaghy Road, I could have clattered him.</P>

      <P>On the other hand, he has followed the difficult line with courage, steadfastness and statesmanship and he has brought about a situation in which he can bring a majority of his own difficult people with him. That is some achievement.</P>
      <P>One of the things I was most happy about was the wonderfully acid attack by senior members of the Ulster Unionist Party on the democratic party of the Rev. Ian Paisley. I have not once heard that irreverent gentleman utter one positive statement. It was &ldquo;O'Neill must go&rdquo; and &ldquo;Chichester Clarke must go&rdquo;. There was nothing positive. It was &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo;. He has not contributed a single positive idea inside the province of Ulster, although he was quite good in Europe.</P>
      <P>We should get rid of all the words of the songs, not just the unspeakable nasty Northern ballads. I am sure Senator Lanigan may have heard the &ldquo;Crossley Tender&rdquo; with its language, which is offensive to any decent person, or seen the notice in Crossmaglen, &ldquo;Sniper At Work&rdquo;, which is a reproach to every decent person, if there is a decent person, living in the vicinity of Crossmaglen.

      <P>We are right to congratulate the Minister and everyone who has been involved in the peace process for such a long time. It has taken an enormous amount of courage by people in this part of the country but incredible courage by people on both sides in Northern Ireland. Like Senator Norris, I also heard the bands for the hunger strikers march. I was leaving the Rotunda Hospital and came out in the middle of them. I thought it was an Orange march because they all seem to have adopted each other's form of musical entertainment.</P>
      <P>One area I am anxious for the Minister to continue to address is the exploitation of and injury to children in Northern Ireland. I am not only alluding to the appalling situation in the Ardoyne where small children are being terrorised on the way to school. This is one of the most vile images we have seen of Northern Ireland in recent years. I hope the political leaders make an effort to show those involved that this is counter-productive to the promotion of peace in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The weapons have been put beyond use on the republican side and we hope that reciprocal arrangements will be made immediately by the loyalist paramilitary groupings. A serious report was recently published by Professor Liam Kennedy of the School of Modern History at Queen's University. This report was entitled &ldquo;They Shoot Children, Don't They?&rdquo;. It is an analysis of the age and gender of victims of paramilitary punishments in Northern Ireland. One side is as bad as the other. It is unfortunate that a high percentage of those who are beaten up by the paramilitaries are children, some of whom are badly injured. It would be a good idea if they realised that it is not just firearms and semtex that are weapons, but also baseball bats and iron bars.</P>
      <P>I have said in the House during past debates on Northern Ireland that in the early 1970s I went to a medical meeting in London &ndash; there were only a few people there from the island of Ireland &ndash; where, to my horror, one of the first papers was on the repair of the knee joint. It was a report on 86 cases of knee capping. It referred to the different injuries one got if the bullet went in from the front or the side or if a shotgun or a Black and Decker drill was used. The type of punishments meted out when it was considered the civil power was not the suitable force to whom to report or it was not doing enough in these areas has been dreadful. One of the negative things since the Good Friday Agreement is that this situation has not improved, but disimproved. The majority of those who are beaten up are young men or boys, and many women, particularly single women, have been witnesses to these atrocities. While we have peace in terms of firearms not being used, it is important to say to the paramilitaries that these important areas must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="586" />It was suggested by Professor Kennedy that a children's rights commissioner for Northern Ireland would champion the rights of those children. He urged that an anti-intimidation unit be established on the model of the Human Rights Commission and that political penalties be imposed on the paramilitary political parties whose armed wings continue to engage in the mutilation of people, including children. The scale of the punishment attacks might also be monitored by General de Chastelain, to whom we owe a great deal of thanks. I congratulate the Minister, his officials and the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I compliment him, his officials and everybody else who has been involved at this historic juncture in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. I thank those who were involved at the beginning of the peace process many years ago, including Charles Haughey, Deputies Albert Reynolds and John Bruton, and past and present leaders of the political parties involved. I pay particular tribute to the Taoiseach for his determination and drive to bring the process to its current point. On the day his mother was laid to rest he left Dublin for Belfast following the burial and worked late into the night to put the Agreement together. The people of the island subsequently voted overwhelmingly in favour of its implementation.</P>
      <P>The IRA must be commended for putting its weapons beyond use and the other paramilitary groups, including the Red Hand Defenders, must reciprocate its action. There is no room on this island or in the world for terrorists. People want to live in peace and harmony in a democracy. There is a long way to go, but this is an historic occasion.</P>
      <P>There is a significant opportunity for the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic to promote tourism on the island in the current difficult economic climate. It will be difficult to recapture the tourism business lost as a result of the tragedy on 11 September in the United States. The Administrations, North and South, can work together to attract visitors. People would not travel to the island in the past because of the threat of terrorism. Ireland is a small island, but the cross-Border bodies now have an ideal opportunity to come together and get on with their work, which I welcome.</P>
      <P>I am concerned, however, about a number of issues, one of which was referred to by Senator Norris. As a politician, I cannot comprehend some recent statements. It was a little glib of Mr. Adams to mention that one of the Colombia Three, Mr. Connolly, was a member of Sinn Féin, but not to mention a connection with drug running and terrorist training. These people come out with a white cloth in one hand and a different coloured cloth in the other. I seek more clarification about Mr. Connolly's activities and how much money is being generated in Colombia for the Sinn Féin organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="587" />I have studied the Good Friday Agreement closely. The Sinn Féin organisation has been trying recently to force the Government into releasing the murderers of Detective Garda McCabe. Last weekend a number of newspapers reported that a deal was being worked on between Sinn Féin and the Government regarding the early release of those who murdered my friend from Ballylongford, Gerry McCabe, and shot his colleague, Garda Ben O'Sullivan. I vigorously oppose such a move under the Agreement. The possible release of these men would fly in the face of natural justice. They held up a van with the intention of robbing money, shot a man dead and are now saying they are republicans. This claim must be examined. I am disappointed at the decision of the court of appeal that the sentences handed down in the McCabe case would not be increased because these people should be locked away for good in a small 8 ft by 6 ft room and fed through a door.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin is seeking the release of these men in the name of republicanism. My father was a republican who fought for this country. He knew Kevin Barry who, with his comrades, was honoured a few weeks ago. I was proud to attend that historic event. These men fought for the freedom we enjoy today. They did not murder gardaí in the street in the name of republicanism or place bombs in restaurants and blow people to smithereens as they ate their meals, whether it was in Omagh or Enniskillen. The people who committed these crimes are terrorists and the sooner they are rooted out of society the better.</P>
    <P>The Director of Public Prosecution feels the sentence for the killers of Detective Garda McCabe was too lenient. However, the killers have applied to the High Court for release. That is not good enough. I echo the opinion of Ann McCabe, widow of Detective Garda Gerry McCabe. She stated: &ldquo;All gardaí and decent people throughout this country will be behind us in ensuring that the release of these people will not happen.&rdquo; There is no way the decent people of Ireland will stand for it. We are at a crucial point in history and all of us are praying for peace, but the murderers of Gerry McCabe cannot be allowed to be released under the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>One Sinn Féin activist, in particular, in my constituency has been involved in the Agreement negotiations and other activities and is one of a number of people promoting the release of the murderers of Detective Garda McCabe in the name of republicanism. Their crime was committed in the name of terrorism. I want the Minister to tell his ministerial colleagues there is no way the decent people of Ireland would comprehend the release of these people. They should be locked away for good.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent historic events and thank the Minister and the Taoiseach for the time and effort they have put in. There is a great challenge ahead, but the era of the bullet and the gun must <Col N="588" /> be consigned to history. I ask loyalists to follow the IRA and allow the people of Northern Ireland to live in peace. Let us root out the terrorists for once and for all because all the decent people of Ireland want is to be able to work and live in a peaceful, harmonious democracy as they raise their families.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for Education and Science for taking time out of his busy schedule to answer this question. It is an issue that arose at a meeting of Cavan-Leitrim Vocational Educational Committee of which I am honoured to be a member. The issue was raised by a colleague of mine who comes from Drumkeeran where the Lough Allen College is located and there has been a question raised about the provision of facilities and resources which forms part of my question to the Minister. I would be grateful for his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House my Department's current position regarding this matter. The new PLC course in Business (Secretarial) at Lough Allen College was approved on 15 June 2001 by my Department's further education section. Further education section was in touch with the VEC's chief executive officer, yesterday 24 October concerning accommodation. I understand the course is now proceeding normally at Lough Allen College and that rented accommodation is not required. I also understand that major extension to the school has been approved and is at the physical planning stage. My Department is currently assessing what assistance it can offer Lough Allen College towards the cost of computers in the context of available resources and on-going commitments. In this regard, I would like to explain that there is an annual approved process whereby schools are required to obtain official sanction each year for PLC courses. As part of this process, schools are informed that PLC courses should not be considered unless a sufficient number of applicants, suitable special accommodation, equipment and appropriately qualified teachers are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All PLC courses are funded through the provision of enhanced teaching resources and the payment of capitation grants to the school authorities in the same way as other second level programmes. In the case of PLC courses, 1.25 teachers are allocated per group of 20, and an <Col N="589" /> additional capitation grant of £146 per pupil is paid, over and above the normal grants for second level pupils, towards overheads and equipment costs. Where schools already running PLC courses experience particular difficulties in maintaining or replacing identified items of equipment, a case can be made to the further education section for extra assistance on a once-off basis. Such appeals are dealt with on their merits and can only be met out of any funds remaining after regular commitments have been honoured.</P>
    <P>The extent of my Department's ongoing commitments in relation to available resources means that decisions on special funding appeals cannot be made before the year end. I have arranged for the needs of Lough Allen College for additional computer facilities to be examined in that context in December. Should new needs arise in the future regarding rented accommodation, my Department will also examine the matter sympathetically.</P>
    <P>Lough Allen College was originally intended to accommodate 150 pupils. However two additional classrooms were added into the schedule of accommodation and the VEC also converted additional space into two further classroom areas. The college operates an outdoor education PLC course off campus 4 days per week, as well as the secretarial course, and I am assured that both are running satisfactorily in the existing accommodation.</P>
    <P>The PLC programme was introduced in 1985 to provide appropriate vocational training for young people to bridge the gap between school and work. The programme is delivered by a network of over 230 schools and colleges throughout the country in the vocational, secondary and community and comprehensive school sector, but the bulk of provision is in vocational colleges. Currently there are over 1,400 courses to choose from in over 60 disciplines providing for some 26,300 students in the academic year 2001-02.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister and acknowledge his continuing understanding and sympathy for what is an extensive proposed capital rebuilding programme in County Leitrim with two proposed mergers and three VEC schools.

I thank you, a Cathaoirligh, for allowing this matter on the Adjournment.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to take this debate. Meelick national school is situated in south-east Clare about two miles from Limerick city. Currently there are about 180 students in the school. There are eight teachers, three assistants and a resource teacher. The school was built in 1959 but no major structural work has been carried out since <Col N="590" /> then. A number of Portacabins have been added on to the school which are in an extremely bad condition.</P>
      <P>The situation is chronic and I am surprised there has not been a major outcry in the area before now. The children are squashed into the classrooms with access and ease of movement almost completely restricted. The teachers find it difficult to move around the classroom. In a number of the rooms the windows are nailed down because of their condition. There is only one staff toilet in the school. Some doors are blocked in the portacabins because they are literally falling down &ndash; this is a very serious health and safety issue, particularly in relation to fire safety. The staff room doubles as a learning support room and some of the pupils are taught in the corridors. In one instance a child who needed an orthopaedic chair could not bring the chair in due to the congestion and inaccessibility in the school and was forced to sit at a wooden desk. It is most unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>The quality of the drinking water supply is also a problem and there is infestation with mice. The floors are rotting. Some of the pupils' toilets are used as storage areas and the schoolyard shelter is about to collapse. One of the portacabin roofs is falling down. There is one small cloakroom for 124 children in one section of the school and there are only three toilets for 93 boys. There is no car park.</P>
      <P>The school was recently visited by a senior environmental health officer from the Mid-Western Health Board. I am sorry to report that he has written to the Department of Education and Science within the last few days about what he found in the school. His responsibilities include general structure and repair, provision of adequate sanitary facilities, provision of potable drinking water for both pupils and staff to comply with European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988, provision of adequate ventilation, absence of overcrowding and adequate pest control. He states that from perusal of an attached complaint report it is evident that accepted standards of compliance are not being met. Adequate sanitary facilities, a safe potable water supply and adequate ventilation should be provided. A proper pest control plan should be put in place to preclude or control rodent presence or infestation. Other concerns regarding health and fire safety are not within the remit of his office; however, he would strongly recommend that these issues be reviewed by the appropriate section of the Department of Education and Science inspectorate and that the fire safety issues be brought to the attention of the chief fire officer at Clare County Council by the Department. He is currently examining the quality of the water serving the school premises and will duly be sending a report to the inspectorate of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister can see that this is unacceptable. It is urgently required that he arrange, and I am sure he will do so, to have some senior personnel <Col N="591" /> from the planning and building unit of the Department to come to Meelick and visit the school. When the site has been inspected, consideration should be given to purchasing lands at the back of the school to enable the school to expand in a satisfactory manner and on a basis acceptable to both teachers and pupils. This will enhance the quality of education, the facilities in which the pupils spend their day and the environment in which the teachers provide their skills.</P>
    <P>There is a crisis. This is unacceptable and deserves priority attention from the Department. I ask the Minister to provide that attention by immediately sending personnel from the Department to examine the entire building and site.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Senator has given me the opportunity to outline to the House the position of the Department of Education and Science regarding the provision of improved accommodation at Meelick national school.</P>
      <P>The school's present staff consists of a principal and five mainstream assistants plus one remedial teacher and one resource teacher, both based at the school. The current enrolment is 171 pupils. The school's present facilities consist of four permanent classrooms in the main school building, a general purpose room, which I understand is in use as a classroom, and two prefabs that were provided by the Department in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="592" />The Department has received an application for grant aid towards the cost of improvement works at the school. The Senator will appreciate that there has been a massive and unprecedented increase in the funds allocated by this Government to the schools building programme at all levels. Decisions relating to the rate of progress of these projects, including Meelick national school, will be taken in the light of the allocations to be made for school building purposes in the forthcoming Estimates.</P>
    <P>The Senator mentioned the condition of the prefabs. In the interim it would be possible to obtain new prefabs if necessary. I can arrange an inspection although we may find that the building unit is aware of the condition of the site. The Department is fully committed to the provision of improved accommodation at Meelick national school and I thank the Senator again for giving me the opportunity to outline the position to the House. I will look into the suggestion of an inspection.</P>
