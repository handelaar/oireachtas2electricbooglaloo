      <P>I have received notice from Senator Bonner that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to clarify the future of the Arramara Teoranta seaweed plant at Meenmore, Dungloe, County Donegal, following his announcement on Monday, 25 June.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re increase in membership of An Bord Pleanála to be referred to the Joint Committee on the Environmental and Local Government, to be taken without debate; No. 2, motion re powers of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, to be taken without debate; No. 3, motion re Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, to be taken for one hour, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes and of all other Senators not to exceed five minutes, if time is available; No. 4, Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Bill, 2001 &ndash; Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes; No. 5, Company Law Enforcement Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage, to be taken at 3 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes; No. 6, Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes.</P>

      <P>Does the Acting Leader have information as to when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney Gen<Col N="662" /> eral will publish their reports on the arms crisis? The Acting Leader will remember that I asked the Leader this question on two occasions last week and he will also remember that more than six or eight weeks ago the Leader promised that these reports would be debated in the House. There has been some slippage on the finalisation of these reports and the suspicion must be that the Minister and the Attorney General do not want them to appear before the Houses rise because they do not want them debated in these Houses. Can the Acting Leader clarify that matter for me?</P>
      <P>On the question of the post-Nice fall-out, it will be a scandal if there is not a debate in this House before the recess on the implications of the referendum and on the way ahead. Even though our timetable looks full this week, the Acting Leader can read a parliamentary timetable better than most and if he scrutinises tomorrow's and Thursday's business he will see gaps where we could begin that discussion. Tomorrow we could debate motion No. 24 on this matter in the names of the Independent Senators. It does not go far enough but it would provide a framework to begin our discussion. I am aware that Senator O'Toole has other proposals to invite the Commissioner to address the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have written to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges about a debate on that issue. Members will be aware of my view of Commissioner Solbes, which I have expressed on a number of occasions. I will return to this matter after the meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise two issues. Yesterday the Central Bank issued a statement calling for budgetary restraint. The House badly needs to know how the Minister for Finance intends to respond to that. It is anachronistic that with the economy facing a downturn the Central Bank should call for budgetary restraint when we should be investing more in the economy and in infrastructure, both for now and the future. There appears to be a conflict between the Central Bank and the Minister for Finance. I ask the Acting Leader to arrange, before the recess, for the Minister to come before the House to engage with us, not in a confrontational but in a discursive manner, and to explain his budgetary policy and how it fits in with the statements of the Central Bank and the European position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other issue I wish to raise has been raised with me numerous times in the past fortnight by school management authorities and parents. It is the extraordinary shortage of teachers at primary level, a shortage which has not been experienced for many decades in primary education. Some schools in the city area are working with a complement of staff less than half of whom are fully qualified. With schools and classes doubling up, it is an extraordinary problem. I do not wish to debate it now but I ask the Minister for Education and Science to recognise that desperate <Col N="663" /> remedies are needed to deal with this situation. We must be flexible and creative in our approach to produce a large number of teachers in the primary sector where they are badly needed.</P>
    <P>The Minister should come before the House and demonstrate an openness to suggestions. They might not be acceptable to everybody but we must meet this challenge without diluting the quality of teachers' qualifications. There is a huge problem and I am sure all Members of the House have been in contact with schools who cannot get teachers to fill vacancies. As a result, pupils are being taught by unqualified and untrained personnel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the Nice treaty. I have asked nearly every day for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come before the House. Last week the European Union bandwagon came to this country and met all groups except the Parliament, despite our requests for a meeting. It is unsatisfactory that Parliament should be bypassed in this fashion. The Minister for Foreign Affairs must come to the House and explain the Government's thinking on this matter. He should also address the question of requests from this House to a Commissioner going unheeded. What is the response of the Department of Foreign Affairs to this? It is an insult to the House.</P>
      <P>I seek a debate on Northern Ireland before the House goes into recess. Ideally, it should have taken place already. Next Sunday is the deadline for the resignation tendered by the First Minister to come into effect. We are facing a huge crisis both in terms of the collapse of the Good Friday Agreement and its institutions and the commencement of the marching season on 1 July, when the First Minister's resignation comes into force. It would be worthwhile to have a debate on the matter, particularly given the escalating violence in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The other debate I seek also relates to violence, but to violence on the sports field. Everybody saw the extraordinary match where a sportsman was assaulted on 11 different occasions by the same person. This went on under the full glare of the cameras in the presence of 40,000 people, yet there has been no charge of assault. That is international sports. If somebody can assault another person on the field of play, it is a terrible example to our young people. One cannot do such a thing on the street. The message coming across from that is a bad one. I want the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, to come into the House and explain the Government's position on this matter. I did not hear a word from the Government on it, even though an Irish citizen was seriously assaulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's call to make the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, aware of the shortage of teachers <Col N="664" /> and the fact that there are not suitable candidates coming on stream in education for the future.</P>
      <P>There is another issue which is important to me and which I want to bring to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as well as the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. It has to do with the legislation we enacted some time ago dealing with the problem of Travellers. The legislation is not working and that is why I am a little concerned. Sections of it indicate that the local authorities should be able to move the Travellers on from areas within the one mile limit. However, it seems there is a question regarding the role of the Garda in this regard, whether they have the power to intrude in open spaces to deal with this. I do not know where to go.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make the Minister aware that there is a problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other ways of making the Minister aware of this problem than on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It needs to be said in this Chamber because the Garda's lack of power in dealing with the problem is becoming an important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to comment on what I see as the bad ordering of business in this House. There are six significant items being taken today, three motions and three Bills. I am supposed to be the Whip of the Independent group and I was not consulted about any of this business. We were promised last week a list and a timetable up to the dissolution. We have not received it. Therefore I move amendment No. 1 to the Order of Business, that we take item No. 22, motion 24, before No. 1.</P>
      <P>It seems that Members on both sides of the House are interested in this issue. It is a clear and specific motion which relates to the queries raised by other Members of the House. It requests the Minister for Foreign Affairs to give an account of his discussions with his colleagues in Europe and the fall-out from the rejection of the Nice treaty in its original form by the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do this for one specific reason. Over the weekend I was contacted by the office of Mrs. Dana Rosemary Scallon. Her aide indicated to me that they had attempted to get a meeting for the Members of the Oireachtas with the President of the Commission and his office in Dublin had said that they specifically did not want such a meeting to take place. That is an extraordinary way to treat elected Members of a national Parliament and we are entitled to an explanation why the repeated calls from my colleagues, Senator <Col N="665" /> O'Toole, Senator Ross and several others, have been ignored by the President of the Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>These are points which can be made in the debate on your motion, but Senator O'Toole has also indicated that he has raised this matter or written to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on the matter. It will be debated at Committee on Procedure and Privileges and I am sure it will come back to the House for further debate. You have made the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to get an explanation for this insult to the elected representatives, as I understand it. If what was said to me clearly on the telephone is true, we are entitled to an explanation. I do not want to prejudge the issue but my informant was quite clear and specific about the attitude of the Commission's office here. It is something with which we need to deal as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to preface my remarks by saying that I do not support Senator Norris's proposal for an amendment to the Order of Business but I do support Senator Manning's call in the initial response to the Order of Business for a debate on the consequences of the rejection of the Treaty of Nice. As you will be aware, a Chathaoirligh, I raised this issue a couple of weeks ago in the immediate aftermath of the referendum and I asked that there would be a structured series of debates because of the complexities involved and the fact that there is a need to have more than one debate. While I welcome Senator Manning's initiative, will the Acting Leader indicate if the Whips will discuss a structure for a series of debates specific to the Treaty of Nice in the context of the Taoiseach's proposal for the establishment of a forum for Europe? I hope civil society will become involved in the forum and that it will disabuse the concern by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side that they will be excluded from what will be a democratic process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on the Nice treaty. Will the Acting Leader bring to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children the fact that each year 60 women die from cervical cancer, the most preventable of all cancers? We were promised that a national programme for cervical screening would be established in 1999 but progress is slow. There is a ten week waiting time for the results of screening, which is a cause of enormous anxiety to women. The Minister must, as a matter of urgency, put the necessary resources into ensuring that the national screening programme is in place and that there is a speedier processing of test results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Acting Leader ask the Minister responsible for motor insurance to attend the House to debate the high cost of insurance, especially for young drivers? Many of <Col N="666" /> them are unable to afford it and those who can often have great difficulty making their payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Norris's call for a debate on No. 22, motion 24. Will the Acting Leader organise a debate on the situation in the acute hospitals before the recess? Senator O'Toole said there is a dire situation in the schools but it is much worse in the hospitals. The House will be aware that a woman who has been refused treatment for cancer for five months recently took her case to the courts to try to get treatment. That is not an isolated case. It is extraordinary that people with curable cancer must go to such lengths to get treatment. It will be seriously remiss of us if we show no concern about the appalling situation in the acute hospitals before the recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's request for a debate on the call by the Central Bank for budgetary constraint. Some economists are forecasting that there may be budget deficits within a period of four to five years. It therefore behoves us to be prudent and to take note of what is being said. While the Minister for Health and Children has allocated extra funding of £2 billion to health, there is a suspicion that much of it has been diverted to wages and salaries with the result that the customers have not benefited. There is a need for a debate on this.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Ormonde's call to reconsider the legislation on Travellers' accommodation. The indiscriminate parking of caravans in many areas is leading to widespread public agitation. The disregard for the settled community creates great difficulty in addressing the issue of much needed accommodation for Travellers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I have taken note of all the points raised and I will try to give a reasonable and fair response. Senator Manning raised the completion of the investigation regarding the Arms Trial. I am reliably informed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that it is nearing completion. The results may be already with the Attorney General and it is hoped that they will be before the Houses of the Oireachtas before the summer recess. That may not be possible and I suggest the position is reviewed and updated at the end of the week. However, that is the information available to me at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Senators sought a debate on the aftermath of the Nice referendum. Such a debate would be welcomed by all sides if it was possible to make time available for it between now and the recess. I will bring the Members' views to the attention of the appropriate Minister and I will revert to the House on the matter. This issue is <Col N="667" /> linked to an amendment to the Order of Business moved by Senator Norris and also the matter on which Senator O'Toole has written to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. It is advisable to refer that matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>Mr. Prodi and Mr. Solbes should have agreed to a request to meet Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas last week. However, I wonder if the request was made in strong terms through the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Senator Norris's disagreeing with the Order of Business today will not change my mind on the matter. I will do my best in relation to it and if some items of legislation are finalised today by agreement, it might create some elbow room for a debate on these matters in the House tomorrow or later in the week.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole and others, including Senator Walsh, referred to the restraints the Central Bank wants the Minister for Finance to impose in the context of the budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We should listen to the Central Bank. but the budgets introduced by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, over the past four years have not been wrong for the people. While I cannot make a decision now, I will bring the matter to the Minister's attention and ask him if it is possible to come to the House before the recess. However, as the Cathaoirleach repeatedly points out, many of the issues raised by Senators should be submitted as matters on the Adjournment and other appropriate debates. I watched with interest over the past month and there were a number of days when no matters on the Adjournment were tabled. Members on both sides should avail of such debates to highlight issues.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Costello's condemnation of what happened to Ronan O'Gara on the rugby field and I thank the Senator for bringing the matter to the notice of the House. I merely saw a clip of the incident on the television news and I was disappointed to learn that the man who committed the assault was suspended for only seven weeks. A person guilty of a similar assault on the street might spend a number of years in jail. My party and I condemn the assault and the manner in which it was dealt with by the rugby authorities.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole and Ormonde raised the question of the shortage of teachers in the House. I did not mean to say &ldquo;the House&rdquo;&ndash; there are enough teachers in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to make sure to return the same number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senators raised the shortage of teachers. I will bring the matter to the <Col N="668" /> notice of the Minister and it will be debated if there is time. It is my intention, during the next couple of days, to discuss with the Opposition Whips the matters which should be given priority during the last weeks of the session.</P>
      <P>Cancer, in all its forms, is a dreadful disease. I am sorry if what Senators Keogh and Henry say is true, that there are deficiencies in the system and people are not being dealt with. I have had a number of letters with regard to services in the Kerry region and I will bring the matter to the notice of the Minister. I know much is being done and that both sides of the House appreciate that this is happening. However, it appears that it is not enough.</P>
      <P>The question of motor insurance is a hardy annual. I was under the impression that ending the practice of juries deciding the amount of awards would bring about a reduction in the cost of motor insurance. This has not happened and it is becoming harder for young drivers to pay for motor insurance. A premium of £2,000 is not unusual for a young driver. If there is time for a debate on this question I will arrange for that.</P>
      <P>Northern Ireland should be a priority for debate before the end of the session. It would be a pity if the great work which has been done in the past three or four years should come to nothing. It is not beyond the powers of politicians to argue and resolve their differences across a table. The violence on the streets of Northern Ireland in recent weeks is hard to comprehend, given the years of peace we have enjoyed. Surely the people of Northern Ireland realise that the only way forward is through peace. I appeal to all public representatives in Northern Ireland to make every effort to resume talks and to get down to running the country. To the people who are causing the violence I say it is time to call a halt now.</P>
      <P>There seem to be ongoing problems with the Traveller community. No matter how many halting sites are being provided and how many of their demands are being met, I notice regularly on my drive home where Travellers are pulled in to the side of the road. There is one group in Limerick who brought in a JCB to make a site for themselves at the side of the road. They have been there for about two or three months. If any of us did that we would be moved on in a matter of days. We should revisit this issue and see what powers the Garda can exercise.</P>
      <P>It is not easy for the Travellers to find a place but I was under the impression that most towns now have halting sites and these should be utilised. It is my belief that those people we are talking about are coming from England during the summertime. They seem to drive very fancy cars and jeeps and have good caravans. I will try to facilitate Senator Norris's request over the next few days.</P>

      <P>The resolution before the House today seeks approval for the continuance in force of those sections of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, which would otherwise cease to be in operation on 30 June 2001. Members of this House will need no reminding of the circumstances in which these provisions were enacted in 1998. The Omagh bomb in August of that year was the single worst atrocity in the conflict in Northern Ireland. It gave rise to universal revulsion and to a determination, nowhere more so than in this House, that those responsible for this mass murder would not succeed in subverting the democratically expressed will of the people on this island that the conflict should be resolved only by peaceful means and on the basis of consent. One person is currently before the courts on a charge related to the Omagh bomb and the investigation is continuing. The Garda Síochána will never give up the search for those responsible.</P>
      <P>The intention of the Oireachtas in enacting the 1998 Act was to strengthen as far as legitimately possible the provisions of the Offences against the State Acts dealing with subversives, to enhance the capacity of the Garda Síochána and the criminal justice system to deter and detect those who would seek to subvert the democratic order and impose their undemocratic will on the people of this island through violence. In recognition of the particular circumstances surrounding enactment of the provisions of the 1998 Act, there was general agreement that the Act should be regularly revisited by the Oireachtas to see if the circumstances then prevailing justified the continuance in force of its provisions or whether there had been a change in circumstances sufficient to convince the Oireachtas that the provisions were no longer needed. Under section 18 of the Act, therefore, as amended by section 37 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, and by virtue of resolutions passed by each House of the Oireachtas on 20 June 2000, sections 2 to 12, inclusive, 14 and 17 will cease to operate on and from 30 June 2001 unless a further resolution is passed by each House authorising the sections to continue to operate for such period not exceeding 12 months as may be specified in the resolution.</P>
      <P>Included in the Act also was a requirement on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to lay before each House of the Oireachtas a report on the operation of the Act prior to consideration by the Houses of the renewal of the provisions. I laid such a report before this House on 21 June. I will go into more detail on the information contained in the report shortly, but its conclusion is that the renewal of the provisions for a further year is necessary. The sad reality is that those responsible for the Omagh bombing have, in the past year, continued their campaign of violence and there is no change of substance to the circumstances which led to the enactment of the 1998 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="671" /> I will turn now to the individual sections which this House is asked to continue in force for a further 12 months, outline their purpose and indicate where they have been utilised in the past 12 months. Section 2 provides that where, in any proceedings against a person for membership of an unlawful organisation, evidence is given that the accused when questioned failed to answer or gave false or misleading answers to any question material to the investigation of the offence, the court may draw such inferences from that failure or from the furnishing of a false or misleading reply as appear proper. As mentioned in my report which is before this House, this provision has been utilised on many occasions in questioning persons arrested on suspicion of being members of an unlawful organisation. Charges do not of course result in every case in which the provision is used but during the period of the report, in other words over the past year charges were preferred in five significant cases in which section 2 was utilised. One of these cases resulted in a conviction, while the other four cases are currently before the courts.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that, in proceedings for an offence of membership of an unlawful organisation, the accused must give notification of an intention to call a person to give evidence on his or her behalf, unless the court permits otherwise.</P>
    <P>Section 4 amends section 3 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972. The effect of the 1972 provision is that any statement or conduct by a person accused of membership of an unlawful organisation implying or leading to a reasonable inference that he was at a material time a member of such an organisation shall be evidence that he or she was then such a member. It originally defined the expression &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; as including an omission by an accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation. The change made by section 4 of the 1998 Act was to expand the definition of &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; to include movements, actions, activities or associations. This simply aligns the definition of conduct in the 1972 Act with the reference to movements, actions, activities or associations used in section 2 of the 1998 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the drawing of adverse inferences in the prosecution of a person for any offence under the Offences against the State Acts, any offence scheduled under the Acts and any offence arising out of the same set of facts as such an offence, provided the offence carries a penalty of five years imprisonment or more. The effect of this section is to allow a court to draw inferences where the accused relies on a fact in his or her defence that he or she could reasonably have been expected to mention during questioning or on being charged but did not do so. This section, as with section 2, incorporated important safeguards whereby it will not have effect unless the accused was told in ordinary language what the effect of a failure to mention such a fact might <Col N="672" /> be and provides that a person shall not be convicted solely on an inference drawn from such failure.</P>
    <P>Section 6 established the offence of directing, at any level of the organisation's structure, the activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made under the Offences against the State Act, 1939. One person is currently before the courts charged with such an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 7 made it an offence to possess articles in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the article is in his or her possession for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of specified firearms or explosives offences.</P>
    <P>Section 8 made it an offence to collect, record or possess information which is of such a nature that it is likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation in the commission of serious offences. Two persons are currently before the courts on charges under this section.</P>
    <P>Section 9 made it an offence to withhold information which a person knows or believes might be of material assistance in preventing the commission by any other person of a serious offence or securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of any other person for such an offence and who fails without reasonable excuse to disclose such information to a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Section 10 extends the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act, which otherwise is 48 hours, to 72 hours on the authorisation of a District Court judge. The judge must be satisfied, on the application of an officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent, that the further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously. The person being detained is entitled to be present in court during the application and to make, or to have made, submissions on his or her behalf. In the past year, 27 persons have had their periods of detention extended under this provision and nine of these were subsequently charged with offences. Two of these persons have been convicted and the remaining cases are before the courts.</P>
    <P>Section 11 allows a District Court judge to permit the rearrest and detention of a person in respect of an offence for which he or she was previously detained under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act, but released without charge. This further period must not exceed 24 hours, and can only be authorised in circumstances where the District Court judge is satisfied, on information supplied on oath by a member of the Garda Síochána, that further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda Síochána about that person's suspected participation in the offence and about which they wish to question the suspect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" /> Section 12 made it an offence for a person to instruct or train another person in the making or use of firearms or explosives or to receive such training without lawful authority or reasonable excuse. Six persons were convicted during the past year with offences under this section.</P>
    <P>The effect of section 14 is to make these new offences scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the 1939 Act. This means that persons suspected of committing such offences are liable to arrest under section 30 of the 1939 Act and can be charged in relation to such offences on the direction of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Section 17 builds on the provision in the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, providing for the forfeiture of property. Essentially, the 1994 provision empowers a court, in its discretion, whenever any person is convicted of an offence, to order the forfeiture of any property in the possession of that person which was used, or intended to be used, to facilitate the commission of the offence. The effect of section 17 is, in the case of a person convicted of specified offences relating to the possession of firearms or explosives and where there is property liable to forfeiture under the 1994 Act, to require the court to order the forfeiture of such property unless it is satisfied that there would be a serious risk of injustice if it made such an order.</P>
    <P>This information on the use made of these provisions of the 1998 Act over the past year is based on information received from the Garda authorities and is contained in the report on the Act laid by me before this House. When contrasted with the previous report, it shows that, more and more, the key provisions of the Act are taking effect. I have always made the point that it would take time for the Act to take effect. Some provisions of the Act, such as extended detention, of their nature have an immediate impact. Others, however, were always going to take time to have effect, such as the new offences created by the Act where time is needed to build a case for prosecution, or the provisions for drawing adverse inferences which only take effect when a case comes to court. We are now seeing the results coming through.</P>
    <P>The section 2 provision for adverse inferences has been used in five cases, resulting in one conviction and four pending charges. One person has been charged, under section 6, with directing the activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made. Two persons have been charged under section 8 in relation to information likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation and six persons have been convicted, under section 12, of instructing or training another person in the making or use of firearms or explosives.</P>
    <P>At the same time, it should be noted that the number of persons held under extended detention under section 10 over the past year was 27, a relatively modest number and one which, taken together with all of the other information I have outlined, goes to support my view that the pro<Col N="674" /> visions of the Act are reasoned and proportionate, and are being implemented by the Gárda Síochána in a measured and restrained manner. There are, of course, some provisions which have not yet taken effect in the context of court proceedings, but even here the Garda authorities have informed me that the provisions in question have been utilised where appropriate by the gardaí during the investigation of offences. Members of this House will appreciate, of course, that many of the investigations at issue are, of their nature, ongoing.</P>
    <P>The Gárda Síochána has had considerable success over the past year in combating those who would subvert, through the use of violence, the democratic wishes of the people on this island and I am sure the House will join with me in congratulating the force on its achievements. But the threat to life and to our democratic values, which led to the enactment of the 1998 Act, remains. So too, I am sure, does the determination of this House never to give in to such a threat, but to provide the Gárda Síochána and the criminal justice system with all legitimate means of combating it. The 1998 Act is an important part of those means. It is proving its worth and I ask the House to continue it in force.</P>
    <P>In addition to these security concerns which alone would, I believe, justify the continuance in force of these provisions, there is another consideration in favour of their continuance in force. The Offences Against the State Acts, including the 1998 Act, are currently under review by a committee under the chairmanship of former Supreme Court judge, Mr. Justice Anthony Hederman, on foot of a commitment in the Good Friday Agreement. The review is, I understand, approaching finalisation. Indeed, I have just received an interim report on the Special Criminal Court which I will shortly be publishing and I expect the committee will submit its final report in the coming months. It clearly would make no sense to allow the provisions of the 1998 Act to lapse before the committee reported its conclusions on those very provisions.</P>
    <P>Much has been achieved in the implementation of the peace process and much remains to be done but there are still those who would threaten to subvert that process through violence. The 1998 Act is part of the democratic response to that threat, and I ask the House to continue in force the relevant provisions of that Act for a further 12 months. I commend the resolution to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that it is necessary for the House to put in place again, for another year, sections 2 to 12, 14 and 17 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1998. In his speech the Minister has given good reasoned justification why this needs to be done. It is regrettable that, despite the Good Friday Agreement and the deep yearning for peace by the overwhelming majority of people north and south of the Border, there are people within our com<Col N="675" /> munity who still want to subvert the power of the State, who still want to create mayhem resulting in loss of life and engage in paramilitary activities. The evidence put before the House by the Minister is ample proof that there is a requirement for these sections to be in place and we support the measures being taken.</P>
      <P>No democratic country would wish to have to implement such legislation, except as a last resort. Unfortunately, however, we must address the situation that exists. Provisions in the different sections ensure the person being investigated or questioned has protections under the Constitution, which is very evident in particular in section 2 which provides that the failure to answer cannot on its own lead to conviction of an offence. It is also important that the section ensures it is explained to the person being questioned, in plain and ordinary language, the dangers for them in failing to comply and answer questions.</P>
      <P>The figures mentioned by the Minister are revealing. Obviously, most of the sections have been used, some to a considerable extent, which is proof of the necessity to keep them in place.</P>
      <P>While this deals specifically with paramilitaries within our country, persons could be prosecuted within the State for acts committed outside the State. I am concerned that in more recent times international terrorists may be setting up small cells in Ireland and I wonder if the Act will apply to those groupings as it is important it should. Given that in the recent referendum we changed the Constitution to provide for the International Court of Justice, will there be interlinking between this Act and that court? Is there a way in which both can work together? Perhaps this legislation could be used in a broader ambit in terms of organisations which are not necessarily within the jurisdiction of Ireland and England. I would like the Minister to elaborate upon and clarify this matter.</P>
      <P>The figures given by the Minister are fascinating. A number of convictions have taken place under section 2 and currently there are four cases before the courts, which is significant. It is all the more interesting that this has occurred under what is a convoluted section. Section 5 also has safeguards, which is important, as the accused must be told in ordinary language the effect of their failure to mention facts of material relevance in an investigation.</P>
      <P>On section 6 the Minister said one person is currently before the courts. The section established the offence of directing, at any level of an organisation's structure, the activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made. Does the Minister envisage that more use will be made of the section? I thought more people might have been brought before the courts under the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has anyone been questioned or is anybody before the courts under section 7? The section refers to being in possession of an article for a <Col N="676" /> purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of specified firearms or explosives offences. Two persons are currently before the courts under section 8. Are these people within the jurisdiction or do they come and go? Can the Minister give any more detail than he has already laid before the House?</P>
    <P>Some 27 persons have been questioned under the extension of time section in the past year, a relatively moderate number. Of the 27, nine are charged with offences, two have been convicted and the remaining seven are before the courts. That is ample evidence that section 10 needs to remain in force, although it is unfortunate to have to say that in a democratic institution.</P>
    <P>Section 12 makes it an offence for a person to instruct or train another person in the making and use of firearms. Under that section, six persons have been convicted. Are any other people currently charged or are there any investigations ongoing under the section, given that six convictions is quite a substantial number? </P>
    <P>I compliment the Garda Síochána on their work to date under this Act. They have a very difficult and dangerous job and are owed the full support of this House in the circumstances. I am sorry we have to renew this Act for another 12 months. I hope the political climate will change and that people who are of a mind to subvert the State will decide to go the peaceful route. It is highly unlikely that this will happen within the next 12 months and this Minister or another will be back here in 12 months' time again asking the Oireachtas to renew these sections. The motion has the full support of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too support this motion. While the measures contained in the Act, particularly the sections referred to here, are draconian, they have been proved to work. It is regrettable that we need such measures. However, there is in existence a self-professed small army terming itself the Real IRA, which has not come into line with the Good Friday Agreement and, although the numbers involved are small, the security of the State must take precedence.</P>
      <P>The Minister is proposing a 12 month extension of these very extensive measures, the most important of which relates to the right to remain silent. That right is written into our Constitution and our legal system. Under section 2 of the Act under discussion it is provided that if a suspect who is being questioned on serious issues involving arms or bomb-making equipment or support for a certain organisation remains silent, senior members of the Garda Síochána are entitled to make certain inferences. That is probably one of the most important features of this Act. The right to remain silent in these circumstances is varied for the greater security of the State and to combat terrorism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and the Garda Síochána on their huge success to date in such matters, particularly on the success of the Crimi<Col N="677" /> nal Assets Bureau in dealing with people who are involved in subversive organisations which are sometimes interlinked with drugs, racketeering and so on. The Criminal Assets Bureau is hitting criminals where it hurts most, in their pockets, and the Minister is to be congratulated for that.</P>
    <P>I also compliment the Minister, on the fourth birthday of the current Dáil, on the fact that during that four-year period there has been a 30% reduction in crime, but it is not enough. Work in that area must continue. However, this Minister is seen as a reforming Minister and the amount of legislation he has initiated since he was appointed Minister four years ago is tremendous. Furthermore, much of it was initiated in this House. That shows the respect this Minister has for the Seanad, which we welcome. I urge other Ministers to initiate legislation here. This House is often ignored, but the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government have done much to introduce legislation and have it teased out here before it goes to the Dáil. That is an indication of great respect for this House.</P>
    <P>The success of the Good Friday Agreement is also important. People in both the Republic and the North voted for it. There will always be struggle and strains on the peace process, especially at this time of the year. I encourage measures, particularly in the North during the next few weeks, to ensure calm and respect for the communities. By their vote on the Good Friday Agreement, both communities of different traditions indicated huge support for peace. The Good Friday Agreement has created an atmosphere in which people are engaging in dialogue with each other, in which it is the political system that is working, not guns, bullets or bombs.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's effort in spearheading the Good Friday Agreement from this side of the Border must also be recognised. The Minister played a key role in the negotiations and continues to do so. It is also important to recognise the interaction and co-operation between the Chief Constable of the RUC and the Garda Commissioner in combating serious crime and creating an atmosphere where it is no longer tolerated that somebody who commits a crime can cross the Border to hide.</P>
    <P>That these measures have been used on only 30 or 40 occasions since they were introduced indicates that they are invoked only in extreme circumstances. They are draconian, but while the threat of a self-professed army however big or small remains, vigilance on the part of the Garda, the Minister and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is the most advisable approach and the lesser of two evils.</P>
    <P>Since the Offences Against the State Act was introduced, there has been a plethora of Acts, including the 1998 Act. The Minister mentioned the very important fact that currently a very eminent Supreme Court judge, Judge Anthony Hederman, is reviewing all this legislation on foot of a commitment given under the Good Friday <Col N="678" /> Agreement. An interim report has been laid before the Minister and he is waiting on a final report which will most likely be laid before him in the next few months. It is prudent and wise that the Oireachtas take cognisance of the report and wait until the final report by Judge Hederman is laid before the Minister and the Houses.</P>
    <P>This resolution enables the particular sections of the 1998 Act to continue in force for another 12 months. If the Minister does not go ahead with this resolution, these sections will lapse. We are then playing into the hands of terrorism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear this legislation is a continuing response to the kind of outrage we saw at Omagh. The State has a right to defend itself against armed conspiracy. It also has an obligation to defend the integrity of the lives of its citizen, so one has to see this sort of legislation in that context. I would like at the outset to ask the Minister to congratulate the Garda Síochána on the discovery of a 60 lb bomb yesterday, which certainly could have caused havoc. It is very good that this material was intercepted.</P>
      <P>However, I have certain reservations about some of the sections, particularly in the light of the civil and human rights aspects of this legislation. Although one accepts that in the circumstances prevailing on both parts of the island at the moment the Government has a responsibility to take strict action, it is also the responsibility of this House to operate as a critical reviewing body. It is significant that the principal Government spokesman said that he regards this as draconian, and draconian is what I would call this legislation. For example, the limitations or, indeed, the removal in certain circumstances of the right to silence is a worrying factor in this legislation. In fact, the whole of section 2 would cause me a fair amount of concern, particularly the provision where in any proceedings against a person for membership of an unlawful organisation evidence is given that the accused when questioned failed to answer or gave a false or misleading answer to any question material to the investigation of the event, the court may draw such inferences from that failure or from the furnishing of a false or misleading reply as appear proper. The drawing of inferences of this kind is a very delicate matter and it does affect the right to be silent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like reassurance from the Minister that suggestions made by many people, including myself &ndash; I remember making it at an international meeting of police chiefs in Dublin Castle last year &ndash; that there should be pretty well universal videoing of interviews. Perhaps the Minister could indicate whether these kinds of interviews are currently being videoed and will continue to be videoed because it seems to me that in those particularly tense circumstances where members of the police feel there is an armed conspiracy against the State, that these are dangerous people, that these are people who may very well have been involved in the murder of some of their colleagues, and where tempers <Col N="679" /> might quite easily become frayed, it is very important that both the accused person and the guards have the protection of a video record so that if there are allegations of mistreatment or allegations that confessions were beaten out of the suspects, then both sides have access to the record.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that any statement or conduct by a person accused of membership of an unlawful organisation implying or leading to a reasonable inference that he or she was at a material time a member of such an organisation shall be evidence that he or she was then such a member. That is quite a jump from a reasonable suspicion to being regarded as proof. In other words, under this legislation, opinion becomes proof. It may very well be a well informed opinion and it could be true.</P>
    <P>As I said, I would like to support the Government in measures to contain the level of violence coming from an armed conspiracy against this State and nobody who regularly attends this House or reads the record could be under any illusion as to my firm opposition to subversive organisations on both sides, north and south of the Border. However, there is a very strong responsibility and onus on the Government to ensure that, both in law and practice, this special court, because of its very special nature, should conform strictly with international standards which require, among other things, that all courts be independent and impartial. I received a briefing from Amnesty International on this area. It indicated that it feels the court should be subject to review by the courts and to regular periodic review by an independent body. Some degree of review appears to be in operation under the committee established, and we have just had one report. However, this must continue and there must be supervision by the courts &ndash; it must not be a court unto itself.</P>
    <P>The jurisdiction should be restricted to offences directly connected with the extraordinary circumstances which justify the establishment of the court and certain sections should be repealed. I look to the Minister to do this. For example, in regard to the provisions of the Offences Against the State Act permitting internment, I do not think anybody seriously imagines that, either north or south of the Border, the political situation would be enhanced by the introduction of internment. It has just become an impossible option and it should be withdrawn unless the Government can foresee situations in which internment, which is a very extreme measure and which caused great damage to the political system in the North of Ireland, was likely to be introduced.</P>
    <P>The sections permitting the arrest and detention of a person without reasonable suspicion of their having committed a recognisable criminal offence and for purposes other than bringing them before the court &ndash; section 30 of the Offences against the State Act, 1939, and section <Col N="680" /> 10 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998 &ndash; should be repealed. Amnesty International is also calling for the repeal of the section criminalising the failure of a person to provide information about their movements, which the Government is clearly continuing both in practice and in spirit in this amending legislation. I refer also to those sections which permit adverse inferences to be drawn from a person's failure to deny reports relating to alleged membership of an unlawful organisation. The senior body trusted with the monitoring of human rights in this country is directly opposed to certain central sections of the legislation and the Minister is seeking to obtain the House's agreement on the continuance of those sections.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Government's attitude to human rights, it is perfectly clear that the Government must ensure that in line with the relevant international standards, the human rights of each person arrested or detained under the Offences against the State Act are fully respected, and I am not completely convinced that under this legislation such is done. From the use of the word &ldquo;draconian&rdquo; on the other side of the House, there are at least legitimate concerns in this area.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to the fact that there is already in existence a judgment against this State in these matters from the European Court of Human Rights. I refer to the cases of Healy and McGuinness <i>v.</i> Ireland and Quinn<i> v. </i>Ireland in which section 53 of the Offences against the State Act, 1939, was held to be in violation of Articles 6.1 and 6.2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In the light of that, it seems the Government should honour its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and introduce legislation repealing section 52 of the Offences against the State Act. Where we have a court described in its very title as the Special Criminal Court, which sets it separate and gives it much greater powers than any other court on this island, that places an even stronger responsibility on us, as legislators, not only to monitor the implementation of this law and its administration, but also to monitor very clearly the Government's compliance under this legislation with good standards of human rights practice throughout the world. In particular, where a section such as section 52 has been found to be in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights, then there is a moral obligation on the Government to lay before the House an instrument amending the legislation by repealing that section or, if not, to provide evidence more cogent and convincing than that which failed to convince the European Court of Human Rights.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and the report he laid before us. When these provisions were introduced in 1998 we all spoke of the regret that they were necessary. They were introduced in the aftermath of the terrible atrocity in Omagh. Everybody stressed at the time that their introduction was necessary to <Col N="681" /> ensure that another such atrocity would not take place. It is evident from the Minister's report that it is necessary for us to give our approval to ensure that these provisions can be renewed.</P>
      <P>The Minister was at pains to point out in 1998 that the Bill would take time to take effect and from this report it is clear he was correct on that. Compared to his report last year, his report this year contains much more striking evidence of the great need to ensure these provisions continue to remain in place for another 12 months, as was said by previous speakers.</P>
      <P>The discovery of a bomb along our Border with Northern Ireland which had the potential to kill and maim many fellow Irish citizens confirms how vital and necessary it is for us to give approval to the Minister today to renew these provisions. As a democratic State, we would much prefer not to have to do this, but we must continue to keep these provisions in place, as outlined in the report.</P>
      <P>I welcome the results that are coming through. It was mentioned that section 2, which deals with provisions for adverse inferences, was used in five cases resulting in one conviction and four pending charges, with one person charged under section 6, two persons charged under section 8 in relation to information likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation and six persons convicted under section 12 of instructing or training another person in the making or use of firearms or explosives. I also note that the number of persons held under extended detention under section 10 during the past year was 27. The provisions of the Act are reasoned and proportionate and are being implemented by the Garda Síochána in a measured and restrained manner.</P>
      <P>When we have seen so much good taking place in Northern Ireland in the past few years, it is frightening to imagine there are people living among us in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland who are still prepared to threaten and subvert the peace process by way of violence. The message must be sent home loud and clear once again today that there is no place in our community or society for the terrible acts of violence and atrocities we have seen over the past 30 years in the northern part of our country.</P>
      <P>Like other speakers, I congratulate the Minister on initiating this legislation in 1998. Many people thought it would not work, but the Minister has proved today in his report that it is working very well. I congratulate the Garda Síochána on implementing the legislation successfully and also the courts of our land. We look forward to the day when a Minister will come into this House and not need to seek approval for the renewal of these provisions. That will be a good day because it will mean we will have reached the ultimate stage that the Good Friday Agreement will have worked and will continue to work. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. He was here this time last year seeking our approval for renewing these sections of this legislation. On that occasion I indicated that I was dissatisfied with the operation of the legislation. There was little use of it in the first two years of its operation, but its use has increased and 27 people have been processed under it resulting in a number of convictions.</P>
      <P>We all know the atrocity that sparked off the introduction of this legislation. I am sure no one objected to steps being taken at that time to ensure those people who were responsible for that murder and that terrible atrocity would be brought to justice. Unfortunately nobody has yet been convicted of that crime. There must be a question mark over the effectiveness of the legislation in that no conviction has taken place.</P>
      <P>We introduced these draconian measures, as Senator O'Donovan described them, on this part of the island. I am not aware that measures of such effectiveness or seriousness in terms of suspending normal legal democratic provisions were introduced in the other jurisdiction &ndash; Omagh is in the other jurisdiction. Considering that one of the Minister's functions under this legislation is to bring forward a report to us annually, will he indicate what element of this report deals with the operation of the RUC in trying to deal with the Omagh atrocity? What steps have been taken by the police force in the other jurisdiction to do that? I would have thought that a report under this legislation would also have included some reference to the purpose for which it was initiated in both jurisdictions on the island. It does not seem that the perpetrators of the Omagh bombing have been pursued effectively in the other jurisdiction. How many arrests have taken place? What legislation has been used?</P>
      <P>Apart from the case of one arrest, which is currently before the courts, that the Minister mentioned in relation to Omagh, the legislation seems to have been used to deal with paramilitary activities in the case of the other 26 people. That does not give a clear indication of progress made in bringing the perpetrators of the Omagh atrocity to justice. It is disappointing from the Minister's report that he has not focused on the Omagh atrocity, which was the main reason this legislation was introduced.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that this is draconian legislation. The periods of detention are draconian, the right to silence does not exist and there is provision for internment and the seizure of property. There are all sorts of unusual legislative provisions in this Act that would not be in place in normal circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister is given support in this House and the other House to renew these provisions &ndash; I will support him on this occasion &ndash; I expect him to respond by introducing some balance. For example, we have a ludicrous Garda complaints body. Complaints about any matter dealing with suspects in custody or complaints against gardaí are dealt with by gardaí. That body <Col N="683" /> is non-functioning. It is a laugh. Will the Minister indicate when he will reform that procedure? </P>
    <P>The Minister indicated when introducing the legislation that tape recording and video recording of interrogation would take place in various Garda stations, particularly around the Border where most questioning takes place. Where provision is made for enormous periods of detention in custody for the purpose of interrogation, we expect that a caveat should be introduced by the Minister to ensure that this would be done properly and that there would be no room for questions to be raised subsequently about improper practices in regard to questioning.</P>
    <P>We must remember these are serious offences. The people brought in for questioning under this legislation are suspected of being involved in most undesirable activity and the powers we have given the Garda Síochána are virtually absolute. However, absolute power corrupts absolutely unless there are measures in place to provide for a monitoring mechanism but we do not have a monitoring mechanism.</P>
    <P>While Senator Norris discussed Amnesty International's concerns about the operation of this legislation, I also believe we have a difficulty maintaining the legislation given our commitment to the European Convention on Human Rights, which is part of the Good Friday Agreement. Part of that Agreement provided for a review of the Offences Against the State Act. However, no sooner did we enter into an agreement to conduct a review of it, which is being conducted by Judge Hederman, than we also passed new legislation which made the Act even more draconian.</P>
    <P>We have a problem and we must address it. We cannot simply renew this legislation year after year until we see where the balance has been put. Legislation of this nature is a serious matter for a democracy. Our neighbouring jurisdiction of England, Wales and Scotland but excluding Northern Ireland does not have legislation of this nature. Everybody has the same objective of bringing peace to Northern Ireland but we cannot do that at the expense of undermining democratic legal institutions. However, that is the danger.</P>
    <P>I hope when we return to the matter next year the Minister will bring forward a report that is more far reaching than what has been presented to date. It should not be just an inventory of the number of people who have been dealt with under the legislation. We want to know what the police force in the other jurisdiction is doing to deal with the atrocity that gave rise to this legislation. We must deal with the people responsible for it but that has not happened.</P>
    <P>The United States has declared the Real IRA an illegal organisation. What is happening in that regard and what steps are we taking or have we taken in relation to influencing the US authorities? What is the situation in Britain? Has the Real IRA been declared an illegal organisation and what steps have been taken in that respect? <Col N="684" /> The Minister should also have given some indication of who the 27 people in the report are. Are they part of a single organisation or of a multiplicity of organisations? Are some of them independent operators? Are they all paramilitaries? We do not have this information even though the Minister is supposed to give the House a meaningful and effective report on the situation and why this legislation must be renewed.</P>
    <P>The worst atrocities that took place in this jurisdiction were the Monaghan and Dublin bombings. No person has been arrested in this jurisdiction in relation to those atrocities. The worst atrocity that took place during the 30 year conflict in Northern Ireland was Omagh. Surely there should be a response to the atrocity in this jurisdiction, given the number of victims and families still seeking justice. The Bloody Sunday inquiry is ongoing and the families concerned are at last getting justice but nothing is happening in this jurisdiction to alleviate the pain and suffering of the victims of the Monaghan and Dublin bombings and their families.</P>
    <P>We support the renewal of the legislation this year. We were not happy with many aspects of it last year and we are not satisfied that precautions have been introduced in the areas suggested. There is a conflict with our commitments in the Good Friday Agreement in relation to introducing democratic legislative provisions and under the European Convention on Human Rights. In addition, we have not received a full ministerial report on why this legislation is necessary. It could well be necessary and it has certainly been used to a greater degree in the last 12 months than previously. I am glad there is an annual review but there should be, in the context of the overall review of the Offences Against the State Act and the new review in 12 months, a thorough ministerial report before the House the next time we debate this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with points raised in the debate. With regard to international terrorists, the 1998 Act applies to all offences under the Offences against the State Acts and scheduled offences under those Acts, regardless of who commits them. That is clear. Anybody who commits an offence in the State is subject to the jurisdiction of the State. There was a query whether section 6 would be used. It is for the Garda Síochána to investigate a possible offence under section 6 and it is for the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide whether to prosecute.</P>
      <P>With regard to the videoing of interviews, I announced that we would proceed to install audio video equipment in Garda stations and work is ongoing on that at present. By the end of the year, I expect 150 Garda stations to have the equipment. The equipment will be used when people are being questioned. This is to the advantage of the person being questioned and of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> The issue of adverse inferences was raised. Section 2 provides for the drawing of adverse inferences in narrowly defined circumstances. Substantial safeguards are in place in the section and nobody can be convicted on inference alone. It is, on balance, a legitimate measure.</P>
    <P>With regard to the European Court of Human Rights, there were judgments in relation to section 52 of the Offences Against the State Act. In those circumstances, there must be an element of concern. However, a review of the Offences Against the State Acts is being carried out by former Justice Hederman and the review will take court judgments into account, including those of the European Court of Human Rights, in arriving at its determinations.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to correct the impression that was given to the effect that there is no equivalent legislation in the United Kingdom. There is. Equivalent measures were introduced when we introduced the 1998 legislation for the good reason that there was little point having the legislation in this jurisdiction if it would not be in place in the other jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>This report deals with the Act and cannot deal with the work of the RUC in investigating the Omagh bombing. There is outstanding co-operation between the Garda Síochána and the RUC. As late as last week I attended a successful meeting in Belfast with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. Reid, and we were accompanied by the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the RUC. Everybody agreed that the level of co-operation between the police forces was never higher than it is at present. In fact, the Secretary of State and the Chief Constable were highly complimentary of the activities of the Garda Síochána in this jurisdiction in the fight against dissident paramilitaries.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Garda complaints procedure is being reviewed at present. I accepted that there is a need to change the system and we are looking at it thoroughly. There is no point in conducting a simplistic examination of the Garda complaints procedure because that would lead to simplistic conclusions, which normally lead to complex problems. In the circumstances I am satisfied that the review will throw up suggestions which will actually work. In that context, I am mindful of the fact that at present the Garda Síochána, for example, is represented on the board. I am not so sure that this a great idea. I am not so sure either that it is such a great idea that in all cases the Garda Síochána examines the complaints. I am certainly convinced that there is a need for some kind of independent inspectorate. I would hope we will be able to bring forward positive suggestions regarding the operation of the Garda Complaints Board in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>The committee reviewing the Offences against the State Acts has not yet submitted its full report and all I have received is an interim report on the Special Criminal Court which, incidentally, I hope to publish soon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="686" /> The Real IRA is of course an unlawful organisation in this State and in the United Kingdom. Regarding its proscription in the United States of America, obviously the American authorities would have been informed by the views held by the Garda Síochána and the RUC.</P>
    <P>That more or less deals with the question other than of course the issue of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, which is totally different. Recently we approved financial support for a family support centre for the Justice for the Forgotten group which they were seeking for some time.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Senators for the contributions. I thank them for the expressions of support for the continuance in force of the provisions of the 1998 Act. Significant progress has obviously been made on the path to peace but there are still those who are ready and prepared to use violence to advance their aims.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan correctly referred to what occurred yesterday. There appears to have been a planned subversive attack which was thwarted by the actions of the Garda Síochána and the Army in discovering and disabling a bomb on the Border. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Garda Síochána on this wonderful success.</P>
    <P>The 1998 Act is an important element in the response of the State to the very real threat posed by those who carry out these attacks and who reject peace and seek to undermine the democratic process. The nature of that threat has not changed since this House approved the enactment of the legislation and approved last year its continuance in force. That is the reality which faces us no matter how we might wish it to be otherwise. No justice Minister in a democratic state would wish to continue legislation such as this if it were possible to operate without it. Unfortunately the sad reality is that this legislation is a crucial tool in the fight against subversive activity.</P>
    <P>The report on the operation of the Act over the past year does show that while the legislation was used sparingly, it is nevertheless having an increasing effect. As I stated earlier, the results are certainly coming through. The Act is proving effective. It is, unfortunately, as necessary today as it was when it was enacted in 1998. I am grateful to the House for continuing it in force.</P>

    <Title>Motor Vehicles (Duties and Licences) Bill, 2001: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The origins of this Bill were established with the passing in the Dáil on 8 March last of a financial resolution which essentially amended the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act, 1952, <Col N="687" /> and the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1992, in relation to rates of motor taxation and trade plate licences. The resolution has, however, only limited statutory effect and needs to be replaced by a Bill which provides a permanent legal base.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill gives effect to the increase in motor taxation of between 4% and 6% for private cars and 6% on goods vehicles with effect from 1 April 2001. It provides for a reduced rate of motor taxation for vehicles kept exclusively on an offshore island. Furthermore, it expands on the categories of vehicles to be exempt from payment of motor tax in that it includes in this exemption the category of vehicles which are used exclusively for mountain and cave rescue purposes as well as vehicles which are used exclusively for underwater search and recovery purposes. Finally, the Bill provides the euro rate of motor tax arising from the introduction of euro currency from 1 January 2002.</P>
      <P>To an extent, the rebalancing of the motor tax rates will &ldquo;green&rdquo; motor tax. While motor tax cannot be regarded, in itself, as a green tax, we can nevertheless configure the motor tax code to give it a greener slant, which will hopefully have positive environmental effects. On this premise, lesser increases in motor tax are applying to cars with smaller capacity engines which, as a general rule, do not use as much fuel as larger cars and, accordingly, create less harmful environmental side effects, particularly in relation to lower carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>By way of information, the moneys collected by the motor tax offices of the local authorities are paid directly by them into the local government fund which was established under the Local Government Act, 1998. The motor tax proceeds in the fund are supplemented by an Exchequer contribution, which is increased each year at least in line with inflation. For example, this year the fund will amount to about £720 million, of which £319 million will be contributed by the Exchequer and about £400 million will come from motor tax receipts. This amount is being used primarily to finance non-national road grants and general purpose block grants for local authorities.</P>
      <P>The importance of this source of income to local authorities cannot be over-emphasised. It greatly assists them in not only upgrading the country's non-national road system but also in providing adequate funding for whatever day-to-day operations they consider necessary. If local authorities are to meet the ever increasing demands being placed upon them, then it is incumbent on all of us to ensure that they are adequately financed in their endeavours. This is the great benefit of the local government fund as its resources, through general purpose grants, can be directed by local authorities to cover the areas of local priority, including maintenance of housing, roads, water and sewerage, fire services, the natural environment, community development, etc. The list is endless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="688" /> The motor tax rate changes, to which I referred earlier, came into force on 1 April 2001. In the rebalancing of the rates, it will be noted that, while there were increases in certain categories of vehicles, in other categories no increases have been applied, in one category a reduced rate is being introduced and two classes of vehicles have been added to the exempt status from payment of motor tax. I will outline these in more detail for the House.</P>
    <P>The increases are as follows. First, a 4% increase for private cars up to 1,100cc which represents an annual rate increase of between £4 and £6. Second, a 5% increase for private cars from 1,101cc to 1,500cc which will result in annual increases of between £8 and £10 and, third, a 6% increase for private cars of 1,501cc and over, which will translate into annual increases ranging from £15 per annum at the lower end of this bracket to £51 for private cars over 3,001cc. These increases cannot be regarded as excessive, especially as almost two thirds of the current vehicle population is under 1,500cc and will, therefore, be subject to relatively low increases.</P>
    <P>An across the board 6% increase is provided for goods vehicles. This, in effect, will in the majority of cases represent an approximate annual increase of £10, as over 80% of commercial vehicle owners pay the minimum rate. Motorcycle tax rates have been revised to reflect the different sizes of these vehicles. The single rate of £22 is being replaced by the three bands, which existed prior to 1992. The new rates range from £25 for motorcycles of 75cc and under, £35 for those at 76cc to 200cc and £45 for motorcycles of 201cc and over. In this regard, the maximum rate for the higher cylinder motorcycles of £45 compares very favourably with the £40 rate for the similar cc band which operated prior to 1992. The motor tax class of vehicles which are classified as machines, workshops and recovery vehicles has been brought into line with the goods vehicle rate, the minimum of which is £170.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a 6% increase for agricultural tractors. The rate for non-agricultural or general tractors is being aligned with the minimum goods vehicle rate of £170 in view of the purpose to which such vehicles are being used. In addition, the Bill provides for average increases for trade licences or trade plates by which they are commonly known. These are green registration plates used by motor traders on vehicles, which are temporarily in their possession, in lieu of a tax disc on the vehicle.</P>
    <P>There are some categories of vehicles where no increases were invoked. These include public service vehicles such as buses, taxis and hackneys and youth-community buses, school buses and electric vehicles. A reduced rate of tax, £52, is being introduced for vehicles which are kept and used exclusively on offshore islands not connected to the mainland. This reduction is in recognition of the limited use of such vehicles.</P>
    <P>Motor tax is being abolished for vehicles used exclusively for mountain and cave rescue pur<Col N="689" /> poses and for vehicles used exclusively for underwater search and recovery purposes. Both of these classes join the exempt category which include ambulances, fire brigade vehicles, civil defence and disabled vehicles, that is, full motor tax exemption is now being accorded to all vehicles used in emergencies.</P>
    <P>While not specifically covered in the Bill, provision has been made in regulations which came into effect on 1 April 2001 to assist people who may face difficulty in taxing their cars on a full year basis. These regulations provide for a reduction in the surcharge which applies to vehicles which are taxed half-yearly or quarterly. The savings envisaged on a half-yearly disc equate to an annual saving of £2 up to the middle cc band rates, rising to £8 in the two highest bands. Savings in respect of a quarterly disc of £4 annually will arise for the two lowest bands, increasing to £8 in the highest bands.</P>
    <P>Aside from the motor tax element, the Bill also empowers the Minister to vary the cost of full driving licences by regulation. Driving licence fees for provisional licences are already prescribed by regulation. The extension of this regulatory power to full licences will enable the undertaking of a review of the overall driving licence fee arrangements so as to introduce a more equitable licence fee arrangement for persons aged more than 70 years. Enacting legislation will be required to enable these arrangements to be implemented. This Bill is the vehicle for this change. As soon as it is enacted it is intended to proceed quickly with the necessary regulatory changes for the introduction of this more equitable system.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation, given that motor tax proceeds are paid into the local government fund for local authority use, costs incurred by the Department in connection with the collection of motor tax are recoupable from the fund. Aside from motor tax, fees from driver licences and other minor miscellaneous fees and duties are also paid into the fund for distribution to local authorities. Even though such fees are paid into the fund, the Local Government Act, 1998, does not specifically refer to the recoupment from the fund of the costs associated with the administration of these fees. As with the costs associated with the collection and administration of motor tax, it is considered that the same provisions should apply in respect of driver licences. Section 7 provides for this.</P>
    <P>With the introduction of the euro notes and coins from 1 January 2002 the Bill provides the euro rates of motor tax. The euro amounts were arrived at by dividing by the euro converter, 0.787564, disregarding cents. This approach not alone ensures that motor tax offices continue their practice of handling whole units of currency but will also provide for a reduction in motor tax to all customers. Savings vary from under a euro for annual renewals to over one euro for half-year applications, and one to three euro for quarterly renewals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="690" /> The Bill is the necessary legislative requirement to the Financial Resolution for motor tax changes which have been in place since last April. The motor tax increases are, by and large, minimal and below the level of inflation. The increases are more than balanced by the benefits which the additional income will generate. They will greatly assist in improving the capabilities of local authorities in providing an improved customer service to all its customers. In addition, they will also be a factor in our campaign in the improvement of our environment by encouraging the continued use of smaller capacity cars.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot find the same level of enthusiasm for this Bill as the Minister of State. It is modest legislation that does very little in practical terms other than increase further the costs borne by many motorists. When we speak of motorists we are not referring to an elite group, as may have been the case 30 or 40 years ago, but to virtually everybody. For most people motoring is no longer, if it ever was, an option or a luxury. Few people would willingly spend hours each week stuck in traffic jams or choked in slow moving traffic if they had an alternative, such as efficient, reliable public transport or, in many cases, any form of public transport. We are talking about what has become an essential staple in most people's lives. The Bill will do nothing for these people other than wave the finger at them and virtually accuse them of anti-social behaviour because of the necessity for them to use their cars to get to work.</P>
      <P>The Bill continues the attack on motorists introduced in a sneaky way in the budget. The thinking behind it is similar to what we read by some of the elite journalists who live in commodious accommodation in the city centre and berate other people because unlike them they do not use bicycles to get to work, forgetting that others are living very long distances from work and the use of bicycles is not practicable. There is an element of preaching in the Bill which hitherto has been confined largely to these journalists.</P>
      <P>The public is by and large patient and if it was seen that the Government was serious about improving public transport the Bill could be accepted more easily. However, while talking big about initiatives, the Government is refusing to take many of the smaller steps needed to improve public transport. We still await the licensing of sufficient private sector buses in the major cities. Vehicles that have been licensed have yet to receive flexibility regarding picking up passengers, set down stops etc. In addition, there is an insufficient provision by the Government of new buses particularly, but not exclusively, in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point about the Bill that stuck in many people's throats when it was published was the hype the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, invested in it when he described it as major green legislation. I wish the Minister a full and speedy recovery from his debilitating illness. We would all like to see him back as soon as possible. However, it has <Col N="691" /> been the history of his tenure in office that all his ducks are portrayed as swans. Everything is hyped and every initiative is considered a major breakthrough. All the eggs are counted and cashed in before they are hatched. The Minister is now paying the price for over-hyping every activity in which he has been involved since he came to office. No other Minister has given such a depth of meaning to the term &ldquo;U-turn&rdquo; as he has done recently.</P>
    <P>In that context, it was typical of him to describe the Bill as an environmentally friendly measure, but it is nothing of the sort. It does nothing to improve the environment and it is impossible to see any environmental purpose that will be served by the Bill or any environmental improvement that will result from it. The legislation is a raid on the local government fund. This fund should be ring-fenced by the Minister, but it has become a revenue earning measure for him for activities which have nothing to do with roads. A full discussion is urgently needed on how the local government fund is distributed, what happens to the motor taxation income that goes into it, how it is allocated among the various local authorities &ndash; there are significant disparities between different parts of the country &ndash; and how the roads system and the maintenance of roads in different parts of the country are treated.</P>
    <P>Few people feel they get value for money from their motor fund contributions. This is particularly true of people living in the many areas where road repairs often lag years behind schedule and where the fabric of roads and footpaths leaves much to be desired. In many cases, they have become hazards. The basic purpose of the Bill is to extract payment from motorists to finance a range of public services which have nothing to do with motoring. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, said this was the case in a disarming passage in his contribution to the other House. He stated:</P>
    <P>Significant downstream costs will arise for authorities in terms of the operation and maintenance of projects and schemes under the national development plan. Additional resources which arise from changes in motor tax rates will help local authorities to meet their commitments in this regard and to provide more and better quality services to the community.</P>
    <P>This is the imposition of a tax on the motorist to help fund changes which may be desirable but which have little to do with motoring. This is why the Bill is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Bill was introduced in an unusual way. This may be history but it caused a great deal of annoyance at the time because it was not announced during the Budget Statement, but in a press release issued later on budget day when deadlines had passed and most of the newspapers had been put to bed. It was hoped to avoid the <Col N="692" /> usual scrutiny by sneaking in this Bill and catching the public unawares. However, that does not work. People can accept new charges and impositions if they are told about them upfront, but their introduction in that way caused great annoyance and it did not work.</P>
    <P>I referred to the greening effect of the Bill but in the debate on motoring, not enough credit is given at times to the motoring industry and not enough pressure is placed on it to ensure every effort is made to make cars and other vehicles more environmentally friendly by adapting to the latest developments in technology. There has been a move in recent years towards cleaner petrol and more fuel efficient cars. A move away from the total dependence on petrol has begun and there have been improvements in emissions from cars. However, is the motoring industry itself sufficiently committed and willing to invest large sums of money in research and development and in pushing these changes even further?</P>
    <P>There may be smaller cars, but there was madness in millennium year when people rushed to get top of the range 00 registration cars. There was an incredible element of competition among people who were benefiting from the Celtic tiger towards ostentatious consumption. People wanted to show off that they had benefited more than others from the Celtic tiger. There was a great sense of gaucherie and the <i>nouveau riche</i> about much of the behaviour last year. Perhaps people are changing and there is a move towards smaller cars and less ostentatious lifestyles, but I doubt it. It is difficult to ask motor manufacturers to develop smaller and more fuel efficient cars when so much of the emphasis is placed on top of the range models as a statement that one is doing well.</P>
    <P>In terms of the place of motorists, it is interesting to note that last year motorists paid an aggregate amount of £3 billion to the Exchequer. This figure includes all taxes from fuel duties to VAT and VRT in addition to road tax. Of the £3 billion, only 16% was reinvested in roads, public transport and road safety. The rest is taxation and, in that context, it is difficult to understand the fiscal justification for the tax increases in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Road safety initiatives are chronically underfunded and a measure suggested by the Automobile Association is worth considering. It proposed that revenue gained from the 1.5% stamp duty levied on motor insurance, which amounts to £20 million annually, should be ring-fenced for road safety. This levy was originally devised in the 1980s to prop up the old PMPA. That situation is gone but, unsurprisingly, the tax is still in place. We all remember other levies that were imposed in the past for a specific purpose but which lasted long after the original purpose ended. Whatever way it is tackled, there is an increasing awareness that not enough is being done in relation to road safety. The Department's initiatives are welcome as far as they go, but they do not go far enough. There is a need for a reallo<Col N="693" /> cation of significant resources to road safety. It is not a good Bill, but the Minister made the best possible case for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, is a frequent visitor to the House and that is indicative of the many fine Bills that have emanated from the Department of the Environment and Local Government in recent years. Senator Manning described the Bill as a modest one but what else would one expect of a Bill whose function is merely to give a more permanent legislative base to the collection of motor taxation?</P>
      <P>I could take a populist line and welcome the Minister but not the Bill, but I prefer to take a more realistic approach. I welcome the Bill, particularly certain sections which, while modest, are nonetheless significant. The grading of motor taxation, to which the Minister refers as a slight greening of the taxation system, is a good measure. The percentage level of increase &ndash; in monetary terms it is a little more significant &ndash; for vehicles of 1100cc encourages a trend towards smaller cars, given that two thirds of the cars on the road are under 1500cc. Cars with greater engine capacity consume more fuel and have an adverse environmental effect. From my experience in the transport industry, I know that, like many aspects of expenditure in that industry, fuel is imported and high fuel costs have an adverse impact on our balance of payments. Making a distinction between cars with smaller engine capacities and more powerful cars is a good measure.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning that we have a dearth of public transport. This has been identified by successive Governments and the current Government not only recognises this fact but has taken steps to do something about it through the national development plan. Much of the expenditure envisaged during the course of the plan will be to rectify the previous dearth of investment in public transport. Anyone who experiences traffic congestion in our cities will see the need for increased investment in public transport.</P>
      <P>The fact that the Minister decided not to apply a tax increase on taxis and buses is a good thing. Nevertheless, many buses have emission levels above what is acceptable for vehicles of their age. I hope a future Bill will include a measure to sanction vehicles whose emission levels are unacceptably high. Such a measure should be policed more effectively than is the case at present. There is an onus on owners of public service vehicles to ensure not only that their vehicles are safe, but that they do not spew toxic gases into the air. Penalties for exceeding acceptable emission levels might be an incentive to vehicle owners to maintain compliance with emission regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning referred to the expenditure of the motor taxation fund. I have been critical of the lack of funding for local government, particularly in the years when there were constraints on public finances. Local government was seen as an easy target for curtailing Government spending. <Col N="694" /> This lack of funding did not enhance the activities of local government. An independent funding system for local government is my preferred arrangement. The removal by different Governments of rates on residential property and of water charges did not help the concept of accountability in local government. If local authority members raise their own funding they will be accountable for the spending of that funding. This is the <i>sine qua non </i>of controlling public expenditure.</P>
    <P>The local government fund, introduced by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is the first attempt for decades to address the issue of local government funding on a reasonable and equitable basis. Those of us who have spent many years attending council meetings will recognise the improvement in recent years of local authority funding. We should acknowledge that and I have complimented the Minister on this development on previous occasions.</P>
    <P>It is easy to say the fund is used for a variety of purposes. Nevertheless, it must be recognised that there has been significant allocation for non-national roads in recent years. Because of the lack of investment, and perhaps because of the reduction in manpower for the maintenance of water courses and so on, the task is a challenging one. The availability of funding has assisted an improvement in recent years. Where good quality engineers who are committed to maintaining the road systems are in place, progress has been seen. Improvement is not uniform throughout the country but the problem is one of the availability of expertise as much as of funding.</P>
    <P>The amount of money spent on non-national roads is small compared with the huge investment in the main national traffic arteries. Capital and maintenance expenditure on national primary and secondary roads is in excess of £1 billion per annum. The national development plan is the single biggest plan ever laid before either House of the Oireachtas. If its targets are to be met it will incur a cost of £46 billion between now and 2006. Much of that spending will be targeted at our infrastructural deficit, of which a principal area is our national primary and secondary routes. Much of the current debate about compensation for land acquired for road building is a consequence of the ambitious plans to improve the national road network.</P>
    <P>Our road network needs huge investment in the short term. Modest tax increases of between 4% and 6% &ndash; at or below the level of inflation &ndash; are preferable to allowing levels to remain for a number of years and then substantially increasing them. Such a system brings consumer resistance. Most people in business review their charges based on their own cost increases in a particular year and try to maintain prices at reasonable levels. This gives a vibrancy to the economy because of the competitive pressures which exist.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" /> I have some sympathy with those who complain about our failure to benefit from membership of the European Union with regard to the price of motor cars. We are way ahead because of particular excise duties and also because the cost of a car here prior to taxes being levied is higher than in many other EU countries. As a consequence, the motorist is not getting as good a deal as he should, given our full participation in the EU. I know the counter argument is that with the huge increase in traffic and a failure to maintain a commensurate improvement in the road network, any such change should follow rather than precede road investment. I hope it will be achieved at some stage and I am sure people will continue to campaign for that.</P>
    <P>This is a short Bill. The funding will assist county and regional roads. Increased funding is available to local government and the Local Government Bill will come to the House soon. It is imperative that councillors are given more say and more autonomy in the decision-making process. All these things must be intertwined if we are to inject dynamism into the system and have a more accountable and democratically-based system.</P>
    <P>I welcome one provision in the Bill for a reduced rate of motor tax for people living on islands, at £52. It shows an empathy with a long-time policy of one of the Government parties, and possibly both of them, to ensure as much as possible that a presence is maintained on our islands. This measure recognises the difficulties involved in island life. Cars will have to be retained on the island to qualify and this is reflected in the reduced charge. It is a sensible measure and any Government policies that can be skewed towards encouraging people to maintain the island way of life should be considered. A recent programme strongly advocated the placement of industries on the islands to give an employment base.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the Minister to change fees for the full driving licence by regulation. That is an extension of the arrangement for provisional licences at present. Section 7 empowers the Minister to recoup his or her expenses associated with the issue of driving licences. I wonder whether we should put the adjective &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; before &ldquo;expenses&rdquo; so that the fund only covers what is necessarily incurred. The introduction of the Schedule at the end of the Bill continues what was there previously and sets out clearly what the increases are. This is a modest but necessary Bill. It contains some good initiatives which reflect positive thinking within the Department and a common-sense approach in relation to certain aspects of the imposition of the taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and, like Senator Manning, I too wish the Minister for the Environment and Local Government a speedy recovery. He has had a rough time, as far as one <Col N="696" /> can see from the members of the Government parties, for implementing Government policy. In view of the fact that he has had a rough time from the Independents in the other House, as an Independent in this House I will try to be as friendly as possible in my remarks about the Bill.</P>
      <P>This is a disappointing Bill. I had expected a great deal more from it. I was pleased when I read a reference to &ldquo;invalids&rdquo;. I have been asking for many years for an extension of the criteria for disabled drivers regarding tax and registration of vehicles. I regret there has been no change in the same old criteria which must have been put down decades ago. There are many young people who are most anxious to return to work following accidents or medical catastrophes, but they are not in a position to do so because of the cost of getting modified cars taxed and insured. It is a pity the opportunity was not taken to do something in that section.</P>
      <P>I wish to address the section dealing with driving licences. Surely something could have been done about the difficulties encountered by many of my colleagues. A bizarre little booklet has been issued by the Department of the Environment and Local Government on the medical aspects of driver licensing as a guide for medical practitioners. The Minister might have heard a colleague of mine, Dr. Maurice Gueret, talking about this subject on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; today. It has been mentioned to me by many other practitioners. The public transport system is very inadequate so the loss of a driving licence is catastrophic, particularly to those living in the country. When doctors feel that they should perhaps bring up with a patient the fact that the person is not up to driving, and I do not mean on the grounds of eyesight, the patient can be very offended. The booklet issued by the Department gives no help or guidance even though it was updated only three years ago. It must have been updated from some booklet that was issued when the model T Ford was produced. It really is an absolute disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A huge number of diseases are not mentioned. I suggest to the Department of the Environment and Local Government that it consider the website produced by its sister Department in the United Kingdom where Alzheimer's disease is given four pages of guidance for doctors. There are only two disqualifying diseases listed in the Department's booklet. One reference is to persons who are dependent on psychotropic drugs &ndash; they are to be totally disqualified. I ask if that includes people who are dependent on sleeping tablets. A very large number of the Irish population is dependent on sleeping tablets so they are obviously out, otherwise they are illegally holding driving licences. The next group consists of persons suffering from a serious cardiac arrhythmia which has resulted in loss of consciousness. Cardiac arrhythmia is very common and very well controlled by modern medical drugs. It does not say how long ago this serious loss of conscious<Col N="697" /> ness should have taken place. Those are the only two disqualifying diseases mentioned.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom has a national driver and vehicle licensing authority. It produces the excellent website for the guidance of doctors and I suggest that the Department get their own one going. Some of the criteria in the booklet are bizarre. One section states that the medical examination should take account of severe mental disturbance, whether congenital or due to disease, trauma or neurosurgical operation on the central nervous system. Section B cites severe mental retardation. Section C mentions psychosis, which in particular has caused general paralysis. This is back to general paralysis of the insane when syphilis was a problem. Section D mentions severe behavioural problems due to dementia, psychoneurosis or personality defects or disorders.</P>
    <P>We dealt with the Mental Health Bill in the House last week and some Senators may remember that we excluded from treatment in mental hospitals people with mental defects or disorders. The Mental Health Bill excludes them and here it says that, if necessary, certification for having a driving licence shall be for a limited period only. It does not specify how long that period should be or if one has to re-examine people with severe mental retardation to see if they should have a licence. That whole section is ridiculous. That section is in place for all licences, apart from people driving heavy duty trucks. If they can get through that they can drive motorbikes, with or without a sidecar, passenger cars carrying up to eight, passenger cars with a trailer, tractors and so forth.</P>
    <P>The section on alcohol is interesting. We are repeatedly told how important alcohol is as a factor in road traffic accidents. I will certainly not disagree with that. In the United Kingdom a person with an alcohol problem cannot drive a public service vehicle until three years after they have been discharged from hospital or by a doctor. They cannot drive their personal car until one year after they have got over an alcohol problem. In Ireland, in the case of anyone applying for a licence and suffering or having suffered in the past from alcoholism, fitness to drive may be certified for limited periods only so as to ensure that the applicant remains under medical supervision. Does this mean that if they are driving the school bus the doctor should hop on and off every now and then to see how they are doing? Those regulations are absolutely bizarre.</P>
    <P>I shall not labour the case but I will conclude with this thought. In respect of all general categories applying for a licence it states that in the case of an applicant of any category special attention shall be paid to serious diseases of the blood. I suggest a certain amount of upgrading with medical help is badly needed in that area. The section dealing with alcohol is ridiculous. There are advertisements on television about alcohol related accidents, yet the booklet given to registered general practitioners for guidance advises <Col N="698" /> one to keep an eye on them and to try to ensure they are not getting into trouble.</P>
    <P>The Bill is disappointing because it could have looked at all these areas and availed of the opportunity to improve them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be on the same lines as that of Senator Manning. While I welcome the Minister of State I am not over-enthused by the legislation. It is modest legislation but the problem is that it provides for another form of tax, a surreptitious tax, a tax by stealth. It is a tax that was not announced properly in the budget by the Minister for Finance. To try to pass it off as a green tax or as being desirable because it benefits local authorities is not good enough. The only thing green about it is the new green registration plates or discs that are being introduced. If he wanted to do something for the greening of the environment, the way to go about it was to put the funding and the energy into public transport which has been absent during the past four years.</P>
      <P>We are into the fourth year of the Government and, unfortunately, public transport has been left devoid of the necessary resources. The rail system is terrible, the Luas is non-existent, the DART does not have enough carriages, Dublin city is congested and the taxi system was belatedly deregulated at Christmas but no regulations have been put in place to ensure an adequate provision over the 24 hour period during which services are required in a busy city such as Dublin. That is the way to go about greening the environment. This would get rid of the need for the rapid increase in motor vehicles. Given the poor condition of roads everywhere, the car driver is heavily penalised by excise duty, insurance costs, the licence fee and motor taxation which it is proposed to increase. Anyone using a motor vehicle is heavily taxed. Yet they have no choice because a public transport system that would alleviate the need for private transport is not being put in place. This is not a green measure.</P>
      <P>What are the benefits for the local authority? It was not, as suggested by another speaker, this Government or a previous Fianna Fáil Government that did anything about funding local authorities. Rather it was the Labour Party and Fine Gael in the previous Administration when the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Howlin, ring-fenced the motor taxation fund for the purpose of providing at least some relatively independent funding for local government and getting the Exchequer to provide, not a matching amount which would have been worthwhile, but a supplement. Unfortunately, it is not a satisfactory way of funding local government. Local government needs its own funding mechanism. This has all stemmed from the abolition of domestic charges in 1977. The Minister of State will remember with whose Government that was associated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Waste management charges are being introduced. It is ludicrous that in the past week or two <Col N="699" /> people, including those who do not have bins, have received notes from the local authority demanding the payment of bin charges. Virtually every area within the canals will continue to operate the old system, that is the black plastic bag service. Not only do they not have bin charges but they have no recycling facilities. Now they are being charged for a greening measure, an environmentally conscious and aware measure, but there is nothing new in it. They are being charged £65 for the collection of bags &ndash; called a bin charge although no bin is supplied. They are not getting the three bins being provided. They are retaining the plastic bag service and have to buy the plastic bags. They get no provision, good, bad or indifferent, towards recycling of household waste. Domestic charges are being imposed by the back door. This is another imposition on the hard pressed taxpayer. It is a domestic charge because virtually every household has a motor car. People have no choice because there is no public service worth the name and money has not been provided in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning said approximately £3 billion is collected from the hard pressed motorist, 16% of which is reinvested. Those figures are colossal. Where is this money spent? It is simply another Exchequer tax that is not used for the local authorities, for the benefit of the road user or to develop the infrastructure required. There are many problems in that respect.</P>
    <P>The licence fees have been mentioned, but the Government has done nothing to improve the excessive cost of insurance for young people. For more than 12 months, we have been sitting on an initial report showing that young people are losing out very badly on insurance costs. If it will cost £2,000 to £3,000 for a person under 25 to get insurance, this is another huge tax on the long suffering motorist. It does not reduce the number of people using cars because second hand cars are now quite inexpensive. The cost of motor taxation, a licence and insurance are huge and are unrelated to the value of the car.</P>
    <P>We have found that these sectors of the driving community have been far less involved in accidents than the insurance industry has given us reason to believe. At a minimum there has been a degree of misinformation by the motor insurance industry in order to maintain high levels of insurance premia for young drivers. What is the Minister doing about that? Why has there still been no action? It is a number of months since we debated that and the Minister said he was waiting for a final report, even though he had the interim report on his desk for more than 12 months.</P>
    <P>Health and safety within the motor industry are very important. Of all the tragedies we experience almost on a daily basis, deaths on the road are among the most horrific. Accidents cause so much suffering to families and of course to the victims who are either fatally injured or maimed. We have been completely unsuccessful in reduc<Col N="700" /> ing the number of deaths on the roads. The Minister and his Department should inject some funding and some energy to try and do something about the matter.</P>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister stated that the fees for the collection of motor tax are recoupable from the local government fund. There seems to be a contradiction; on the one hand he says that under existing legislation, the collection of motor tax is recoupable from the local government fund and then he says that the Local Government Act, 1998, does not specifically refer to the recoupment from the fund of the costs associated with the administration of these fees. It appears that the Department is recouping its fees from the local government fund even though the legislation does not make provision for that. Should the Department not pay for the fees that are associated with the collection of motor taxation? What fees are there for the collection of motor tax? I thought most of it was collected by the local authorities rather than by the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what has been a very useful and constructive debate, which has given much food for thought and covered a wide span of issues. I thank all Senators who contributed and assure them that I have given and will continue to give serious consideration to the various issues raised and suggestions made.</P>
      <P>The last time motor tax rates changed was in January 1999. The changes in the Bill are fair and reasonable. It is a necessary Bill so that the local authorities have sufficient funds to meet their many obligations. Local authorities current expenditure is met from a range of sources. In 2001 local authorities' current expenditure is estimated at £2.1 billion. General purpose grants and finance from the local government fund are an important source of local authorities' funding representing about one fifth of total current income. They are discretionary and may be used by authorities for funding whatever day to day operations they deem necessary without the need for approval from the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning suggested the Bill is a raid on local government funding; it is anything but that. The increased motor tax will add to the fund, not take away from it. As the House is aware, such operations span a wide spectrum, covering a multitude of areas. As I mentioned at the opening of this debate, these areas cover housing, maintenance, roads, water and sewerage, planning, the natural environment, recreation and amenities, community development, etc. The additional resources that arise from the change in motor tax rates will help local authorities to meet their commitments in this regard and to provide more and better quality services to the community. The local government fund is also used to finance non-national road grants and the additional resources brought about by the increase in motor <Col N="701" /> tax will allow work to continue on improving the non-national road network.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, never claimed this Bill introduced a green tax as suggested by Senator Manning. The Minister always said this was a greening of the existing tax. Larger cars use more fuel and give rise to higher levels of carbon dioxide emissions. Apart from the revenue raising aspect, this Bill is designed to rebalance motor taxation rates in such a way that it will have a positive impact on the environment. In this Bill, I intend to send a green signal to consumers that smaller cc cars use less fuel, pay less vehicle registration tax and less motor tax. If the result of this message achieves anything close to the outcome of the restructuring of the VRT bands in January 1999, which last year resulted in an 8% increase in the purchase of new cars up to 1,400 cc at the expense of cars in the 1,401 cc to 2,000 cc range, it will be a worthwhile exercise.</P>
    <P>Senators Manning and Costello suggested that this motor tax increase was sneaked in; this is not true. Motor tax is not a budgetary issue. Policy in relation to motor tax does not form part of taxation policy generally. Motor tax, unlike all other taxes, is not paid into the Exchequer. Under the Local Government Act, 1998, motor tax is paid directly into the local government fund. Before 1997, when the motor tax was paid into the Exchequer, provision was made in the Finance Act for any changes in the rates of the tax. However, in 1997, the Fine Gael/Labour/ Democratic Left coalition Government decided to divert motor tax from the Exchequer and to assign it directly to local government. Then 80% of the tax on private cars and all tax on commercial cars were paid directly into the local government equalisation fund and the balance of 20% of private car motor tax was retained directly by local authorities. This was done under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>The Act also made provision allowing local authorities discretion to increase motor tax by up to 6%. This legislation was promulgated by the Government completely outside the budget or Finance Act agenda. The local government fund followed the equalisation fund and the same practices are applied. The proceeds of motor tax no longer go to the Exchequer and the practice is for changes to the motor tax regime to be dealt with outside the budgetary and Finance Bill system.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning referred to the problem of road safety and I agree with the importance of tackling this issue. We have just passed the mid point in implementing the Government's strategy for road safety for 1998 to 2002. The interim targets under that strategy have been fully met, i.e. to reduce Ireland's rate of road fatalities by the end of 2000 to a figure not exceeding 116 and to complete specific accident reduction measures at 240 locations on the national road network. All road safety agencies are striving to achieve the targets set in the Government's strategy and a number of measures are being employed to achieve these targets. Garda enforcement has <Col N="702" /> been intensified in relation to speeding, drinking and the wearing of seat belts. Speed cameras and evidential breath testing have been introduced and are being further extended in support of this process. Research into the involvement of young people in road accidents and the problem of drugs and driving is being advanced. Education and information in relation to road safety are being improved, including joint promotional campaigns with the Northern Ireland authorities.</P>
    <P>This Bill, in conjunction with a new road traffic Bill, will help to improve road safety. It provides for a range of legislative measures aimed at achieving a further reduction in deaths and injuries on our roads. Its primary focus is on road safety, treating road traffic offences much more seriously than heretofore and with the severity which they deserve. I agree with Senator Manning that we can never afford to be complacent about road safety and this Government will continue to work to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>The rates of motor tax for certain vehicles, including all electrically propelled vehicles, are not being changed. Motor tax applies to all mechanically propelled vehicles regardless of how the vehicle is propelled. Since motor tax is now an important part of the local government fund and is distributed to local authorities to finance their activities, it is appropriate that all types of vehicles contribute. I have no difficulty with the principle of keeping motor tax on environmentally friendly vehicles to a minimum and that is reflected in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the question of disabled drivers being exempted from motor tax. At present, disabled drivers are exempt from motor tax under regulations made by the Minister for Finance. The scheme also provides for exemption from VAT and rebate of fuel duty.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello suggested that it was the rainbow Government which introduced the system of local government funding through motor tax and Exchequer contribution. I remind the Senator that the equalisation fund introduced by the previous Government comprised motor tax only and did not include any Exchequer contribution, which was introduced by this Government. In 2001, the Exchequer contributed £319 million, a very substantial sum indeed. The general purpose grants for local authorities have increased by 63% in the four years since this Government came to office.</P>
    <P>I hope I have dealt adequately with the matters raised in this debate and I thank Senators for their contributions. As I have indicated, the Bill is a follow-up to the financial resolution on motor tax rates which was passed by the Dáil on 8 March 2001. A number of issues have been touched on, either by way of suggestion or seeking clarification. I hope I have dealt with each issue as fully and helpfully as I can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the fund is already ring-fenced. This Bill follows the existing precedent. I mentioned at Second Stage that perhaps reasonable expenses could be deducted from the driving licence fund. It would be helpful if we had a figure for that in relation to the motor taxation section. Perhaps the Minister of State could clarify if departmental expenditure, as distinct from local authority expenditure, is also recouped. All motor tax is collected by local authorities. It finds its way to the fund and is then redistributed to the various local authorities and there is an equalisation fund involved also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Senator Manning about payment of the cost of administering driving licence fees from the local government fund, the issue is quite simple. The costs involved are minimal and will have no material effect on the local authorities.</P>
      <P>It may be helpful to Senators if I set out the background to section 7. In essence, the purpose of the section is to provide that the expenses incurred in issuing driving licences and the administration of miscellaneous fees and duties shall be recoupable by the Minister from the local government equalisation fund and the local government fund. Under the legislative provisions establishing both those funds, specific provision was made for the making of certain payments into and out of the funds.</P>
      <P>In relation to the income side of the fund, section 5 of the Local Government Act, 1998, provides that the fund will be financed by an Exchequer contribution, the proceeds of motor tax and certain fees and duties, including all driving licence fees and duties collected by local authorities. On the expenditure side, payments may be made out of the fund towards general purpose grants and non-national road grants. The law also provides that the costs incurred by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in collecting the motor tax are payable out of the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> Section 7 is essentially a technical amendment of the provisions contained in section 6 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1997, and the Local Government Act, 1998. It provides that, in addition to the costs involved in the administration of motor tax, costs incurred by the Minister in the issuing of driver licences shall also be recoupable from the local government fund.</P>
    <P>Average annual income to the local government fund from the proceeds of driver licensing amounts to some £6 million. Average annual expenditure by the Minister in production of driver licences over the last three years amounted to less than £350,000. It is considered entirely appropriate, in terms of consistency, that the costs incurred in the collection of driver licensing fees should be recouped in the same manner as the cost relating to motor taxation which the Minister is collecting on behalf of local authorities. This provision is aimed specifically at striking a balance between income and expenditure requirements of the fund for local government purposes. Section 7 is aimed only at bringing equity to the treatment of the income and expenditure elements contained in the fund. The costs associated with driving licence administration are relatively very small indeed and would have no material effect on the fund or on the finances of local authorities. This year, it is estimated that the fund will amount to over £720 million. The annual average cost of administration of the driving licence regime over the last three years represents less than 0.05% of the fund, or less than 1/2000th.</P>

    <Title>Company Law Enforcement Bill, 2000: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to be given the opportunity to bring this Bill before the House on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Enactment of the Company Law Enforcement Bill, 2000, will represent a landmark in the Government's drive to combat corporate crime and malpractice and should help restore public confidence in the manner in which business is conducted in Ireland. Revelations that have emerged from the various tribunals of inquiry established by the Government and from investigations under the Companies Acts initiated by the Tánaiste provide clear evidence that many people in business have an entirely insufficient regard for the requirements of company law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main provisions of the Bill flow directly from the recommendations in the report of the working group on company law compliance and enforcement, which was published in March 1999. The working group's report confirmed many of the worst fears as to the state of corporate governance in Ireland. It concluded that company law was greatly underenforced and that those who sought to deliberately subvert the system of company regulation had little reason to fear that they might be apprehended and punished. In regard to companies' statutory obligations to file returns with the Companies Registration Office, <Col N="706" /> available data suggested a culture of widespread non-compliance and disregard for the law.</P>
    <P>The working group made a number of substantive recommendations aimed at combating the culture of non-compliance. Most importantly, it recommended the establishment of an independent statutory officer, to be known as the Director of Corporate Enforcement, who would have general responsibility for the enforcement of company law in Ireland. The group recommended that the director be resourced with legal, accountancy, investigative and administrative expertise to investigate and prosecute offences under the Companies Acts. The establishment of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement with the necessary powers and resources is seen as the best way to ensure the enforcement of company law on a consistent and independent basis.</P>
    <P>The Company Law Enforcement Bill provides a range of powers for the director of corporate enforcement to support the performance of the functions assigned to him under the Bill. The director will have the function of investigating suspected offences under the Companies Acts and will assume the powers that are currently exercised by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in relation to company investigations. The director will be given power to prosecute offences under the Companies Acts by way of summary proceedings and to refer cases for prosecution on indictment to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The director will be given the power to apply to the High Court for injunctions restraining companies or their officers from continuing to breach the Companies Acts, where the director can establish the breach to the satisfaction of the court. This will allow the director to take immediate action to prevent ongoing breaches of company law and, by so doing, protect the interests of creditors and others whose rights may be affected by such breaches.</P>
    <P>The director will have the power to apply to the High Court for orders for the restriction or disqualification of company directors and other officers, where the conduct of the persons concerned in the management of companies warrants such action. This will prevent unscrupulous persons from continuing to use the vehicle of limited liability companies for reckless or illegal purposes to the detriment of their creditors and others.</P>
    <P>The Bill also makes important changes to the arrangements for the filing of statutory returns with the Registrar of Companies. The registrar plays an important part in the ongoing supervision of companies' compliance with their statutory filing obligations under the Companies Acts. In recent years the registrar has made great strides in the enforcement of filing obligations. However, this work has been hampered by the absence of a satisfactory and enforceable system for determining the precise date in each year when a company is required to file its annual return. The Bill provides a remedy for this problem through the introduction of the concept of an <Col N="707" /> annual return date specific to each company which will be used to calculate the exact date by which the company must file its annual return. This measure should provide a more transparent and enforceable regime for the filing of annual returns.</P>
    <P>In addition to its recommendations in the area of ongoing company law enforcement, the working group recommended the establishment of a company law review group to advise the Minister on all matters relating to the implementation, amendment and consolidation of company law in Ireland. The establishment of such a group will ensure that the Companies Acts are kept under continual review with a view to maintaining a first class system of company law in the State. This will facilitate the operation of companies already established here and serve to attract more international companies to locate here.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of such a company law review group on a statutory basis. In anticipation of the legislation, and in order to allow the review group to commence its work as quickly as possible, the Minister established the group on a non-statutory basis in February last year under the chairmanship of Mr. Tom Courtney, solicitor, and one of the country's most eminent experts in company law. The membership of the group combines company law experts and members of representative bodies to give the Minister the best possible advice on the ongoing refinement of the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>On the detail of the Bill, I propose to highlight some of the more important provisions of the Bill, and particularly to highlight some of the more significant changes made to it in its passage through the Dáil. Part 2 provides for the establishment of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the appointment, terms and conditions of service of the director and the arrangements for reporting by the director to both the Minister and the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides, among other things, that the director shall be appointed following the holding of a competition by the Civil Service Commissioners. In this regard, the Civil Service Commissioners have selected a person for appointment as director-designate on the basis that the person concerned will be appointed as Director of Corporate Enforcement following enactment of this Bill. Mr. Paul Appleby of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has been selected as director-designate. Mr. Appleby has extensive experience of the company law area and has been closely involved with company investigations being undertaken under Part 2 of the Companies Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>Section 12 sets out the general functions of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. These include enforcing and encouraging compliance with the Companies Acts and investigating suspected offences under the Acts. The director is also given a general supervisory role in respect of liquidators and receivers. The section expressly <Col N="708" /> provides that the director will be independent in the performance of his functions.</P>
    <P>Section 16 sets out the director's reporting requirements. The director will be required to produce an annual report of his activities as well as being required to appear before committees of the Oireachtas to account for the overall performance of his or her functions subject to the proviso that this reporting and accountability should not prejudice the performance by the director of any of his or her functions.</P>
    <P>This section was amended in the Dáil to assuage Members' concerns that following the establishment of the director the Oireachtas might have access to less information concerning company investigations than it has currently. Significantly, the provision at section 16(5) in the Bill, as initiated, whereby the director was exempted from the provisions of the Committees of the Oireachtas Compellability (Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997, has been removed. Through this amendment, and a further amendment later in the Bill, the director will be required to attend before a committee with compellability powers and to provide relevant documentation.</P>
    <P>Part 3 of the Bill relates to the function of the Director of Corporate Enforcement of investigating suspected offences under the Companies Acts. Section 28 of the Bill is a new section introduced during Dáil Committee Stage. It provides for the amendment of section 18 of the Companies Act, 1990, which deals with the admissibility in evidence of statements required to be made by persons pursuant to various provisions of the Companies Acts. Section 28 reflects judgments both of the Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights in relation to a person's privilege against self-incrimination. Section 28 now provides that statements made by persons under compulsion may not subsequently be used against them in criminal proceedings. Similar provisions have been provided for in sections 29, 44 and 49 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 29 repeals and replaces section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990. Section 19 provides for the examination of a company's books and documents. The replacement section 19 will give further scope to the Director of Corporate Enforcement to examine books and documents, including, in specific circumstances, the private papers of an individual whom the director believes to have documentation relevant to the books and documents of a company under investigation. This latter provision was introduced during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil. Section 29 also introduces a new provision whereby a person who knowingly conceals, destroys or falsifies documentary evidence relating to an investigation of an offence under the Companies Acts is guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 31 amends section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990, which provides for the persons to whom, and the reasons for which, confidential information obtained under sections 19 and 20 of <Col N="709" /> that Act may be disclosed. This section has been significantly amended arising from contributions of Members during Dáil Committee Stage. It now provides for disclosure of information by the director both to the Competition Authority and to a committee of the Oireachtas that has been granted powers under the Committees of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>Section 34 is a new section introduced during Committee Stage in the Dáil. It provides for the continued exercise by the Minister or an authorised officer of powers under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, in respect of particular companies, notwithstanding the transfer to the Director of Corporate Enforcement of the relevant powers. This is to allow the completion by the currently appointed authorised officer of certain examinations of books and documents that are at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>Part 4 of the Bill relates to the power of the court to order the restriction or disqualification of persons from acting as company directors or other officers or being involved in any way in the promotion, formation or management of companies. The powers to restrict and disqualify persons are central to maintaining the integrity of the system of company regulation.</P>
    <P>Part 5 of the Bill contains provisions relating to the winding up of companies and, in particular, those companies that are wound up insolvent. The provisions of this Part are aimed at addressing the so-called &ldquo;phoenix syndrome&rdquo;, whereby companies go out of business leaving debts unpaid and their members or directors immediately start up new companies without having to account for their previous failures and debts. This greatly undermines confidence in the system of company law and is one of the issues that the Director of Corporate Enforcement must seek to address urgently.</P>
    <P>The director is given a range of powers in this Part of the Bill to intervene in company liquidations to ensure that persons responsible, through recklessness or otherwise, for company failures are brought before the courts to account for their actions. The director may seek to have such persons made liable for the debts of their companies or ordered to return assets wrongly transferred from those companies.</P>
    <P>Part 8 of the Bill deals with company accounts and auditors. Since the Bill was published, the Report of the Review Group on Auditing has been completed and significant further changes will be made to company law in respect of auditors in a separate Bill later this year. These will be separate and distinct from the measures dealing with auditing and enforcement that are included in this Part of the Bill. These provisions, which derive from recommendations contained in the Report of the Working Group on Company Law compliance and enforcement, will allow the Director of Corporate Enforcement to ensure that auditors comply with their statutory obligations under the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="710" /> Sections 73 and 74 impose on auditors and on the recognised accountancy bodies an obligation to report to the director instances where they believe certain breaches of the Companies Acts may have occurred. Section 74 was amended in the Dáil to clarify the circumstance in which auditors will be required to report apparent offences under the Companies Acts on the part of their client companies and to remove the requirement on auditors to report instances of fraud both to the director and to the Garda. This latter requirement is adequately provided for in the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Bill, 2000, which is currently before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Part 10 contains a number of miscellaneous provisions relating to this Bill, the Companies Acts generally and other enactments. Sections 93, 94 and 108 are all new sections introduced in the Dáil. They relate to investment companies provided for at Part 13 of the Companies Act, 1990. These are essentially collective investment or mutual funds products that use the company structure provided for under the Companies Acts. The effect of these sections is, first, to provide a mechanism whereby a trustee of such a company may resign and have the company wound up with the consent of the court and, second, to disapply certain prospectus provisions of the Companies Act, 1963, in respect of these companies. These changes are being made to support the Central Bank as regulator for such companies.</P>
    <P>Section 96 amends section 371 of the Companies Act, 1963, and provides an important power to the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Under this section, the director will be given the power to seek orders of the High Court restraining companies or their officers from persisting with ongoing breaches of the Companies Act. This injunctive power will be a key weapon of the director in his efforts to ensure compliance with the Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 109 provides a mechanism whereby the Director of Corporate Enforcement may impose on the spot fines in lieu of the institution of proceedings in respect of offences under the Companies Acts. Persons accused of offences will have the option of going to court but in so doing they will risk incurring a conviction. Section 110, which was introduced during Dáil Committee Stage, provides for the provision of certain documentation to a jury in a trial on indictment of an offence under the Companies Acts. The purpose of the section is to allow a trial judge to provide a jury with documentation, including transcripts of evidence, where the trial judge feels that such information may assist the jury in its deliberations.</P>
    <P>Section 111 was also inserted in the Bill during its passage through the Dáil. It provides for an exemption from certain provisions of the Companies Acts that prohibit the purchase by a subsidiary of shares in its parent company. The exemptions will apply where the subsidiary is a professional dealer in securities and will need, in the course of its normal business, to purchase <Col N="711" /> shares in other companies, including from time to time in its parent company.</P>
    <P>The measures contained in the Company Law Enforcement Bill, 2000, represent a significant step on the road to addressing the deficiencies that have been identified in the enforcement of Ireland's company law regime. In particular, the Bill provides the powers necessary to the performance by the Director of Corporate Enforcement of the functions assigned to him. He will be resourced with a dedicated team of accountants, lawyers and gardaí who will bring their particular competencies to bear on the task of investigating and prosecuting offences under the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>The Government is providing the legislative framework within which the director will operate and the resources to allow him to operate effectively. On establishment, the challenge facing the director will be to use his powers effectively to make a telling impact on the Irish corporate landscape. I thank the House for its co-operation in arranging this debate on the Bill and I look forward to hearing the contributions of Members. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This is important, significant and almost milestone legislation. It is also somewhat unusual in that it has clearly been very significantly amended during its passage through the Lower House. This indicates that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment had very definite views and convictions and an open mind on the legislation. There is a level of expertise and knowledge in the Lower House to which she listened and which allowed very significant changes to be made to the legislation which the Minister of State has outlined. I hope the same open-mindedness will prevail on Committee Stage in this House.</P>
      <P>We may say it has taken a very long time to get to the stage of discussing this legislation and of, I hope, seeing it on the Statute Book early next month but at least the legislation is welcome and probably better for the long period of gestation and discussion which preceded it. The major aim of this legislation is to fill a major lacuna in our legislation and administration to ensure that the company law, which we so laboriously passed in these Houses over many years, which was added to with each passing year and which keeps thousands of lawyers, accountants and others in lucrative lifestyles, is enforced. That is the nub of this legislation. If it succeeds in doing that, it may well be one of the most significant Bills in the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For far too long we will have lived with a culture which said that for every new law, there was a loophole, a climate in which the clever evasion of law was seen as part of the natural and, indeed, national way of doing business and something to be applauded, something real men did. Mrs. Helmsley, the famous American millionairess, <Col N="712" /> may not have had this country in mind which she famously said, &ldquo;Only the little people pay taxes&rdquo; but she could well have been talking about certain aspects of the way life was lived and business was done in this country. That was the way things were done as we now know only too well. It may only have been done by a small minority, a minority maybe small in numbers but big in their net worth and huge in the amount that was cheated from law-abiding taxpayers.</P>
    <P>It is too easy to blame selfish individuals or people who thought they were acting in their own best interest or the best interest of their families when a great deal of the blame for the failure of compliance lay with the Governments and administrations of the day which simply refused to allocate the resources to the State agencies charged with compliance. It was almost as if once a law was passed, compliance was assumed. One had to prove one was not complying rather than that one was complying.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest examples of this over the years was the way in which the fraud squad was starved of resources. The fraud squad, which was small in number and had very little expertise, was pitted against the smartest accountants money could buy, the sharpest lawyers this side of &ldquo;LA Law&rdquo; and the slickest of public relations machines. The fraud squad was locked in an utterly unequal struggle. It did not have the accountants as it could not pay the salaries for top accountants, it did not have the lawyers and did not have the forensic skills needed to begin to even tackle the huge and often diabolically clever range of white collar crime going on in our midst.</P>
    <P>I sometimes listen to journalists say that the reason we did not have proper investigative journalism, or the reason charges were not brought, was because of the libel laws. That may well be true, I am not too sure about that, but what I am certain of is that if we had a properly equipped fraud squad capable of following money trails with even a fraction of the expertise those who were evading the law had, we might very well have uncovered much of what subsequently was uncovered at a much earlier date. It may not be the responsibility of the Minister of State but I would like to ask him whether the fraud squad yet has the resources it needs.</P>
    <P>Looking at another area, has the Competition Authority, another vital cog which up to now existed on starvation rations and was housed in poor conditions with little independence in the recruiting of its staff, the resources required? From what I see and hear, the traffic in the Competition Authority is all one way. It is out of the Competition Authority because for some reason or other &ndash; some say it is because of a departmental mindset which does not want to lose control of the authority, which may or may not be true &ndash; the Competition Authority does not seem to have the resources required.</P>
    <P>Failure of compliance in the past was in many ways a failure of the whole political system. I include in this the permanent Government, the <Col N="713" /> civil servants, as much as I include ourselves, the politicians. We are now reaping the whirlwind. What has happened has also been a very good thing. It is good we are reaping this whirlwind. It is good that we have had, and are having, the tribunals, the DIRT inquiry and the various other inquiries that are going on. It is good that we are having a long debate among ourselves on these matters. At least now there can be clarity and certainty about the rules, about what is right and what is not right. For far too long that was not the case. The rules may have been there, but there was no great clarity about them. There were assumptions that certain rules did not have to be obeyed and were not expected to be obeyed and that they were there for some reason not easily explained.</P>
    <P>In the present climate, where in the media especially it is very easy to get a sort of mob justice after the latest name emerges and where presumptions of guilt are made before even half the evidence is heard, it is very easy to create a climate in which everybody involved in evasion in the past is dubbed a criminal. That is unfair. Many people were lulled by the culture of the time into practices which seemed to have been sanctioned by official indifference. Many were encouraged by people in banks and financial institutions to whom they went for advice and from whom they might legitimately have expected honest advice, to do what was the cute thing at the time, never mind that it was illegal. As far as they were concerned, they were breaking a law that was not going to be enforced and probably was not meant to be and which probably ranked in gravity in their minds as akin to drinking a pint after hours or driving at 50 miles an hour in a 40 mile per hour zone. They know differently now, many to their great cost and embarrassment. There is much more financial pain and social embarrassment ahead for many of these people.</P>
    <P>I am trying to put into perspective how we got to where we are today. In getting there much of the blame lies with a State which made more and more laws ever more detailed and complicated and then made no provision to ensure they could be enforced. One of the lessons we have learned in recent times is that it is not good enough to pass a complicated law; that law must be explained to the people, particularly those whom it will affect. We have debates here, but to many people the language of our debate is arcane and obscure. A certain expertise is needed to fathom a detailed Committee Stage debate. Laws were made in the past, but the State or relevant Department or agency did not take the trouble to publicise them or explain them to the people. We have learned a lesson from that. Today the extent to which Departments and official bodies advertise on television or in newspapers to make sure the public are aware of the law is part of what needs to be done to ensure people cannot claim, rightly or wrongly, they were not aware or did not know what they were doing was against the <Col N="714" /> law and that it is also made clear to people that laws, once passed, will be certainly enforced.</P>
    <P>Some of us still believe in original sin, but the ways in which laws were made in the past, and no attempt was made to enforce them, took little cognisance of the fact that if people are left alone, they will probably follow their more self-centred instincts.</P>
    <P>Today we are a more honest and certainly a more compliant society. We are not necessarily a more moral society, but at least we are more aware of our responsibilities and more inclined, for whatever reason, to be compliant. We are more honest because of the degree of publicity and awareness of consequences of not being. There is a much stronger sense of openness about the way in which we do our public business, a greater awareness that if people are caught there will be consequences, that the system of accountability is open and above board and that political pressure and political cronyism will not work to a person's advantage any more. Our society is much the better for that.</P>
    <P>The realisation that the law will be enforced is at the centre of this Bill. Enough has been said of what has happened in recent months and years for us to know that the enforcement of company laws has been patchy and ineffective up to now, which is why the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and powers under this Bill, especially in Part 5, go a long way towards meeting these needs, and I look forward to going into the detail of some of that on Committee Stage. How long is it since a company director has been prosecuted? How many people have been brought to court on charges of insider trading? How easy is it still for the phoenix syndrome to exist? These are some of the issues being tackled in this Bill. I hope that once it is enacted we will see a change in the culture and in the practice, but that will only happen if proper resources are provided to make sure this new office works. The Minister and the Tánaiste guaranteed in the other House that proper resources would be provided. There will be no forgiveness if they are not. We have it on the word of the Tánaiste and she is hardly likely to set up what may well be one of her lasting legacies to public life and then leave it starved of resources. We have to take it on good faith that the necessary resources will be provided. The sums mentioned in the Dáil do not seem to be enough, but I will not go into that now.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change made to section 16 in the Lower House, that the director will report to an Oireachtas committee. It is right that should be done. I enter one caveat &ndash; we need to examine seriously how Oireachtas committees are resourced. If they are not adequate to the task of dealing with reports, if they do not have the necessary expertise and back-up, they may fall into disrepute. The Houses need to examine the way in which Oireachtas committees have been set up and resourced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> The Minister of State mentioned in passing the Company Law Review Group. He might indicate what preliminary work it has done in the four months since it was established. In dealing with reform, it is not a question of only proposing ideas, it is also important we have this group to clarify and simplify the legislation and to eliminate outdated and fussy offences.</P>
    <P>I look forward to Committee Stage. This is important legislation. I welcome the open mind the Tánaiste had on this legislation when it went through the Dáil. A genuine contribution was made there and I look forward to that process being continued here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the opportunity to speak on this Bill. It is important that I make clear my stance on corruption and abuse of power. Deliberate corruption and abuse power are wrong in any circumstances. To echo the words of Senator Manning, we are ensuring that the clever evasion of law will not be tolerated. I welcome that.</P>
      <P>It is also important to ensure that we do not concentrate on the headlines but take account of the full picture. It is necessary to think about what has gone on here during the past 50 to 70 years when times were difficult and trying. I am not talking about what is happening at the tribunals but about the ordinary individual who held a business together through many of the tough times, came out the other end and managed to make a significant contribution to the overall prosperity we enjoy. I notice from the thrust of the legislation, and I believe the Tánaiste has accepted this, that it is important we do not place the focus on ensuring that everyone complies with administrative procedures but that we focus on eliminating corruption, of practices being done deliberately wrong by companies and that we do not use this legislation only to ensure that all &ldquo;i&rdquo;s are dotted and &ldquo;t&rdquo;s crossed. We should not concentrate on people for that reason, but we should concentrate on companies and the enforcement of company law in the overall context to ensure companies operating in Ireland do so on the firm understanding that we expect them to be proper corporate citizens, to pay their taxes, be fair to their suppliers and their employees and be proper and upstanding members of the community and the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave detailed reasons for the introduction of the Bill. It represents a landmark in the Government's drive to combat the corporate crime and malpractice we read about every day in the reports on the tribunals. I hope the Bill will help to restore public confidence in the manner in which business is conducted and, in the majority of cases, has been conducted. We must acknowledge, and we have seen the evidence, that people have abused the trust placed in them by shareholders, other business people and the public, and did not have sufficient regard for the legal requirements under which they were sup<Col N="716" /> posed to operate. It is true, as the Minister and the Minister of State have acknowledged, that the enforcement of company law has been under-resourced and it was reasonable for anybody operating in such a manner to believe there was little fear of being apprehended and punished.</P>
    <P>With regard to the statutory obligation to file returns, the date by which returns had to be made was not always clear &ndash; one of the sections in the Bill deals with this &ndash; and there was no follow-up by the Companies Registration Office. However, in the overall measurement of what was wrong in this area, not filing paperwork on time is a far smaller offence than deliberately corrupting and defrauding the system and the people with whom one does business. Over time, nevertheless, there has been non-compliance in dealing with returns. The Minister and the Department should bear in mind that it is sometimes difficult to operate in this economy due to the enormous burden placed on small and medium-sized enterprises in terms of filling out forms and ensuring that every piece of paper is returned to the relevant authorities. I acknowledge the work the Minister and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment have done to streamline the process but there is still room for improvement. I hope this legislation will not muddy the waters further or make it more difficult to operate a business by transforming it into a paper pushing exercise.</P>
    <P>I welcome the role of the new director. If anything is to be given a sense of importance and greater recognition by the Government and by industry it is the allocation of adequate legal, accountancy, investigative and administrative resources. That indicates a commitment to ensuring the legislation will do what it is supposed to do. I welcome that. This is one of the few Bills I have seen where there is recognition of the fact that the law enforcement being put in place must be resourced and where resources are provided to allow enforcement to proceed.</P>
    <P>The Bill outlines the functions of the director. He or she will have the power to investigate, prosecute, take out injunctions and protect the interests of the people involved in companies, such as the employees, suppliers and the Revenue Commissioners. That is welcome. The issue of prevention is extremely important. The director has the power to apply to the High Court for orders for the restriction or disqualification of company directors and other officers where the conduct of the persons concerned in the management of the companies warrants such an action. I hope this will prevent unscrupulous persons from abusing the system and the vehicle of limited liability companies for reckless and illegal purposes to the detriment of their creditors and others.</P>
    <P>One of the failures of Irish society, however, in the context of running a business is that we fail to recognise that those who do not try do not succeed and those who try often fail. There is no shame in failing if one gets up and does one's best to try to succeed in the future. In the United States, a country we are usually keen to emulate, <Col N="717" /> success and failure can be equally accepted. That is something we need to learn as this country matures. There should not always be the element of begrudgery one sometimes sees. Just because what one tried the first time does not work, it does not mean everything else one tries will not work and that one should not get some support and recognition for at least taking the initiative and the risk and putting one's time and effort and, perhaps, that of one's family into that initiative. We should recognise that if one does not try, one will not win but that when one tries there is a chance one will not succeed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Companies Registration Office, there can be a simple system with the technology available. It is important that the system works in a clear and unambiguous way and that the uses and resources of technology are made available to the office. There have been significant improvements in this area to date and this legislation will improve matters further. The clarity in terms of the annual return date is important but it is vital it does not just become a vehicle for fining and making a criminal of somebody who, for one or other, did not return a document on time.</P>
    <P>The company law review group is an important innovation in the Bill. I do not profess to be an expert on company law &ndash; it is a highly complex area. The Bill provides for a first class system which has the laudable objective of trying to set up a framework that allows us to work while ensuring there are the rules and regulations which mean we can operate in an honest and trustworthy environment. The Minister, in accepting the recommendation of the working group and establishing a company law review group, is taking a huge step forward in ensuring company law is kept under continuous review. We must maintain the system we are now putting in place. The review group was set up on a non-statutory basis in February and has commenced its work. It will now be put on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>With regard to the reporting requirements in section 16, the reporting process in relation to how the director reports to the Houses of the Oireachtas is clear. I welcome the changes made in the Lower House. It is important the Oireachtas does not continue to push its powers into the hands of directorates and agencies. It is vital that the elected Government of the country does the job it is elected to do and that where agencies and directorates are established, the type of reporting and accountability we wish to see in place is made clear. I welcome the changes made by the Lower House in this area.</P>
    <P>Part 4 deals with restrictions and disqualifications. It is important to refer again to risk takers. I would not like to see a situation arise whereby a person who has not been successful on the first try will not be able to try again in the future. We need to explore this matter further on Committee and Report Stages in terms of how people conduct their business and what will disqualify them. I take this opportunity to say to the <Col N="718" /> Minister that we are clear in this area of company law about the types of people who should be accountable or who should take up roles as directors, but there are other areas where in enacting legislation we need to look similarly at the types of restrictions we put in place for people applying to do business in the State. I do not mean this as a criticism but as an observation which has caused me great concern recently.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning spoke about the failure of the State to enforce legislation, the failure of the various institutions to enforce and investigate and the lack of resources, etc. I want to particularly compliment the Criminal Assets Bureau on the fine work it has done. The focus of its work is on clearing up criminal activity and that is the way we should be moving forward.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that we maintain and ensure that we recognise the real difference between administrative failures and failures to return document, and fraudulent activities which are either criminal in nature or which hurt, damage and cause people harm in their businesses. I would not like to see this legislation placing too much emphasis on crossing the &ldquo;t&rdquo;s and dotting the &ldquo;i&rdquo;s, and I would expect that there should not be such a danger. The directorate should take that on board.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation. It sends a strong message regarding the deliberate corruption and abuse of power. It is important that there would not be such corruption and abuse of power in the future. However, I would suggest that we have much more to do in restoring public confidence in our business world than just enacting these pieces of legislation. Perhaps that is the challenge for us as we move forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and thank him for bringing this Bill before the House on behalf of Tánaiste and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney.</P>
      <P>While at a conference attended by over 1,000 people on the Continent during the week I was impressed at the number of people who now know something about Ireland. I remember 20 years ago when the attendees at this sort of conference did not know of the existence of Ireland. Now their knowledge of Ireland is partly due to the success of our economy and of our achievements in other areas and partly due to the opportunities which exist for them to consider investing in Ireland which might not have existed in the past. Therefore, I agree with the Minister of State that this is landmark legislation and I commend it to the House. I say this in spite of the fact that in the past we steered away to a certain extent from enacting legislation for precisely the reason to which Senator Cox referred, that it might create more bureaucracy and therefore act as a deterrent for others to come in and invest. We recognise now that there are a number of reasons we must enact this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="719" /> I welcome this Bill which is clearly long overdue. The question of its timing and the lack of urgency associated with it is a matter to which I wish to return. First, I want to emphasis the importance of having a clear, transparent and fair company law regime which is backed up by prompt and reliable enforcement. This economy, let there be no mistake, depends critically on foreign direct investment. Our economic future depends on retaining existing investment and continuing to attract more investment in an increasingly competitive investment marketplace. I say this as a champion of indigenous Irish industry, but the fact remains that the development of our own industries also depends on foreign direct investment. Irish companies piggy-back on foreign investment and sometimes this has resulted in very considerable success. Senator Cox touched on this also.</P>
    <P>Since the 1959 Whitaker White Paper we have been seeking to attract foreign investment and the playing field has changed in those 40 years. We started off with a package which relied heavily on abundant cheap labour supplemented with grants and tax incentives. That was enough to get us started in the 1960s but it would not get us very far these days.</P>
    <P>Thankfully this is no longer a low cost economy. Other countries now must offer incentive packages which rival those available here and they do so. Therefore, the ground on which we must compete for foreign investment has shifted and we must change with it. Tax incentives remain an important part of our package and it is one of the areas which is referred to continually, but they are not enough on their own. Potential investors now look at a whole raft of issues before coming to a decision on whether they will invest here. They look at the quality of the workforce, not just at the abundance and price of labour. They look for well developed research institutions with which they can work in partnerships, and we have been doing something about that in recent years. They look for a highly developed physical infrastructure capable of sustaining continued growth. Increasingly they look for a well thought out regulatory framework which is well policed, which is what is we are providing now. This framework applies to the environment, the legal framework, competition policy and company law.</P>
    <P>It is a myth that foreign investors always look for a location with the least regulation. That is what we used think. They know that good regulation provides them with protection if it means that decisions are open and transparent. They know that the absence of effective regulations leads to corruption and uncertainty. Uncertainty is the one element of business practice which investors seek to avoid around the world and they will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>Ireland has always projected itself as a clean destination for foreign investment where there is no corruption or crony capitalism and where <Col N="720" /> everything is done according to the book, a book which is open to all. That picture was true, by and large. However, various incidents over the past decade have greatly undermined Ireland's reputation as a clean investment destination. Nowadays Ireland is not perceived in the international world in the same way it was ten or 15 years ago. Whereas once we were above suspicion and such thoughts did not even enter people's minds, the international community is now much more ready to believe every stray rumour. The world tends to see us not as an island of saints and scholars but as a refuge for cowboys. This is a matter which should concern us greatly because reputation is a priceless asset in all matters to do with business. Reputation is something we never appreciate enough until we have lost it and once we have lost it, it is almost impossible to regain.</P>
    <P>This problem was clear when the Government came into office four years ago. I was among those who hoped that, by firm and decisive action, the Government would put the national house in order and leave the world in no doubt that our rightful place was on the side of the angels, as we had always claimed. Unfortunately little has been done to grasp that nettle in the interim. If anything, our international reputation is lower than it was in 1997. Everything which has happened since has worked to reinforce the negative image of Ireland rather than to fight against it.</P>
    <P>It is in this context that I must criticise the pace at which the Government has approached the introduction of this legislation. The McDowell report, which should have acted as a wake-up call, was published early in 1999. This Bill, which aims to implement that report, took more than a year to prepare. That was hardly an indication that the Government attached a high priority to the legislation and that impression was heightened by the fact that it has taken a further year to reach this House. This delay is an important signal in itself but it is even more significant in what it tells us about what is likely to happen once the legislation is enacted. If, as has been the case in the past couple of years, there is not an air of determination and urgency, my real concern is whether this is likely to change.</P>
    <P>The key issue is not what is contained in the Bill but whether its provisions will be enforced promptly, efficiently and fairly. The most serious fact highlighted by the McDowell report was the almost complete absence of enforcement in the area of company law. The widespread culture of non-compliance sprang directly from this. Like in any other area compliance with the law is determined by the seriousness with which it is enforced. Laws do not enforce themselves. If the State cannot be bothered to police a law it does not take long for it to fall into disrespect. Examples include the law on alcohol and speed driving.</P>
    <P>The structure envisaged in the Bill is a huge step forward from the almost laughable situation where the entire policing of company law was in the hands of two people who were not even <Col N="721" /> assigned to it on a full-time basis. However, the new structure will not be enough if it is not properly resourced. For example, the hands of the Competition Authority have been tied not by the legislation controlling it but because the Department of Finance has consistently refused to allocate it the necessary resources to staff its operation effectively. The authority has told committees of the Houses that it has not been able to do its work properly because of inadequate staffing levels. Will this new directorate be any different?</P>
    <P>The Government could have sent a signal of its urgent intent by the way it processed this legislation, however, it has sent the opposite message. While I do not doubt the personal commitment of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Finance to the legislation, I doubt if it is widely shared by their colleagues. In view of this I question if it will be given the necessary resources to do its job.</P>
    <P>To make this legislation work and to help the directorate change the perception of Ireland as a place to do business the Government must give a highly visible commitment, accompanied by action, to establishing the directorate. I welcome the appointment of a new director on a non-statutory basis in advance of the legislation being passed. This will enable the new structure to hit the ground running rather than having to begin with preparatory work.</P>
    <P>However, no matter how talented and able the director is he cannot achieve much on his own. The directorate will not become a going concern until it is fully staffed with all the specialist expertise that has been correctly identified as necessary. Even when it is fully staffed it will be some considerable time before it can show results in terms of investigations and prosecutions. In view of this it is essential that the establishment of the directorate is accompanied by a targeted information campaign the aim of which should be to let everybody know that the game has changed regarding company law and that henceforth the State will take very seriously the policing of the law.</P>
    <P>The issue of credibility arises among those who operate under company law and in the international arena among potential investors and their advisers, the people who consider where they will invest, be it in Ireland or elsewhere. For both these audiences the critical task is not just passing the legislation or establishing the new directorate, it is to convince those audiences that, at long last, the State means business with company law. If that task is carried out well this legislation, which we fully support, will have succeeded. If we fail it will prove to be as useless as many of the laws preceding it. I urge the Minister to use all the power he has to ensure not only that the directorate becomes established when the law is passed but that it is well enough resourced to ensure that the enforcement of company law sends out a message to all involved that the State means what it plans to do in this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation. It is instructive to listen to my distinguished colleague, Senator Quinn, who is involved in the area of business, outlining what he considers to be the necessary prerequisites if it is to be effective. I bow to his greater expertise in this area. My contribution will probably be more political than corporate in scope.</P>
      <P>This is very significant legislation but I am sadly of the view that a wide gulf has developed between corporate Ireland and those who are, as a colleague in the House said at one time, &ldquo;the plain people of Ireland who eat their dinner in the middle of the day&rdquo;. A culture appears to have been in place over the past decades, more evident since the country's economic development over the past 15 years, which suggest that some agree with Leona Helmsley, the owner of the multi-million dollar hotel corporation in America, who, when charged with the non-payment of tax said that paying tax was for &ldquo;the little people&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Like most others, I am appalled by what has unfolded at the tribunals and in other areas of society. A significant element of those who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the Nice treaty referendum did so as a protest against the culture they have witnessed. Their vote had little to do with the relevance or provisions of the treaty. It is a sad state of affairs that the country is being accused of not having a proper regulatory regime that will not only put in place a legal framework but one that will be enforced.</P>
      <P>According to an analysis in <i> The Irish Times</i> the Bill will address the so-called phoenix syndrome where companies go out of business leaving unpaid debts while the directors establish a new business and have no responsibility for meeting them. I was taken aback by this because I was a Member of the House several years ago when the Companies Bill was passed. It was the largest Bill to be put before the House, containing over 350 sections. I recall the Minister and the House acquiescing to the view that it would address the phoenix syndrome and would finally regulate the market and corporate Ireland. Yet, we are now being told this legislation will achieve that purpose.</P>
      <P>From my experience in this House I take the view that this is wonderful country for passing laws. Regardless of the Administration, there is a penchant for a knee-jerk reaction to events. Whatever flavour of the month emerges in the media requiring legislative provision will be agreed to by a Minister. The ensuing legislation is passed by both Houses and then consigned, like party manifestos, to the dustbin of history. I hope that will not be the case with this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the other Members of this and the Lower House, I am a democrat but I reluctantly believe we face a threat to all that we hold dear in this society, to all the traditional values of honesty, ethics in business and a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. This has not been the agenda by which certain business people have operated over recent years. Perhaps that has only been the case <Col N="723" /> since significant amounts of money started flowing into corporate Ireland over the past 15 years, but undoubtedly this culture has existed for many years. Nevertheless, there was a wide chasm between political and corporate reality. Politicians got on with their business, but corporate Ireland went merrily on its way, denuding and defrauding people and taking as much money as possible out of the system.</P>
    <P>Corporate carpet-baggers, who trailed after political parties, particularly the Fianna Fáil Party as the largest party in the country, have intensely annoyed me and many of my colleagues in the House. These people saw a chance and if the Fine Gael Party was entering Government, they followed it. They went after who they considered were the political winners and they inculcated and ingratiated themselves by giving significant political donations to individuals and parties. The <i>quid pro quo</i> was that they would be chosen when a State or infrastructural contract was awarded or a job on the bench was available because they had made their contribution and they were there when they were needed. The elimination of this culture from society is long overdue.</P>
    <P>I hope sufficient resources will be provided to enforce the Bill because one of the elements of the debate in this and the other House is that it is not enough to provide the legislative framework. We must be serious this time and provide the necessary resources and expertise in the context of gardaí, accountants and the other paraphernalia required to combat white collar crime. The perpetrators of white collar crime are much more insidious and expert than the ordinary decent criminal that shimmies up a drain pipe or breaks a window to open a door. That is a simple way of taking money and property from people and it does not require any great brain power. However, it requires an enormous amount of brain power to defraud the State and it has been put at the disposal of many people who have hidden behind shelf, shell and other types of companies that are addressed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The events unfolding at the tribunals are a disgrace to corporate Ireland. I have no doubt that the people are lying in wait for all political parties. There was an example of this in the recent Nice referendum and we may see it in the next general election. I am sure members of the Opposition, who might find themselves in Government in the future given the nature of democracy, do not find any great advantage or political benefit in sniggering on the sidelines at the difficulties the Government might be facing in this area.</P>
    <P>There is a threat to the democratic structures of this country and it will involve a fight to the death. I am not referring to the body politic of corporate Ireland, but the rotten apples who have laughed and treated the political system with the greatest contempt in recent years. The Government had enjoined this war and the implication of the Bill is that it at last will grapple with this thorny issue and say to those in corporate Ireland <Col N="724" /> who have treated us with contempt that enough is enough, the game is over and it is time they got their affairs in order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions and the general expression of welcome for the Bill. The debate highlighted the importance of the Bill in the context of investment in Ireland and the ongoing creation of jobs which are necessary to ensure the population has satisfactory employment opportunities at home. The success that has been achieved could be easily threatened if the wrong impression is conveyed about the way business is done here.</P>
      <P>The criticism expressed in the House ignored the fact that many steps have been taken by the Government to clean up this area. Many of the ongoing tribunals and company investigations will, I hope, result in a general clearing out of the old attitude and bring about a renewal that will be a credit to our reputation abroad. It is essential to maintain the integrity of the way we do business with each other and with people who wish to invest in Ireland.</P>
      <P>As I outlined, the Bill covers an important area. The establishment of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement will, with the extra powers and functions being given to it, result in a major improvement in the attitude of business people in terms of their general business methods. All the views expressed will be considered by the Department. As was evidenced in the debate in the other House, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, if she takes Committee Stage, will be open to the views expressed in any amendments that are tabled. She showed her willingness in the other House to accept a number of amendments from Opposition spokespersons which greatly strengthened the Bill. This is good for democracy. If Senators believe there are further ways in which the operation of the Bill can be improved, I invite them to table amendments.</P>
      <P>Senator Cox and Senator Quinn referred to the need to avoid unnecessary regulation. Our desire is to have the best company law in the world so that Ireland is considered an attractive place from which and in which to carry on business. With that desire in mind, two initial tasks were given to the company law review group. The first was to consolidate all our company law and the second was to seek to simplify the company law code to ensure it is more user friendly and clear so companies and their officers can be sure of their obligations and responsibilities in this area. Senator Quinn highlighted this area when he referred to Ireland's attractiveness for new investment and the need to ensure there is a clear and well regulated economy. As he said, investors abhor uncertainty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning sought further information on the current work programme of the company law review group. The group, which is currently <Col N="725" /> established on an interim, non-statutory basis, held its first meeting on 7 February 2000. It will be placed on a statutory footing following enactment of the Bill. It is chaired by Thomas P. Courtney, a solicitor and a company law author. He is the head of legal affairs of the ICS building society and he is one of the country's most eminent experts on company law. We are pleased and honoured to have the services of such an eminent person.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the review group will operate to a biannual work programme and that a reforming companies amendment Bill will be brought forward every two years based on the relevant report of the group. In the first two-yearly work programme assigned to the group, it was asked to examine a number of issues and it has advertised for submissions to assist that process. The issues being considered include simplification of company law; a review of the law on company directors; consideration of the desirability of a statutory licensing scheme for liquidators, examiners and receivers; a review of company law in the light of new technological developments; consideration of the case for dedicated treatment of commercial cases within the court system; and duties and regulations of auditors, having regard to the report of the review group on auditing.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox's comment that restrictions should be used sparingly and should not penalise people for honest business failure is, I believe, a view shared by all Senators. The Companies Acts provide that restriction and disqualification may only be applied by the courts and that a person should not be restricted where the court is satisfied he or she has acted honestly and responsibly in the management of his or her company's affairs.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning highlighted the need for awareness of the law and for a public information campaign. Senator Quinn spoke extensively on the same point. One of the functions of the Director of Corporate Enforcement will be to encourage compliance with the provisions of company law. As part of this function the director will, no doubt, launch a public awareness campaign aimed at informing people of their obligations under the Companies Acts. This will be particularly relevant to people who agree to become directors of companies without fully understanding the serious responsibilities this brings.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning also raised the issue of the number of prosecutions the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has initiated under the Companies Acts. Since 1 January 1999, 100 prosecutions have been initiated under the Companies Acts, resulting in 47 persons or companies being successfully prosecuted in criminal convictions. Senator Manning acknowledged that the Bill had been significantly amended in the Dáil. This was because of the desire of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to present the best possible Bill to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>My ministerial colleague, Deputy Dempsey, who has responsibility for company law matters will tease out the detailed provisions of the Bill <Col N="726" /> with Senators if he takes Committee Stage in place of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the need to ensure that the provisions of the Companies Acts are enforced so that those who do business with or through corporate entities can feel secure in the knowledge that the rules are obeyed by the vast majority of companies, if not by all. However, in the past it has been the case that insufficient resources were deployed to enforce the provisions of the Companies Acts, and I accept the point made by all Senators, particularly by Senators Manning, Cox and Quinn. It is the Government's intention to ensure that adequate resources are provided. There is now a much fuller acceptance of the necessity to protect the integrity of our business regime and it will require extensive resources to ensure that the provisions of the Bill work efficiently.</P>
    <P>Resourcing of the Garda bureau of fraud investigation is not a matter which comes within the scope of this Bill or within the remit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Government recognises the necessity to ensure that the work of the fraud squad and the Competition Authority is adequately resourced. It is the Minister's firm intention to see that this is done as soon as possible and there is general acceptance of the need for such resourcing. The points made by Senators were well made and are accepted.</P>
    <P>May I inquire if the division bell ringing in the Dáil applies to me? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear that. I would not like to be the cause of an untoward happening in my absence. I recall a former Ceann Comhairle, Deputy McCormack, telling me that when he was a young Deputy he once became bored with what was happening in the House and went to the pictures for the afternoon. When he returned he found that not alone had he missed a vote but that the division had been lost and Mr. de Valera had called a general election. I believe Mr. de Valera was only looking for the excuse. Deputy McCormack has gone to his reward since those days.</P>
      <P>The level of staffing and resources of the Competition Authority is kept under continuous review by the Department which is in close consultation with the authority. Since the enactment of the Competitions (Amendment) Act, 1996, the total authorised staff level of the authority has increased from about 17 to the present level of 29. Arising from a review carried out by Deloitte &amp; Touche, the Minister proposes to increase this number to 44, a level sufficient for the authority's staff to meet its future responsibilities. Even then, the level of staff will continue to be kept under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> In the past the authority has experienced difficulties in retaining staff but the situation has improved considerably in the past year, mainly as a result of improvements in staff terms and conditions. With regard to the impact of staffing difficulties on searches, while some problems were experienced in late 1999 and early 2000, these have been resolved.</P>
    <P>I do not accept Senator Quinn's contention that there was an unacceptable delay in putting in place the office of the director. It was necessary to ensure that the legislation adequately provided for the powers and functions of the director. A director designate was established nine months ago and, as Senator Quinn acknowledged, the director has hit the ground running. I assure the Senator that the State means business in all the areas we are discussing.</P>
    <P>The Director of Corporate Enforcement will have a staff of 37, including seven members of the Garda Síochána seconded to the office to facilitate its criminal investigative role. The non-Garda personnel will comprise people with administrative, legal and accountancy expertise who will be assigned to the director's office by recruitment or redeployment from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It may also be necessary on occasion for specialist expertise or advice to be available to the director by way of consultancy contracted services. I have every reason to believe these staffing arrangements will be in place at an early date.</P>
    <P>I hope and expect that once the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is in operation there will be a greater willingness by those involved in corporate activity to abide by the provisions of the Companies Acts and that enforcement by way of prosecution or other court action will be necessary only in very rare cases.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their interest and contributions to the debate. I invite their consideration of the terms of the Bill, as amended, which has been brought before them. Any amendments which are brought forward will be welcomed and carefully examined. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Ms Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta (NET) is the holding company for the State's 51% shareholding in Irish Fertilizer Industries Limited (IFI). The remaining 49% of IFI is owned by Imperial Chemical Industries plc (ICI).</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for the transfer of liability for the historically accumulated State guaranteed debt of NET to the Minister for Finance and to enable the Minister for Finance to delegate responsibility for the repayment and/or management of this debt to the National Treasury Management Agency. An amendment to the First Schedule of the National Treasury Management Agency Act, 1990, is necessary in order to provide for the delegation of this function.</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides for legislative changes which could be made by ministerial order in the event of the winding up of NET. These legislative changes include the repeal of all previous NET legislation and the removal of the applicability of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) legislation to NET.</P>
      <P>NET's State-guaranteed borrowings are currently in the region of £194 million. NET was established in 1961 as a State-sponsored company to manufacture nitrogenous fertilisers at Arklow. The company started in a relatively modest way but expanded to the stage where after the completion of the Marino Point plant in Cork in 1979, it was at that time one of our largest chemical manufacturing companies, employing over 1,500 employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By the early 1980s it was recognised that because of the construction cost overruns and operating losses in the early years of the Marino Point plant, a substantial part of the NET debt was a sunk cost which could not be expected to be recovered. The overall size of the debt and the costs of servicing it were such as to keep the future of NET's fertiliser business and that of its employees in constant jeopardy. In order to provide a more secure future for the business, a joint venture was formed with Imperial Chemical Industries plc. in 1987, whereby NET's fertiliser businesses at Cork and Arklow and ICI's Richardsons Fertilizer business at Belfast were transferred to the new joint venture company &ndash; Irish Fertilizer Industries Ltd. &ndash; which became the manufacturing company. Under the joint venture arrangements, NET took a 51% shareholding in <Col N="729" /> the new company, with ICI taking the remaining 49%.</P>
    <P>As part of the joint venture agreement, NET's old core capital debt, which was £164.6 million at September 1987 and most of which was guaranteed by the State, was retained by NET in its new role as a holding company for the State's 51% shareholding in IFI. Since 1987, NET itself no longer has a manufacturing role and its primary activity has been the management of its debt portfolio as well as managing a gas contract and monitoring IFI. The gas contract expired at the end of December 1999.</P>
    <P>At the time of the joint venture agreement in 1987, NET entered into a long-term agreement with IFI for the supply of its gas feedstock requirements, with a contract termination date scheduled for the end of 1999. NET already had a long-term gas contract in place with Bord Gais Éireann under which NET purchased gas from BGE. The old accumulated NET debt of £164.6 million had remained with the holding company NET, with the intention that NET would service the borrowings from its income from profits on the sale of gas to IFI and also from dividends from that company.</P>
    <P>However, the combined income accruing to NET from its profits on the sale of gas and from dividends from IFI has been insufficient to cover fully the interest payable on the retained debt. As a result, the shortfall in interest had to be converted into new State-guaranteed borrowings with the result that overall borrowings have continued to grow to their current level. Also, the gas agreement with IFI expired at the end of 1999 and NET, therefore, no longer had income from this source to service the debt. NET has carried out its debt management role in a most professional manner over the years and has always sought to obtain the best cost of funds available.</P>
    <P>Both Imperial Chemical Industries plc (ICI) and the State have offered for sale their shareholdings in IFI. Following the decision by both shareholders to seek to sell 100% of IFI, two indicative offers were received in 1999. Howeve,r both the State and the other shareholder, ICI, were of the view that neither offer presented a sufficiently strong basis for proceeding further with the joint sale process. Subsequently, several other parties expressed a possible interest in the purchase of IFI but no further indicative offers were received. The company is still on offer for sale.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the various sections of the Bill. Section 1 provides for the standard interpretation and definitions. Section 2 provides for the transfer of liability in respect of NET's State-guaranteed debt to the Minister for Finance to enable the Minister for Finance to discharge the State's liabilities under the various outstanding loans. The current legislative limit on NET's State guaranteed debt is £200 million and this section of the Bill reflects that maximum amount. Section 3 provides for an amendment of the First Schedule to the National Treasury Management <Col N="730" /> Agency Act, 1990, which will allow the Minister for Finance to transfer responsibility for the repayment and/or management of the NET debt to the National Treasury Management Agency.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is a standard provision to allow the Minister for Finance to make payments arising under this Bill from the Central Fund. Under the provisions of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977 and 1988, four worker directors are elected to the NET board. Section 5 will enable the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make an order which would have the effect of discontinuing the entitlement of the four worker directors to be elected to the board of NET. I should explain here that it is only intended to exercise this power in the event of the sale or disposal of NET's 51% shareholding in IFI. The four worker directors on the board of NET are actually employees of IFI. Therefore, if the State were to dispose of its shareholding in IFI, there would no longer be any rationale for IFI employees to be elected to the board of NET.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the repeal of all of the previous NET legislation, which comprises Acts stretching from the statutory establishment of NET in 1963 to the most recent Act in 1993. The section provides for the repeal of the NET Acts, 1963 to 1993, to be brought into operation by order of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It is the intention to exercise this power only in the event of a sale of the State's shareholding in IFI and the subsequent winding up of NET. Section 7 is a standard provision enabling expenses incurred in the administration of the Act to be paid from moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Section 8 is also a standard provision giving the Short Title of the Act, which will be the Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Act, 2001.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Bill, 2000, will commend itself to the House and I recommend it for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House, and I welcome the opportunity to discuss this important legislation. The Minister has related the history of the company since1961and the more recent developments relating to the change in 1987 when possibly one of the first public private partnerships took place. The then NET became the 51% holding company in IFI and the remaining 49% was owned by ICI. The ICI-NET partnership which formed IFI was an interesting and necessary development at a time when the country experienced difficult financial circumstances from which this company and many others were not immune. Since then the company has progressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between 1987 and the present day the debt was serviced but at no stage was it reduced. I would like an explanation on that specific issue. I would like to have a clearer picture of the two companies that formed IFI and the detail of the finances. It is extraordinary that the servicing of the debt has cost more than the actual debt. The banks have done extraordinarily well out of this at the <Col N="731" /> expense of the taxpayer. There is a need for greater clarification in regard to what has happened between 1987 and 2001. I hope the Minister of State can provide such clarification in concluding Second Stage.</P>
    <P>By virtue of the fact that this is a fertiliser company, the difficulties that arise are peculiar to farming. Given the boom in farming in the 1990s, I would have expected a corresponding boom in this company. That is the reason I seek clarification of finances.</P>
    <P>The company produces fertiliser. Anyone who is involved with or has any association with farming will be aware it is a seasonal operation. The use of fertiliser can vary from year to year and according to weather conditions. In certain parts of the country it may be impossible to spread fertiliser until late in the year and there would not be a repeat of the operation. In some years there may be a greater supply of fertiliser than is required to meet the need. Because of fluctuations the company would be subjected to those difficulties.</P>
    <P>As members of local authorities we are all familiar with directives from Europe on phosphates in water and nutrient control plans on farms. As we progress there will be more directives which will constrain farmers in regard to the amount of fertiliser that may be used and the amount of phosphates that may be permitted to drain into the main water courses. That matter will have to be taken into consideration because it will have an impact on the company. Given that there will also be companies from eastern Europe and elsewhere providing fertiliser there will be competition. These are fundamental issues which can affect the company adversely or otherwise and have to be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Since 1997 the particular function of NET was to service the debt. The section of the Bill which deals with the 51% shareholding of IFI needs to be teased out. At one stage there were over 1,500 in employment in the company but now there are 680 or 690 in employment. The jobs of those people need to be protected and there is a need for discussions with the trade unions and the workers. The Bill proposes to withdraw the worker-partnership section of NET in relation to IFI. Undoubtedly that will affect workers down the road. The position of workers as well as their pension fund must be protected in any sale that may take place. Every option should be explored, including the possibility of a new bidder from outside or a consortium of interests from within the country who may purchase it or whether it is feasible to have a worker buy-out of the company. All these aspects need to be explored and examined and nothing should happen until that is done.</P>
    <P>In the interests of Irish agriculture it is important to have a fertiliser production facility here. As the only island member nation of the EU, it would put the farming community in a dependent position in the event of having to <Col N="732" /> import fertiliser. Transportation costs can increase depending on the price of oil. There is a huge energy cost in the production of fertiliser which can vary according to the price of oil. It is interesting to note that the debt was serviced until 1999 by the sale of gas from NET to IFI. The actual source of the servicing of the debt has evaporated, hence the difficulty that arises. All of these issues are up for discussion.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has set out clearly the position of the company. Before anything further is done there is a need to put on the record the position regarding the £164 million which was owed in 1987 and which has risen to £195 million or £197 million. In regard to the interest paid to the bank for servicing the debt, did ICI make a profit at any stage? What was the position in regard to the ICI-NET relationship? It is important to explore those issues to ensure that everything is above board. I have no doubt that is what the Minister of State would want. In the public interest perhaps she would state the position when replying. Priority should be given to the position of workers and their pension fund should be protected. Also the future of farming in Ireland should be taken into consideration in respect of the continuation of a fertiliser production facility. Such a facility has existed here since 1959. It would be a retrograde step if Ireland did not maintain that production facility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pleasure to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Coughlan, to the House albeit in a different role from that in which she made her Seanad debut. It proves a point we have all known in the north west that the Minister of State, when given the brief, can rise to the occasion irrespective of the topic.</P>
      <P>I endorse much that Senator Taylor-Quinn has said. The debate in the other House was taken by the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob. I acknowledge his contribution to building up the resources of NET and Irish Fertilizers. He was employed in that company for many decades and was responsible for creating the distribution network that enabled farmers throughout the country to speedily access their fertiliser needs through the rail network. It is appropriate that we acknowledge the contribution made by Deputy Jacob in another life in that regard. He also expressed some serious concerns about the future of the plant during his Second Stage speech in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking through the documentation relating to the plant in Arklow and to IFI as well as the background as outlined by Senator Taylor-Quinn, I quickly came to the conclusion that at least on the face of it, the Government sees this as being a social policy to ensure that 600 jobs are maintained in Arklow rather than being based on sound economic principles. When the ICI private public partnership concept was established in 1987, there was a debt overhang of well in excess of £150 million. Although NET was charged with managing the debt for the subsequent years, it <Col N="733" /> has now reached an accumulated figure of £180 million so it has been rising despite the best efforts in that regard.</P>
    <P>There have been some good points as well. For example, the rationalisation and restructuring of the company and the creation of new plant and of a leaner and fitter IFI in Arklow is to be welcomed and makes it attractive to a potential buyer. However, that also seems to be an intractable problem. Despite the fact that the Minister set up a consultative working group and involved the trade unions and other interested parties 12 to 18 months ago, no potential buyer has emerged. Obviously the trade union movement is acutely aware of the implications for the sale of the plant in Arklow and what the future will be. Notwithstanding the guarantees given by the Minister on job security, all of us will have to accept that if it goes into private hands, bearing in mind the carryover of the debt, some down-sizing or rationalisation is inevitable, although I hope this is not the case.</P>
    <P>I hate describing this in American terminology when what we are talking about is bread and butter and putting food on the table for some individual who is working. They are real people, they are not just statistics and I think the Government is acutely aware of its responsibility in that regard. Why else would it effectively be introducing enabling legislation where one of its sections refers to permitting &ldquo;Auntie May&rdquo; as it is called, the National Treasury Management Agency, to take over the debt management of the company. Although it is enabling legislation, it seems inevitable that that is the way it will go. NTMA will take over the role of management of the debt that was handled by NET since 1987.</P>
    <P>On the face of it, the Government seems to have found itself in a very difficult position. On the one hand it wants to ensure, as Senator Taylor-Quinn has correctly said, that the continuous supply of fertiliser product to Irish farmers would remain in Irish hands. As an island nation we have to be very aware of that. On the other hand, now that the Government has spent money on improving the plant and as we are guaranteeing this enormous debt, there is a very real possibility that some big player on the European mainland may decide to move in, take over and start rationalising, which might ultimately lead to them supplying fertiliser and phosphate from Europe rather than from this country. The Government is on the horns of a dilemma, but in the circumstances I do not see what else it can do other than bring in this legislation to ensure that the debt is managed and continues to be underwritten.</P>
    <P>Even though Senator Ross might not share my enthusiasm, I have long admired the NTMA. It has contributed greatly to improving the finances of this country, although Senator Ross has made the point on more than one occasion that we have nothing to compare it with. It is effectively a monopoly and does not operate to any specific efficiency ratio. We accept what it is doing is right because there is no other management agency in <Col N="734" /> the country that one can use as a benchmark. Notwithstanding that, I believe it has done a good job and it is appropriate that this enabling legislation be included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not want to reopen a debate on this. However, because IFI relied and continues to rely to a great extent on its distribution network, there was great concern at the unofficial dispute by the ILDA last year. There is a leading trade unionist in the House in the person of Senator O'Toole. I know he does not have responsibility for the ILDA's actions given that it is outside congress, however, its decision to prevent haulage to and from the Arklow plant to further its own agenda was irresponsible, bordering on national sabotage.</P>
    <P>I know that there are rights involved and I do not wish to suggest that the members of the ILDA, as it then was, did not have a passion, commitment and conviction about what it was attempting to do. The vast majority of trade unionists recognise that there is a higher agenda, the national interest. However, the national interest was not served by the unilateral decision to prevent trains from going in and out of the Arklow plant last year. I still have vivid memories of seeing on the television news workers coming out of the plant, very concerned and visibly upset by what they saw as yet another barb being sent in their direction. When one knows the background to the difficulties that NET and the IFI had since 1967 and even before, one can readily understand that that action is not one that would have been accepted by the workforce there. I hope it will not be repeated. There comes a time in industrial disputes when the national interest should take over, but that is not always the case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten and Senator Taylor-Quinn referred to another important aspect of this debate, that is the use of phosphates by farmers and the illegal seepage of phosphates into our waterways. I have a file that is getting larger by the month relating to the pollution of the upper Shannon. Sadly, a significant amount of this is as a result of phosphate leakage into the waterway system. Fish are dying along a stretch from Longford through Roosky and into Lough Allen where a significant number of people have spent considerable sums of their own money and devoted much of their time and resources over the past ten years to build up bed and breakfast accommodation, restaurants etc. They rely almost exclusively on coarse fishing, but that business is dwindling because increasingly our friends from across the Irish Sea, who were traditionally the support structure for coarse fishing and the development of tourism in my area right down to Athlone, find in recent years that when they come to fish in waters that traditionally had fish in them there is none.</P>
    <P>I know that Senator O'Toole is very familiar with the upper Shannon &ndash; he boats on it regularly. I am not sure if he fishes on it, but he certainly would be aware of the great concern, bordering on despair, among bed and breakfast <Col N="735" /> owners and those involved in tourism at what they see as the desecration of our waterway. The fish are disappearing at an alarming rate, in many cases as a result of phosphate poisoning, and the evidence is there. I know that it is outside the Minister's brief and outside the brief of this Bill, but because it relates to phosphate, I again call on the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board at least to try to put in the resources necessary to police and monitor this. I also call on local authorities along the route to be more proactive and not be afraid to take prosecutions. I am not aware of prosecutions of any great significance against those who are perpetrating this national sabotage. While it may not relate directly to this Bill, it is an opportunity to issue that plea on behalf of those who wish to continue to make their living from tourism or who have no other choice.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be a sale and that it will be to an Irish purchaser. There are indications that some entrepreneurs or groups are watching this development &ndash; and the passage of this legislation &ndash; very closely. Could the Minister of State give some indication of the current state of play or is that commercially sensitive information? Is there a real chance, now that this legislation is about to be enacted, the debt guaranteed and an increase in the limit, that this will satisfy those who might be considering investing? Is this now a viable company or is it simply another indication of the Government's commitment to ensuring that jobs are maintained for the sake of jobs? </P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with that but I recall the early 1980s when people in Leitrim, Sligo and north Roscommon were fighting very hard for the retention of the Connacht coalfields. The seams were running out, there was a very high ash content and the cost of continuing was not seen as economically or commercially viable. There were plans afoot to create a second mining facility in Arigna which would use the then contemporary technology to extract coal. However, it never came to anything due to lack of money. In this situation, £180 million is being effectively written off by the Government to ensure that 630 jobs are kept in Arklow. I have absolutely no problem with that and, if it was in my part of the country, I would argue passionately for it, as no doubt any of us would because it is about jobs. I hope there will be some relief from the uncertainty which the workers in Arklow are obviously facing. They must feel very uncertain about their future, despite the guarantees given by the Tánaiste. Perhaps the Minister can offer them some succour in that regard about the future of the plant. In general, like my colleagues, I commend this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mooney has ranged far and wide. I am not sure of the relationship between his speech and Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta but at least it was very interesting. He raised some provocative issues which I cannot ignore. <Col N="736" /> We should recognise that, while the ILDA were walking up and down with their banners, members of the NBRU and SIPTU walked past them and went to work. That took a lot of courage. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions publicly opposed the ILDA action on every occasion. That is something which political parties could learn from in terms of dealing with miscreants who step out of line now and then. If a little internal discipline is required, the trade union movement will not be found wanting.</P>

      <P>I am possibly the person who has spoken longest and most often on the Shannon waterways since I was elected to this House, although I acknowledge that all three Senators present have contributed to that debate on every occasion. I am happy to read some good news into the record of the House in relation to the Shannon. During the last two months, anglers have been catching brown trout in Lough Derg &ndash; old fashioned brown trout, not rainbow trout. I saw five one-and-a-half pound brown trout landed in Mountshannon in May. Many fishermen stayed on the Shannon this year instead of going to the west for the mayfly because the fishing was so good there. That is some recognition of the improvements in waste water management at various towns along the river, including Portumna at the top of the lake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>But not fully up the river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but it shows what can be done if action is taken. Senator Mooney quite rightly referred &ndash; and perhaps this is the connection with the Bill &ndash; to the problems created by nitrates and phosphates getting into waters and causing endless damage. The most recent survey showed that, although there are significant problems arising from bad management of waste water and domestic sewage from towns along the way, by far the biggest problem comes from farming sources. That is the reality and there is a huge cost involved.</P>
      <P>This Bill is essential and has to be passed. One can read it with some poignancy and sadness, reflecting on our situation in 1979 and 1980. I recall those times very clearly, especially the impact on the trade union movement of the possibility of NET collapsing. At that time, there were 1,500 jobs involved, the loss of which, in 1980, would be a crushing blow by any standards. Unlike now, there was no job creation and unemployment was on the way up. I believe the Government made a wise decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="737" /> Senator Taylor-Quinn asked an important question. The debt has gone from £164 million to about £195 million in the meantime. That does not sound like great management, although I say that without having all the facts. Perhaps there are very good reasons. I find it impossible to comprehend the situation. The only function of the company since 1987 was to manage the debt and the income. Was the income from the gas contract never enough to meet the expenses of the debt? That appears to be the case. If that is so, we should have been looking much sooner at the kind of measure now being taken.</P>
    <P>I fully support the transfer of the debt, through the Minister, to the NTMA for management. Senator Ross is completely and utterly wrong in his frequently repeated statements on this matter. There are benchmarks for measurement purposes. I use a very simple comparison, based on the savings arising from the NTMA operations. The cost of managing the £30 billion or so of national debt has always been somewhat less than 10%. That was not bad at all. I am referring to figures for two years ago &ndash; I have not seen last year's figures. In terms of investments, fund management and use of the money market, the operation has been extraordinarily successful.</P>
    <P>What we are talking of, in the present context, is writing off the debt. There is really no management of the debt. It will just go into the NTMA and appear in the books. It would be cleaner to write it off, suffer the loss in year one and forget it. I think I know the answer to my question on whether the gas contract paid for the cost of the debt &ndash; it obviously did not.</P>
    <P>I have another question which, perhaps, I should have researched before this debate. As the company stands, is it now making money? What is IFI getting out of it? Is NET getting anything at all out of it since the new company was established? What is the situation in that regard? IFI seems to be trading reasonably satisfactorily without increasing debt, but is it generating a profit and, if so, where is that profit going?</P>
    <P>On a third question, what is the current estimated value of IFI? In other words, if the State finds a buyer, what is the asking price? That figure would allow us to make some judgment as to the overall net outcome. Taking it that we are down £195 million, what are the best and worst case scenarios for our 51% share in IFI? </P>
    <P>I note the proposal to repeal the provision for worker representation on the board. There is no point in having worker representation on the board when there is no board and nothing to manage. Therefore, I have no difficulty with that provision. However, in a time of partnership, it brings to mind the fact there are not enough companies moving in this direction, and it is worrying to see the reaction, particularly in the UK, to the recent directive from the EU insisting on more consultation with the workforce before taking significant decisions.</P>
    <P>Members in this and the other House know more than others what happens when a company <Col N="738" /> closes in their area. There is absolute anger which in the first place is directed towards Government and elected politicians. Very often there is no consultation with the workers, and the first they hear about it is on the news or five minutes before it is reported on the news when they are called together by senior management. In IFI and NET we saw total worker commitment to restructuring and improving the product and to running the company as efficiently as possible. It is a sad episode. Perhaps it is one of those industries which is no longer fully viable in this country.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and suggest in the interests of efficiency of business that we take all Stages tonight. I do not see Members coming forward with amendments, and we have much business this week and next week. There can be no valid objection to disposing of the Bill tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Ms Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Gabhaim buíochas do na Seanadóirí uilig as ucht na tacaíochta, thart ar an iomlán, mar gheall ar an mBille. Enacting this Bill will enable NET to transfer its State guaranteed debt to the Minister for Finance, and he may delegate responsibility for the debt management and repayment to the NTMA. The outcome will be that NET will be relieved of its historically accumulated debt, which it has retained since 1987 when the restructuring took place.</P>
      <P>I wish to address a number of the questions and comments raised by Senators. Senator Taylor-Quinn referred to the history of the debt. The majority of the State guaranteed debt was built up in the 1970s, mainly as a result of a large cost overrun during the construction of the Marino Point plant in Cork. At the time of the joint venture in 1987 NET, in its new capacity as a holding company for the State shareholding, retained an historically accumulated debt of £164.4 million. Therefore, the debt belonged to the holding company and not the new company. Prior to that NET was a manufacturing company.</P>
      <P>Since 1987 it is estimated that approximately £200 million has been paid on the debt. NET has always managed the debt to the best extent possible by obtaining the best cost of funds available. A substantial amount of the interest payments made by NET were funded by income generated from the commercial arrangements between NET and IFI. The contract for the sale of gas concluded in 1999 which has had a cumulative effect and has increased the debt as a consequence.</P>
      <P>Since 1988 IFI has made a total profit of £63 million. Some £30 million was invested some time ago in upgrading the Belfast plant to a proper standard. During the same period NET lost £157 million with the interest payments to service the debt over the years. Last year IFI lost £11.58 million, but the previous year it made a profit of £3.8 million. It is a very difficult market which is quite volatile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in my speech, a decision was made to discuss the future sale of IFI. The <Col N="739" /> Government is committed to seeking a purchaser who must be committed to retaining and developing the company as a manufacturing facility with the intention of securing, in so far as possible, the future jobs of the company. That is the main criterion being set down by the Government. Prior to any sale all employment issues will be fully explored with employees through the consultative committees which would be formed at the time. Because of the volatility of the industry and the commitments expected by the Government there are not too many potentially interested at present in the purchase of IFI.</P>
    <P>Regarding speculation as to how much it is worth, I will leave that to somebody else. Perhaps Senator O'Toole might rise to the occasion and give a guesstimate. I am not in a position to do that as it would depend on the market and whether people are interested in purchasing the plant.</P>
    <P>Other issues were raised which are certainly not within my brief or within the remit of the Bill, though those issues have very important implications. Senator Taylor-Quinn raised the issue of EU directives and their consequences for such an industry and similar industries which may not currently be seen as politically correct in an EU context. Companies will have to work within the confines of those directives. However, I agree that fertiliser is not necessarily the main pollutant, and people from the Shannon basin would certainly be aware of this. It is a very difficult issue and one of which we must be cognisant in terms of the protection of our waterways from a fishing perspective and as a source of our drinking water. I am sure the company is fully aware of any prospective new legislation which may have implications for it and that it will work within those confines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise the issue of the statement of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources in relation to Arramara Teoranta and particularly the Meenmore plant which is based in Dungloe.</P>
      <P>Arramara was established in Dungloe in 1968. Currently it has 12 full-time workers, two of whom have been there from the very start, for 33 years, and six of whom have more than 25 years' service. The company also has between 100 and 200 seaweed harvesters stretching from Mayo to Donegal.</P>
      <P>Shock waves ran through this rural community yesterday as a result of the Minister's announcement. It is an area where there is no alternative employment and a high level of unemployment. While there were difficulties over the past two years, the suddenness of the announcement took us all by surprise. I am displeased with the announcement. I am particularly displeased that the information was made available to the media before the board, the management, the workers and local public representatives were informed. I know all the people who work in that factory and yesterday's announcement came as a tremendous shock.</P>
      <P>The National Seaweed Forum stated the need for more added value in the industry. However, this company, particularly the Dungloe plant, has been given no chance. The announcement that all operations are to be relocated to the company's plant at Kilkieran in Galway was made before any meaningful discussions could take place on developing alternative projects at Meenmore. I cannot understand, therefore, why the Minister states that high priority will be given by his Department to consultation with all the relevant interests. The difficulties have been known for two years and the management discussed the possible alternative some six to nine months ago with the board and the Department, but no serious discussions have taken place since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to postpone the closure of the Dungloe plant until a chance has been given to find alternatives. Otherwise many harvesters could drop out in the short term. The blame for this fiasco lies totally with the Department's co-shareholder ISP Algenates UK, formerly Kelco. The position we are in is due to the failure to build a third plant in Mayo in the early 1990s. Kelco was displeased that this venture did not proceed. Subsequently it purchased 75% of another company in Canada and its product was sourced there. Despite many years of providing good quality seafood meal at low prices at the Dungloe plant, the company is to reduce the volume of product taken from 6,500 tonnes in 1997 to about 2,000 tonnes this year. Despite increased sales to other markets, which have risen from 1,500 tonnes in 1997 to 3,500 tonnes this year, the lack of loyalty on the part of the shareholder, ISP <Col N="741" /> Algenates, which is now walking away, is the death knell for this Dungloe activity.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the company is insolvent. I do not accept this. There has been a lack of investment. No subsidy has been paid to this company despite the only financial drain on the Department being the set-up costs in 1968. Many other lame ducks have been carried for years. I ask the Government to provide £1 million to enable this company to restructure financially and to retain jobs in Dungloe until an alternative is found.</P>
    <P>I would also like clarification on the following matters. When will the relocation to Galway take place? What is the up-to-date position in relation to consultation on alternative product production? How will the proposed restructuring secure the future of the company given the record of one of the shareholders to date? How will protection of the employment and income of seaweed harvesters in this coastal community in the Rosses be achieved as stated by the Minister yesterday? For what will the £350,000 commitment by the Department and ISP Algenates be used? Is it an investment towards redundancy payments? What package will be available to the workers, many of whom have given more than 25 years' service to the company, and particularly for the manager who has given 33 years of his life to this company? Will any compensation be made available to the harvesters and hauliers who have worked for this company in a self-employed capacity? Most of these men will have no alternative now but to go on the dole or to return to work for McAlpine and Wimpey as they did before they came back here to work for this company. Given the record of the shareholder in the Dungloe plant, how can long-term viability be restored and the business developed in the future?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard with shock the Minister's recent announcement about Arramara Teoranta. I understand from the statement that consideration is being given to making a substantial investment in the company. I support Senator Bonner's proposal that the suggested amount be increased substantially to support the company in overcoming its current difficulties and to secure its future.</P>
      <P>Arramara Teoranta has played a very substantial role in the economic viability of the western seaboard. When times were bad economically, when there were no jobs and no opportunities, it sustained hundreds of families. It is a very important company and has a very important future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I served on the board of Arramara Teoranta for five years. During my tenure, two thirds of its production was being sold in third party sales. As representatives of the Government's interest in the company, we took a defined line of building up third party exports over a two to three year period to the extent that there was balance within the company and we did not have all our eggs in <Col N="742" /> one basket. With our partners, Kelco International at the time and then Monsanto, we took a firm vote within the company that to keep it strong we would direct our sales into third parties as strongly as we could. That direction seems to have changed. The new partners, ISP Algenates who were brought in from Monsanto, have changed the direction of the company over the past few years and have decided not to purchase the amounts they used to because of changes and restructuring, and they have left the company in this dilemma.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposal offers an opportunity for the company. It needs to be restructured, it needs investment and it needs a change in its outlook. It needs to change direction. The whole structure of the company should be examined, particularly its relationship with its partners, ISP Algenates, with a view to taking up the opportunities and challenges offered by the current economic climate. We must look after the interests of the people who are clearly affected by these decisions. I ask the Minister to take that strongly into account. There is a great opportunity for change in the new legislation, and for putting the future of the company and the seaweed industry on an agreed long-term basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Bonner and my good friend from Mayo for raising this issue. I would like to say how sorry I am this has happened because I live in a small coastal community and know the impact this will have on the community in Dungloe.</P>
      <P>The Minister confirmed in a statement yesterday that Arramara Teoranta is to be restructured to restore its long-term viability and develop the business into the future, which is absolutely vital. Discussions on the financial restructuring package are ongoing between the shareholders and, when concluded, formal announcements by the company are expected to follow in the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>Arramara Teoranta was established in 1947 to produce seaweed meal for use in the alginate industry. Alginates have a wide variety of applications ranging from use in food and animal feed production to use in the pharmaceutical industry. The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources holds 51% of the shares in Arramara Teoranta on behalf of the Government. ISP Alginates (UK) Limited, formerly Kelco, holds the remaining 49% of the issued shares. Called up share capital stands at £77,000. The company operates two plants. Its main base is at Kilkieran, Connemara, and it operates a second plant at Meenmore, Dungloe, County Donegal. The company employs 34 people in total with a further 400 people engaged in seasonal seaweed harvesting along the coast from Malin Head to Loop Head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> Due to downturns in the global alginate market, combined with increased competition from Chile, China and other countries, Arramara Teoranta has experienced trading difficulties which have accelerated in the past 12 months. ISP, which throughout has been Arramara's main customer, has reduced its annual purchases of weed from 6,500 tonnes in 1997 to just 2,000 tonnes in 2001. Third party sales have been developed from a very low base in the mid-1990s to 3,000 tonnes in 2000. Losses of over £100,000 were incurred last year.</P>
    <P>In light of the situation, a business review of the company's prospects was commissioned by my Department in consultation with the other shareholder and the company. The business analysis confirms that a viable business can be maintained if operations are restructured on the basis of relocation of all production to Arramara's Connemara plant which can fully service expected product demand.</P>
    <P>This restructuring is, therefore, expected to entail the closure and sale of the facility at Meenmore in County Donegal. There are 12 permanent employees and three temporary staff at Meenmore. I emphasise again that discussions are ongoing between the shareholders and the company's bank on the proposed restructuring which will require funding of £350,000. When a satisfactory financial agreement is concluded, the company will take the necessary decisions, consult the staff and proceed with negotiations on a fair and <Col N="744" /> reasonable package. In that context, the Minister has confirmed that he will be giving high priority to the possible scope for development of alternative projects at Meenmore in consultation with all relevant interests.</P>
    <P>It must be said that a restructuring package is critical to the viability of the company at this time and to its future. In this regard, the Minister has Government agreement to negotiate the best possible funding package which will reposition the company on a solid footing and enable it to develop into the future. Legislation will be brought forward to underpin any funding decision on foot of a satisfactory agreement being concluded.</P>
    <P>I am confident that we will have general support in pressing ahead with an essential strategy which will, first and foremost, secure the future of Arramara Teoranta, ensure a return to profitability and underpin most of the direct and seasonal employment in the interests of the coastal communities concerned. The Minister and ISP as shareholders will continue to work closely with the company over the coming weeks to deliver on that strategy to underpin a sound and sustainable future for Arramara Teoranta.</P>
    <P>I do not have the answers to some of the questions asked but I will convey them immediately to the two Senators. I thank them again for raising this issue which must be causing great hardship and concern in their local areas.</P>
