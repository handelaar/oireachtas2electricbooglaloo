      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000, (Additional Functions) Order, 2001, to be taken for one hour with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed seven minutes and all other Senators not to exceed five minutes; No. 2, Sustainable Energy Bill, 2001 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; No. 3, ACC Bank Bill, 2001 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages, not to be taken before 3.30 p.m.; and No. 19, motion 24, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., and business, if not previously concluded, to resume thereafter. I was to propose to take statements but that will not be going ahead now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to facilitate the House by having a wide-ranging debate on sports policy. Major issues are engaging the attentions of a great number of people. There are some big decisions to be taken. In the spirit in which Senator Glennon suggested a week or two ago, a wide-ranging debate would be welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Leader in a position to give a date for the debate which was promised on the Middle East? We had a very useful meeting yesterday with Mr. Nabil Sha'ath, a Cabinet Minister of the Palestinian Authority. It would be timely for a reasoned exchange of views such as we had yesterday.</P>
      <P>Could the Leader tell us when the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Bill will come before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request from Senator Manning that the House should have a <Col N="1122" /> wide-ranging debate on sport. It is the focus of attention in the other House and in the media. One can hardly open a newspaper or listen to a radio programme without an item on Stadium Ireland. It is becoming &ldquo;curiouser and curiouser&rdquo;. It is important to have a wide-ranging debate so that we can see where it fits in the context of the provision of sports facilities for all.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House arising from the alarming statements of the Garda Commissioner yesterday that there is profound concern in the community in relation to crime. Obviously the policy of zero tolerance is now in tatters. He said that the situation is pretty dire in the community at large and he will be obliged to target resources in specific areas in order to deal with the situation. The Minister, who has prided himself on zero tolerance, should inform this House of the situation and why there is a conflict between what he and the Garda Commissioner are saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the whole issue of the national children's strategy. I waited for many weeks in the hope that perhaps another Senator would raise the issue and that it would not fall to a female Member to do so. It is one of the single most exciting developments in the whole policy-making process of this Government that it has published a national children's strategy. A reading of the document will show how much it will be to the benefit of children and also parents, older people and the whole community.</P>
      <P>It is important that we ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House. Our policy of zero tolerance has been very successful, but we must now look at the different challenges facing us in the whole area of security, especially the challenges facing the Garda Síochána. I witnessed last weekend the brazenness of some young people which gardaí must face on a daily basis while performing their duties. We must look in a constructive way at how society is changing and what we can do about it. I would welcome a debate on the issue of crime with the Minister present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood last week that we were going to have a debate this week on the health services, or lack of them. The Minister will be present to discuss the draft order on the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000 (Additional Functions) Order, 2001. Is this then meant to be the debate on health? I am surprised that the Leader has not given us the opportunity to debate the health services, seeing that the Minister will be in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Norris's request for a debate on the Middle East. I am delighted that it will take place this week. Senator George Mitchell's report on the current situation <Col N="1123" /> in the Middle East makes this an opportune time to discuss the matter.</P>
      <P>There has been a request to have a debate on transport. There is the impression that public transport in Ireland is dire. It is time somebody stood up here and thanked the staff generally of Iarnród Éireann and CIE for the fantastic work they are doing. There is a small number of people within Iarnród Éireann who are creating problems, but as one who uses public transport a great deal the general opinion of those who travel on Iarnród Éireann is that we are dealing with a group of people who are satisfied and pleasant, and&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be right if this House were to lead on this issue. The public disorder which is taking place around the country is disturbing, and it would be right and proper to have a debate on it. That people are being killed every second week is not an unusual occurrence here. I have been around for a while and I find this frightening. I have been involved with the public for a long time. No example is being shown and there is no recognition of the law. This House could lead on this issue by making the point to the Minister so that the public can be aware that we are not only concerned but are making sure something is done about it.</P>
      <P>Last weekend two people were killed in towns, not cities. Towns are tidy places and people can be found quite easily. It is disturbing that these people seem to think they can get away with it &ndash; the general impression is that they can get away with it. If one kills a person and thinks that he or she can walk around for the next two years without being questioned and charged, it is wrong and is very serious. We should take the lead on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to the call by Senator Manning and others for a wide-ranging debate on sports policy. I do not understand the unseemly rush on Abbotstown for contractors in advance of the overview, the so-called independent review, which we cannot have for three months. Yet I know Senator Dardis&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to debate it now. I admire Senator Dardis's smile because he will not object to the relocation. It may prove to be the right decision in the end. We appear to be putting the cart before the horse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on law and order. I was particularly pleased to hear the Garda Commissioner admit <Col N="1124" /> at long last that one of the big issues facing us today is the amount of money which young people have and, second, the amount of alcohol which is being consumed. Many of the difficulties can be focused back to that area. In days gone by, one would be regarded as old fashioned to make that point. More and more people are coming to the realisation that that is the reason for it. If we are to have a debate here it is important to broaden it. We are talking about changes in society, changes in family life and the extra freedom which young people have. I do not think any policy or any Garda surveillance will change that unless we focus on the core issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate, at which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is present, on compulsory purchase orders and that whole system. A huge amount of new road network is about to be built and there is much concern among landowners and house owners throughout the country, particularly where it is proposed to build those roads, about the long-term effect it will have on them. I call on the Leader to arrange such a debate before the end of the session. This matter is urgent given that many of the routes are being finalised. It is very important to have a full debate and to change the rules and procedures in relation to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on crime and public order generally. I agree with my colleague, Senator Ó Murchú, that it should be as wide as possible. I specifically call on the Leader to ask the Minister to urge the Garda Síochána to implement the Public Order Act and the by-laws that have been put in place in Dublin. It is blatant that gardaí are not confiscating drink from people who are drinking in public places. This is causing huge problems. It is turning very quiet communities into rowdy ghettos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the call for a debate on young people and particularly the fact that so many of them are getting involved in alcohol and drug abuse. Central to that debate must be the issue of sporting and recreation facilities in towns and cities, particularly in the working class areas where there is nothing at all. People with money can get into a club, but people in many urban areas without the means to pay the fees have nothing. It is time that changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request by Senator Cox for a debate on children's policy, which may underlie many of the other concerns we have in the longer term. I strongly support the desire of Senators Ó Murchú and O'Dowd to widen the debate to cover values in society and to seek options other than the pub culture for young people. The short-term problem is law and order but the longer-term problem is health. If we have a debate it should include the issues of sport and <Col N="1125" /> health as well as law and order. This should be carried out, not in a confrontational way, but in a way that seeks to find a way forward for our society which is in a state of transition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on law and order. As I have been saying since I came into this House and for a long time before that, the basic problem is alcohol abuse. Unless we come to grips with that, we will have social problems that will be impossible to handle. For many years we blamed poor people and the unemployed. However, we now see children who went to middle class schools being brought before courts on manslaughter charges. Alcohol abuse is affecting society from the top to the bottom. I would like a debate on it, but it needs to be broadened.</P>
      <P>I previously asked for a debate on the convoys of Traveller business people going round the country, parking in places and leaving a mess afterwards. In some cases they demand money to leave. This is a serious problem and something will have to be done with this convoy system of 30 or 40 people. In the old days it was not traditional for more than two families to travel together.</P>
      <P>We should also have a debate on whether the Equal Status Act should be amended. Many publicans and hoteliers are finding it nearly impossible to run their businesses. The criminal element is abusing it by going in and causing a problem; they subsequently go in again and are refused. They then blackmail the proprietor and demand money by threatening to object to the licence renewal. The Equal Status Act was good in its intention, but it is being abused by a small element that is making life hell for publicans and hoteliers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the calls from the other side of the House for a full debate on sport and Campus Ireland. I would like to see the facts outlined in this House. They were outlined yesterday very clearly by the chief executive officer of Campus Ireland. They were also outlined in the other House and I would welcome an opportunity for the Minister to do likewise in this House. However, I expect that the Opposition will still not listen and will continue bandying totally exaggerated figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on sport. It should be a broadly based debate, including how our most promising athletes are currently being funded through the national lottery. I would be ashamed to say how much one of this country's top cyclists is getting from the national lottery. The broad issue of funding for sport should certainly be debated in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Senators who raised the issue of law and order. The Leader should consider taking motion 8 under item 19 on the Order <Col N="1126" /> Paper. If it cannot be taken today, time should be allocated for it tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on law and order. I particularly noted the point raised by Senator Maurice Hayes when he spoke of the value systems of today and made comparison with those of previous generations. Perhaps that is where the core issue lies. The home life aspect has to be emphasised. Parents must take responsibility. Other people are simply <i>in loco parentis.</i> The issue involves parents, teachers and students. The home must be the starting point and unless we get it right at that point, all other extraordinary ways of handling the situation will fail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>One is always wary on hearing one's name invoked on the other side of the House. However, I welcome all the calls for a debate on sport. When I spoke in this context last week, I used the phrase &ldquo;for the hundreds of thousands of people involved in honest athletic endeavour throughout the country.&rdquo; I was not referring at that stage to Stadium Ireland and specifically not to what I described as the show business end of sport. I welcome the realisation that healthy sporting activity among our young people is absolutely essential to their future well-being. All the other issues mentioned are affected by it, but the core issue is the funding of sport and of voluntary effort to encourage sporting activity among the youth of our country. I am delighted to join again in all the calls for a debate on this aspect of sport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleague, Senator Glennon, and in response to Senator Manning who raised this subject last week in a different context in relation to the Football Association of Ireland, I am pleased there seems to be a general consensus on all sides of the House about having a debate on sport. I wish to qualify Senator Burke's comment about national lottery funding. As the House is aware, most funding for sport is channelled through the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation. This is the first time that a Government in this State has a Minister with responsibility for sport who sits at the Cabinet table with real power and effectiveness. It is a long way from the time when our colleagues on the other side of the House appointed a Minister with responsibility for sport whose first job was to repaint the offices&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to make the point in relation to the national lottery that this House and the other House changed the ground rules for apportioning national lottery funds. In the original legislation in 1986, when the national lottery was first introduced&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Mooney, if you will bear with me for one moment, please, I have made it clear to Senators that I have no objection to political charges being made during the course of debates in the House, but I object to such charges being made on the Order of Business. Political charges provoke disorder on the Order of Business. I would prefer it if Senator Mooney would confine himself to a question or a request to the Leader of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to accede to the Cathaoirleach's request. Senator Burke raised an important issue about national lottery funding for sport and legislation surrounding it. We should examine that aspect of funding. Much funding that was supposed to be for sport was channelled into health and the percentages changed to the detriment of sport's funding. That is why I am asking&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, A Chathaoirligh, the Senator has no right to impugn my motives or read anything into my words other than what I said. Had he been present he would have heard what I said. It is typical of him to indulge in points scoring in a debate which was good tempered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked yesterday for a debate on the lack of facilities for youth sport. It relates to the matter raised by Senator Manning this morning, that is, sport. He raised nothing else, and I support the call for such a debate. We now have a Minister for Sport and this is an opportunity for him to measure himself and state what he has achieved. The two matters are related because if there is proper funding for sports people to achieve success at the highest level, then they act as role models for the young.</P>

Points can be raised with the Minister who will be here.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello, Cox, Cregan, Burke, Farrell, Ó Murchú, Ormonde and Fitzgerald called for a debate on crime and the Government's progress. There have been 1,000 gardaí appointed and the revolving door system is eliminated. Extra prison places were built under the present Government. A review is called for in the House, and to assist the Minister with future policy, I will allow that as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Senators Cox, Maurice Hayes, and others called for a debate on the recently published national children's strategy. It is an excellent document and I will allow time to discuss it. Senator Jackman asked for a debate on health, which I intend to have as soon as possible. The Senator may think that it will be discussed this week&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Tom Hayes called for a debate with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on land prices in areas where land will need to be acquired for the national roads network, such as Dublin to Cork, Dublin to Galway, Dublin to Limerick and Dublin to Belfast, and all the parcels of land that will have to be acquired by the NRA to make this possible. I will leave time for this debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell called, as did Senator Glynn last week, for a debate on transient Travellers. I said I would allow time for this debate in the future. Senator Farrell also called for a debate on the Equal Status Act and a review of its operation, particularly in relation to the hotel trade and publicans in general. There seems to be an abuse in this regard and I will leave time for a debate.</P>

      <P>Before seeking the approval of the Seanad for this important resolution, I would like to give some background information concerning the events which have led to the making of this order. I have no doubt this House will agree that one of the success stories in relation to human health in the last century has been the reduction and, in some cases, elimination of disease and death due to infectious diseases, particularly in relation to diphtheria, pertussis and polio. Many of us may recall stories told by parents or grandparents of whole families being wiped out as a result of diphtheria. Thankfully, those days are no longer with us. Vaccines against a range of serious diseases, such as diphtheria, pertussis, polio and measles, have been developed and introduced into vaccination programmes around the world, and Ireland has been no exception in this regard.</P>
      <P>The background to this draft order is that as a result of media interest in 1990 and 1991, three vaccine trials that had been undertaken on children in care in Ireland in the 1960s and 1970s were brought to the attention of the then Minister for Health. Two of these trials were the subject of published articles in peer reviewed medical journals. The then Minister for Health answered a question on the matter in the Dáil in May 1991. Interest in these trials continued and on 9 July 1997 the then Minister promised to have inquiries made into the matter following which he would consider appropriate action. The chief medical officer of the Department of Health and Children was asked to make these inquiries on the Minister's behalf and his report entitled report on three clinical trials involving babies and children in institutional settings 1960-61, 1970 and 1973 was laid before both Houses in November 2000.</P>
      <P>The Minister has welcomed the interest which Members of both Houses have shown in the report and he shares the view that answers must be provided to the various issues raised in the report. He is also acutely aware of the serious concerns of former residents of a number of children's homes who are concerned that they may have been involved in these trials. These children were in the care of the State and it is important to establish if the State fulfilled its obligations to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1130" /> It is important to state that, in this case, we are looking at marginal degrees of difference in the vaccines administered not at experimental, unproven or dangerous medications. Furthermore, we must take into account that the protocols of 30 years ago are not necessarily the protocols applied today. However, the Minister has already indicated that he is not satisfied that the chief medical officer has been able to establish that solid informed consent was given by the people entitled to give it. He rightly considers this issue of consent to be absolutely fundamental.</P>
    <P>The Minister has raised questions which he considers must be asked, irrespective of the overall intent of the trials and irrespective of the indications that no child suffered medically as a result. These are questions which unfortunately the report cannot answer; questions such as, why children in care were given a more experimental vaccine than children not in the State's care. Was the end result from each trial for the public good or for the commercial advantage of a manufacturer? Why were some medications given to children who were outside the age group at which those medications were known to be effective? And above all, why are the records of some of the trials so woefully inadequate at almost every point? These questions must be asked in a context which offers the competence to thoroughly investigate the matter. For that reason, the report has been sent to Justice Laffoy so that the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse may consider it as part of its wide ranging investigation.</P>
    <P>This decision is based on the rights of those involved who are entitled to a thorough wide ranging and public investigation of all the issues involved. The Laffoy commission offers the best mechanism for dealing expeditiously and rigorously with the totality of the issues. The appropriateness of referring the report to the Laffoy commission was raised in the Dáil last November. At that stage, the Attorney General advised as follows: The definition of &ldquo;abuse &ldquo; in the Inquiry to Child Abuse Act, 2000, includes any wilful infliction of physical injury or failure to prevent such injury to a child and any failure to care for a child, or act or omission towards a child which has serious effects on the child's behaviour or welfare&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In so far as clinical trials are alleged to have been conducted without the appropriate consent and in so far as these trials are alleged to include the use of injections and intra-nasal administration of drugs, quite clearly an issue arises as to whether any such trials amounted in law to an assault or an unlawful invasion of the physical integrity of the children involved. Likewise, the consequences of participating in any such trials are matters relating to the welfare of children. All these issues fall within the scope of the commission as expressed in section 1 of the Act.</P>
    <P>It was further stated by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children that the issue of whether the commission required additional powers by means of a Government order to <Col N="1131" /> investigate the vaccines report would be considered by the commission. It was also made clear by the Taoiseach that the approval of both Houses would be sought should such an order be deemed necessary.</P>
    <P>Having considered the relevant issues in the intervening period, it is the clear view of both the Attorney General and the chairperson of the commission that, as matters stand, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse has the competence to investigate the vaccines report. However, the chairperson has suggested to the Minister that it would be helpful, for the sake of clarity, if the terms of reference for the commission's investigation into the report were to be incorporated in a Government order. This course of action has been agreed following consultation between the commission and the Attorney General's office.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the draft order is to define the parameters of the commission's inquiry into the vaccine report. The Government may, under section 4 of the Commission on Child Abuse Act, 2000, by order confer on the commission and its committees additional functions or powers connected with their functions and powers. The proposed order provides for additional functions to be conferred on the commission as follows: to inquire, through the investigation committee, into the circumstances, legality, conduct, ethical propriety and effects on the subjects thereof of (i) the three vaccine trials referred to in the report and (ii) any systematic trials of a vaccine or the mode of delivery thereof to test its efficacy or to ascertain its side effects on a person found by the investigation committee to have taken place during the period commencing on 1 January 1940 and ending on 31 December 1987, and to have been conducted in an institution, following an allegation by a person that he or she as a child in the institution was a subject thereof, and to prepare and publish to the general public in such manner and at such time as the commission may determine a report in writing specifying the determinations made by the investigation committee in its report under article 4 of this order.</P>
    <P>The Minister has outlined on a number of occasions the advantages of having the report and its implications fully investigated by the Laffoy commission. The commission has the full range of powers and personnel needed &ndash; an experienced secretariat, a strong panel of experts with the requisite qualifications and an investigative and legal infrastructure.</P>
    <P>There is a clear synergy between investigating this matter and the other matters being addressed by the commission and the Laffoy commission offers a comprehensive vehicle for dealing with the totality of these issues. Ms Justice Laffoy has indicated her willingness and competence to take on this role and, as the Minister indicated, the Department of Health and Children will fully co-operate with the commission in the course of its investigation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1132" /> We believe that entering this process makes a clear and unambiguous statement to those involved in the trials that every effort will be made to find out if their rights were protected all those years ago. We wish to do this in a forum that has the power to investigate, to compel witnesses and to publish its findings without fear or favour.</P>
    <P>The Laffoy commission, for all the reasons I outlined, offers by far the best opportunity to secure answers to the many questions raised in the report. I ask Members of the House to approve this resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am pleased the draft order is before us for approval, but the concern of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, that the Minister of State outlined rings hollow given it is more than 12 months since this issue was raised. When the draft was published in <i>The Irish Times</i> last March the Minister stated specifically he would publish it within weeks, but then there was a six months' delay up to November and the draft order has only come before us 12 months after the issue was raised. That does not reflect that the Minister considers this matter to be extremely urgent, which we believe it to be.</P>
      <P>I recall Fine Gael policy on the matter at the time, particularly Deputy Gay Mitchell stating he wished the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children had the power to compel witnesses to attend and to answer questions, but that did not happen. As a member of that committee, I am aware the draft order was laid before us, but it has not been debated. While I accept there is a heavy volume of work before the committee, there has been a long delay in debating this draft order, particularly in the context of the safety of vaccines. We spent a considerable number of months dealing with groups in the health area, including health boards, medical personnel and parents who are extremely concerned about possible links between particular vaccines and autism. The Minister should have responded must faster.</P>
      <P>There are many questions to be answered. What struck us most at the time was that 123 of the 211 children concerned &ndash; which is a considerable number &ndash; in the period between approximately 1960 and 1973 were residents of children's homes. That is absolutely dastardly considering the State has such a responsibility for children in the care of the State and that this practice continued for quite a long time. Fortunately for children throughout the rest of the country from what we know, it appears most of the institutions involved were in Dublin, although we do not know that conclusively until the commission inquires into it and, as outlined by the Minister of State, its remit is quite specific.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have preferred if there was compellability of witnesses. Will we ever know the full truth regarding witnesses and consent? I read the various newspaper reports on the issue. <i>The Irish Times</i> mentioned that Professor Irene Hilary <Col N="1133" /> repeatedly asserted that she invariably sought the consent of the appropriate authorities, whether it was parent, management or medical officers, before conducting the trials. That statement shows she was specific. Twelve months later, why have we not at least cleared up the matter of consent?</P>
    <P>Another serious issue concerns the risk of infection as a result of receiving experimental vaccine. This point was omitted during a lengthy period of correspondence. The Laffoy Commission will examine the matter. The report of the chief medical officer of the Department of Health and Children did not draw conclusions, so it is obvious that we need to investigate further. The fact that it was the children in care who received the experimental vaccine suggests that they were discriminated against in favour of the children living in normal families, who received the standard approved vaccine.</P>
    <P>There are many questions to be answered on this topical issue. In conducting my research, I looked at the British public health sector and the Vaccine Damage Payments (Specified Disease) Order, 1995. When one finds that other countries have progressed so far in terms of investigating problems associated with experimental vaccines, etc., one realises that we have more to do than merely check what happened to the children who were victims of vaccination experiments.</P>
    <P>One must question whether the end result of each trial was for the public good or, as the Minister of State mentioned, for the commercial advantage of vaccine manufacturers. Additionally, one must ask why so many vaccines were administered to so many children who were known to be outside the age group within which the vaccines were known to be effective. This is a serious issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State did not say when we might expect to have the reports. We do not know how healthy the victims are, who are now adults. Why were the records of some of the trials so inadequate, almost in every regard? I know that the Minster for Health and Children said that the issue of consent could not be fudged, but he stated that there was evidence of solid informed consent given by those entitled to do so. He also said that there was a lack of documentation regarding the trials that was puzzling and unsatisfactory. I appeal to the Minister of State to inform the Minister for Health and Children that we require a speedy reaction to one of the most serious cases that a commission has been given to investigate. We should be particularly concerned about children in State care. If they were used as guinea pigs and their health has been damaged or impaired, I hope the Minister will compensate them adequately, if this is possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been debated before so I will be brief. I am as anxious as Senator Jackman and the Minster of State that we should attain the facts on the vaccine trials in question. I am also anxious that when the Laffoy <Col N="1134" /> commission investigates this it takes cognisance of the standards of the times. We cannot apply the standards of today to the actions of yesterday, although things have happened to children down through the years that cannot be excused.</P>
      <P>If Edward Jenner was starting work today he would lose his licence to practise as his standards were horrific when compared with today's standards. He was responsible for the elimination of smallpox. It is important that we consider this matter in context and educate ourselves in the way we approach children with regard to their rights and other childhood issues. This report can be an educational one for the State and those employed by it <i>in loco parentis</i> to care for children outside the home. It can help to underpin our understanding of childhood and how we should treat children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is helpful to this debate that the Minister is a general practitioner and we have the benefit of Senator Fitzpatrick who is also a GP. There are few people other than GPs who know about the difficulties with vaccination. I am sorry the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000 (Additional Functions) Order, 2001, is being used to investigate this situation, because I do not think these children were abused.</P>
      <P>Both the Minister and Senator Fitzpatrick know the value of vaccination as well as I do. Sadly, there are too many people nowadays who forget it as they are not in a position to remember the polio epidemic which preceded these trials. I come from Cork where there were over 100 deaths and thousands were crippled from the disease. Everyone in this House wants to protect the rights of children, especially children in care. I speak frequently on this and I hope we do not end up with a situation where far more children are put at risk because of the drama which has been created about these trials, which at the time were absolutely ethical and, indeed, would be ethical today.</P>
      <P>One cannot carry out trials for childhood vaccines on adults. Senator Fitzpatrick referred to Jenner. If he had not started in this area, would we be without smallpox now? I do not know if the medical profession has made people think that all these matters are safe and that nothing will ever go wrong, but certainly the type of trials which were carried out were absolutely ethical. At that time Professor Meenan was a World Health Organisation expert and Dr. Irene Hillery, who carried out the practical part of the trial, went on to become, and still is, an international expert.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course more emphasis should have been put on consent. As president of Cherish, the organisation for single mothers which was set up around that time, I can attest to that more than anyone. I am only too well aware of how little consideration was given to the consent of mothers. Those in authority in institutions perhaps gave consent too regularly, but we allowed them act <i>in loco parentis </i>and that is what they did. We cannot describe these children as guinea pigs, as I have <Col N="1135" /> seen them described in media reports, because that is not so. If I had been asked to let my own children, who were being immunised at that time, take part in the trials, I would have done so.</P>
    <P>Last year we brought in immunisation against meningitis and it has been an astonishing success. Given the terror that surrounded its introduction, I am glad I have never been a general practitioner involved in vaccination. Understandably, parents will always look for a reason if something goes wrong with their child. However, many children's problems are only discovered around the time of immunisation. Take the current controversy linking autism to the measles vaccination. The evidence to connect them appears to be very slim, whereas the genetic evidence appears to be much stronger. Tragically it seems that family linkages are a factor. We are just beginning to find out about many of these issues.</P>
    <P>Last year we had 1,500 cases of measles and two deaths. The year before we had only 47 cases of measles and no deaths. We knew there was an epidemic coming, and two children died from conditions associated with measles, so I hope that this issue will not be blown up too much. We are forgetting about diphtheria, which is breaking out again in eastern Europe, and polio which has nearly been eliminated. If we do not immunise, our children will suffer.</P>
    <P>One of the most extraordinary things about these trials is the stage we are at now. I ask the Minister to confirm that there will be a change in immunisation policy as of June. In the trial carried out in the 1960s Dr. Hillery investigated the possibility of reducing the number of injections given to children. At that stage we did not have the oral polio vaccine and children were given the triple vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis as one injection and the polio vaccine as another. Dr. Hillery investigated whether sufficient immunity could be achieved by giving all the vaccines in one injection. As Members will be aware, however, the more injections one gets, the lower the uptake of an eventual vaccination programme. This is because parents are naturally upset by the distress children experience when getting injections &ndash; even a slightly sore arm causes distress &ndash; so the number of children being immunised falls.</P>
    <P>Some adults have contracted polio from faeces while changing the nappies of babies who have recently received the oral polio vaccination. I understand that a quadruple vaccine programme will be introduced in June, which will vaccinate children against pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus and polio in one injection. If that is true, it means that Dr. Hillery's work will have become standard more than 30 years later. Someone has to do the work to show whether the immunity achieved is adequate. One cannot simply decide to change from one vaccination to another without examining whether children will receive adequate immunity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> The vaccination programme in the 1970s investigated the possibility of reducing the number of organisms of pertussis in the injection. This was because some children got very sore arms and even systemic reactions to the pertussis part of the vaccination, which entailed injecting dead organisms. Dr. Hillery examined whether one could greatly diminish the number of dead organisms and still have a satisfactory result. From June onwards, we will reduce the dose to part of a dead organism in line with the work carried out by Dr. Hillery. She should be praised for her work and these unfortunate circumstances should not have been allowed to arise. It is extraordinary that we are investigating these trials when we are about to introduce a vaccination programme based on her work.</P>
    <P>We must be very careful to ensure that this legislation is not used to investigate all sorts of matters. We could end up investigating the lack of facilities for neonates, on which I have had a heated correspondence for the past couple of years. In a couple of years' time we will have an investigation to establish why some children did not get adequate treatment just after they were born, because the State did not supply adequate facilities. We will have another investigation looking at the implications of the drastic reduction of the number of nurses who were available to treat these children. In 1980 we had 29,000 nurses and we now have about 11,000. Members will be relieved to hear that clerical and administration staff in the health services have risen from 5,400 to well over 11,000. They have more that doubled while the number of nurses has gone down. The number of doctors has risen by about 20%. Will we have an investigation about this under the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000? Children's operations are repeatedly put off. They do not get the quality intensive care nursing they should. Why do we not investigate this under the Act?</P>
    <P>I am glad Senator Fitzpatrick said this must be looked at in the context of the times. Trying to get records from 30 years ago is difficult as we know. While it is important that we look into this from the point of view of those involved, we must remember that the protection of our children is also the physical protection of them by the immunisation programmes we set up. We certainly do not want the current drop in the vaccination uptake to be repeated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I will be brief because I have spoken on this matter before. I do not agree with Senator Henry that the Minister has not attached importance to this. The function of this proposal is to ensure that the Laffoy commission has the competency to investigate this matter. I think it is accepted that it has, but this will clinch it and make absolutely sure that everything is above board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The record keeping of 40 years ago is far removed from what it is today. Both the Minister <Col N="1137" /> and his predecessor ensured that once the complaints came from a former resident of a children's home in Dublin, by way of correspondence with the then Minister, they were investigated. It has already been said that there were some reports in the peer review journals. If there was wrongdoing or impropriety in the past it will be investigated. It is important that the public, who look to the Houses of the Oireachtas to protect their interests, have confidence that whatever happened, however long ago, will be investigated.</P>
    <P>I strongly agree with Senator Henry's views on the importance of vaccines. I regret to say that I lost my eldest brother at four-and-a-half years of age due to complication arising from measles. Vaccination is very important.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the competence of the people involved in those days. The question raised by the Minister about why one group of children were given an experimental vaccine while children not in the State's care got a regular vaccine must be answered. Was the end result for the public's good or for the commercial advantage of a manufacturer? That is a very pertinent question. Why were the medications given to children outside the age group for which it was known to be effective?</P>
    <P>I commend this order to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>As with other Members I welcome and lend my full support to the resolution. The attitude of the Department, as set out by the Minister in his speech, is to be welcomed. It marks the changing attitude, which we all have, to accountability for things which happened in the past and indeed reconciliation with things that happened then. We are going through a period which, while painful, is certainly necessary and ultimately will be very healthy. We must examine files relating to events which took place in past decades, particularly in State institutions, and bring those accountable to justice where necessary. The use of experimental vaccines is one example of children in care being treated very differently from those not in care.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to speak on the medical issues as Senator Henry has already done that. I will deal with the general issues raised and the Laffoy inquiry into child abuse. It has been pointed out by the Minister that the Attorney General's advice, as given to the Dáil last November, makes it clear that any wilful infliction of physical injury, failure to prevent such injury to a child or failure to care for a child which has serious effects on the child's behaviour or welfare, comes under the definition of abuse in the Act. In that regard this issue can be sent to the Laffoy inquiry and can be dealt with adequately. I hope that the issues raised can be reconciled there. I hope that it will be given full public examination and reportage because that is an important part of the processes of accountability and reconciliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The investigation by the Laffoy commission is extremely important. I hope that it will be possible to reconcile the quite serious differences that <Col N="1138" /> have emerged between the groups representing those who have been abused on the one hand, and the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science and the commission on the other, so that the commission can do its work and come to its conclusions. The differences must be reconciled so that those who have been victims of abuse can feel that not only have their cases been adequately and publicly heard, but that accountability and justice are seen to be done. We have some way to go to achieve that, and I extend every best wish to those involved in ensuring that happens. It is undoubtedly one of the black clouds that hangs over the State's care of children in the past that needs to be dealt with if we are to move into a proper democracy.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry referred to issues surrounding the care of children in the current era that would certainly come under the definition of abuse as outlined by the Attorney General. One can only think of the care of troubled teenagers and the necessity to provide resources, not only in our cities but throughout the country, and to look carefully at how we need to deal with that problem. Times and issues have changed but that is one of the most urgent and important issues regarding the care of children that has to be dealt with by Departments today. I support the commendation of this order to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of a study on the Famine and related issues which I carried out in my school in Drogheda some years ago, I ended up reading about the children in care in the foundling hospital in Dublin at that time. I found that they were dreadfully abused and maltreated in those days, and over the centuries the care of children has certainly improved.</P>
      <P>I welcome this initiative from the Minister. I welcome the consensus here that this inquiry must take place in the manner in which it is proposed. The work of many organisations down the years has not been in vain and the rights of children, who have been in care and are in care, are being vindicated. Regrettably this is happening much later than it should have because we were not aware of the abuses taking place, and that is the significant aspect of it. The concept of care and the number of social workers and health board employees who are working full-time in the care of children, particularly children who are in care, are about to be put in care, are in temporary care or are in foster care, is something to which we are paying a great deal more attention now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only problem I see as important now, which is why I rise to contribute on this issue, is that there are many young single mothers who have nowhere to go with their children, who end up in bed and breakfast accommodation or inappropriate poor housing. The reality is that the rent allowance to which they are entitled gives them access to the worst, rather than the best, accommodation in our society. This is an area we ought to look at. We ought to provide especially for young mothers, some of whom have been in <Col N="1139" /> the care of the State until they were 18. Having left the care of the health boards, these mothers with young children in my area are coming to me for help. There is a lack of interest in their position because there is no statutory requirement in place. There is a lack of communication with those families and a lack of ongoing empathy and concern which they need.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister in what he is proposing here. It is one part of a long process. I hope we are coming to the end of the sad, sorry, disgraceful saga of the way people in care have been treated in our society in the past. We all share the blame. We must all work together to make sure it never happens again and that whatever can be done will be done to address the wrongs done to all those people.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Senators for their contributions and for their support for this order. Senator Jackman was concerned about the delay, but in these issues it is sometimes difficult to get things off the ground. I hope, now that it is in the arena, it will not take too long before this commission sits and brings forward its findings.</P>
      <P>No doubt this is a difficult subject. As Senator Fitzpatrick said, one cannot apply the criteria of today to what happened 30 years ago. Senator Henry also made the point that she was a little perturbed about it coming under the area of child abuse because we are talking about vaccination and it was done according to best practice at that time. There is much good which has come out of many vaccine trials. It is best for us to wait and see when all the facts in this area are elucidated. I hope the commission will bring forward clear findings.</P>
      <P>Over the years we have learned a great deal about vaccines. Senator Henry alluded to the hope, which I share, that we do not put off mothers from vaccinating their children because there is much unwarranted fear regarding vaccines. Certainly in regard to autism, that has not been cleared up as yet and at present there are many theories. Nevertheless, we are learning all the time, especially in regard to genetics, which have changed the issue and provided much of our knowledge on the issue. I hope this commission will get to the bottom of the issue and produce a report which will be fair to everybody.</P>

      <P>That is the second amendment and there is a consequential amendment to the Title, amendment No. 17. To be consistent, we propose that the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; should be inserted after &ldquo;Energy&rdquo;, in section 1. I would be interested to find out from the Minister why, contrary to normal practice, no Irish language version was inserted in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I understand amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 17 are grouped. Amendment No. 1 proposes that the Act be cited as the Sustainable Energy Ireland Act, 2001. I am of the view that the Short Title of the Act, as it stands in section 1, is generally reflective of the rather lengthy title of the authority in the Long Title. I would seek to prevail on Senators to leave the Short Title as it stands, on the basis that we are devolving functions to the authority relating to sustainable energy. The Title reflects that.</P>
      <P>I will be pleased to accept amendments Nos. 2 and 17, to include the Irish language name of the authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&ndash;The Freedom of Information Act, 1997 shall apply to the Authority.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not be offended by this. If the slightly pretentious title of the Bill were to reflect its contents this would be an even more important amendment. Nevertheless, given that this is a semi-State body set up to carry out the functions listed in section 6, I am astonished there is no mention of the Freedom of Information Act anywhere in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 18 referring to disclosure of information is a standard section which has appeared in many items of legislation setting up semi-State or arm's length State bodies. In the case of each body such as FÁS, the Health and Safety Authority, etc., a reference in, I think, the First Schedule of the Freedom of Information Act makes it clear that the injunction to confidentiality contained in a section, such as section 18, does not override obligations under the Freedom of Information Act. If we do not make reference to the Freedom of Information Act on Committee or Report Stages it will be impossible for the Department of Finance to make the normal statutory instrument order to bring this body under the aegis of the Freedom of Information Act because the injunction to confidentiality in section 18 will override that statutory instrument.</P>
      <P>We simply want to raise the issue. I cannot believe the parliamentary draftsperson accidentally omitted reference to the Freedom of Information Act, therefore, one has to conclude there was a deliberate decision to exclude this authority from the aegis of the Freedom of Information Act. I would like to hear the view of the Minister of State on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue of access to the authority's records under the freedom of information regulations. The Irish Energy Centre has been subject to the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, since 21 January 2001. This is because Enterprise Ireland, of which the centre is a division, came under the Act on that date. I fully agree that the new authority should be made subject to the Freedom of Information Act and I would be anxious that the authority would be so subject as soon as possible. However, I believe the appropriate way of doing this is through updating the First Schedule of the Freedom of Information Act by the relevant Minister making an order under that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is more appropriate to embrace any new bodies being set up within the ambit of freedom <Col N="1142" /> of information in this way as provided for by the Oireachtas. In my view making different bodies subject to FOI under different Acts is not appropriate. I will ensure that the new authority is included in the Schedule to the Freedom of Information Act as soon as possible after the establishment of the new authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to hear what the Minister has said. However, I would point out that previous legislation &ndash; I am subject to correction &ndash; the Aviation Authority Bill and a number of other Bills, contained a reference to the Freedom of Information Act and, in particular, a reference to the fact that the body being set up would be a body covered by Schedule 1 of the Freedom of Information Act. It appears to be a departure from precedent to exclude the Freedom of Information Act. I am a little wary of the relegation of this fundamental institutional change to the realm of secondary legislation. It would be difficult for whoever was in Government because it is a difficult and new institutional relationship. People know much more about the Government's plans, civil servants' plans and the thinking. This is healthy development and one that most people outside the establishment regard as a good development.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State explain, given that previous legislation introduced an amendment to the Schedule to make it clear, the reason there is no such amendment here? It appears there will be a hiatus when this body moves from being a sub-division of Enterprise Ireland, where it is covered by the Freedom of Information Act, and becomes An tÚdarás where it will not be covered by the Freedom of Information Act until the Department of Finance gets around to making the relevant order whenever, if ever. I do not understand why, in a political culture which is supposed to be moving more in the direction of freedom of information, the consequence of this Bill will be, at least in the short term, accepting the Minister's bona fides to take the authority out of the ambit of freedom of information. Perhaps the Minister of State can explain why that is a good thing because I do not see it as such.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;<i>(a)</i>to provide a working definition of sustainable energy and to update the definition on a regular basis having regard to developments in available technology.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a deliberately aspirational amendment. I do not need to declare an interest in the legal sense but in the unfortunate period when I was not a Member between 1992 and 1997 I devoted my limited talents to research in the area of cleaner technology and learned a good deal in the period about many things, one of which is that it is necessary because of the environmental impact of energy usage. One could argue about the timescale but with the looming crisis of both greenhouse gases and the depletion of hydrocarbon fuels the concept of sustainable energy will become much more central to the future of the industrialised and the under-developed world and will need redefining and reinvention on a continuing basis because the position will change.</P>
      <P>One of the things society needs is to be forward looking. We have been very bad at it. The buffers we are hitting in terms of the infrastructural crisis, housing crisis, health crisis are all because we as a society have been reluctant to allow ourselves to be pushed to think further. The authority, which in my experience is extremely well regarded as a forward-looking and progressive body, should be invited to challenge us on a continuing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our amendment to provide a working definition of sustainable energy and to update the definition on a regular basis having regard to developments would allow us to recognise change and not become complacent. I would be quite happy to talk through the detail of the wording. However, the principle that sustainable energy was the same twenty years ago as it is now and as it will be in twenty years' time is not tenable. We need to decide how to redefine it and whether it should be done within Government or by those who advise Government. Ultimately, these are matters for the Oireachtas and Government but the process of coming to such a decision would be advanced if the authority were to be encour<Col N="1144" /> aged to keep on looking at, challenging and redefining what is meant by sustainable energy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The words &ldquo;sustainable energy&rdquo; appear to be tripping off the tongues of people across the world as I found out in recent conferences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>George Bush says that he is in favour of it too and that is where we have a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>He has his definition. I once heard a very eminent person define sustainable energy as that with which our grandchildren would be pleased. I think this is quite appropriate.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Ryan for his amendment. In the Green Paper on Sustainable Energy, which I published in September 1999, I endeavoured to set down how Ireland would progress towards meeting its energy requirements in an environmentally and economically sustainable way, having regard to economic growth and security of supply objectives. In the Green Paper sustainability is defined as &ldquo;ensuring that the needs of present generations can be met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As I set out in the Green Paper, a sustainable energy policy should firstly ensure security of energy supply in order to supply economic and social development while protecting the environment. It should maximise efficiency of generation and emphasise the use of renewable resources. It should promote energy conservation by users. It should minimise emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants both by clean generation and sustainable consumption levels in all sectors. It should maintain local air quality and limit and reduce the Irish contribution to regional and global environmental problems.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the functions of the authority, as set out in section 6(1), encapsulate all these requirements. I do not agree that the sustainability concept needs constant redefining. It depends on constantly using best available technology and best practice to achieve a sustainable goal. It should not be the function of the authority to define sustainability but to ensure that we are utilising best practice in all our energy supply and use.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following paragraphs:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e)to propose legislative and fiscal measures to achieve the objectives stipulated in the foregoing subparagraphs of this subsection;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> (f)to prepare and publish annual reports on the relative performance of the State and each of the other member States of the European Union relating to sustainable energy objectives;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I never claim great precision in drafting skills. There are two important issues here. Firstly, we will all have to change our habits. It will either be done proactively or we will have to react to the mess we get ourselves into. Despite what the United States may believe, we cannot continue to waste energy in the way we have been doing, either in terms of energy resources or in terms of the planet's capacity to assimilate waste energy. Energy is never destroyed; it is simply degraded and it all floats around accumulating in a far from useful fashion. The side effects of energy production are enormous.</P>
    <P>In this amendment, we suggest that the authority should look at legislative and fiscal measures to achieve the objectives stipulated. Legislation and taxation are exclusively functions of the Oireachtas and that is as it should be. However, our parliamentary system is clogged up and the enormous skills of our public service are also overstretched. Given that the body has the job of looking at sustainable energy generally, it seems pointless not to give it the task of looking for ways to move us on in the desired route by way of regulation or taxation. This is what the addition of paragraph (e) would mean.</P>
    <P>The second one is even more important. To a degree, the Environmental Protection Agency looks at our comparative performance in the area of the environment. We cannot rely on Government, regardless of who is in Government, to produce objective reports of comparative performance. We need an independent agency which will outline how Ireland is doing by comparison to the objectives we set ourselves and also by comparison to our colleagues in the European Union. They will assist us by telling us how everybody else in the European Union is doing.</P>
    <P>I sit on the intermittently functioning sub-committee of the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government, which looks at sustainable development. I discovered there that the Department of Finance's mission statement did not have any reference to sustainable development even though it is the driving force for most public policy. I also discovered there that the Department of Enterprise and Employment did not know that our sulphur dioxide emissions <i>per capita</i> were way above the European average as are our NOX emissions. We have the good fortune to have a strong wind from the south west which means that we do not have to live with the consequences of our less than perfect performance.</P>
    <P>We need to question and challenge ourselves. This amendment calls on the authority to look at our performance, compare it to what we said we would do and compare us with other countries in the European Union, particularly the civilised countries of northern Europe who seem to have <Col N="1146" /> devised a formula by which it is possible to mix outstanding economic achievement with high quality environmental performance. We are in danger of sacrificing the latter for the former. An independent authority reminding us of what we promised to do and what we had or had not done would help greatly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the authority should have the power to propose or initiate measures of a legislative or fiscal nature as proposed by Senator Ryan. I am satisfied that the authority could at any time advise the Minister on legislative or fiscal measures, under section 6(1)(f), which states that the authority will have a function to provide advice, information and guidance to the Minister relating to the functions of the authority.</P>
      <P>With regard to benchmarking of the authority's performance against other member states of the European Union, I do not see that as a function of the authority. It is rather a reporting matter, which is well catered for in sections 22 and 23 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Minister of State is not given to being deliberately unhelpful. I was not suggesting that this body could initiate legislation as I know that would be unconstitutional. However, there is a long and intense debate in the developed world about the instruments to be used to achieve environmental objectives. The &ldquo;idealogues&rdquo; who run the White House are passionately committed to what they would call market mechanisms which, incidentally, have never worked but which they still believe in because it suits the interest groups who put the US President in power. Most of civilised Europe accepts that a combination of good, imaginative regulation and fiscal measures is the most efficient way of achieving the objectives. There is no single answer. To leave the drafting of legislation to Departments alone would be to lose certain skills. Of course, the Minister can call in the skills from the authority.</P>
      <P>However, we need public awareness and debate on this issue. We need a shift in public habits. For instance, to deal with the tyranny of the car, as it is sometimes called, we need to look at public transport. One of the issues in terms of sustainable energy is the degree of subsidy which it is worthwhile giving to public transport to encourage people to move away from using the car. It is very difficult to have that issue debated and properly evaluated within the structure of Government and Departments. It is a matter for Government to decide what to do, but independent bodies, properly resourced, are needed to provide advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency plays an important role in telling us that our water quality is getting worse and that we need to pay attention to the air quality in our cities. Similarly, the role of the authority which we are now discussing should be to provide information and <Col N="1147" /> advice, which the Government does not necessarily have to accept. We will have access to much of that information through the Freedom of Information Act. All that is involved is to formalise something which the Minister of State thinks it can already do and I do not see why it should not be formalised.</P>
    <P>A second requirement is to look at performance. Who does that at present? The Environmental Protection Agency does a little of it in relation to water and air quality. There is very little work being done on our comparative performance within Europe, other than what the European environmental agency does. We should not wait until some big brother in Europe tells us that we need to improve. If we really aspire to be an economically advanced and environmentally healthy country, we need to measure our own performance rather than wait for others to tell us. That is what amendment No. 5 would have us do. It would simply require the authority to assemble information across the European Union and advise accordingly.</P>
    <P>I have seen this system work extraordinarily well in a branch of a European multinational company, which simply provided comparative figures on water usage for each of its plants across the EU. No stick was being waved over the heads of management, but it was found that the water usage of the Irish plant was way out of line with the rest of Europe. That was because water is cheap, if not free, in Ireland &ndash; cheap to industry and free to the rest of us. As a result of that comparison, there was embarrassment at the Irish plant about the excessive usage of water. Even though it was not a huge economic issue, water usage was reduced dramatically because of this being highlighted in the benchmarking exercise.</P>
    <P>That kind of comparison is necessary. We have been making excuses for ourselves over the past five or six years, and I am not being party political in this regard. Some of the excuses are valid. Things happened which nobody ever anticipated. The economy is 90% larger than it was seven years ago. Because of that, we must set ourselves new standards, but we cannot do that from within the mechanism of government. It should be done through an agency which has the job of telling us how we are performing relative to our targets and to other people's targets. That is what paragraph (f) would do if it was accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Senator has acknowledged, I certainly do not intend to be unhelpful. I hope I can portray that during the debate, if not on this amendment. I have no dispute with the Senator's statement that fiscal and regulatory measures are efficient in reducing emissions. We must have such measures and they can be put in place by the Minister on the advice of the new authority. That advice should be sought and, indeed, it has been my practice to avail of that process. The Irish Energy Centre, as it stands, has a wealth of expertise and experience on which we are very <Col N="1148" /> happy to draw. That situation will be enhanced by putting it on a statutory basis and beefing it up generally, both in terms of quality and quantity.</P>
      <P>On the Senator's question as to who evaluates performance, he really answered it himself. The EU prepares annual reports on emissions and the performance of each member state is covered in that report. That process is independent of Governments and of any authority such as we are now discussing. I reiterate my view that the advice, information and guidance which the authority will provide to the Minister of the day is what is called for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Only last week, there was a newspaper report on the quality of bathing water in European countries. Ireland was not at the top of the list, although we did not do too badly. Countries which one might expect to have greater problems with their bathing water, such as the Netherlands, were ahead of us. I do not believe that countries like the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark or Finland wait for the European environment agency report to evaluate their environmental performance. The Danes have been complaining for years, and more recently the Swedes, that the European Union is holding them back from doing things which they would like to do.</P>
      <P>It is not a particularly noble target to say that we want to do as well as Europe requires. That is not where we should be. If we aspire to be a modern, rich, small European country, we should lead the European Union, not follow its standards. To lead, we must think, measure and evaluate independently, according to more demanding standards than the European Union's. There is no evidence that it affects competitiveness or the ability to attract internationally mobile capital. Sweden has a better record than us in attracting direct foreign investment.</P>
      <P>It is a reluctance to set ourselves sufficiently high standards. We would never have set ourselves a target of 9% <i>per annum</i> growth in GDP. Everyone would have said it was impossible. We would not have set 7%. The consensus among the economic elite in the 1970s and 1980s was that 4% to 4.5% was the best we could sustain without a major inflation crisis. It was wrong. We need independent thinking looking at what is the best we can aspire to. Measuring ourselves against a <i>post hoc</i> European standard, which is probably a year out of date when it reaches here, is inadequate. That is why I am disappointed at the Minister of State's not accepting the amendment. It is not the wording, but the principle, that we should publish independent reports on our performance to encourage us to establish higher standards, which is important.</P>

      <P>My only comment is that we are leading the way in Europe. My discussions at meetings and on the sidelines reveal that we are the envy of Europe. On the issue of sustainable energy, which is now Government policy, our Green Paper, sets a higher target for renewables <Col N="1149" /> than any set in the EU. We are proud of that. Measures will ensure we achieve that target. We trebled our target for electricity production <i>via</i> renewable sources, primarily wind energy. Before the end of the week, I will make an important announcement about the plans to achieve this. We lead the way and by 2005 will produce 12% of our energy requirement <i>via</i> renewable sources. From a low basis, that is leading the way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two questions on the section as amended. On paragraph (f), &ldquo;to provide advice information and guidance to the Minister and each other Minister or bodies as the Minister may direct.&rdquo; Why not include &ldquo;provide and publish,&rdquo; subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act? It would be a pity if the advice was not made public because an important role of the authority must be to persuade public opinion and consumers that we have no choice but must move to sustainable energy. Does the wording &ldquo;to provide advice information and guidance to the Minister and each other Minister and bodies as the Minister may direct&rdquo; mean that another Minister cannot seek advice from the authority without the Minister's approval? If so, why? There are areas, such as enterprise and employment, the environment and so forth, where there should be no bureaucratic channel to do something simple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Other Departments will have access to this or any other agency. During my watch, I never saw any bureaucratic or other obstacle to that facility. It is normally advocated. Other appropriate Departments discuss with us and draw up plans involving the Irish Energy Centre, the new body. The Department of Social, Com<Col N="1150" /> munity and Family Affairs is involved with fuel poverty and there is close interaction there. On work programmes or an enterprise, for example, at the behest of another Department, it is reasonable that the authority of the Minister be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have another question. Sustainable energy is important for us and critical for the developing world. The Minister can say that there is nothing to stop the authority from assisting developing countries, but it would be good if there were a specific reference under the authority's functions to providing assistance for developing countries, particularly the least developed. It would be an appropriate statement of our philosophy. I accept that there is nothing to stop this but the statements on the functions of a body like this say something about the way we see the world. A critical issue is the development of sustainable energy to the almost three billion people who live on less than $2 per day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very timely that the Senator should raise this because an integral part of Government policy is to do precisely what the Senator said. It is not just policy, it is being done in a very practical and pragmatic fashion. In recent weeks I was at the UN Commission for Sustainable Development conference. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government also attended. The Irish message was, and we strongly advocated it, that we wanted to see the development of sustainable energy in developing countries. We fear the nuclear voice which is becoming louder all the time and which advocates nuclear production of energy &ndash; in the context of global warming and Kyoto &ndash; on the basis that there are no emissions of CO2, although it conveniently forgets the other potentially huge deleterious effects of that mode of production such as the waste with which the technology has not caught up. We do not want to see other countries, particularly developing countries which need energy production, being caught by that and being lumbered with a mode of energy production which is not sustainable. It is hugely important to convey that message at every forum available to us. That is being done in a practical fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of additional functions, I am afraid the primary one of sustainability could get lost in a plethora of additional functions. Section 7(1) reads &ldquo;relating to the production, supply (including security of supply) and use of energy as the Minister considers appropriate&rdquo;. That is not even within the constraints of the Bill. That could be anything the Minister wants to do.</P>

      <Col N="1151" /> Section 7(2) reads: &ldquo;an order under this section may assign to the Authority any function which relates to the production, supply (including security of supply) and use of energy and which arises from, or is necessary for, the implementation of any provision of the treaties governing the European Communities&rdquo;. How will that mesh in with the electricity regulator without turf wars developing? We have a regulator to deal with many of these issues in the electricity area. How is the Minister going to ensure that section 7(2) does not cause some uncertainty about spheres of reference of the authority and the electricity regulator? I will be interested in what the Minister of State has to say.</P>

      <P>The Minister may, following consultation with the Authority. . . . . any other Minister of the Government who, in the opinion of the Minister, is concerned, by order assign to the Authority such additional functions relating to the production, supply (including security of supply) and use of energy as the Minister considers appropriate.</P>
      <P>The Minister may consider anything appropriate, but it might not be anything to do with the function of this body which has to do with sustainability. Therefore, the Minister could, by order, dilute its primary focus which is sustainable energy.</P>
      <P>Section 7(2) reads:</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to the generality of <i>subsection (1)</i>, an order under this section may assign to the Authority any function which relates to the production, supply (including security of supply) and use of energy and which arises from, or is necessary for, the implementation of any provision of the treaties governing the European Communities. . . . . .</P>
      <P>If one is not extremely careful, one will end up with this authority being given functions that perhaps might be more appropriately given to the electricity regulator. Has the Government thought about this? I assume it has. If it has, how will it distinguish between the functions of the regulator and those of the authority since there is no specific reference to sustainability in section 7?</P>

I cannot see any Minister delegating to this new authority a function that would be more appropriately delegated to the electricity regulator given the regulator's present function or the new functions he will shortly assume. I would have thought the words &ldquo;as the Minister considers appropriate&rdquo; to mean at the discretion of the Minister and that would call for the intelligence, knowledge and skills of the Minister <i>in situ</i> to assign to this authority the functions he deems appropriate to it which would be vastly different to those that would be appropriate to the regulator.

      <P>I propose a Government amendment to amend section 9(17) by inserting a provision which reflects Government policy in relation to the appointment of men and women to the boards of semi-State companies. I propose that, in making appointments to the board of the new authority, the Minister shall have regard to the objective of there not being fewer than four members who are women and not fewer than four members who are men. The new board will consist of 12 members one of whom will be the chief executive. This leaves 11 members to be appointed by the Minister which means that four members roughly correspond to 40% of the board. This is a formulation which met with Oireachtas approval in the Comhairle Act, 2000. I sincerely hope it will meet with Senators' requirements.</P>

      <P>This Government has an appalling record on gender balance perhaps epitomised by the board set up to deal with the pensions funds on which there is only one woman, notwithstand<Col N="1153" /> ing the fact that the majority of people on whom most of the pension funds will be spent will be women. The Minister for Finance decided there was only one woman worthy of being on that board. The record shows a lack of enthusiasm for gender balancing which is quite distressing and retrograde. People can make all the jokes they wish about excesses of political correctness &ndash; it is easy for second-rate comedians to find things about political correctness to poke fun at &ndash; but if one does not state what one wishes to do, it most assuredly will never happen.</P>
      <P>I am unhappy with the words &ldquo;have regard to the objective of there being an equitable balance&rdquo;. I do not understand why we cannot state that at least 40% of the members of the board shall be women. Is the Minister of State saying that the Government is not certain there are four women good enough to serve on this board? If the Government will not accept the words &ldquo;comply with the requirement that at least 40% of the members of the Board shall be men and at least 40% of the members shall be women&rdquo; I will be happy to accept &ldquo;a requirement that at least four members of the Board&rdquo;. We should use the words &ldquo;the requirement&rdquo;, not &ldquo;have regard to the objective&rdquo;. One can have regard to all the objectives one wants but one can still say that women were not good enough, that one found that the best people for the job were men. The best people, one will find, are men because all those in the places one would currently look are men given that we do not promote women. I do not understand why we cannot state &ldquo;a requirement that at least 40%&rdquo;. It is a statement about the masculine nature of science and engineering. Between 25% and 40% of students now taking engineering courses are female.</P>
      <P>If we wish to sustain that movement, we must make women, who are capable of doing the job, visible in areas like this. Using the words &ldquo;have regard to the objectives&rdquo; is a dilution though it is a step forward. I am disappointed we did not get a little further on this issue.</P>

      <P>He has very grudgingly, and belatedly, given credit to the Minister for stipulating that at least four members of the board shall be women. That is not dictatorial, as Senator Ryan rightly said, it is a significant step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall many instances since I became involved in politics of pressure being brought to bear on various Governments and Ministers to achieve gender balance. I recall an instance, before Senator Ryan and I became Members of this House, when a gender balance stipulation was not met because Senator Ryan's party had a difficulty, for practical reasons, in going along with <Col N="1154" /> it. There are many instances in which practical problems can arise.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan poses the question that surely there are four women of the calibre required to become members of the board being established by the Minister. There may well be 44 or 144 such women but they might not be willing to serve. Many questions arising from Senator Ryan's contribution have not been teased out. I commend the Minister for what he is doing. It is very laudable that he should stipulate that at least 40% of the members of the board shall be women.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all aspire to moving forward on the issue of gender balance, none of us would be satisfied with how far we have already gone. When making appointments to boards, I endeavour to find the person most suitably accomplished and capable of serving. Some of the boards deal with safety matters such as nuclear safety and aviation safety, and it is crucial that one appoints the right people. I consider myself very fortunate if, having used the criteria I mentioned, I arrive at that objective. The formula I am proposing met with the approval of both Houses when dealing with the Comhairle Act.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister of State's attention to subsection (13) which makes provision for some things which make perfect sense and others which are a lot less easy to accept. It states: &ldquo;A member of the Board may at any time be removed from membership of the Board by the Minister if [this is where we get into difficulty] in the Minister's opinion the member has become incapable through ill-health of performing his or her functions&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; is carefully chosen in legislation because it is very difficult to prove an opinion wrong. If the phrase &ldquo;the Minister is satisfied&rdquo; was used, one would have some type of objective test. The phrase &ldquo;in the Minister's opinion&rdquo; is precisely that. We are all entitled to our opinions. It is not something one has to prove, it is an opinion, it is what one thinks about something. It would be much better to use the phrase &ldquo;if the Minister is satisfied the member has become incapable through ill health of performing his or her functions.&rdquo; That would require some type of objective test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (13) also states &ldquo;or has committed stated misbehaviour&rdquo;. This is saying that in the opinion of the Minister, a member of the board has committed stated misbehaviour, not that the member has committed stated misbehaviour. In the way this is written, the member may be removed if, in the Minister's opinion, the person has committed stated misbehaviour. The Minister does not have to prove his case. That is wrong <Col N="1155" /> and is contrary to natural justice. If we try to implement that we will end up in the courts and we will lose. There is no suggestion of due process. Opinions do not have to be formulated by due process, one can pick them off the top of one's head.</P>
    <P>The subsection further states: &ldquo;his or her removal appears to the Minister to be necessary for the effective performance by the Authority of its functions.&rdquo; Each member of the board can be sacked by the Minister if, in the opinion of the Minister it is necessary to do so in order that the authority can do its job. This is entirely a ministerial decision with no requirement that the matter be referred back to the Oireachtas. Because it is an opinion, there is no need to give the person a right to due process.</P>
    <P>I am not particularly concerned about the 12 members of this authority; they may be quite happy to be sacked from the board and to return to doing something more satisfying. I am concerned about the use of language in this section and its implication that Ministers can sack members of boards such as this one on the basis that they form an opinion about them. There should be some objective test by way of a positive order of the Oireachtas or at least a negative order of the Oireachtas before members can be sacked from boards such this one.</P>
    <P>It is easy to envisage conflict between a board such as this one and Government as this is an area that involves difficult choices for whoever will be in Government on taxation and regulation in which a large number of conflicting interests are involved. It is, therefore, a pity that the Minister cannot see fit to include provision for some objective test by which members could be adjudged not to be fit to be on the board any longer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems Senator Ryan unearthed at least part of a problem that the Minister of State might be kind enough to look at and come back to us on it on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>There are a number of different elements, the first of which Senator Ryan is right about &ndash; the question of whether, in the Minister's opinion, a member has become incapable through ill health of performing his or her functions. I am not sure if the Minister is qualified to hold an opinion in this area. When one talks of opinion in a matter like this, one would normally think of the expert opinion of a medical doctor who is the only person professionally qualified to hold such an opinion. He or she might well advise the Minister that a person was unfit through ill-health to perform his functions, but an opinion held by a Minister who is not a medical practitioner and has not examined the person as a patient, would not be sustainable in law. For that reason I believe the first element of this paragraph is deeply flawed. I ask the Minister to come back to the House with a view on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to a member having committed <Col N="1156" /> stated misbehaviour, I am not quite so worried about that element. The words &ldquo;. his or her removal appears to the Minister to be necessary for the effective performance by the Authority of its functions&rdquo; do not cause me any great agony, but perhaps the paragraph would be better if it included the words &ldquo;if the Minister is satisfied&rdquo;. It is a case that the Minister would be satisfied because it appeared to him or her that the removal of the member would be a good thing. We have got to give the Minister the right to remove somebody in those circumstances, otherwise we would be back here bellyaching that the Minister is impotent, that a member of the board misbehaved in the most fantastic ways, yet the Minister had no right to remove him.</P>
    <P>There is a kind of descending order to this. Senator Ryan put his finger on something that is important in terms of medical opinion. The phrase &ldquo;that the Minister is satisfied&rdquo; is preferable and it would be helpful if that could be rejigged to cover the three elements of this paragraph. I am not as concerned about the other two elements.</P>
    <P>One has to be terribly careful about using phrases like &ldquo;medical opinion&rdquo;. Apart from anything else, if the Minister is wrong and that became known it could be damaging to the person's future employment prospects. The Minister might say, &ldquo;I have got to get rid of this fellow because he is not capable of doing the job, his health is rotten.&rdquo; In those circumstances, who else would employ that person? </P>
    <P>As politicians, we are a little sensitive about this matter. I have had some ups and downs in my health. I know that at one stage it was being rumoured around the constituency by malign elements that my health was so impoverished that it was being said, &ldquo;Poor David, he won't be standing again&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">

      <P>It was extremely kind of those persons whom, in the sanctity of this House, I will not name, to be so concerned about my health, but I thought it was done with a malicious intention to damage me. In the matter of medical opinion, we must be careful. Having looked at the matter, perhaps the Minister will come back to us on Report Stage, unless my colleague intends to put the issue to a vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I must agree with certain parts of Senator Ryan's assessment of this section. In the past members of boards have been removed on the basis of political motivation. Many board appointments are political appointments. There could be reason to suspect that a member may be removed on a political issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from Senator Ryan's philosophical definition of an opinion, there are many opinions on many matters and political opinions are very <Col N="1157" /> important in the political system and they have a habit of imposing themselves on semi-State boards and authorities. There should be some safeguard in place for members of boards without eliminating the Minister's right to remove a board member on a particular basis. Senator Ryan is partly correct in suggesting some safeguard should be put in place in this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was taken initially with Senator Ryan's discovery of this opinion factor, but as he went on to develop it I was not entirely convinced about it. He oscillated between substituting the phrase &ldquo;if the Minister is satisfied&rdquo; for the phase &ldquo;if in the Minister's opinion&rdquo;. There may be a major legal difference between the meaning of two, but on a simple literal basis I do not understand what it is. If the Minister has formed an opinion, it would be assumed by definition in the Constitution and by law that such an opinion is based on the best information available to him and, therefore, that opinion must be to his satisfaction. Senator Ryan then went on to refer to a positive order and a negative order.</P>
      <P>On the question of political patronage, it goes without saying that political patronage has been part of the culture of Governments from the foundation of the State in terms of boards and semi-State boards. I remind my colleagues opposite that history is littered with examples of people who have been fired from boards, including recent incidents. One of the men to the fore in that regard has hit the headlines of the front pages of today's newspapers. He decided to go through the semi-States like a dose of salts and shafted people left, right and centre politically speaking. There are many examples and we could all lash out in this regard, but we must ask ourselves what is practical and pragmatic for Government.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris adverted to a very important matter. He said it was important that the Minister would be cognisant of what incompetence through ill health meant. I am sure there are devices and mechanisms within every Department for every Minister to avail of and call upon to make such a decision. I am sure no Minister would be so callous as to say willy nilly that a person is of such ill health as to be incompetent to continue to serve on a board.</P>
      <P>If one is talking about a positive order or a negative order, one is talking in terms of such a provision applying to Ministers in every Department in relation to all State boards. One could not apply such a provision only to boards, agencies or authorities such as this one. If one is to comply with natural justice, as Senator Ryan talked about it, one would have to invoke such a provision for every board. The logistics of doing that would be baffling and mindboggling and I do not know what mechanism one could use to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate to which Senator Ryan adverted is a major one. He skirted around the edges of it. That debate has been taking place for some time <Col N="1158" /> and it will continue, but that is not to take from the merits of having in place an objective, independent adjudication mechanism of the continued suitability or otherwise of board members. Senator Ryan oscillated between substituting the words &ldquo;if satisfied&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; or the words &ldquo;positive order or negative order as is appropriate&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo;. This wording of the paragraph is the way such a provision has traditionally being included and it is what is preferable in the absence of a more appropriate mechanism that is practical and pragmatic. One cannot tie the Minister's hands behind his back and say he has set up a board and such membership will be held by the members for their life, irrespective of how the board performs. We are all human beings and even if we are appointed to boards, it does not automatically transcend us into the clouds of wisdom and knowledge.</P>
    <P>Any Minister must realise that if he or she appoints a board, it must work effectively and the Minister must have the authority to review it on an ongoing basis. To suggest otherwise would require a Minister to return to both Houses, by way of a positive or negative order, and on each and every occasion he or she is satisfied that a member of a board is not functioning. We have seen recent positive examples of boards having to be replaced by other boards in the interests of progress and the liberalisation of markets. We should be careful because the issue is substantial. We could not deal with it in a very short debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision in question is standard in many Acts setting up semi-State bodies to which appointments are made. However, it is legitimate that Senators question the issue. The Minister must form an opinion or, as Senator Norris said, be satisfied when appointing someone in the first place. He would have to refer to curricula vitae and seek referees to ensure the appointee is competent. Likewise, when it comes to unfortunate cases where dismissals are required &ndash; I am thankful none has occurred in my term thus far &ndash; the Minister would have to be satisfied that the candidate does not measure up to the job or is disrupting the work of the board, notwithstanding the original decision to appoint the person. There are diverse reasons that might contribute to the Minister's forming an opinion on why a dismissal might have to be made. When dismissing someone, one would have to take advice and consult appropriate people.</P>
      <P>There is an ongoing practice in which I engage myself of speaking regularly with the chairmen of boards to discuss personnel and the workings of the boards etc. Most Ministers do this. I find it very useful to keep updated and to maintain a rapport with the chairmen. Given that the Senators have raised the issue of appointment to boards, we must reflect on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister of State said he would reflect on the issue. Perhaps it would be <Col N="1159" /> helpful if the statutory provision in question were regularly included in Bills. This should be looked at more carefully.</P>
      <P>What worries me is the question of medical opinion. It looks as if the Minister of State is purporting to be able to give a medical opinion &ndash; he obviously is not. There is a conflict there. I see one of his advisers disagreeing, so the Minister of State may counter the point I have just made.</P>
      <P>With regard to the removal, and having read this morning's paper, there is a relevant analogy to which I will refer. I will do so without taking sides because many of the people on the board are known to me. On the outgoing board, I know Frank O'Reilly, a former chancellor of Trinity College Dublin and a very distinguished man. I know people on the incoming board such as Doireann Ní Bhriain.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in terms of the College des Irlandais, Paris, wishes to infuse new blood into the board and is having some difficulty. There may be some resistance from those who say they have worked very hard on it for 15 years and should not be dismissed. The ambassador has sent a communication, which has found its way into the media, in which he says that it is not clear that all the five remaining nominees on the Irish side have contributed much or have much to contribute to the administrative council. That seems to be the advice to the Minister, which he has to take into account in forming his opinion. The board members played their role in stage one of the operation, but now the Minister wants to introduce vigorous young people and an element of gender balance. That was mentioned in this debate. Three of the 14 members of the new management board are women. That is not the proportion that we were looking for, but at least it is an improvement. There were no women on the board that is being replaced so we are moving in the right direction. It may be a matter for the Minister to consider and address again on Report Stage. It is not as unambiguous as some of us felt, such as Senator Ryan in his initial contribution.</P>

I will not insist on that.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about subsection (10), which states that &ldquo;a member of the Board other than the Chief Executive shall not serve for more than 10 consecutive years.&rdquo; A later provision states that the chief executive shall be appointed for a period of five years and may be reappointed. Is there a possibility that the ten years could be used to guarantee the reappointment of the chief executive?</P>

I have taken the opportunity to correct that in my areas of employment. It would be a matter for the board to monitor the performance of the chief executive and take appropriate action if necessary.</P>

      <P>It would be a good idea in terms of sustainable energy, because our scientific understanding of technologies is changing so rapidly, if the Minister would review the operations to see how satisfactory they are, make necessary amendments and report to the House after year one.</P>

      <P>What Senator Norris had in mind was the introduction of new blood. I believe that Ministers set out to appoint people to boards who have the appropriate expertise. Arrangements for a regular turnover of board members will provide for new blood coming in every year, after three years. Under section 9(15), the Minister may reappoint a board member who has retired from the board if they have been effective on the board. If one has a valuable asset in terms of human resources, whether it is a board member or a fitter or engineer, one would want to hold on to that person.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the performance of the board can only be judged against the effective or otherwise performance of its functions by the new authority. There is ample opportunity for performance reviews of the new authority in sections 22 and 23 and we may be discussing it later in another context. In the light of the existing provisions of the Bill, I would be disinclined to accept Senator Norris's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is correct in the final part of what he said, regarding the fact that what <Col N="1161" /> I am looking for is not just the possibility of critically reviewing the members of the board as much as the operation of the board. Now that I have looked at sections 22 and 23 it seems that my concerns are pretty well covered there &ndash; the annual report of the activities and so on. I am happy enough to withdraw the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Section 11 agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 12 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 13.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 13 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose section 13, root and branch. I will not rehearse all the arguments I made at the time, but I find it rather offensive that this is a disqualification section, without any reason being given, simply by virtue of one's profession. I find it unnecessarily discriminatory and rather insulting that the first body to be named in this series of discriminations is Seanad Éireann. Why on earth should we agree in this tame way to be disqualified from membership of this board? The same applies to all Members of the Oireachtas and to the European Parliament. If one looks at the people who promoted the ideas of this Bill &ndash; Deputy Gormley, Deputy Sargent and Patricia Mc Kenna, MEP, who all happen to be from the Green Party but they certainly have expertise in this area &ndash; I can see no good reason they should be removed from the possibility of participating in the board.</P>
      <P>We did battle for weeks on a similar question in terms of the composition of the board of Trinity College, Dublin. We were told that they were quite entitled to put people on it and we were pointed to the example of the National University where it is quite a routine occurrence for the Government to appoint people, as well as to appoint members of county councils. There was strong support for this all around the House when we questioned it. There is a contradiction in ethos and I do not blame this Minister because I know this is a standard element, but I think we ought to challenge it and make a breakthrough.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, politicians are not held in high regard, some of it they have brought on themselves, but the media circus has been a factor. It is a tiny proportion of politicians who have brought discredit on the profession and I very much regret this but I do think it is an honourable calling and that we represent to the best of our ability the interests of our electorate and of the wider public. Why should that be a disqualification? The only reason I can see is as a kind of guilt trip on behalf of all administrations because of their venal and mercenary nominations to boards, but I hope for higher things from this Minister and from his colleagues in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1162" /> Can I put on the record of this House the kind of company we are being lumped in with &ndash; those who are adjudicated bankrupt, those who make a composition or arrangement with creditors, in other words, refuse to pay the bill, those who are convicted or indicted by a court of competent jurisdiction and sentenced to a term of imprisonment, those who are disqualified or restricted from being a director in the meaning of the Companies Act, in other words, bankrupts, criminals, fraudsters, and Members of Seanad Éireann? How immensely flattering. Have my colleagues got the guts to stand with me today and say no, to put an end to this nonsense?</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister may accept the amendment. If not, I will have to put it to a vote because I would like to see people coming in to vote that they are not fit to be members of this board because they regard it as perfectly all right to be categorised as bankrupts and swindlers. I do not find it flattering and I will vote against it, but I hope that if the Minister is not in a giving mood and is not capable of acceding to my request on this occasion, it will not prejudice him or put him in a bad mood so that he will not accept any future amendments just to punish us on this side of the House. The Minister is smiling broadly and shaking his head. I feel very strongly that this is a slur on the decent and honourable profession of politics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>To a degree I can understand the point of these provisions, but like Senator Norris I am profoundly offended by the sloppiness of the legislative drafting procedure. This effectively states that there are four categories of people who cannot serve on boards, criminals, bankrupts, fraudsters and Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas. This is the first time I have seen members of local authorities included. I find it astonishing that an eminent academic in the area of energy conservation who happens to be a member of, let us say, the Passage West Town Commissioners, because he believes in making a contribution as an independent member to his local authority, would be exempt. This is a small town outside Cork where eminent academics from either my own place of work or UCC could be living. It could be a body as minor as that, or Youghal Urban District Council or Kinsale Urban District Council which are all places that people who are working in Cork could live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no idea what conflict of interest could possibly arise between that level of membership of a local authority and board membership. Did somebody just think up something new? I believe that to a degree it is driven by a hostility to the idea of those who are elected persons being involved in any of these bodies. Where is the difficulty with a body which is accountable to the Minister and also to the Committee of Public Accounts and to a committee of the Oireachtas under section 23? There might be a problem with a Member of the Oireachtas being a member of this board as well as a member of the committee <Col N="1163" /> which investigates the body. I think there is a degree of separation of function there. The solution is to change the rules of the Houses so that Members are required to resign from any of the following bodies because of the danger of a perceived conflict of interests. Therefore the matter should be dealt with not by law but by the rules of the Houses.</P>
    <P>It is gratuitously offensive to slip in a clause like this. It effectively puts us in the same boat as criminals and bankrupts. As long ago as the Regional Technical Colleges Bill, which contained the same requirement, I said that this standard clause is offensive. It has been slipped in because it is a handy way of getting something done.</P>
    <P>That is one part of it. I have certain qualms about the rest of the section and although I also have qualms about Senator Norris's objections to it, I will support him. The part about local authority membership, however, is a nonsense. The exclusion of members of an urban district council from membership of the board will dissuade good people from getting involved in even the lowest level of politics. It sends out the signal that one cannot get involved with the technical side of things. In this regard I have in mind a body with which I have a connection, the clean technology centre in my place of work. If a similar body was set up on a national scale, none of my colleagues who have chosen to get involved in local politics could be appointed to its board. I cannot understand how membership of a local authority, particularly an urban district council, could conflict with membership of a board. There may be an overlap at county council level but I cannot think of one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise in support of the comments of Senators Norris and Ryan. I have a query for the Minister regarding subsection (1) which begins:</P>
      <P>Where a member of the Board</P>
      <P>(a)is nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann,</P>
      <P>(b) is elected as a member of either House of the Oireachtas. . .</P>
      <P>I do not understand why nomination to Seanad Éireann debars, while one has to be elected to the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should be aware that it refers to Members of both Houses.<b></b>There are 11 Seanad Members who would be excluded if it did not refer to nominated Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand. That explanation is satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be popular to say that Members of the Oireachtas and members of local authorities should be eligible for inclusion in this board. I disagree, however, on that question. <Col N="1164" /> These appointments carry historical baggage. Members of local authorities were appointed to boards by successive Governments primarily on the basis of their party position.</P>
      <P>It is very easy for Independent members to advocate that councillors, members of local authorities and Members of the Oireachtas be included but we must consider the legacy we have inherited. The Government is right to take this stance. It relieves the major parties, when in power, of the need to deal with internal pressures to nominate people to these boards. It is right for any Government to remove the possibility of local authority members or Members of the Oireachtas exerting such pressure. There could definitely be a conflict of interest between membership of the Oireachtas and membership of a board such as the Sustainable Energy Authority.</P>
      <P>We may have been lumped alongside criminals, bankrupts and fraudsters, as Senators have pointed out, but it remains a convenient way of dealing with the matter. I remind Senators that the President of the United States is excluded from sitting on all boards&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Senator believe he should also be excluded from the Presidency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;so why should Members of the Oireachtas be eligible to sit on boards? The Government is right. Its members are aware of the pressures exerted in the past from within their own organisations with regard to these appointments. My party is also conscious of the pressures that emanated from a variety of sources in relation to appointments to boards. The day has come to appoint members of boards strictly on merit. The media and the public demand as much and, as Oireachtas Members, we should step aside. We make the law governing what these boards may and may not do and on that basis alone, we should not sit on them.</P>

It is time they grew up, behaved like <Col N="1165" /> adults and refused these approaches on the basis that these persons are not qualified.</P>
      <P>I look forward to a favourable response from the Minister and support from Senator Fitzgerald on the basis that if Fine Gael is supporting this, it cannot be as right as they thought.</P>

      <P>&mdash;and has been for as long as I can remember. That includes the provisions on local authorities. We are not breaking new ground. This format has been accepted by the Oireachtas for several years. The intention of the section is clear. It seeks to ensure that political neutrality is achieved on boards at all times. Examples of similar legislation where this section <Col N="1166" /> can be found are in the Acts to establish Enterprise Ireland, the National Disability Authority and the Radiological Protection Institute. There are others that do not come to mind.</P>
      <P>As an Oireachtas Member, I empathise with the views expressed by Senators. I wish to put on the record my total agreement with Senator Norris's statement that the political profession is a noble calling. The vast majority of colleagues in these Houses whom I have had the privilege to know over many years are most honourable people of the highest integrity. I am not in a position, however, to accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I arrived in this House 20 years ago, which was probably the worst for you and me, I have been intrigued by the self-serving nature of legislation. This is the section dealing with prohibition on disclosure of information. It is intriguing that even though we now have one of the best freedom of information Acts in the democratic world, the draftsmen still put exactly the same section about disclosure of information into legislation as they used to do when we did not have freedom of information legislation. I would have thought that the culture of our system had changed sufficiently for a phraseology to be used on disclosure of information which reflected modern thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same phrases were used 20 years ago in legislation dealt with in my first year in this <Col N="1167" /> House. It is a standard provision which states that nothing shall be disclosed, that the definition of confidential information means that everything the board says is confidential. That definition means that an amendment must be made to the First Schedule of the Freedom of Information Act, to bale out of that catch-all phrase. There is no point in introducing primary legislation containing a clause like that and then inserting, as secondary legislation, an amendment to other primary legislation to the effect that this does not really mean what it appears to mean.</P>
    <P>This section states that everything is confidential. The Freedom of Information Act maintains that nothing is confidential except a sensible list of exceptions. The Minister should talk to the draftsmen and ask them to draft legislation in terms of current institutional realities which are that the principle is that everything should be disclosed except where there is a reason to keep it secret.</P>
    <P>This section states that everything shall be secret unless people have permission to disclose it and that the penalty on summary conviction is a fine of 2,000. This is the first Bill I have ever dealt with where euro amounts were stated first, with pound amounts in brackets. It is a sign of things to come. There will be a fine of 2,000 for disclosing information, most of which one will be able to legally disclose under the Freedom of Information Act. If we are talking about wasting the time of the Houses of the Oireachtas and of civil servants, it would have been much more sensible to state that subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, which applies to this body, the following shall apply.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, confidential information, and we now have a definition of that. Confidential information is information which may not be disclosed under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act. There is case law in terms of the decisions of deciding officers and appeals officers and of the information commissioner. That section is out of date based on a principle which is now out of date and is in conflict with the spirit of the Freedom of Information Act. The Minister of State should agree to look at it and review it before Report Stage because it is meaningless legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>In preparing legislation people always work in conjunction with the Attorney General's office. This provision seeks to ensure that information submitted by companies or bodies in tendering for contracts is not revealed. That area of tendering is sacrosanct. Obviously, this body will be involved in a good deal of activity involving the tendering process. We would all concur to a lesser or greater extent with Senator Ryan in the generalisation he has made about the drafting of some of our legislation and that which is no longer relevant or is antiquated. I would like to think that the professionals who were involved in putting this together have it tight and effective <Col N="1168" /> at the end of the day. No doubt the sentiments expressed by Senator Ryan will go into the record and will be taken up in the preparation of future legislation which may meet with his aspirations in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so much me but the Attorney General. Section 18(4) states:</P>
      <P>In this section &ldquo;confidential information&rdquo; includes information that is expressed by the Board or a committee of the Board, as the case may be, to be confidential. . . . . .</P>
      <P>It is not confidential. The boards of public bodies no longer have that authority if they are covered by the Freedom of Information Act. They do not have that authority &ldquo;as regards particular information or as regards information of a particular class or description&rdquo;. They do not have that authority if they are covered by the Freedom of Information Act. Their obligation under that Act is to ensure that information that is confidential under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, of which there are seven, is confidential. Irrespective of what arguments have arisen about the Freedom of Information Act I have not seen a single complaint that information was disclosed that should have been kept confidential. No harm has been done. There have been interesting little spats between Ministers and civil servants. A huge amount of information has been put into the public domain. The public understands much better what is happening, nobody has suffered and it has been a successful operation. What is the reason for putting into legislation forms of definition that are effectively contradictory of other legislation? Between now and Report Stage will the Minister of State ask the Attorney General why subsection (4) is included in light of the clear commitment that this authority should continue to be covered by the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act? That subsection is entirely meaningless.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;22.&ndash;The Authority may, for the purpose <Col N="1169" /> of providing for current or capital expenditure, from time to time, borrow money (whether on the security of the assets of the Authority or otherwise), including money in a currency other than the currency of the State, subject to the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance and to such conditions as they may specify.</P>

      <P>I have decided it is necessary for the new authority to have the power to borrow money subject to the usual consent from the Minister and the Minister for Finance.

      <P>I have been asked to move this amendment. I do so enthusiastically. I am sure the House will regret as I do that Senator O'Toole is unable to be present because of the death of his father. The funeral is taking place today. He deserves credit for this amendment. I had asked him to second an amendment of mine. Being a very efficient speed reader he spotted subsection (5) of section 22, an extraordinary provision which states:</P>
      <P>In the performance of his or her duties under this section, the Chief Executive shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy.</P>
      <P>It is an extraordinarily wide prohibition. The chief executive shall not express any opinion. It does not say in public, on the broadcast media, except he shall not express any opinion. What kind of a yes-man or a yes-woman would be involved if they did not express an opinion? Surely it is a moral requirement to express an opinion at least to the Minister. It seems to be very loosely drafted. It also seems to be a most astonishing restriction on freedom of opinion. I do not think it is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan drew attention to an earlier section where the disclosure of sensitive information is prohibited already. That is illegal. The Minister appointed this person and it suggests a disastrous lack of confidence in the Minister's <Col N="1170" /> own capacity to choose a person of reasonable discretion. This is a matter the Minister should reconsider.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he would not disappoint and that he would accept amendments. He has only a Government amendment left and I would not expect him to do anything other than to accept that. I hope the Government will accept this amendment and pending the Minister's remarks, I will resist the temptation to go into the kind of rhetoric we had. This would be no harm because Senator O'Toole did say this was almost Nazi style. I would not go quite as far as that; Stalinist would be as far as I would go.</P>
    <P>It is certainly something that should be taken out of the Bill and, with the expert advice he has been given, I hope the Minister will find it in his heart to accept these two amendments. The second amendment is merely a technical one and I am very grateful to the staff of the House for drawing my attention to it. It is consequent on the first one and it would be rather foolish not to remove it in both instances.</P>

      <P>Senator Norris has said much of what I wanted to cover. This has come up before. A chief executive of this authority could be before the Committee of Public Accounts trying to explain why money was not being spent to the satisfaction of the Comptroller and Auditor General or why proper accounts were not kept having been refused permission to appoint someone to a critical position to keep accounts because the Government had an embargo on appointments. In such a case, before the primary constitutional committee, the chief executive's job would be to cover up for the Government. This is a backlash by people who do not like the fact that committees have made life difficult for them and are beginning to have teeth. They want to reduce the degree of accountability to committees.</P>
      <P>I failed to spot the repetition in the following section and I am grateful to Senators Norris and O'Toole for submitting amendment No. 15. This section is even more wide ranging. I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government, which obviously has an environmental brief. If we want to know what is happening on sustainable energy, we would invite the authority to appear before us. If we are trying to determine whether public policy in this area is successful, appropriate or how it compares with other countries, the person who is best qualified to tell us cannot do so because the Government has said he may not express an opinion on the merits or objectives of any policy of the Government or of a Minister. He cannot outline to the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government, either in private or in public, what he thinks should be done because that would be an implied criticism. His job is to say the Government is wonderful. That is the only thing the authority can say to an Oireachtas committee.</P>
      <P>It is not the first time this has been put in but it is a new idea. It is the backlash&mdash;</P>

      <P>I support Senator Norris. What is the point of having people with expertise in these positions unless they are able to express their opinion on policy? I do not believe it is a new idea. In the health services, we have had to labour under similar restrictions. For example, hospital consultants have been issued with warnings by hospital management and health board managers <i>de temps en temps</i> that they are not to give their opinions on policy or what they see as the lack of services. Mercifully, to date, we have resisted and feel that the ethical obligations to our patients are far more important. I would not like to see this idea take hold and if we have people with expertise in various positions, it is most important that they express their opinions.</P>

      <P>Since I came into this House, I have always looked at every Bill coming through to see if it would incorporate what is called good management practice. The first time I saw this prohibition in such strong virulent words was when the regional health authorities were set up about 18 months ago. There is a precedent for it but one against which we fought.</P>
      <P>It is not healthy for the senior management of an organisation to be unable to question decisions or policy. The argument against this is that the owners or board of the organisation should define the policy and tell the chief executive that it is his job to make sure it works. It is much more healthy to allow for open debate and let the authority answer to Oireachtas committees. It is not good or even normal management practice such as we might expect in the 21st century. It might have been acceptable 100 years ago when management instructed people to do what they were told without questioning it. If we are to have a strong organisation, there needs to be open debate.</P>

      <P>As the Senators have said, I also regret that Senator O'Toole is not present. I know that he has had a bereavement and I register my condolences to him on his great loss.</P>
      <P>I sincerely thank the Senators for their careful consideration of this provision. I was very mindful that it had been raised quite vehemently on Second Stage. Senator Caffrey had also raised it with me privately and I appreciated that. I strongly disagree that there is any attempt inherent in the Bill to gag the chief executive of the new sustainable energy authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The similar provisions in both sections 22 and 23 relate only to the appearance of the chief executive before Oireachtas committees. The provisions do not relate to his or her duties in carrying out the activities or management of the <Col N="1172" /> new authority or to anything the chief executive might wish to say about Government policy or about a Minister's policy in any other form. Section 22(5) only relates to the chief executive appearing before a Dáil committee in accordance with section 22(4). Likewise, section 23(6) relates only to appearances of the chief executive before an Oireachtas committee.</P>
    <P>The provision was essentially intended as a protection for the chief executive against being drawn into giving an opinion on Government policy in the political arena and thereby becoming politicised. There are precedents for such protection. In particular, I was guided by the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997, which provides that a civil servant, a member of the Defence Forces or the Garda Síochána shall not, while giving evidence to an Oireachtas committee, question or express an opinion about Government policy or that of a Minister.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, an accounting officer, normally a secretary general of a Department, is restrained from questioning or expressing an opinion on Government policy. There are also instances where the Oireachtas has enacted provisions similar to this legislation in establishing semi-State bodies. In the Employment Equality Act, 1998, the chief executive officer is required not to question or express an opinion on Government policy, when appearing before an Oireachtas committee.</P>
    <P>I thought it appropriate to set out the rationale for putting this provision in place in the first instance. I appreciate the manner in which this matter was raised and the fact that it was also raised privately. This showed the depth of opinion and conviction in the House in relation to this provision. In deference to that well-put conviction, I am happy to accept the two amendments.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for accepting our amendments. With regard to any difficulty for a senior official, he or she can decline to give an opinion when questioned before an Oireachtas committee. The committee cannot compel a person to give an opinion. The individual has his or her rights. It would be wrong to exclude persons from giving opinions to an Oireachtas committee when they might well wish to do so. The Minister of State gave a military example. The military is organised in a particular manner whereby orders are taken without question and a subordinate does not express an opinion.</P>

      <P>These are standard provisions, but what happens if a directive is very expensive? Has the authority any come-back if the Minister gives a directive which involves substantial expenditure? Is there any way in which the authority can be protected from a future Minister? Where a directive involves major expenditure, the Minister should ultimately be responsible for that cost, not the authority. There have been past instances of directives being given to State agencies which proved to be enormously expensive. I accept the principle that a body which is an agent of the State ought to be subject to Government direction, in a transparent, open and accountable way. I do not accept that the Minister should simply be able to give a directive and not take some of the consequences if that directive causes problems, particularly of a financial kind.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No 16:</P>
      <P>In page 16, before section 27, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>27.&ndash;The Authority may, from time to time, as it considers necessary for the performance of its functions&ndash;</P>
      <P>(a)enter into contracts with persons or bodies, and</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment to section 27, in effect, amalgamates sections 27 and 28 of the Bill. What I am proposing is to include a provision in section 27 which will allow the authority to enter into contracts with persons or bodies to carry out such activities related to the performance of its functions as it considers necessary. The section also provides that the authority could engage consultants and advisers for the purpose of assisting it in the performance of its functions.</P>
      <P>Section 28 provides that the authority could enter into contracts to perform such of its functions as it considers necessary. It has been properly represented to me that the authority would not propose to contract out any of its functions, while on the other hand it may wish to enter into contracts for the carrying out of activities related to the performance of its functions. The acceptance of my amendment obviates the need for section 28 of the Bill and, accordingly, I am proposing its deletion.</P>
      <P>I believe my amendment clarifies the position and allows the authority to enter into contracts, which it may need to do in a range of areas related to its functions, such as the provision of information and the overseeing of business energy management services in public sector offices and local energy management agencies.</P>

      <P>Section 5(3) means that the Minister provides that this section shall not apply where the Minister is transferring shares to the ESOT or providing a director of ACC Bank plc with a share. In line with the Government's decision to dispose of the State's interest in ACC, the subsection provides that the Minister may dispose of his shares in the bank in such a manner and upon and subject to such terms and conditions as he may determine. It is envisaged that the Minister will sell his shares to the purchaser of the bank. However, the subsection also provides that he may exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of them in order to allow him full flexibility in this matter. Section 5(3) is obviously concerned with the ESOT and to make sure that it is ring fenced </P>

      <P>When bidders make an offer for the ACC Bank they will do so under prevailing market conditions and also on the basis of the condition in which the bank is. When the ICC Bank was put on the market there was little trouble because it had a good financial record. As we know from last week's debate, the ACC Bank is in a different situation. I had to rely on one of my Sunday financial newspapers to tell me that of the bad debts provision of £7 million made in the accounts related to the Four Seasons Hotel. In view of the difficulties the bank has experienced in relation to DIRT repayments and its underwriting of bad debts, which were substantial &ndash; I think the provision for bad and doubtful debts was £14 million &ndash; is the Minister of State concerned about the value of this bank when it goes on the market?</P>

      <P>As I emphasised to the Senator on the last day we spoke about the ACC Bank, we are not involved in a fire sale nor are we trying to get rid of the bank immediately. The reality is that market conditions will determine what offers will come in for the bank as well as the state of the bank, its financial capacity and how its stands at a particular time in the market. I assure the Senator the Government will not sell the bank for the sake of selling it. We will obviously ensure that the State's asset, the ACC Bank, and its value will be maximised to the fullest possible effect in any sale. Whether the bank will take some time to sell remains to be seen. It is certainly not a rush by the Government. We want to be in a position, as we were with other legislation, to ensure that if a very substantial and suitable offer comes in for the bank, the Minister would be in a position to dispose of his shares in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask a couple of questions which I think I asked on Second Stage, but in maybe a little more detail. There are several ways in which the Minister can dispose of shares. I have very little quarrel with the options he will have. He is not going to tell us which option he will take because I do not believe he knows at this stage. There is a provision here that whatever the method of disposal, a fair number will go to an ESOT trust. Apparently when these shares are disposed to the ESOT, a deal is done. The deal is between the workforce and the Government, the owner. Some 14.99% will go to the employees in this way. It is fully understandable that the Minister, for reasons which have precedent and which I do not want to quote again, is going to do this.</P>
      <P>What is the <i>quid pro quo</i> of this deal? What is being given back specifically by the employees? In other words, there has to be consideration in all cases for the disposal of shares. I presume in the case of 85% of it, it will be money but in the case of 15%, some 4.99% will be given to employees and I imagine they will pay a certain amount for the balance with soft loans if precedent is to be followed. What are the terms likely to be but, more specifically, will loans be given for the balance after the 5% &ndash; the 9.99%? What work practices will change in exchange for this gift of 5%?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said to the Senator the last day &ndash; I do not want to repeat myself <i>ad nauseam</i>&ndash; this is under negotiation at present between the bank and its staff. As regards the ESOT, as in the case of other companies which were disposed of on the same basis and where the workforce got a specific part of the company, that is, 4.99%, the rest of which was purchased, the conditions the company believes are necessary to meet in terms of redundancies, change in work practices and change in security from a State bank to a private sector company are some of the obvious areas in which one would expect fairly standard agreements to be reached between the management and the workforce in the context of selling the company.</P>
      <P>The terms of the ESOT are being negotiated as I speak. I am not, nor is the Minister, party to those negotiations. I cannot be any more specific than that. Issues such as the number of redundancies involved, the substantial changes in work practice, as would be dictated by any potential customer in terms of how the new structure may affect them, and the movement of employees from a State company and the certainty that brings with it to what prevails in the marketplace will need to be negotiated. They are the areas where one would seek agreement to change. There may be some specific detailed issues which I am not aware of because I am not privy to the negotiations which are taking place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister of State's reply as far as it goes and the point he is making regarding redundancies, although I presume that <Col N="1179" /> means that those who are made redundant on a voluntary basis will not receive shares.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that would be useful. Presumably, those who are made redundant will not receive shares. They will accept voluntary redundancy under a separate package. There is no point giving them shares because they would then also receive the benefit of the incentive.</P>
      <P>I am interested in work practices. This has been put on the long finger in the case of Aer Lingus and was spoken about in relation to TSB and Eircom. Perhaps the Minister of State will identify the work practices in ACC which the Government specifically feels require changing. What do these people have to give up to get their shares? What do they have to change? Where is the need for change? Where are the problems?</P>

      <P>Senator Ross has raised a fair question. It is not correct to compare Aer Lingus or Eircom with the bank. There are fundamental and very obvious differences between them. There is room and a demand for substantial improvement in the operation of the ACC Bank given its outturn for last year. That will involve everybody in the bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously at management level and downwards. One could deduce there would be better use of systems in the bank which might determine better judgment in the context of decisions being made regarding loans and the way the bank has developed. That is only stating the obvious. There is a need to improve efficiencies. Senators will be aware that flexibilities which exist within the private sector regarding work practices are more restrained, confined or restricted in the State sector. There is a need to co-operate with change. This would lead to greater efficiencies thus ensuring the bank develops new channels of delivery. Staff will need to be flexible and adaptable regarding new products. They will be required to accept new products as part and parcel of their existing brief rather than requiring incentives to change work practices to embark on the delivery of new products within the system. All these issues come under the heading of flexibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Merging with the new owners in the organisation will be an important issue. Staff must be prepared to co-operate and assist with the planning and implementation of the merger and the integration of new strategies. The ACC Bank will no longer function as it is and any purchaser would have in mind a strategic view of the potential of the bank which would see it grow as an <Col N="1180" /> asset within any new scenario. Changes will also be required if that is to happen.</P>
    <P>The reduction in staff numbers will be an issue. New technology to keep those in the financial sector at the cutting edge, nationally and internationally, is being introduced almost monthly. The use of technology is an area in which staff wish to be involved. A new system may involve a change in job roles, with changes in responsibility which staff may not have had heretofore. All these issues need to be negotiated when developing ESOT.</P>
    <P>I am not negotiating internally on behalf of the bank between management and staff. The Minister for Finance has overall responsibility as the shareholder and guardian of the taxpayers' interest in this area. Obviously he would wish to ensure that the bank is put on a very successful footing and is in a position to deal with any issues raised by an intending purchaser to ensure a much stronger, profitable and brighter future for the bank.</P>

      <P>I intervene in this debate between two of the most committed capitalists in Leinster House and remind both of them that there has not been a business yet, particularly one which deals with consumers, that did not have workers. Workers are not just an inconvenient addition to the equation, they are a very central part of a company's function.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Minister. I hope he will not interrupt me again.</P>
      <P>I do not object to selling off State banks any more than I do to keeping them in State ownership. It is motive and purpose which troubles me. It is the myth of private sector efficiency which gets up my nose. Senator Ross, in another capacity, is particularly good at pointing out the degree of the myth of private sector efficiency.</P>
      <P>It is not the State-owned post office that closes at 3 p.m. or 4 p.m. most days of the week, it is the big private sector banks which do so. They open at 10 a.m. and in some cases still close for lunch. This is not private sector efficiency. Post offices in most towns remain open until 6 p.m. six days a week. This is no longer the fault of the trade unions, it is the decision of management to restrict opening hours because it saves them money. There are certain things which the private sector does very well. One of the things it does best is sell the myth of its capacity to innovate. I was using e-mail in my place of work in the public sector for approximately five years before it was discovered by the private sector nationally and internationally. It was invented by the European Centre for Nuclear Research in Switzerland, a public-funded body which then had to persuade the ultra-efficient private sector of its merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am tired of the ideological nonsense about the public and private sectors. They serve different purposes and each can learn from the other. <Col N="1181" /> The private banking sector can learn a great deal from the concept that when one is big in a small society one has a social purpose. As Marks &amp; Spencers has discovered, it is not quite as easy as it thought to close businesses in civilised countries in Europe. It is only the least civilised member state of the EU, the United Kingdom, that still believes it is worthwhile to be able to sack people easily. The rest of civilised Europe, which is richer than the United Kingdom, does not share that view. The British ethos is to sack people and doing so is considered to be just a bit inconvenient.</P>
    <P>What we are doing here is a sensible way of making progress. While we will probably have to dress up the 5% in new work practices, there is not a scrap of evidence that the work practices in the Agricultural Credit Corporation are anywhere near as antediluvian as the work practices in Independent Newspapers, out of which it has had to spend the past two years trying to negotiate its way, so far unsuccessfully. The issue is about old and conservative practices, not about public or private practices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand why the Minister of State has given me a general reply. The company is in negotiations on an ESOT, so he cannot give a specific reply. It is damaging his case for selling this bank, to some extent, to willy nilly hand over this 15%. Whatever Senator Ryan may say, and he may be right, there is undoubtedly a feeling abroad and among those who were considering the ICC Bank, which had an almost identical type sales pitch, that they would not buy it because they did not like the 15% provision and although the 15% was handed over, the practices, which they did not like and which the Minister of State refused to spell out, still existed and might still exist there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is similar in Eircom. Anyone who works there would say, off the record, that the semi-State culture still exists there and has not been removed, that it has not been successful in changing the work practices and this 15%, 5% plus 9.99%, in exchange for work practices is a <Col N="1182" /> mere fiction. Nothing was given back or offered back and at the end of the day the Minister will get the worst of all worlds because he will not be able to sell this bank to many possible bidders because he will have given 15% of it away and he will not get anything back from the workforce where there are practices in place that are not particularly suitable or liked by the private sector. The Minister will give away 15% of the bank and no one will be able to spell out what will be given back in return.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about two of my least favourite words &ldquo;integrating strategies&rdquo;, which mean nothing whatsoever and he knows that perfectly well. The word &ldquo;integrating&rdquo; means very little and the word &ldquo;strategies&rdquo; means anything one wants it to mean. The Minister told us not to worry, the bank will have integrating strategies. &ldquo;Flexibility&rdquo; was another word he used &ndash; flexibility my eye. Let us hear specifically what will be given back in return. I know we will not hear that, so I will give up on it. The Minister of State need not worry, I will not waste time on this. We will not hear what specifically will be given in return for this 5% because nothing will given in return. The bank will go up for sale and very few people will want to buy it because of that. That is the reality. The capitalists in the private sector &ndash; I may be right or wrong about this and Senator Ryan may be right in what he said&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but he may be. I am not infallible. The reality is that a large number of banks in the private sector will not want to buy the bank because of that.</P>
      <P>Assuming the Minister will give away the 5%, which I presume he will, there is another 9.99%. What will that cost the employees and will they get soft loans on top of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with a few general points and then specifically with the Senator's last question. I would not like it to go out from here that it is my view that everything that exists in the private sector is perfect and everything that exists in the State sector is the opposite. As the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, I have learned a good deal about the practices in the public sector and how excellent they can be. The success of what that Department is doing is based on it having been able to marry a good deal of work between the public and private sectors and each sector has learned from what is the best in both. There are many elements in the public sector in terms of technique, etc., that are far ahead of those in some areas of the private sector. I have no difficulty saying that and have witnessed it first hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are the first Civil Service Department in Europe, if not the world, to receive ISO 9002 accreditation on product management, which makes us the foremost company in the country in product management services, equal and better <Col N="1183" /> than any that exists in the private sector here or in Europe. I can fully subscribe to the view that not all that exists in the private sector or the public sector is best, that there are pursuits of excellence in both categories, which both should strive to achieve. I do not have the youthful ideological view I might have had ten or 15 years ago and one learns over the years, but that is not to say I can recognise difficulties in all situations.</P>
    <P>As Senator Ross accepted, matters relating to the ESOT are under negotiation between the employers and the employees. From the point of view of management and the staff, it must emerge from these negotiations that the bank must be in a position when a potential purchaser submits a fair and substantial offer to present such a potential purchaser with an agreement in which the bank can have confidence in the context of redundancies, the range of work practices I mentioned and other flexibilities. That is not pie in the sky.</P>
    <P>I note the Senator's view of the easy way one can use words such as &ldquo;integrate&rdquo; and &ldquo;strategies&rdquo; and, to a certain extent, I agree with him, but it is important that the bank should have an agreement in place that is worthwhile and stands up. If it does not, the chances of getting a potentially good purchaser, which can have confidence in purchasing the bank, integrating it into its organisation in a smooth, seamless way will that will lead to efficiencies and to the potential purchaser realising the bank's potential, then we are at nothing, so to speak. There must be a fundamental basic agreement in place that would be attractive to any potential purchaser.</P>
    <P>The Senator tends to compare this company with other semi-State companies &ndash; one in particular on which he has a particular view &ndash; of a different nature. I will keep my counsel on that and not make any personal or public comment on it as it is not fair to compare the two.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and I have dealt with that aspect of the section. A good summary was given on Second Stage of the current state of the bank, its profits and why it was making losses. It was a pretty sorry story. Given that the Minister is the owner of the bank I consider it a fair question to ask him to identify the principal problems within the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Doyle raised this issue on Second Stage. I am not in a position to deal with the specific bad debts the bank has incurred in relation specifically to customers. We are well aware of the role ACC Bank regarding DIRT and hope it does not happen again. I believe it will not. It has certainly allowed for a very substantial provision to be made in the accounts of the last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ross can read as well as I can and has a good view on many of the difficulties that have <Col N="1184" /> arisen. One difficulty, which I do not mind stating, is that the strategy the bank adopted on business other than its core business may not, in hindsight, have been beneficial to the bank's development. Last year the bank made the correct decision to make full provision for all contingencies that could arise so that a potential purchaser will see that the bank has a clean bill of health and has overcome the hangovers it may have had owing to bad debt, the DIRT liabilities, etc. The bank did that at the end of the year in a transparent manner. It is better to do that than hope to do something different in the future. It makes absolutely clear the future value of the bank.</P>
    <P>I made the point, of which Senator Ross was very dismissive, that the operating profit of ACC Bank did rise last year. Some bad decisions might have been made and if the bank had had a crystal ball, it would not have made them. I can think of one instance which would have proved a very good deal for the client involved, but it did not work out. The bank has prepared itself so a potential buyer will know exactly how the company stands.</P>
    <P>The ACC Bank has a strong future in the context of its core operations. For instance, its reduction in its branch network in Dublin and its rural spread throughout the country is strategically useful. It may have been obvious up to ten years ago that the bank should have been doing what its core reason for being established was in the first place, but the bank went in a different direction. It is easy for me to criticise those who made poor decisions, and doubtless they did so in good faith, but it is only with the benefit of hindsight that I know they were not the best decisions for the bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to be awkward but I have two questions. Part of the Ombudsman Act, 1980, is to be repealed. Is the repeal because the Ombudsman used to have a brief to investigate complaints which is being revoked? Second, a paragraph of a subsection of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, is being repealed. What was that paragraph? It is strange to see this in a Bill on banking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The first repeal caters for the fact that the bank will move from public to private ownership. Obviously when the bank becomes private, in whatever guise, the remit of the Ombudsman will not apply to it in the way it would were it to remain in the public sector.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, I can only presume a similar provision is being made. I do not have the appropriate legislation in front of me, but I presume the repeal concerns the change of ownership and access and the conditions that apply to a State run bank as opposed to a private one. If I am incorrect, I will inform Senator Ryan.</P>

    <Title>Local Government Reform: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the Government:</P>
      <P>(a)for its failure to implement a strategy for better local government,</P>
      <P>(b)reneging on its commitment to introduce on behalf of local government elected members, a salary-pension scheme commensurate with their contribution to society, and</P>
      <P>(c)further condemns this Government for its failure to devolve authority and responsibilities to elected members.</P>
      <P>This motion has been moved out of pure frustration which has been created by the Minister, who unfortunately is not here. Let me welcome Deputy Dan Wallace, Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, to the House tonight. In the unfortunate absence of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, he is going to bear the brunt of my tongue. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has made commitments and promises to local authority members in the last few years and has failed to deliver on them. I previously accused him of avoiding coming into the Seanad and he denied it, saying that he had not been invited. He was invited here tonight and he is not here.</P>
      <P>This motion relates to something very simple, the commitment to reform local government. This requires first of all reforming it so that it becomes meaningful to the people outside, but it also needs reform so that it becomes meaningful to the elected members. These elected members have made a commitment over the years to this country. They are the ones who underpin local democracy which the Minister himself says he supports as the central pivot of democracy, yet nonetheless he is not supporting it in this House. He brought forward a local government Bill which I believe is gathering dust in the Lower House.</P>
      <P>Can I ask the Minister of State, since unfortunately the Minister himself is not here, to remind him of something? At the annual Christmas lunch in the Burlington Hotel of the local authority representative associations, LAMA, the General Council of County Councils and the AMAI the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1187" /> Our reform of local government is dealing with the fundamental issues. We are putting you the elected members back at the centre of the local government system and at the cutting edge of policy and decision making.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the history of what he has done with regard to policy and decision making. He is handing over the responsibility for the waste management programme from councillors to managers. That is not enhancing democracy but is reducing it, and is a step in the wrong direction. It is the very opposite to the commitment that he made then. It is worth remembering that in December 1999 he said, &ldquo;The Bill is taking a little longer than I anticipated.&rdquo; This is 2001. If it was taking longer than he had anticipated then, what would he call it now that he has not even got it past Second Stage?</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill are to deal with a number of issues, one of which is the dual mandate, and I believe that this is the one on which the Minister is getting stuck. I know that the Minister has enough support in the Lower House to get the Bill through, including this aspect of it, if he wishes to push it. I think his inaction is due to fear of the four Independents rather than a fear of losing the vote. If he had the guts to do what he is supposed to have done then he would put it through, something he has failed to do.</P>
    <P>Another major aspect relates to that of direct election of cathaoirligh and mayors. The truth is that it is only there because it suits the Government. It suits Fianna Fáil because of the numbers game. It is not there to revolutionise local government, and does not give any more responsibility to a mayor or chairman<i> vis-à-vis </i>the manager. He has no more responsibility than if he was elected from among the councillors themselves, as is the case under the present scheme which has worked adequately in the past, and if it was not tampered with would work well in the future. It is democracy at work and the proposal is a ploy.</P>
    <P>The third aspect is the payment of local authority members, who are rightly sick and fed up watching what is happening in this House. A salary increase was given to us in the Seanad, and also to Members of the Dáil, while they only got a promise that salaries would be paid to them and that was over two years ago. The Government amendment welcomes us belatedly on board into the salary and pension scheme. I was speaking in favour of this a long time before the Minister ever thought about it, and he does not have the right to claim it as his own.</P>
    <P>Some time ago a survey was carried out by the General Council of County Councils where they asked local government members to keep a record of an average week's work. The results averaged out at 19 hours a week, which in anybody's lexicon is two and a half working days. That is not just during the daytime because most of the business that people do in local authorities is carried out in the evenings, on weekends and at night. This is not to say that they themselves <Col N="1188" /> are the only ones working because, as Senator Walsh will say, when he is not at home somebody else is taking the calls for him. Local authority members are supplying a service to the community and if something goes wrong they are the first people to be phoned. If there is a leaking water pipe they are the first to be approached. If a light fails somewhere they are the first to be approached. At the same time, we are refusing to pay them, refusing to give them something which I believe is their right, and I am sure Senator Walsh also believes it.</P>
    <P>All we are asking is that this right be recognised and that they are paid as soon as possible. Payment should be backdated not just to last May or to when the Bill was introduced a year ago but to when they were elected, which was the previous June. It is only right that as they are carrying out the work that they should be paid for it. One of the factors we should take into account is the amount of additional work that local authority members are being asked to carry out. The tabulation of hours worked by local authority members does not convey the full picture as these hours are unsocial. Since the survey was carried out a new generation of committees and quangos has been spawned, namely the corporate policy groups and the SPCs which multiply the time involved for members. There are committee meetings, housing committee meetings, ADMs and all of those require members to do more work rather than less. When I put it to the Minister that the SPCs would involve more work, he replied that it would actually mean less, which is not true. Any measurement of the workload of local authority members would show that it has increased by at least 50%, yet the Government refuses to recognise it.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the Government will not move on its own Bill. It is a simple matter. The Minister has the numbers and he is in Government. An attempt is being made to blame the Opposition for the delay in passing the Bill. The Opposition has nothing to do with it. It is a Government Bill. The Government has the numbers to put other Bills through the Oireachtas, so why can it not put this one through? It is a simple request.</P>
    <P>I cannot believe the Government amendment before us. Senator Walsh is laughing because he cannot believe it either. I do not know who dreamt up the amendment but it is ridiculous. It must have been churned out by someone in a back room. It was stupid to bring it into the House. I await with curiosity the Minister's defence of this amendment.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that the Minister would inform us of a date for Second Stage. The Bill is stuck on Second Stage in the Lower House. I want to know when it will be moved on to Committee Stage. We on this side offered to take it in this House first if that would help. We even offered to move the Bill but, unfortunately, we were prevented from doing so because it contains a financial provision. We have tried to be helpful to <Col N="1189" /> ensure that the Bill is passed. We have adhered to our line on the dual mandate, yet there are people outside accusing the Opposition of holding up the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to several Senators from the opposite side of the Chamber who are embarrassed and feel that it is right to put down this motion to try to ensure that this Bill progresses. If the Minister has to make some modifications to keep his Independents happy, let him do so. There will be other opportunities to introduce legislation. It probably boils down to intransigence on his part. There must be disputes between the Minister and the Whip in the Lower House. We simply request that he recognises the contribution made by members of local government and the commitment they have shown in the past and will show in the future by acknowledging that their role deserves compensation and providing for that compensation.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Wallace, to go back to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and tell him that local authority members, even his own people, will not support the Government if he fails to get this Bill through. Even now, many of them are bitter at the Government and I do not blame them. When Deputy Dempsey goes knocking on doors seeking support he will not find his own people behind him unless he adheres to the commitment he made. He made it, let him keep it.</P>

      <P>I also welcome the Minister to the House. I reiterate the final comment of Senator Coogan. When Deputy Dempsey knocks on the doors of east Meath, he will get a very hot reception because of his failure to deal with the question of waste management and to introduce a proper system of local government.</P>
      <P>Our motion condemns the Government &ldquo;for its failure to implement a strategy for better local government&rdquo;. This Government has taken away the powers of elected members to decide on a waste management strategy. This decision was taken in light of a visit by councillors to waste management facilities in Europe. On the very day the councillors were due to decide in favour of an incinerator based on the facility they had visited, it transpired that this incinerator, which had been described as technologically perfect, had been closed down for breaching national regulations by polluting the atmosphere with illegal emissions. Had it been allowed to continue, it would have been responsible for killing people further down the line.</P>
      <P>The Minister used his amendment to the Waste Management Bill as a sledgehammer to destroy the power of people at local level and the right of their representatives to say no on matters relating to the environment. Our motion condemns the Government, particularly the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, for its failure in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" /> Behind every Senator there are at least 300 county councillors. When the Government and Opposition parties travel the country to meet county councillors, we listen to their views. We are their voice in the Oireachtas. The clear message from all the county councillors we have met over the past 12 months is that they are fed up with the shilly-shallying around this Bill and the soft words emanating from the Minister's office to the effect that these moneys will be paid. The reality is, as Senator Coogan said, the Government has failed miserably by declining to bring the Bill before the Oireachtas and by failing to pay county councillors, of all parties and none, for the work they are doing for their communities. Why will he not bring in the Bill and face down the four Independents who are setting the agenda of the Government? County councillors have lost patience. They are extremely angry and upset by the notorious failure of the Government to do its duty and follow through on its Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government has neither made local government local nor given it true power. The reality is that county councillors face a plethora of committees, all of which dilute their existing powers. They spend their time chasing ineffectively from one meeting to the next. The truth is that if the Minister wanted to give true power to local government, he would have changed the powers of councillors and county managers by giving the elected representatives of the people the power to overrule county managers. He would have increased their capacity to make decisions and insisted that officials carry out those decisions.</P>
    <P>Section 4 was available for county councillors to use in planning. The new section 4 in the Waste Management (Amendment) Act allows the manager to dictate to county councils and gives them more power than ever before. This is an utter negation of local democracy and if the Minister was serious and sincere about doing something for local government, he would have given more power to the elected members and chairmen of local authorities instead of diluting it.</P>
    <P>This motion is timely and important. It gives expression to the concerns of the public. From Cork to Donegal, from Mayo to Connemara, from Senator Walsh's constituency to mine, there are billboards and posters about environment issues such as dumps and waste management facilities. The Government has completely failed to deal with environmental issues.</P>
    <P>A meeting in Buswell's Hotel on Tuesday brought together 19 community, as opposed to political, groups from 19 counties to show that local communities as well as the Opposition parties are concerned about the failure of the Minister to act. That is further proof, if it were needed, that local government has been a shambles under this Government. It is time the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, resigned.</P>
    <P>The amendment to the motion tabled by the Government is a recitation of empty formulas <Col N="1191" /> that would take ten minutes to read never mind understand. The reality is that the Government has failed miserably in its duty. We ask, therefore, that the Minister resign. Before handing in his resignation, which should already be in an envelope somewhere in Leinster House, I ask that he at least introduce the provision to pay public representatives the moneys they deserve. Leaving them in limbo creates increased frustration, as all sides of the House know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to take this matter on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Noel Dempsey, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. As regards the call for his resignation, he will be around for many years to come to continue the good work which he is doing.</P>
      <P>This Fine Gael motion is about local government. A major programme of action has been under way to renew our system of local government. It involves not empty rhetoric but concrete action across a whole range of activities, where results have already been delivered or where progress is well in train. This wide-ranging programme of renewal has been driven by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, and the amendment which has been tabled reflects the substantial progress already made.</P>
      <P>The motion resonates with tired ritualistic negativity. While Opposition parties can be expected to oppose, most people now expect them to display at least some element of maturity and balance. That is sadly absent here. Indeed they might well be expected to recall some of the real advances for local government which have been effected. Several of them came before this House by way of local government, planning and constitutional Bills. There are none so blind as those who choose not to see.</P>
      <P>I am happy however to acknowledge the publication by the previous Administration of the White Paper, Better Local Government, in 1996. Yet until this Government came into office almost four years ago, the issue of local government renewal was largely aspirational. Since then, the Government has worked hard in the drive to renew the system of local government. There are several critical objectives of the renewal programme. Among them are the need to strengthen local democracy, especially through an enhanced role for elected members. Proper resources must be provided. Partnerships with sectoral interests and local communities must be developed. Customer service must be improved and efficiencies in local government must be developed.</P>
      <P>Credit is due to the Government for the real progress which has been made and the many initiatives which have been taken. Fine Gael is seemingly unaware of these; it is an ailment which seems to afflict them badly from time to time. Let me remind them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> Local government is democratically elected, its members are elected by direct vote and its <i>raison d'être</i> is to serve the people. The Government put the issue to the people by way of referendum in 1999. It did this to afford proper recognition to local government and local democracy as an intrinsic, separate and distinct part of our democratic system with a fixed electoral cycle. There can be no more postponements of local elections. For the first time ever local elections are guaranteed. What has been delivered here is not empty waffle but fundamental change.</P>
    <P>One of the first priorities of the Government was to put in place a proper funding system to secure the necessary resources for the ambitious programme of local government renewal. The local government fund was established by the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1998. After years of debate, a proper statutorily guaranteed source of funding was made available to local government. It has delivered over 63% more spending to local authorities since 1997 for general purposes allocation. The resources available &ndash; estimated at £720 million in 2001 &ndash; will help local authorities provide more and better quality services and afford them the certainty and confidence to plan for the future. In addition, a &lsquo;needs and resources' model has been introduced to create a more equitable method of distributing funds to local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Government, under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, has delivered the greatest ever capital investment programme to meet the needs of a rapidly growing economy and a modern society. Local authorities are key players in upgrading the essential infrastructure with record investment levels for their services. Almost £700 million will be invested in the national road network this year. That is an increase of £167 million, or 32%, on last year's spend. Investment in non-national roads will reach another record level at some £319 million, an increase of over 21% on the initial 2000 allocations. The greater part of this will go towards accelerating the restoration programme for local and regional roads in county council areas and its success is clear. Investment in social housing has increased by no less than 70% this year and we expect to commence a record 7,000 local authority housing units. This provides clear evidence of priority action by the Government.</P>
    <P>Progress is also being made on upgrading the water and waste water treatment infrastructure, on which over £330 million will be spent this year. This is one of the cornerstones of our efforts to protect and enhance the quality of our environment and to upgrade rural water supplies. Moves to end the discharge of untreated effluent along our coasts are well under way.</P>
    <P>Strategic policy committees are established in county and city councils to introduce the partnership model to local government by bringing together elected members and local sectoral interests. These will facilitate a timely and focused input by elected members to policy <Col N="1193" /> development in key areas of local authority activity. Along with other reforms, they will help to re-balance the relationship between councillors and management. They will have proper back-up with directors of service, many of whom have just been appointed or are about to take up office shortly. Delays due to industrial relations difficulties have been resolved. Additionally a programme of policy focused seminars for strategic policy committees chairs has been held. These will continue so that the committees receive regular updates and are equipped properly to fulfil their roles.</P>
    <P>A further initiative has seen the establishment of county and city development boards. These are already up and running and planning strategically for their areas. They are led by local government with representation from local development, State agencies and the social partners. Directors of community enterprise have been appointed and support staff put in place. Now that the development boards are fully operational, the next challenge is to draw up their strategies for economic, social and cultural development and to implement them successfully. This is a bold experiment where, for the first time, local government is being given the opportunity to influence the planning and delivery of a whole range of locally provided public services in a meaningful way.</P>
    <P>Local government exists to serve the public. A wide range of initiatives are well advanced to promote better efficiencies and customer service. Among these are a complete revamp of financial management and accounting systems to provide proper costings, comparability and transparency; an increased emphasis on corporate planning with proper input by the elected council; improved management structures with directors of service and clear accountability; the adoption of service indicators to measure performance across local authorities; the formulation of customer action plans to ensure a focus on service delivery; the better use of information technology and other innovative measures with financial assistance from the centre; and the establishing of one-stop shops, promoted by local authorities with funding provided by the Department, to deliver more integrated public services from a single location. Action in these areas continues apace. The overall aim is to equip local authorities with the requisite tools for a first-class, quality service that is efficient, responsive and attuned to customer needs.</P>
    <P>I remind Members that the Planning and Development Act, 2000, will give us a much improved planning system and greatly enhance the policy functions of elected members. Much of the Act &ndash; such as the new development plan system, the measures to improve housing supply, the licensing of outdoor events &ndash; is already in operation. The Act will be fully commenced later this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well known for his commitment to revitalise and reinvigorate local government <Col N="1194" /> and to maintain confidence and credibility in local democracy. A central objective of the Local Government Bill, 2000, and the reform process which I have outlined, is to restore the balance in local government and address the democratic deficit. The Local Government Bill is the first attempt by any Government in over a century to consolidate and modernise local government law. It follows directly from the constitutional amendment. It provides an array of mechanisms for the council to maintain a proper overview of local authority business, to develop, make and steer policy and to oversee the executive. The ending of the dual mandate and the introduction of a directly elected cathaoirleach in 2004 are further elements of this overall package which will enhance the role of the elected member, support community involvement and promote efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>For members to become fully involved demands practical supports and those too are being provided. There is provision in the Bill for the introduction, for the first time, of salary and pension arrangements. Continued allowances will be provided for members and cathaoirligh, including an allowance for leas-chathaoirligh. A better administrative back-up will be provided and a comprehensive training and information programme for all councillors will be delivered in consultation with their representative associations. Second Stage of the Bill commenced in the Dáil in March and is scheduled to resume shortly.</P>

      <P>We are all aware that some aspects of the Bill have led to disagreement from certain quarters and that discussions continue. I have no doubt but that an acceptable arrangement can be reached within the broad policy parameters, but let us acknowledge this. Local government is now constitutionally recognised and local elections guaranteed, a proper local government funding system is in place &ndash; it was promised and delivered, capital investment is at record levels &ndash; visible for all to see, this Minister was the first ever to propose a salary type payment for councillors &ndash; more than that, it is provided for in the Local Government Bill and will be delivered. For the first time since the foundation of the State a Bill to revitalise local government is before Parliament and a wide ranging programme to modernise local government and improve efficiencies is well in hands and continues to accelerate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has been achieved in the last four years and what is in prospect is nothing less than a new beginning for local government, that is, a local government system which is properly funded, focused on the customer and on the improvement of its services, which is founded on principles of democracy, partnership and community leadership and, above all, which is at the heart of local communities and which places elected members <Col N="1195" /> at its core and backed up by practical supports. The actions taken by the Minister and this Government speak louder than the belated criticisms of Fine Gael. The programme of local government renewal is well on track and will be completed within the lifetime of this Government. This Government is happy to stand by its record. I commend the amended motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise disappointed in the sense that it is typical that, once again, we must rely on Fine Gael in Private Members' time to ensure that the local government Bill will progress in the Dáil. As the House will be aware, it reached the Dáil on 8 March because of the specific lobbying of the Senators on this side of the House, week in, week out, until the Leader of the Fianna Fáil group and of the Seanad was embarrassed to have to say that it was not coming. Indeed, I do not expect it to be taken next week either because we have heard nothing in what the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, had to say as regards a date. There has been more lobbying in respect of this Bill than any other in my experience in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Recently I received a letter from the general secretary of LAMA, of which I have been a member since 1985 and on which I served with one of my fellow Senators. There are thousands of councillors and I am sure there are very few, if any, who are not members of LAMA and I am sure they all received this. The following paragraph of the letter, which was sent out of desperation to all councils, sums it up. It states that once again, within the past week, LAMA has had members of its executive speak separately with the Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, the Government Chief Whip, the Leader of the Opposition, the Opposition spokespersons and Independent Deputies in a co-ordinated and continuing effort to advance the issue. This shows that this is the most lobbied piece of promised legislation I have ever come across. The letter then states that in the circumstances it was LAMA's opinion that a compromise between the differing viewpoints would be preferable but this now appears to be unlikely. In other words, the compromise has gone out the window. The letter further states:</P>
      <P>In this eventuality we are now pressing very strongly that the Bill be re-introduced before the end of May to continue Second Stage in the Dáil and that all stages, in both Houses of the Oireachtas, will be completed prior to the summer recess.</P>
      <P>The end of May is just a few days away and the summer recess is only weeks away. Obviously time is becoming increasingly tight for this but nonetheless, from LAMA's viewpoint, &ldquo;it is not impossible&rdquo;. That says it all. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, should be well aware of how LAMA works since he was once its secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> I did say that this Bill has been discussed, debated, refined and amended, according to LAMA, AMAI and the General Council of County Councils, with frustration and anger building up among all parties as to why it has not been enacted. At LAMA's major conference, the Minister made promises, as he does continually, but nothing has happened.</P>
    <P>I suppose we must put this in context. When I was cathaoirleach of Limerick County Council in 1998, when we celebrated 100 years of local government, we were reminded by the Minister that the new Bill would provide for a statutory framework for local government and that the legislation on that matter dated from 1898. It is now 2001, three years after the Minister said that he looked forward to putting local government on a statutory footing. It is now 103 years since the previous Act became law.</P>
    <P>The White Paper of the rainbow Government, referred to by the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, was published within the short period my party was in Government. It contained a commitment on proper funding and on devolution. I thought there would have been continuity in regard to the 1996 White Paper but in five years nothing has happened.</P>
    <P>On the various efforts regarding funding, I know from Limerick County Council's road programme that, despite what was stated here, this year we received less than last year's allocation. We are supposed to be getting all this funding.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of equalisation. I acknowledge that there are IT systems in Limerick County Council and there is the programme for information and training for all of us. However, it is interesting that at the environmental SPC meeting I attended last Monday the sectoral representatives expressed the utmost frustration. They said they thought they had come to provide an input to policy and that they had achieved nothing since the last meeting. They wanted to know what is happening. The particular gentleman in question was so frustrated that he said he would not be turning up at any other meetings unless he saw progress. He was a little disappointed to find that members who were not from the voluntary sector had actually left the meeting and he felt that this was the result of frustration. The question, to illustrate the point to the House, had to do with a simple issue. The individual was extremely concerned about the environment. He had done much in his own local community to keep the environment clean and he was interested in waste management and in the implementation of the Litter Act, etc. However, he was gob-smacked when he heard that there were to be only two litter wardens in County Limerick and that if there were to be a third, which the Minister graciously said we could have, Limerick County Council would have to pay for him or her. Therefore, as regards all this gung-ho in the amendment to the motion about funding, I am extremely shocked if one cannot get funding from the Minister to appoint a third litter warden in a <Col N="1197" /> county as large as Limerick, which has huge environs.</P>
    <P>I will not even go into the issue of the city and county development boards because it would take too long. On the issue of directly elected mayors, much has been stated about the fact that in principle it sounds like a fine idea but, following investigation, we know it is very appropriate for European countries where there is a distinct difference between national and local government. I do know what will be the brief of these directly elected mayors. I think they will just be concerned with ceremonial duties because, from what I can see, certainly there has been no devolution of powers to them. Following tremendous pressure, the Minister had to concede that someone must spend a period of five years as a local government representative before he or she could be directly elected mayor. It sounds reasonable until one reads the fine print.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has the support of my party on the issue of the dual mandate, what is the problem? The Minister says that of course Members of the Oireachtas will receive all possible support within local government when they make representations but I want to know how he will deal with this. Where is the distinction between national and local representation? On the one hand he is talking about the dual mandate and on the other hand he is talking about the links between national and local representation. I would be happy that there would be links but it shows that the Minister is not thinking in terms of a local government structure with full powers separate from national government.</P>
    <P>When I hear the words &ldquo;efficiency and effectiveness&rdquo; used about local government, all I can think of is that sadly people still think of local authorities in Ballymagash terms. Even though the Minister states that all of these things will be done and that local authorities will give a fantastic service to the general public, the people, like ourselves, know that the problem is not that there is anything wrong with the local government officials in the administration but that they are working long hours, without overtime, particularly in the planning area. There are planners and engineers working until 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock at night in Limerick County Council because they can deal with planning only the day before the decision is made. Therefore, when local authority representatives like me are asked what is the delay with a planning application, one must repeatedly say that the officials have not looked at it yet because they just do not have time.</P>
    <P>The position as regards enforcement of planning is shocking. I could list many examples in Limerick where developers, in particular, have got away with blue murder because they know in their hearts and souls there is nobody to come out and enforce the decisions. Will this Bill ensure the necessary funding? There are many people who could deal with enforcement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1198" /> It is a pity I must reduce my comments to a few last points. Members of local authorities do not know when they will get these salaries. Will the Minister say when these salaries will be paid and will they be back dated? There is nothing concrete in what the Minister has told the House. Fine Gael has done its level best. We have put down Private Members' motions and asked for debates on the subject. People will not be willing to serve in local government. PAYE workers do not seem to be willing to serve and perhaps it is, as Senator Coogan stated, because of the long hours put in by local authority members. They put in long hours and work hard at tremendous financial and social expense to themselves. They are doing work equivalent to Members of the Oireachtas, and all without pay.</P>
    <P>We have group water schemes, consultative committees, Traveller accommodation consultative committees and corporate policy groups. There are more layers than in a large multinational company and individuals have to undertake a heavy workload. It is time the Minister woke up to the realities of local government. The Local Government Bill should be put before this House or it should be taken in the other House. We need an accurate and definite deadline before the summer recess.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;commends the Government for the high priority given to local government since June 1997, including securing constitutional recognition and guaranteed local elections once every five years, and on the real and tangible progress which has been made to renew our system of local government and to acknowledge the landmark events of the renewal programme, such as:</P>
      <P>The enhancements of the policy making role of the elected members through, for example:&ndash;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the Strategic Policy Committee and corporate policy group structures, and the enhanced policy role of members under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, in relation to issues such as decisions on future development in their areas and the innovative &ldquo;housing strategy&rdquo; provisions on affordable and social housing.</P>
      <P>The establishment, by way of new legislation, of the local government fund, which has delivered over 63% more general purpose funding to local authorities since 1997; and the introduction of a &ldquo;needs and resources&rdquo; model to the allocations process to create a more equitable method of distributing funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1199" /> The National Development Plan 2000-2006 which provides for the greatest ever capital investment programme by local authorities to upgrade roads, water and other necessary infrastructure and which this year sees an increase of some 34% in funding for such programmes.</P>
    <P>The wide range of initiatives currently under way with:</P>
    <P>&ndash;a comprehensive information and policy-focused training programme for SPC chairs now being extended to all councillors;</P>
    <P>&ndash;new management structures and directors of dervices now in place or currently being filled to support the SPCs;</P>
    <P>&ndash;county-city development boards now established, staffed and fully operational &ndash; led by local government working with representatives from local development bodies, the State agencies and social partners, ensuring real devolution and local decision making;</P>
    <P>&ndash;modern financial management systems based on best accounting principles, currently being rolled out to local authorities and to be completed by the end of the year;</P>
    <P>&ndash;a wide agenda to improve customer service by way of the one-stop shop programme, better corporate planning, customer action plans and service indicators, special funding for service improvement and innovation as well as information technology; and upgraded audit and VFM systems.</P>
    <P>The sustainable development ethos which has been introduced into land use planning under the Planning and Development Act, 2000.</P>
    <P>The continued progress and role of local authorities in improving the economic, social and physical fabric of our cities, towns and villages through the urban renewal schemes.</P>
    <P>The Local Government Bill, 2000, which is designed to underpin the range of initiatives already under way; to enhance the role of the elected members and place them at the heart of local democracy and to provide additional practical supports such as salary-pension arrangements; and other measures to reinforce the distinctive nature of local government as now recognised in our Constitution and as part of the overall programme for the renewal of our local government systems; and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1200" /> welcomes the belated support of Opposition parties for the salary-pension arrangements for councillors provided for in the Local Government Bill, 2000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I reiterate the welcome to the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, to the House. It is appropriate for a debate on local government that we would have a Minister who has given tremendous local service to Cork Corporation. He is a former Lord Mayor of Cork and is well equipped to understand and appreciate the contribution of local government to society.</P>
    <P>The amendment, which was tabled by the Leader, Senator Cassidy, deals comprehensively with many aspects of the motion. I wish to deal with the three specific points put forward in the motion, the first of which is cited as failure to implement the strategy for local government. I have not come across, in my time in local politics, a scenario where a Minister has engaged himself so fully with the consultation process, as has happened in relation to this Bill. The Bill was published in May 2000. Shortly afterwards, the Minister attended a seminar in Tralee which was also attended by almost 40% of the county councillors in the country. He answered all questions arising from the publication of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Coogan alluded to the fact that the Bill has stalled on the issue of the dual mandate. Efforts are being made to find a resolution. It is imperative that the Bill is enacted as soon as possible in the interests of local government. It is hoped that it will pass through the Houses of the Oireachtas before the summer recess.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have reduced the remit and influence of local councils. In 1995, a report on competitiveness stated that Ireland has the most centralised system of government anywhere in the world. It alluded to the fact that China was less centralised than Ireland. On a recent visit to China, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they have taken steps to make their regions and districts more politically autonomous. This has released a new dynamic within the Chinese economy and they hope it will supply the economic impetus needed to create employment and opportunities for the population.</P>
    <P>The City and County Management Act was introduced for specific reasons and it has now outlived its usefulness. The Local Government Bill will, I hope, dilute the effects of those provisions. The removal of rates on private housing and agricultural land in the 1970s and 1980s had a detrimental effect on the remit and influence of local government. Those of us involved in local government should publicly acknowledge the contribution of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, in providing the necessary funding for local government. I have been involved for more than 20 years at local council level and the Minister's contribution has been exceptional. There has been a 63% increase in funding since 1997 and that is a very significant figure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1201" /> The establishment of other parallel local government systems was to the detriment of the overall system. The Leader groups, the ADLs and the partnership groups, for instance, certainly made a valuable contribution to the local communities. However, they could have been merged into the local government system at an earlier stage and at a much-reduced administrative cost. Some of the local government initiatives taken by Deputy Quinn when he was Minister for Finance were very negative. Councillors could not serve as members of a partnership board and were prohibited from serving as chairs of Leader groups. These measures send the wrong signal. We must try to attract people into the local government system. Any system such as this which is so fundamental, employing more than 30,000 people, spending between £2 billion and £3 billion per year, needs good people with the ability, commitment and capacity to deliver the services and enhance the system. During that era, the thrust was very much in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>Central and managerial control is strangling local government. I hope that when the Bill is finally passed, we will see improvements in that area. The Bill can be used to release the dynamic of local government. In the 80 years of independence, local councils have made an invaluable contribution to the quality of life of the people they serve. The needs of modern society require a more invigorated approach. If councils are given the powers, resources and responsibilities, there are no boundaries to what they can deliver on behalf of their local communities.</P>
    <P>The motion cites criticism of the Minister for reneging on the salaries and pensions. If ever there was a misnomer, it is in the word &ldquo;reneging&rdquo;. I acknowledge there is a delay but it is very unfair to level this charge at this Minister. He is probably the most aware and responsive Minister ever to hold this portfolio. As a member of the general council, I remember proposals for a councillors' pension fund which would be funded by the councils. It was LAMA which first put forward the proposal for salaries for councillors at a meeting on 11 October 1997. For these proposals to be implemented, they must first be embraced by somebody imbued with the same spirit of local service, and we have found this in the Minister, Deputy Dempsey. He was the right man in the right place. Within the space of three or four years, a Bill was published which includes provisions for the payment of a salary and pension to councillors. The leas-chathaoirleach's allowance is a welcome provision and one that was sought.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senators that Oireachtas terms and conditions have been rectified during the currency of this Administration and rightly so. Politicians should be paid appropriately for the work and effort put in. It is important that politicians, so far as possible, should be made financially independent. It is fundamental to our democracy that that be the case. Councillors are the only public servants who are not paid. If those of us <Col N="1202" /> who serve in local government &ndash; I have served for 22 years &ndash; were to leave in the morning we would have no entitlements to salary, pension, gratuity or any other payment whereas after a short period of four years in the Seanad one is entitled to a pension proportionate to service and also a gratuity. It is untenable that local representatives should continue to be in the invidious position of being the only public servants who are not paid. That will be rectified at the discretion of this Minister who is entitled to be applauded and congratulated rather than criticised. It is not before its time but it is a welcome change.</P>
    <P>The increase in funding for national roads, housing and so on has placed the Minister in a position where he will be recognised as having made the most significant changes over a number of decades to the local government system. Much more needs to be done in the area of devolution. We have already suggested to him that as a start he could replicate the system of joint committees in the Houses by having joint local council committees which would hold to account the implementation of public services at local level, in education, policing, health, social welfare and agricultural services. While much remains to be done I am confident that the Minister has the commitment, the interest and the capacity to ensure local government going forward in the future will be more enhanced because of his period in office.</P>

      <P>I deplore the fact that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is not present. I do not say that to denigrate the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, who comes to this House frequently and is always helpful. This is an important motion and it is something for which the Minister has been directly criticised. He should have been man enough to come in here and face his critics with their justified criticism of his performance in relation to the Local Government Bill, 2000. While the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, represents the Government the Minister ought to be here.</P>
      <P>This is not the first occasion on which the Minister has not shown due respect to this House. He was able to come in here a few weeks ago to take the Planning (Amendment) Bill by which he takes the power from local authority members to decide their own waste management strategy. He issued a series of gratuitous insults against my local authority because of our independence in relation to our input into the regional waste management strategy for the Connacht region. As elected members on our local authority we were perfectly entitled to do that but the Minister did not see it that way. He considered that it was his idea of a waste management plan for the region and that we should accept every iota of it. It was regrettable that I had to engage with him in a way I did not like having to defend my local authority when he made those remarks about four weeks ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1203" /> I wish to deal with paragraph <i>(b)</i> of the motion. All I can say to the Government is &ldquo;well done&rdquo;, because 95% of the wording of the amendment is lifted straight from the Government White Paper of 1996 &ndash; Better Local Government. Of course it has been changed at the edges to convey a certain amount of politics.</P>
    <P>On the question of how we have treated local authority members, my good friend, Senator Walsh, is chairman of the Local Authority Members' Association, in other words, our trade union, and I am the executive member on behalf of Roscommon local authority. We meet every month and discuss this issue at great length in a non-political and objective manner. The matter has been on the agenda for the past couple of years. The first meeting I attended of the Local Authority Members' Association as an executive member was in Mullingar at its annual general meeting in September 1999. Our guest speaker on that occasion was none other than the Minister, Deputy Dempsey. He promised unequivocally that within a matter of weeks the Bill would be published. He said he could not control parliamentary time but that he hoped to have it passed before the Christmas recess of 1999.</P>
    <P>Now half way through 200l, the Bill is stuck in the other House because of disagreements over an aspect with which we on this side agree, that is, the dual mandate. Deputy Healy-Rae, supported by three other Independent Members, cannot agree that the Bill, when enacted, will provide that Members of the Oireachtas cannot be members of local authorities after 2004. The Minister has enough support here already to get the Bill through. The Labour Party and the Green Party have said they will support that section of the legislation and we have no great difficulty with it. Our difficulty would be that it is a nonsense making this radical change without devolving real powers to local authority members. It is a laugh in a sense that one can remove Oireachtas Members from local authorities who very often are the only people who can influence the Department or the Government. Local authority members with no additional statutory powers given to them would, in a sense, be bereft of the power that Oireachtas Members can wield by virtue of their membership of either House.</P>
    <P>Local authority members have been badly treated in the manner in which they are compensated for the enormous amount of work they carry out. Much of their work is statutorily provided for. There are many areas in a local authority that cannot function unless local authority members attend their meetings and debate them. There are dozens of statutory functions for which they get no remuneration or recompense.</P>
    <P>An attempt was made to deal with expenses to local authority members in 1993. That provided for a set travel allowance per annum plus a postal and telephone allowance which remained in place from 1993 until July 1998 when some small <Col N="1204" /> changes were made to it. An increase of £800 was given in most cases to local authority members who serve on full county councils or on full borough councils. There were some changes, albeit small, in the travel rate which is paid in a lump sum. Another aspect of this is that a member must attend at least 80% of all meetings of the local authority, committees and sub-committees of which he is a member to qualify for the full rate of expenses. There is an annual expense allowance which is divided by 12 and paid monthly to each member.</P>
    <P>No provision is made for a member who is ill. Recently a member of my local authority was ill for a long time and missed six meetings. By virtue of that illness that person lost substantially on the recompense received even though continuing the work at home and making telephone calls from the home telephone. Not only is the travel element reduced if a member cannot attend 80% of the meetings but if, owing to illness or for some other reason, he cannot attend 50% of the meetings of the local authority, committees and sub-committees of which he may be a member his postal and telephone allowance is reduced. That is surely very unfair.</P>
    <P>Local authority members looked forward to the fact that this would be the first recognition of their work. They feel very frustrated. Because of increases in the cost of running a car, fuel, telephone, offices etc., the salaries and expenses paid to Members of the Oireachtas have been kept in line with those increases. Not alone that, because there is now more money in the economy, we compensate ourselves somewhat better in real terms than we did in 1993. However, local authority members have none of these benefits.</P>
    <P>Members of this House were treated generously by the Buckley Commission. By 31 October 2002, the salary of a Member of the Seanad will have been increased by 30%. That will give us a salary that is 75% of a Member of the Lower House. We have also had other substantial increases in our secretarial and office expenses. The Oireachtas will soon be enacting the long-service increment provision for Members of these Houses. Based on my reading of the Buckley report, the Government will introduce a first long-service increment after seven years' service in either House and a second increment after ten years of service.</P>
    <P>Bright, intelligent local authority members carry out a huge task for democracy and their community. They are in very close contact with Members of these Houses and they see their work being denigrated and devalued. They are treated with contempt by the Government. A promise was made to them when the then Minister, Deputy Howlin published his White Paper in 1996. This has not seen the light of day and it is no wonder they feel so frustrated. The cursory way the Minister dealt with this in his speech this evening is most disappointing to put it at its kindest. He said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" /> We are all aware that some aspects of the Bill have led to disagreement from certain quarters and that discussions continue. I have no doubt but that an acceptable arrangement can be reached within the broad policy parameters.</P>
    <P>When will this happen? There is no sign that this Bill will complete Second Stage in the other House before the summer recess and it still has to come here. There could be a long wrangle in the other House during Committee and Report Stages that would take it through the autumn session to Christmas. I believe that we will probably have a general election before the end of this year and if the House dissolves, the Bill falls. We may not see legislation like this again in our political lifetime.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister for State to take a message back to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, to let him know that Members on all sides of this House are expressing the anger of local authority members who are his colleagues and mine. They feel very badly let down and devalued. There is nonsense, rhetoric about putting them at the centre of decision-making and redefining their role to give them real authority. This is not backed up with the necessary recompense and improvement in expenses, which they deserve if only to compensate them for the time they spend at local authority functions.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State not to see this as a political point-scoring debate. We brought this forward because Members on both sides of the House are under pressure. Senator Walsh, an honest and decent man, is chairman of the local authority members' trade union and he knows this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">

      <P>I welcome the Minister for State, Deputy Wallace, to the House. I compliment him and the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, on all the work they have done for local government since 1997. I am surprised at the wording of the motion. I admit there is frustration among members of local authorities that the Bill has not been passed. However, a motion criticising the Government for inactivity is totally unfair. The Government has given proper funding to local authorities and put proper structures in place for the first time.</P>
      <P>I have been a member of a local authority for 21 years. Various Governments have promised us structures, but it took this Minister and this Government to put them in place and it is now planning further structures. The Bill is in the other House and I am sure it will be completed in plenty of time. It will give better compensation to the councillors who run the system. They do a tremendous job for local democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A year ago Members of this House said that there was a housing crisis, with people living in hovels, and nothing could be done. All of a sudden under the Planning Act we have a new social housing strategy with the provision for affordable housing introduced by the Government. The establishment of the local government fund has <Col N="1206" /> delivered over 63% more general purpose funding for local authorities since 1997. The Government was criticised for not providing money for infrastructure such as roads, water schemes and sewerage schemes. However, now the money has been provided and we can see work being done throughout the country. To accuse the Government of sitting on its laurels, doing nothing, could not be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>The new national plan shows a 34% increase in funding for various programmes. SPCs and the city and county development boards were established. There is a more worthwhile county council with everybody working in the right direction. In the past, if a person wanted to complain about a road, a house, a sewerage scheme or a water scheme, he had to go to maybe 20 different buildings before getting anywhere. Now there is the one stop shop programme, which gives an improved service to the customer using the local service. These were all introduced by this Government.</P>
    <P>One of the first priorities of the Government was to introduce a proper funding system that secured the necessary resources for a very ambitions programme for local government. This was established under the Local Government Act, 1998. A sum of £720 million will be spent by local authorities in 2001. It is totally untrue to say that the Government is reneging on its promises to local authorities. I expect that the Bill which is currently before the Dáil will be completed in the near future.</P>
    <P>Perhaps local authority members are somewhat annoyed that they have not got what they were promised with regard to salaries and pension rights. My colleague, Senator Walsh, who is the chairman of LAMA, stated earlier that that body was the first to mention the question of salary. As chairman of the General Council of County Councils back in the 1980s, I and my executive committee were the first to promote the idea of pensions for councillors. Both salaries and pensions for local authority members will come to fruition, and rightly so. The Minister is on public record as undertaking to backdate the arrangements when the legislation is enacted. I and my colleagues on this side of the House will press the Minister to backdate it to the date of the last local elections. In view of the commitment already given, I feel sure that the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, will not be found wanting in relation to that further backdating.</P>
    <P>Local councillors deserve a proper salary for their work. We on this side of the House will promote that issue vigorously when the Bill comes before the Seanad. Many Senators owe their seats to their local authority experience. There is much discussion about the dual mandate. If the dual mandate is to be abolished, so be it. The workload of local authority members is getting so heavy that they are almost fully occupied already and should be rewarded accordingly.</P>
    <P>It was Deputy Michael Smith, during his term as Minister for the Environment and Local <Col N="1207" /> Government, who first introduced some form of reward for urban councillors. Postage and telephone allowances for local authority members were also introduced by Fianna Fáil led Governments and more will be done for them under the present Government. In my 20 years' experience as a local authority member, I have yet to see any input from the other side of the House to alleviate the plight of local authority members, who were starved of funds for many years.</P>

That is unfair. The Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, is present. This Government is implementing its proposals and providing proper funding for local authorities.</P>
      <P>It is, perhaps, regrettable that the Waste Management (Amendment) Bill had to be put through because of the fact that many local authorities did not face up to their responsibilities and, consequently, those local authorities which were doing their job were also penalised. If the Minister did not take action, refuse would continue to pile up on the streets. When the Bill comes before this House, there will be ample opportunity&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Kiely for raising the issue of the Waste Management (Amendment) Bill which we debated recently in this House. That encapsulates the manner in which this Government has completely and utterly undermined local government. The Government's amendment includes a long list of so-called achievements, very few of which are due to the current Administration. Most of those matters were brought forward by the previous Government. The Better Local Government policy was formulated by the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Brendan Howlin of the Labour Party. The present Minister is simply implementing the ideas of his predecessors. He has implemented very few of his own ideas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, the Minister's initiative on salary and pension arrangements for local councillors went down very well. At this stage, local councillors are fed up with hearing of the Minister's so-called commitments on this matter. Many of us <Col N="1208" /> have almost come to the point of believing that it will never happen. It seems to be caught up in the paralysis of indecision, or perhaps in some kind of Bermuda triangle in Kerry South, on the issue of the dual mandate. When the history books are written on the record of this Administration, this Government will be seen, on balance, as one which undermined local government rather than progressing it. That is most regrettable, in view of the huge opportunity which exists.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the progress being made under the Better Local Government strategy, at least in theory. The structures of strategic policy committees, corporate policy groups etc., are long overdue as a management tool. The benefit is already evident in my own local authoirity, even within a short period, but that is only one part of the overall infrastructure which local government needs. There was a clear need to upgrade and reform management systems and to make local government more accountable to the people whom it serves. We still have a long way to go in terms of delivery of service by local authorities but we are on the right road in that regard. Better local government is certainly the way to go.</P>
    <P>However, there is a huge deficit and this was evident on the doorsteps to those of us who went before the electorate in the last local elections. The standing of the elected members of local authorities is diminishing by the day. Senator Kiely spoke of the increasing workload of local councillors. I fully agree with him and, indeed, I can attest to it from my own experience. The ability of councillors to take a full role in the process, to act on behalf of the people who elected us and to respond to them, is a hugely important part of the role of a councillor. It is fundamental to ensuring that local government, which is the very cornerstone of our democracy, works properly. We are still very far from making that happen. We have only to observe the cynicism of the electorate when they experience local democracy. In doing their best to be the liaison between the infrastructure of local government and the people, councillors are, in many ways, the meat in the sandwich. There can be such a sense of frustration as to make one wonder if it is possible to achieve anything.</P>
    <P>The issue of salary and pension is fundamental for the elected members. As Senators who are elected by local councillors throughout the country, we must take it upon ourselves to raise this issue at every opportunity. I commend the Fine Gael Party for bringing it forward at this stage. This important legislation deserves thorough examination and debate when it comes before this House. I hope that day will be sooner rather than later, because the fundamental issue of salaries and pensions, and a strategy for the future of local democracy is daily more urgent and important. Our democracy is under threat from all sides and unless we start from the ground up, we are at nothing. We need an imaginative, dedicated, committed approach to local government. The introduction of a salary and pension scheme, <Col N="1209" /> which recognises the central role of councillors and their contribution, is fundamental. I support the Fine Gael motion in this respect.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment lists what this Government has implemented of strategies introduced by previous Administrations. We have come a long way in recent years but still have a long distance to go in the reform of local government. The process will stop in its tracks if the reform is not continued and this legislation is not brought forward as soon as possible. This Government may run out of time before we have the chance to implement fully this legislation.</P>
    <P>At the heart of this is the dual mandate, a politically thorny issue which must be grappled with. If the Government fails to do so, it fails to deal with an issue fundamental to our democracy. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government often states, and has done so in this House, that it is a core issue for him. He is not going to step back from the crunch on it. There is division in the Government on this issue as colleagues disagree with him. It appears to be caught in the Bermuda triangle in Kerry South. It is to be condemned and deplored because the people, who elected us to this House and to local authorities, suffer from the Government's inability to make a political decision and move forward on this fundamental legislation. I support the Opposition motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>On neglecting local government and its members, if we had our sins on our foreheads, no one would be holding his head up. The chest and chin of Fine Gael would be inseparable companions.</P>
      <P>I support this amendment. It is important and opportune that we in this House debate local government. Its current status should be looked at in depth. An important factor in recent years was the ring-fencing of local government funding. Over the years, local government members called for powers. Funding is power, the power to raise money and to spend it. At Estimates time, the people who called for hundreds of thousands or millions of pounds to be spent were shy when it came to striking a rate. This Minister provided a real funding base for local government, which gives the members real power.</P>
      <P>I served as president of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland ten or 11 years ago and chaired an all-party committee which made recommendations on local government reform, one of which was constitutional recognition. We were not the only group making that recommendation. That recognition has now been given in the Constitution. Strategic policy has been addressed by the Minister through legislation. In 21st century Ireland, it is important to move forward and take a hard look at ourselves. The Minister and the Government have done that in legislation and the measures taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much was said about the Local Government Bill. Like every elected Member here, I appreciate that the local authority member and his role <Col N="1210" /> today is very different from when I entered Westmeath County Council and Mullingar Town Commission, almost 22 years ago. Membership of a county council, a county borough council and, in most cases, membership of a borough or urban district council, is a full-time job.</P>
    <P>The Buckley report recognised the workload of Deputies and Senators. Much has been said, inside the House and outside, about the dual mandate. I never supported it as I made clear when I was president of the AMAI. However, I respect the views of those who want to retain it. That is democracy and we are supposed to be living in one where people can express their views. As someone nominated by the AMAI, I am conscious, as the Acting Chairman knows, of the lobbying over the Bill. There is anxiety among local authority members over the proposed salary and pension. I do not doubt it will come. What this Minister starts, he finishes.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely referred to waste management. Members must have powers, but it is important for them to use them. When we brought in paid parking in Mullingar to improve the traffic flow, it was unpopular, but if we had not today Mullingar would be gridlocked. I am glad we made that decision. Many important infrastructural developments for traffic have flowed from it. However, even though the decision was originally unanimous, many members in the chamber, for political reasons with the advent of an election, jumped ship except for my group. I was the chairman of the authority. The people of Mullingar can now see the benefits of the Fianna Fáil supported decision.</P>
    <P>There are a number of Acts on the powers of local government, particularly the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955. Changes have come but, as I told the Minister, county managers have too many powers.</P>

      <P>This motion tabled by Senator Coogan and my colleagues is timely given the Government's lethargy on this all important matter. The changing role of local government and the enhanced role of the councillor, which has been promised for years, is a matter of primary concern to us all. The motion, like the Bill whenever we get it, is designed to underpin a range of initiatives already under way to enhance the role of elected members and place them at the heart <Col N="1211" /> of local democracy and to provide additional practical supports, such as salary and pension arrangements. Forgive me for not welcoming this long suffering Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, to the House, which I wholeheartedly do. He spent a lot of time in this House today, which is appreciated.</P>
      <P>We have had many false dawns in regard to this Bill. Indeed, the Leader has given this House many assurances. One of the first was in late 1999 when he said it would be passed through both Houses by April 2000. He then said it would be passed through both Houses by last Christmas and then that it would be brought in immediately after Christmas. Here we are in May 2001 and the Bill remains undelivered. I sometimes worry about the Leader because he is meant to be the conduit between this House and the Government. I do not know where the breakdown in communications is. I sometimes wonder if the Leader is being given the washroom treatment by the Government. I do not know what is wrong, but he has given a lot of assurances that have not measured up.</P>
      <P>Senator Walsh said the Minister has the interest and capacity and I accept that, but he has been thwarted a lot by his own side of the House &ndash; probably not in this House but in the other House. I am worried because here we are four years later and the planning system is creaking at the seams.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Government's belated speeding up of this Bill which will be very welcome as far as we are concerned. This side of the House has been supportive and has given it encouragement from the outset and I assure Members we will continue to do so. Members on both sides of this House would agree that as part of the enhanced role and the increased workload being imposed on councillors whose function is practically full-time already, there should be due and proper recompense. The time for putting in place a proper salary and pension scheme and improved allowances for members of local authorities is long overdue. It is difficult for us to understand the reasons for the delay in introducing such measures given all the Government promises regarding their delivery. At this juncture nothing further can be done to enhance the role of councillors, improve local authorities and introduce the necessary salary and pension arrangements without the passage of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all have the utmost respect for councillors who have given of their time so dedicatedly over such a long period and without any reward whatsoever. In many instances, they have suffered great loss personally, given the time consuming nature of their role which separates them so much from the families, and financially, through losses in work, businesses, professionally and otherwise, because of their dedication to duty and the long hours they put in to serving their people and communities. I, therefore, plead with the Government to proceed immediately with the passage of the <Col N="1212" /> Bill through the Oireachtas. I urge the Minister to set the salary scale initially at least at £12,000 per annum. That is why I asked Senator Dan Kiely, my learned friend from my county, and others to put a figure on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">

      <P>I would heartily concur with that. I got worried when I heard the Minister of State say a modest salary is envisaged because anything less than that would not be commensurate with the work they do and the pension arrangement which would relate to salary level would be pretty worthless.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said the ending of the dual mandate and the introduction of a directly elected cathaoirleach in 2004 and further elements of this overall package will enhance the role of the elected members, support community involvement and promote efficiency and effectiveness. The Minister of State said the dual mandate will end but the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, recently spoke of the consultative process, for which we thank him, with all the local authority associations and said that during this consultation process many issues have been raised, one of which is the ending of the dual mandate, and that, as we are already aware, this is a matter of ongoing discussion. That is very imprecise. Senator Dan Kiely used the word &ldquo;if&rdquo;, so I do not know where it stands. In any event, I look forward to the full implementation of the Bill following its overdue passage through the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I am glad we are having this debate this evening. The reform of local government is fundamental to a regeneration of respect for democracy because local government touches people's daily lives in the most meaningful way. If people had respect for local government and its practitioners, they would have an enhanced respect for the institutions of State and it is important that happens. There is a great deal of cynicism at the moment and nothing good comes out of that.</P>
      <P>We talked about payment for local councillors. A feature of local councillors and local authority members is their very heightened sense of public service and of the giving of public service in a voluntary way. It is a huge value in a community that there are people who are prepared to give their time, talent and energy to public service and to give it without counting the cost or whatever remuneration they get for it. We should not take that for granted. That is a key reason we should proceed with due haste to formulate and put in place some kind of salary structure, even if it is only to recognise our local authority members. We should not continue to take them for granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Local Government Bill, it would be unfair and a travesty of the truth not to acknowledge that this Minister has tried with might and <Col N="1213" /> main to push the local government reform agenda through. He is very sincere and determined.</P>

      <P>I really want to acknowledge that because it is a fact. The effort to reform local government will finish in a nonsense unless we have the courage, determination and conviction to insist on bringing an end to the dual mandate. Given the complexity of legislation that has to be handled by these Houses, it is not practical or feasible to expect legislators to run around the country looking into potholes or to wonder whether bus stops should be put on one side of the street or the other, dissipating their energies on matters of that nature which properly belong to locally elected representatives with a brief to represent the local interest.</P>
      <P>The net result of a system that requires Deputies and Senators to carry on both workloads is the filtering away of the powers of this and the other House. The power is going to the courts and other sources not elected by the people. That is a negation of democracy. There is a high price to be paid for requiring our legislators to attend to all these functions which is one of many reasons we should seek to bring down the curtain on dual mandate. I know a number of women who would like to be elected to this or the other House but could not manage the punishing timetable involved. There are overwhelming reasons for putting an end to the dual mandate system. We should not permit a small number of people to dictate the agenda on this issue. That is a major negation of democracy.</P>
      <P>We must work towards directly elected mayors with executive functions for a fixed term of office. The running of cities is a very challenging task. Cities are very complex places to run from a social, transport, environmental and planning point of view. We must elect persons for a sufficiency of time to bring about change and put our cities on a par with other cities in Europe. Such countries have directly elected mayors who have a mandate from the people to carry out essential changes and reforms. One could not change anything in this country as things stand. No matter what is proposed, some genius on the corner of the street is against it. There is only one way to break through that culture. We must put in place a mayor with vision&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have been listening to debate on the issue of local government reform for the past 20 years, but no such reform has taken place. The Government has tinkered with local government for many years and has made only cosmetic and academic changes to it. The fundamental change it introduced, giving local government constitutional status, is of academic interest only to councillors. Indeed many of them were happier with the way things were.</P>
      <P>Councillors have less power now than they had years ago. If the Government is serious about providing local government with real power it will have to give it real responsibility. It must be allowed to raise money locally. Local government in many other European states is allocated a budget through which it can provide services. Until we go down that road we are going nowhere. The Government is merely tinkering with local government. SPCs are great on paper and in theory but in reality they are not contributing to local government.</P>
      <P>I support the abolition of the dual mandate system. It is impossible for local authority members to cope with the many demands made on their time. The Government is to be condemned for its failure to recognise the role being played by local authority members. The Government has promised, for the past two years, to introduce this legislation. It is currently being held up by the four Independent Deputies who have refused to budge on the issue. We will have to have a U-turn by the Minister, intervention by the Taoiseach or a compromise or climb down by the four Independent Deputies before this legislation can be passed by both Houses. I would like to know which of the three options is most likely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1215" /> Councillors believe that the Government is not taking serious regard of their efforts. They are promised a salary and pension on the passing of this Bill, which though only small is a very important part of overall legislation in this area. The Government will meet a great deal of resistance among local authority members if it does not move forward with this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The first real test of support for the electorate of this House, the councillors of Ireland, comes before us this evening. What is embraced within the Fine Gael motion is total support for the councillors of Ireland regardless of party and total support for local government. To oppose this motion and table an amendment to it, as has been done by the Government parties, is hypocrisy. It will be very difficult for Senators of the Government parties to face the councillor electorate in the forthcoming Seanad elections.</P>
      <P>The councillors of Ireland are, in my opinion, the foot soldiers on the ground who carry the can when Oireachtas Members are away in the capital, away from the electorate. Councillors remain available to the people at all times. Unless they are treated differently, very few people will be putting their names forward come the next local government elections. The time has come for county councillors and local authority members to be properly remunerated for their work. They are involved in county council meetings, SPCs, area committee meetings and so on. It is almost a full-time job. It is too bad that four people &ndash; called a yankee in racing parlance &ndash; the four Independent Deputies, can hold to ransom the councillors of this country. The Government parties now have the opportunity to support councillors and, accordingly, to support the all-embracing Fine Gael motion before the House. I find it difficult to understand how the Government parties can commend the Government on the high priority given to local government since June 1997 when in the recent Waste Management Bill it denuded the councils of the little power they have left by vesting power in regard to waste management in the county managers, a power they do not want and which puts them in an unenviable position. There is a major difficulty in this area, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is muzzled by four Independents. The time for change is nigh, otherwise local authority members will remain second class citizens within the context of public representation. I hope change will be introduced soon and then the matter will be rectified but that will only happen then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this motion presents a golden opportunity to commend the Government on the local government reforms it has introduced which are ongoing and will be completed before a general election is called. To briefly highlight the reforms introduced, local <Col N="1216" /> elections will be held every five years. Development boards were introduced and, for what it is worth, I sit on one of them and that board is working extremely well. We reflect on policy in relation to councillors, local interested bodies and on how best we can help in any area that requires assistance. We moved forward on planning legislation. That was the first time a Government introduced a policy on housing strategy, which provides that 20% of development land will be handed over to the local authority concerned for the purposes of social housing, affordable housing or voluntary housing. I have been a member of a council for a long time and there are many armchair members, so to speak, hurlers on the ditch. This debate presents a golden opportunity to outline what is being done in this area.</P>
      <P>One final part of the reform is the implementation of the provisions in the local government Bill. It deals with three key areas, including directly elected mayors. I had a difficulty initially with that proposal, but I must compliment the Minister on the way he went out and about and convinced Members on all sides of the House of the importance of giving power to local councillors and directly electors mayors to get the job done and to remove that power from the county manager, with which everyone who knows about this would agree.</P>
      <P>I have concerns about another aspect of that Bill, the proposal to remove the dual mandate. I support its removal as it is physically impossible to be in two places at the one time. I could give examples every week of attending meetings in the council and trying to be here at the same time, but one must make choices. This matter was thrashed out at length and the fact that we have not moved on that is holding up matters. I have confidence in the Minister that the dual mandate will be removed.</P>
      <P>A third key area of that Bill relates to a salary for councillors. We will all be canvassing in the next election in the knowledge that councillors will be paid a salary &ndash; that is certain. The Minister has given a commitment on that and it is merely a question of getting such a measure through the Dáil, which I am convinced will happen.</P>
      <P>I am pleased we have local government reform, we will implement the measures the Minister spoke about and I congratulate him as he is the only Minister who has had responsibility for the environment who has travelled the highways and byways to talk to every councillor who came his way to convince him or her of the necessity to introduce reform of local government. I congratulate him and the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, on the reform they have introduced on all aspects of local government. I believe that in the next few months we will all be singing from the same hymn sheet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little confused as I do not think we are talking about the same Bill. I have heard members of both Government parties talk <Col N="1217" /> about a Bill in respect of which responsibility has been handed back to the local representatives. That is not provided in that Bill; the opposite is happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senators opposite know that is the case. What strikes me most about this matter is that I know in their heart of hearts they all agree with this motion, but they are mandated to oppose it but the so-called grounds on which they do so do not exist. The provisions in that Bill will not hand responsibility back to the local representatives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with the Senator; I spoke to him outside the Chamber about this matter. He said the number of hours the GCC said local authority members work during the week is more than 19 hours &ndash; he said it is more than double that figure. He is effectively supporting this motion in saying the work being done by councillors should be remunerated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government should dust it off and give us a positive date for the implementation of such a measure and not tell us, as I heard every time I asked when a Bill to provide for the introduction of this measure would be before us, that it is will introduced in three weeks, four weeks or six weeks. That has been promised for the past two years. Once the Government informed local authority members it intended to remunerate them, it gave them that expectation and those people had a right that that expectation would be met.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, has been sent in here in the Minister's place and we have not heard why the Minister is not here. I looked through the Minister of State's speech and thought I would try to get a specific date for the introduction of this measure following which I and Fianna Fáil Senators will be able to tell councillors we have a date for the introduction of a Bill to provide for this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I guarantee the Senator we will have a date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no date for the introduction of a Bill to provide for that. So many dates <Col N="1218" /> have been put forward at this stage, it is getting to be like a TV comedy show.</P>
      <P>We tabled this motion because we strongly believe in the reform of local government and our belief in that predates the time of this Government. No Senator opposite should claim this Government introduced local government reform. It did not; it was introduced by the previous Government and the Government before that. However, this Government took the initiative and I always believed the Minister was one who believed in local government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing has happened in this area in terms of the Local Government Bill or during the past few years. I call on Senators opposite to point out what has happened and to tell me what extra responsibilities local authority members have; the opposite is the case. Local authorities were involved in tourism but that power was taken from them. I could spend the rest of the night talking about local authorities having been gradually denuded of responsibility. I am not saying that is the Government's fault, it is often the fault of the administration behind the Government who do not want local authorities to have responsibility, but the Government falls for that. The truth is, as was said by all speakers, that local authority members are at the coalface of democracy, they take the brunt when things go wrong. For that reason, we call on the Government to recompense them for their work and to reform local government by giving local authority members more responsibility.</P>
      <P>Senator Quill talked about the dual mandate. It is in place because it suits the Government, as it believes, on the basis of current percentages, that the dual mandate will result in more Government candidates being elected. That is the basis of it continuing to be in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>What responsibility or authority does that give to the chairperson of local authorities or to elected mayors? It gives them no additional responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
