      <P>I have received notice from Senator Jackman that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to assign extra Garda resources to Limerick, including the establishment of a Garda station in Castletroy.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ó Fearghail of the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment if in light of the imminent closure of the Peerless Rug plant, in Athy, County Kildare, with the loss of 65 jobs, she will consider establishing a special task force to promote job creation in the area.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Rory Kiely of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to ensure that cattle movement permits are issued by return of post on receipt of applications.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill, 1999 [<i>Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil</i>] &ndash; Report and Final Stages; No. 2, Sex Offenders Bill, 2000 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; and No. 15, motion 25, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and business, if not previously concluded, will resume thereafter. Business will be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, the business is agreed. We read today that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is shortly to bring forward proposals aimed at <Col N="1354" /> deregulating the licensed vintners trade. If this is the case, perhaps it would be appropriate for the Minister to come into the House, before or shortly after he publishes his proposals, to have a debate here. There are very far-reaching issues involved as the pub, for good or ill, is at the centre of much of Irish social life. There are questions of under age drinking and the possible losses incurred by people under deregulation due to the value of investments and so forth. As the issues are wide-ranging, it will help if the Minister comes into the House to explain what he proposes to do and gets the benefit of the views of the Members before the proposals are cast in stone.</P>
      <P>It is now almost five years since the country voted for divorce and I think the new regime has worked well. It would be appropriate, perhaps in the autumn, to have a debate on how the divorce legislation has worked over the past five years and whether there is a need for fundamental changes in the way it operates. Will the Deputy Leader pencil it in as a topic, which we can discuss with profit as soon as there is time available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. I previously raised with the Department of the Marine the issue of the <i>LE Deirdre</i>, on which a report is out today. Will the Deputy Leader request the appropriate Minister to come in and discuss the matter here? It is proposed that the ship will be sold for £200,000, but the top deck would be worth more in scrap value. We are the only country in Europe which I know of that does not have a maritime or ship museum. If one goes to London there is the HMS <i>Belfast</i>, the <i>Endeavour</i> is in Dundee and there is a number of ship museums in Portsmouth. When one goes to Boston, <i>The Constitution </i>is in the harbour. The £200,000 sale price would be picked up in two months of tourist trade, and I ask that this point be made to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation or the Minister for the Marine. If it is not sited in Dublin it can be put in the Spike Island museum or, with the new interest in navigation in Limerick city, it would be ideal along the docks in Limerick.</P>
      <P>This is part of our national heritage. There is too little interest in our maritime culture and very little interest in what our Naval Service has done. This is a great opportunity to have a tourist attraction which also celebrates part of our culture. It does not need to be in Dublin. Perhaps people who represent areas where there are ports might take an interest in this. Most of our ports have been done up since the new harbour authorities were set up by this House&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to Senator O'Toole that this would be a very appropriate matter for the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am expressing the view that this is not just a minor issue for the Dublin area. This <Col N="1355" /> ship could be sited anywhere. It could be a tourist attraction&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the matter could be raised more appropriately on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would consider that suggestion if I could get some indication of who the appropriate Minister is. Is it the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, or the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey? I ask that this matter be debated and that other Members of the House consider it. People with harbour authority interests should bear this in mind. We could look at all the options from Foynes to Ballylongford to Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Senator O'Toole would consider bringing it down to the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>He would then find out the relevance of the response.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo Senator Manning's comments on the recommendations on liquor licensing produced by the commission appointed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue. There are a lot of leftovers from the last legislation introduced by the Minister. The question of deregulation of off-licences and public house licences is a major part of that. This report was published at the same time as yesterday's report by the Higher Education Authority which attributes much of the reason for dropout rates in third level institutions to an inordinate amount of drinking among students, in addition to the money and time they spend on alcohol.</P>
      <P>This comes against the background of the report of the European survey on under age drinkers, which found that up to 89% of 15 to 16 year olds in Ireland were regular drinkers and that 69% of our 15 to 16 year olds had been drunk at some stage in the last 12 months. Clearly this raises issues about licensing, under age drinking and drinking in general. According to the statistics, we drink twice the European average. We need, therefore, a broad debate on the issue before the Minister introduces legislation on it. The Seanad is the obvious body to hold this debate because of the expertise available in this House, many Members having been involved in the trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent weeks a number of Senators have called for a debate to be held on education once things have settled down. Our examination system is unique among the European states. That fact, combined with approach of the leaving certificate examinations in a few weeks with all the <Col N="1356" /> stress that brings, makes this an opportune time to hold that debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange a wide-ranging debate on disability. Despite a serious shortage in the labour market, it appears that neither the public nor private sector is taking seriously the commitment to employ people with disability. New figures reveal that the proportion of people with disabilities employed in the public service is only 1.9% despite an agreement that up to 3% would be disabled people. Some 80% of disabled people are unemployed and it can no longer be argued that they can only be employed in certain areas. With modern technologies they are a major asset to a potential employer and serious consideration should be given to that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate what movement there has been on the local government Bill? It is crazy that a Bill published over a year ago has made very limited progress to date. Is there a likelihood that it will come before this House before the summer recess? The Bill contains many sections, much more than the provisions on the dual mandate. It also contains many positive reforms to local government. Has any progress been made or is the stand-off continuing? </P>
      <P>Will the Horse and Greyhound Racing Bill come before the House in the coming weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week the Environmental Protection Agency announced that it had tested 23 beaches for salmonella, four of which were found to be unsafe. Immediately afterwards it apologised and issued a statement saying that those four beaches are safe. The Minister should tell the House the steps he has taken to ensure such a thing will not happen again, and also that the Environmental Protection Agency will find a way to ensure those who use the beaches of Dollymount, Portmarnock, Portrane and Sutton can put their minds at rest. It needs action rather than words. An apology is fine but the Minister should tell the House that he has ensured the Environmental Protection Agency can guarantee this will not happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>A serious difficulty has recently arisen regarding sheep shearing. I am conscious of the expert way in which the foot and mouth crisis was handled by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh. However, a difficulty has arisen due to the regulations laid down by the expert group. Members from sheep farming areas are aware that sheep shearing has to be undertaken at this time each year and that the weather plays a major part in the process. Major difficulties have arisen as three days notice is needed before sheep shearing but one shower of rain can change everything and can mean that shearing must be put off for a day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" /> I ask the Deputy Leader to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. The expert group might relax the regulations in order that this necessary operation, particular to certain parts of the country, can proceed in a more relaxed fashion. Major difficulties exclusive to this annual operation are known only in those counties involved. There is a risk of a major outbreak of maggot disease and other diseases due to the regulations in place. I have received many representations on the issue which needs urgent attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the views expressed by Senator Manning on deregulation and the concerns about drink being widely available to young people. The Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business recently discussed the matter and saw grave dangers in a total liberalisation of the trade. We should proceed with caution. I support Senator Manning's request that the Minister come before the House as soon as possible, preferably before any legislation is cast in stone.</P>
      <P>I support the views of Senator O'Toole on his suggestion that a maritime museum be located at one of our harbours. I also support Senator Cosgrave's comments on the local government Bill, 2000, on which I asked a question yesterday in the light of the decision made in Killarney on Monday to which I did not receive an answer. Perhaps we might be enlightened this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like a debate on FÁS and its operations. There was veiled criticism recently in the OECD report, although this was appropriately answered. We should ventilate the subject. Senator Mooney spoke this morning of the situation in Leitrim where many are isolated once FÁS schemes end. We need to look again at the legislation governing FÁS in order that if there is a bar on the social aspect of this type of employment, we can rejig the legislation.</P>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's call for debate on the fate of the <i>LE Deirdre</i>. Numerous suggestions can be made and are frequently made from the back benches of the House, including from Senator Quinn, although he missed his opportunity today. I suggest the State take over the <i>LE Deirdre</i> for use as Ireland's first presidential yacht. This would obviate the awkwardness of the President's situation where she must seek planning permission for a holiday home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise matters dealt with at the Irish Planning Institute conference in Kilkenny on Monday and the views expressed by the institute on the overall aspect of planning within the national spatial plan. Yesterday's statement by the Minster of State with responsibility for rural development, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, is in contrast with what was said at the conference in Kilkenny. How we are to progress with planning and housing in rural Ireland needs to be debated in an overall context. There are a lot of <Col N="1358" /> contradictions about which the public are very concerned. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, should be invited to this House to have a discussion on how we approach this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the issue which Senator Finneran raised on the regulations governing sheep shearing in the light of the foot and mouth scare. The regulations are draconian in that they have delayed significantly the commencement of shearing and are restrictive in the way in which it can be carried out. It is an enormous cruelty to leave sheep to carry a full fleece given the warm weather which we have been having. There is also an unpleasant pest strike that they can suffer as well. This is something which might not be taken seriously but it certainly ought to be.</P>
      <P>We already have had a comprehensive debate on broadcasting, but in the light of the director general of RTÉ appearing at the Joint Committee on Heritage and Irish language yesterday I call for a further debate on the future of broadcasting. The debate should look at issues such as the nature of public service broadcasting. While the director general replied to some questions on that, I felt that it was inadequate. We welcome his announcement that the veil of secrecy that has covered the payment of salaries and expenses to well-known broadcasters is to be lifted. That is something which could be revisited in the debate. The dissemination of Irish broadcasting around the world could also be discussed. Modern technology such as the Internet and satellite broadcasting are used. Nevertheless Ireland does not have a short-wave broadcast service, unlike most other countries, some of which are much smaller and poorer than us. Will the Deputy Leader agree to such a debate at an early time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a day long debate on education. Senator Costello called for the debate and I have also called for it on a number of occasions. I ask that the Cromien report and the report of the NCCA be given a day long debate. It is well overdue. In his excellent report on the Department of Education and Science, Sean Cromien described the Department as a place where the urgent and the topical often displaced that which is important. I do not think we would like that to be said about any other institution of State.</P>
      <P>Education is fundamentally important and it is a long time since we had a thorough debate on it in this House. I ask that this session not be allowed to conclude without having a full day dedicated specifically to these education reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I asked for a debate on public disorder. This morning Senator Manning has brought up the issue of deregulation of the drinks trade. If we had a discussion on public disorder we would find out whether or not there should be deregulation. It is in this House, and not in commissions, that we will find what is best <Col N="1359" /> for the country. We are public representatives and I find it most disturbing that we are to set up another commission to investigate something on behalf of the Government. It is in these Houses that we can find out exactly what is happening. I have been a long time in the drinks trade and we should not put the cart before the horse in debating deregulation before we debate public disorder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call from Senator Chambers for a debate on housing. I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, on his statement. I thought he was brilliant. A lot of building in rural Ireland in prohibited and inhibited by self-appointed experts living in this city. It is time members of rural communities spoke out and I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, did so on their behalf.</P>
      <P>I request a debate on motor insurance and road safety. It was reported on radio yesterday that a number of drunken drivers pass across toll bridges late at night and in the early hours of the morning. What is the Garda Síochána doing about this type of behaviour? It is not acceptable that inebriated persons should be able to drive along the M50. Most of us are obliged to pay an additional £100 in motor insurance costs because of the number of people who do not have insurance. Traffic wardens should be given permission to check tax and insurance and to report cars that are not taxed or insured. Uninsured cars should be seized on the spot. A great deal is often said about young drivers being penalised, but it is those who drive without insurance who should be penalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have called on a number of occasions for a debate on disability, particularly in the absence of the disability legislation which we had hoped would come before the House during this session. It is a major disappointment that this will not happen. Many issues relating to this matter have been identified, primary among which is that of employment. People with disabilities undoubtedly have skills which are not being used and it is dreadful that they are willing and able to work but are not being approached by many employers, particularly those within the public service. We must address this matter.</P>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on education and the Cromien report, to which Senator Quill referred. We have been promised such a debate, which is long overdue. It would be timely to have that debate, particularly as the examination season is upon us again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senators Keogh and Quill in their call for a debate on education and the Cromien report. I hope the Leader or the Deputy Leader will arrange to hold such a debate during this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also request a debate on tourism, the marketing thereof and the details of what took place at <Col N="1360" /> the Cabinet meeting in Killarney. Many people have lost a great deal of money as a result of the foot and mouth disease crisis and it would be appropriate for the House to have a debate on this matter. It will be too late to do so when the session concludes. This is a matter of immediate importance and the Leader should arrange a debate at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the call for a debate on the Cromien report, a worthwhile document that should be debated by the House at length. In conjunction with that report, we could also discuss the new commission which has been established to oversee educational welfare, school attendance etc. The latter is extremely important in terms of the restructuring of the Department.</P>
      <P>On many occasions I have requested a debate on the housing strategy. In light of the recent planning conference which highlighted defects in the system, we should also investigate the role of An Bord Pleanála. We have a golden opportunity to debate the housing strategy, incorporated in which could be a discussion on how planning applications are granted and how An Bord Pleanála can perhaps work against us in terms of how it does its business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning, Costello, Coghlan and Dino Cregan referred to the deregulation of the licensed trade. This matter is worthy of debate and I share the view that the House has an input to make into issues of this nature. Increasingly, however, our opinion is considered secondary to that of an expert group established to discuss such matters. The House should debate this issue and I will see if time can be made available at the earliest opportunity prior to the issuing of the detailed proposals and regulations.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello also raised the issue of the responsible use of alcohol. Senator Farrell and others spoke about that in the context of road safety and insurance. I am aware of and do not deny the relationship between alcohol abuse and the dropout rate in colleges. It is one of the undesirable by-products of the Celtic tiger that there appears to be a great deal of money available to young people with which to buy drink. That said, they appear to be much more responsible in their use of motor vehicles than our generation. When it comes to consuming alcohol, it appears that they do not drive vehicles when drunk, whereas the culture 30 years ago was very much one where people drove while drunk. I do not deny that there is still a problem with drunken driving and that should be dealt with, as Senator Farrell recommended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statistics regarding alcohol cited by Senator Coghlan related to beer. The consumption of beer among younger people is high by European standards, but I am not so sure total alcohol consumption is high compared to coun<Col N="1361" /> tries such as France where a great deal of wine is consumed.</P>
    <P>I noted some comments in the papers in recent days regarding divorce and the operation of divorce legislation. Some of the fears expressed when this matter was discussed in the Houses have proved to be unfounded, certainly in respect of the numbers seeking divorce. I agree with Senator Manning that it is a subject we should spend some time discussing when we return in the autumn.</P>
    <P>Senators Coghlan, O'Toole and Norris spoke about the <i>LE Deirdre.</i> Coming from the middle of the country, perhaps I am one of those about whom Senator O'Toole spoke who have little interest in marine matters. I am sure significant costs would be associated with restoring the vessel and using it as a museum. Nevertheless, the proposal is worthy of consideration and I will bring it to the attention of the relevant Minister, bearing in mind the Cathaoirleach's advice that this issue, along with others raised, would be appropriate to the Adjournment&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Senator seek promotion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;or to a Private Members' motion. Senators Costello, Quill, Keogh, Burke and Ormonde spoke about education and there has been a recurring call for a debate. It is something we should dispose of as early as possible. I agree it is a good time to do it in light of the Cromien report and the fact that exams will take place soon. I will have a detailed discussion with the Leader on his return to see what can be done in this context.</P>
      <P>Senators Kett and Keogh raised the issue of disability. I agree strongly with the Senators about the need to have more disabled people in full-time employment. Steps have been taken to improve the position but it needs further improvement. There are certain legal obligations. We have enacted legislation in recent years which imposes obligations of which employers and others should be conscious. People with a disability who are capable of making a full and useful input into society should be enabled to do that and it is not good enough that they are excluded in many cases.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senators Cosgrave and Coghlan, I understand from the Taoiseach's reply in the other House yesterday that Second Stage of the local government Bill is to resume when the Houses return after the referendums. The Taoiseach expressed the hope it would be finished by the time we rise in summer. That is my understanding of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>I am not sure when it is expected the Horse and Greyhound Racing Bill will be <Col N="1362" /> debated in the Seanad, but I will report back to the Senator on that matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn referred to the Environmental Protection Agency and the quality of water on beaches. It is wrong that something such as this should happen but the EPA has a very good record in this respect. It has highlighted many issues which might not otherwise have been highlighted, something which has, perhaps, led to a general improvement in the environment. That said, I take the point the Senator made. It is well founded and I will bring it to the attention of the appropriate people.</P>
      <P>Senators Finneran and Connor raised a serious issue, namely, the difficulties caused by the sheep shearing regulations, especially where a voluntary effort is made rather than people doing it on a commercial basis. Notwithstanding the fact that we have not had a foot and mouth case since March, there are still several instances of the disease in England. As there are outbreaks in Yorkshire and Lancashire there remains a requirement for vigilance. However some procedures are necessary to ensure shearing can go ahead on an orderly and proper basis and I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister. I am sure the expert group will bear the Senator's comments in mind.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris raised the question of FÁS schemes. We must welcome the most recent unemployment figures of 3.7%. As recently as five years ago we would not have believed these figures were possible. The figure for Dublin is 2.6%. This is not to say the issue raised by the Senator is not an important one.</P>

      <P>Yes. I accept what the Senator says about rural areas. The matter was highlighted this morning by the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed which spoke about gaps in training and the inaccessibility of training in rural areas. The Senator's point is a reasonable one and I will see what can be done about it. Some other matters raised by the Senator are in the realm of surrealism. I will pass those by.</P>

      <P>The Irish Planning Institute was referred to by Senators Chambers, Farrell and Ormonde. I agree with what the Senators have to say about the difficulties of building in rural areas. When the local government Bill comes <Col N="1363" /> before the House it would be appropriate to discuss some of these issues. Major planning legislation was debated in the House recently when many points were made about An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor raised the question of public service broadcasting. These issues can be debated in the House but they might more appropriately be dealt with by the committee which has responsibility for them and where they were discussed yesterday.</P>
      <P>The question of public order raised by Senator Dino Cregan relates to the matter of alcohol to which I have referred. The Public Order Act has been used very effectively in my area to break up disorderly crowds and even small groups of youths. The legislation is in place. However the Senator is correct when he says the opinion of the House is important. This should be evident.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell spoke about insurance and road safety. It is not desirable that people who are compliant with the law must bear the cost of those who are not. The existing law has very strong powers and one hopes they are used.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke spoke about tourism. On Monday, the Government announced an allocation of £2 million for tourism promotion. President Clinton's visit has been useful in promoting Ireland in the United States. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation reported to the House when we discussed the foot and mouth crisis. This is a matter to which the House can return later.</P>

      <P>Tugadh <Col N="1364" /> an Bille seo isteach sa tSeanad i Mí na Nollag 1999. Ar an lá céanna shínigh an Taoiseach dearbhú Chonradh Aoine an Chéasta, dearbhú a chuir nua-Altanna 2 agus 3 i bhfeidhm sa Bhunreacht. As you outlined, a Chathaoirligh, the Bill was introduced in the Seanad on the same day that the Taoiseach signed the order for the Good Friday Agreement which put Articles 2 and 3 in force into the Constitution. De bharr na nua-Altanna sin níor mhiste leasaithe a dhéanamh ar Achtanna náisiúntachta agus saoránachta na hÉireann. Sin atá mar phríomh aidhm ar an mBille seo. Chomh maith leis sin, déanann an Bille ath-chóirithe tábhachtacha eile ar na hAchtanna sin. There was a very extensive debate in the House on the Bill agus ritheadh é i Mí Feabhra 2000.</P>
      <P>Is é atá i gceist inniu, cúpla leasú teicniúil, ó thaobh dréachtóireachta a phlé, leasaithe a rinneadh sa Dáil. I have to put before the House a couple of technical amendments made in the Dáil. Senators will recall that it was passed on 9 February and these amendments are of a drafting and technical nature.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 to section 2 corrects a drafting oversight and ensures the reference at section 2(<i>c</i>) to the definition of &ldquo;naturalised Irish citizen&rdquo; in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, is correctly cited.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2, which is technical in nature, is for the purpose of ensuring consistency of language in expressing the periods of residence required for naturalisation as between the new naturalisation scheme for spouses of Irish citizens and its parallel in the existing section 15 of the 1956 Act. The language of the new section 15A(1)(<i>f</i>), as it originally appeared in the Bill, did not mirror precisely the language of section 15(1)(<i>c</i>) of the existing Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, to the extent that they both deal with the period of one year's residence immediately before an application for naturalisation is made. The amendment aligns the language of the two provisions. Molaim an dá athrú sin don Teach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no difficulty with these two amendments which, as the Minister of State said, are technical in nature. They improve the Bill in terms of absolute definition. There was a lengthy debate on the legislation in the House at a time when I was my party's spokesperson on justice and equality matters. One can take some satisfaction from the fact that when the Bill went to the Dáil it was returned to us, after a very comprehensive debate in the Lower House, in the same form, barring these two minor technical amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our dissatisfaction was that the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill did not go quite as far as we would have liked. We felt it should have addressed issues such as asylum and immigration. However the legislation was introduced because of that part of the Good Friday Agreement which guarantees Irish citizenship to people on this <Col N="1365" /> island in that they can opt to be Irish or British citizens as they so wish.</P>
    <P>We were delighted that the legislation removed the term &ldquo;alien&rdquo; from Irish citizenship law. It was an offensive term and was rightly removed from the Bill. We welcome the legislation which has been a long time coming. If I remember correctly, the Bill was passed by the House as long ago as February 2000. The legislation was a long time in the Lower House and we had hoped it would have found its way onto the Statute Book a good deal sooner but better late than never.</P>

      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn is unfortunately ill and unable to be present. I hope that the presence of Senator Connor and myself will be acceptable to the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>There is concern about the age differential in section 3(3), which provides for an exemption from the notification requirement where the person guilty of the offence was aged not more than three years older than the other person involved. Two years older would be a sufficient gap and I ask the Minister of State to consider the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1366" />
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I cannot support the amendment. Three years is a reasonable length of time. The intention is to protect young people from being coerced into sex with those who are considerably older and who would have great influence on them or who could even be seen to be in a position of authority. Since we are constantly told that boys mature much later than girls, three years is reasonable in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Keogh for moving the amendment. The aim of the age differential is to draw a distinction between sexual activity taking place between young people of a broadly similar age and cases where one person is significantly older than the other or where an abuse of authority or trust may be involved. As a generality, I would put it no more precisely than that. Child abuse is indicative of the existence of an unequal relationship of power between the child and the older person but that would not be the case where the parties involved are teenage peers.</P>
      <P>The proposal in section 3(3) is that consensual teenage sexual activity where the victim is aged between 15 and 17 years and the other party to the offence is not more than three years older than the victim should be exempted from the notification requirements. Where an offence has been committed in such circumstances and the sentence is non-custodial, it is almost certainly as part of a consensual relationship that does not imply that the offender represents any future danger.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to know what the right age difference should be, that is, if there is a right or wrong age difference because essentially it is a value judgment with all the relevant circumstances having been considered. However, there are two important points to bear in mind. First, we do not wish to place on the register the names of young persons involved in a relationship among peers and, second, if the Bill is to be effective, it must be practical and have regard to social realities.</P>
      <P>My concern is that we will not expose a young person who engages in sexual intercourse with a willing and socially mature partner of broadly similar age to a notification requirement aimed at paedophiles and serious sex offenders when that young person does not fall into either category. The age limits which attract the exemption in this area are, to some extent, necessarily arbitrary. If the amendment proposed by Senator Keogh was accepted the effect would be to potentially expose an 18 year old partner of a 15 year old teenager to the notification requirement, with all that entails. I consider that the three year age gap proposed in the Bill represents a more realistic difference in age having regard to the purpose of the Bill. Where the girl is under 15 years of age the other party will be included in the register regardless of his age or the age difference. The exemption in this respect only applies where the girl is 15 or 16 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1367" /> It is worth bearing in mind that this exemption does not affect the criminal offences concerned such as defilement of a girl aged between 15 and 17 years. These remain criminal offences regardless of the age of the perpetrator. It is only the requirement to notify that is affected. There appears to be general acceptance of the need for these exemptions. We are simply discussing the question of the age difference. For the reasons I have explained, I consider that the balance lies with three years and appreciate Senator Henry's support on the matter. I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I also oppose the amendment for some of the reasons the Minister of State has outlined but those very reasons should give us pause to consider the operation of the Bill in these terms. I have always believed, for example, that a far better way of dealing with these issues is the principle of consent. I am aware that is awkward because it would have to go to a court and a judge, or some kind of panel, would have to determine whether consent actually existed but the Minister of State said it all when she said that any of these lines are arbitrarily drawn, and when these lines are arbitrarily drawn there will be cases where moral injustice or damage is done to young people.</P>
      <P>I notice the Minister of State referred to the girl under 15 years but this is not confined to girls. There is no recognition or understanding of the whole area of gay sexuality in the Bill and my experience of this area, in founding counselling organisations and so on, is that whether society likes it very frequently and, in most cases, viewed positively by the subject, a young gay man's experience is in partnership with somebody who is some years older and seen by the younger person as a secure and reassuring entry into the full expression of sexuality. I do not believe there is any understanding of this fact in the Bill because the Minister of State simply referred to &ldquo;a girl&rdquo; and that is the way in which people think. They do not accept the area of gay sexuality at all.</P>
      <P>Even the language in which many of these matters are couched is questionable. The Minister of State spoke about the defilement of a girl. This, presumably, is something that can take place with or without consent because the girl is under a certain age. Is this language we should accept in the 21st century as appropriate to describe a consensual sexual relationship, even though I accept that parents may be concerned because of a difference in age or because they believe their child, young woman or young man, is too young to have any experience of sexuality? There is a whole area therefore that has not been taken into account by those framing the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's amendment, No. 18, appears to be in the same area &ndash; I am surprised it is not linked but I am sure there is a technical reason for this &ndash; where it specifies prison terms for persons found guilty of sexual assault and so <Col N="1368" /> on. If somebody is under the age of 17 years, regardless of whether there is consent, in legal terms it is defined as an assault. No consent can be deemed possible by a person under a certain age so a situation may arise where the relationship is perceived by the two parties engaged in it as consenting, yet the law describes it as assault and defilement and apportions severe penalties in terms of imprisonment or the social stigma of being added to a register.</P>
    <P>I accept the enormous public concern about this issue, especially because so much tragic information has been given to the public in the area of paedophilia. The Minister of State used the word appropriately but unfortunately often in these discussions it is not used appropriately and people assume that certain types of behaviour of which they disapprove are paedophilia when they are not. I am against the idea of arbitrary age considerations and in favour of a principle of consent. Since that appears not to be available I support the Minister of State's view.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State and her advisers to bear in mind this area. I do not ask them to necessarily take what I say as fact but to contact those agencies that deal with young people with troubled sexuality, especially young people in the gay community who are coming to understand their sexuality. I also ask them to listen to what the people who deal with young people in this area have to say. Surprising conclusions may emerge which might affect the way these legislative provisions are framed in the future. I welcome the Minister of State's indication that this may be possible and that in future when such legislation is being framed these kinds of contacts will be made. As it is, a whole area of human sexuality is totally ignored in the consideration of this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Senator Norris's point of view but we have not totally ignored gay sex in this legislation. I considered heterosexual and homosexual sex in the context of the Bill. At any given time society makes judgments, and arguing about consent on a case by case basis is extraordinarily difficult. The Senator will recall that we discussed this area some years ago when we considered the age of consent for homosexual and heterosexual sex. Children mature at different ages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I said the same thing then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct and I do not accuse the Senator of being boring or repetitious because what he says is very important in that he can provide us with an insight into the thinking in an area where most of us do not have as much access. However, we must recognise that at any given time society makes decisions which reflect the best we can do. For example, it was not long ago &ndash; it was certainly the case at the beginning of the last century &ndash; that 12 was the age of consent for girls, yet nobody today would suggest <Col N="1369" /> that this was appropriate. Most legislation in other countries has raised the age of consent to 14 or 15 years.</P>
      <P>Many of these provisions concerning girls were made for practical reasons because they were too young for motherhood. The dangers of becoming pregnant for physical reasons were so severe that the age of consent was continually raised. It was not raised simply for moral reasons or on the basis that girls were not in a position to properly give consent. The situation is more difficult when it is applied to boys.</P>
      <P>The legislation strikes the right balance. Of course some children will mature sooner than others and will be in a better position to consent to sex but the legislation is drafted as well as possible. The Bill should be passed with this provision intact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise the Minister of State is being reasonable in this regard. As she said, it is difficult at that stage to differentiate between two and three years. Others have made the point, which should be borne in mind, that people mature at different ages. Having listened to the various arguments, I am content to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to comment on that. I accept that my position will not be advanced very much by this debate, but I would ask the Minister of State and her advisers to be particularly sensitive where gay sexuality is concerned and to make the kind of contacts I have suggested.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry referred to girls and women. The whole concept of gay sexuality was left out of her contribution entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Senator Henry mentioned it, but only after I referred to it, and subsequently she retreated to the subject of girls.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to public opinion and society making decisions. Society is a very complex organism. Nobody who listens to the radio or reads the newspaper can be unaware of the fact that young people of 14, 15 and 16 years &ndash; schoolgoers &ndash; seem to be routinely engaging in sexual activity, not necessarily full sexual activity. I am concerned about any measures that would marginalise young men and women, either by putting them on a list as sex offenders or by subjecting them to terms of imprisonment.</P>
      <P>I am simply sounding an alarm bell warning that the Bill must reflect the reality of society as a whole and not merely consist of the aspirations of an older generation. It must reflect the reality of young people who are sexually active, whether they are heterosexual or homosexual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I reassure Senator Norris that young men are dealt with in section 3(3)(<i>b</i>), which stipulates that they will be treated in the <Col N="1370" /> same way as young girls aged between 15 and 17 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of being an offence, which I think is Senator Norris's original question, it is in the Bill. We are not talking about changing the criminal law regarding such offences and a register. The question of consent will be examined when the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences is being considered further. Just as Senator Norris spoke of the appropriate use of words, the message today is that we should have the appropriate use of the register, which is designed to work against paedophiles and sex offenders. I thank Senator Keogh for withdrawing her amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 37, after &ldquo;conviction&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or the date found guilty but insane&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There are two criteria concerning the Bill that must be satisfied &ndash; that the offender must be convicted and found guilty but insane. I know from amendment No. 2, moved on behalf of Senator Taylor-Quinn, that those words do not occur. Therefore, &ldquo;or the date found guilty but insane&rdquo; should be inserted after &ldquo;the date of conviction&rdquo; in section 6. If we are to have people on a register, it would be an omission if these words were not included. Will the Minister of State respond?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Although an insanity finding is, in law, a verdict of acquittal, persons found to be guilty but insane of a sexual offence are included in the scope of the Bill. Research shows that sex <Col N="1371" /> offenders legally classified as mentally disordered are slightly more likely to re-offend than other sex offender groups. The Senator will notice that the definition of &ldquo;conviction&rdquo; in section 2 includes a finding of guilty but insane. Therefore, the amendments are unnecessary as the matters they are addressing are already catered for in the Bill. I will not accept them.</P>

      <P>The period for which the person is subject to requirements must be tightened up. Amendment No. 5 concerns the deletion of &ldquo;2 years&rdquo;. Therefore, subsection (3)(<i>a</i>) would read: &ldquo;an indefinite duration if the sentence imposed on the person in respect of the offence concerned is one of imprisonment for life or for a term of more than 6 months.&rdquo;. Consequently, as indicated in amendment No. 6, section (3)(<i>b</i>) would read: &ldquo;10 years if the sentence imposed on the person in respect of the offence concerned is one of imprisonment for life or for a term of 6 months or less.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment 8 requires that &ldquo;7 years&rdquo; be substituted in the place of &ldquo;5 years&rdquo; in subsection 3(<i>d</i>). We are looking for safeguarding measures.</P>

      <P>These amendments propose to reduce the severity of the sentence required before a person becomes liable for the relevant period for notification. With regard to amendment No. 5, a lifetime notification requirement would apply following a six-month prison sentence, instead of a two-year sentence, as is in the Bill. The provisions in the Bill in this respect are, to some extent, arbitrary in that deciding on the particular durations is not an exact science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two major concerns have directly influenced the proposals for the Bill. First, we looked at the English durations, took them as a base line and <Col N="1372" /> examined them to see if they were appropriate for Ireland. In other words, could we justify the imposition of different durations? The only change that could be justified using that yardstick was to reduce of the 2.5-year prison sentence for lifetime notification requirement to two years. This was done to bring cases within the jurisdiction of the District Court in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Second, and more importantly, we had to have regard to proportionality &ndash; a concept developed over recent years by our courts. The balance between sentence and the notification obligation is about right, and to extend that obligation, as proposed in the amendments, could stretch that balance to breaking point.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that we, as legislators, should decide what the courts should do. It may also be argued that the principle of proportionality is inherent in the amendments. It is here in the sense of the notification requirement, where a six month sentence is handed down and is greater than where the sentence is for less than six months. However, that is not necessarily what the courts had in mind when they introduced into Irish constitutional law, in the case of Cox <i>v.</i> Ireland, 1992, the notion of proportionality between offence and penal consequence. That was extended in the case of Lovett and the Minister for Education in 1997, which applied the notion of proportionality, by particular reference to the statutory objectives sought to be achieved, to consequences which would limit a citizen's constitutional rights and were sought to be applied as a secondary consequence of criminal conviction. What all that means by reference to the amendments is that a constitutional issue is involved and I am satisfied that acceptance of the amendments could upset the balance so carefully achieved in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill already provides a mechanism whereby persons with a lifetime notification requirement can apply to the court to have that requirement lifted, ten years after their release from prison. That indicates how seriously the notion of proportionality must be taken. I can understand the reason Senator Keogh put it forward but, for the reasons explained, I will not be able to accept it.</P>

      <P>Can I ask the Minister a question in relation to this? Forgive me if I am not as familiar as I might be. If there has been an offence with a sentence of two years or less, and the person subsequently re-offends, what will be the result of that and will they automatically go on to a lifetime on the register?</P>

      <P>This is an eminently sensible amendment as such information should be available. There is a later amendment on access to the register by the Garda Síochána. We are specifying that it would be the Garda Commissioner who would be informed in this instance. It is essential that there is an awareness of the whereabouts of the offender.

    </Speaker>
    <P>In order that the fullest amount of information would be available, the issue of fingerprints and a signed photograph attached is a very valuable way of having information on a particular offender.

      <P>I would have thought these were useful amendments, in that it would be more specific as to who the person was, particularly in a country where so many of us tend to have the same names. There are quite a few Mary Henrys running around the countryside, and there would be John Byrnes, and maybe even Helen Keoghs and John Connors and John Cregans. It would be an extra useful method of identifying people and it would also prevent the false identification of people, particularly if there were photographs. We have seen problems in England since their register was set up, with the false identification and people really having the most unpleasant time from vigilantes, before they were rescued by the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a slightly different view from the previous speakers. The whole purpose of the Bill is to ensure that people notify the relevant authorities, and I think they are far more likely to notify them simply by having their names and addresses on the register. Fingerprinting and photographing might be going too far as people would fear that the photograph might appear at some stage in the future and we would be back to the situation which we are trying to prevent. The confidentiality of the register is the important element and people would not have easy access to it. I am against the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms. Hanafin Ms. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks to place two additional requirements on convicted sex offenders when they are fulfilling their notification obligations, providing photographs and having fingerprints taken. We are not aware that these obligations are used in any other jurisdiction. In preparing the provision relating to the information that a convicted sex offender would have to supply when registering, we were very conscious of the British and Northern Irish requirements in that respect, and the high compliance rates of up to 97% in those jurisdictions. There is a direct link between the two. Whatever about our own notions on sex offenders, their devious nature and heinous crimes, it would be counterproductive to persecute or demonise them at a time when they may be making an effort to avoid further offending and indeed the temptations to reoffending. There is a direct and verifiable link between the amount of information required to be notified and the compliance rate, and in the final analysis it is the compliance rate that is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the non-punitive context of this provision, it is important to ensure that the actual notification system is easy to comply with and is one that will not frighten off sex offenders from notifying the Garda. Any fear, however unfounded or irrational, of say photographs given at the time of notification being made public would lessen the compliance rate and therefore the benefits of the <Col N="1375" /> notification system. The Minister is at present preparing legislation under which the Garda would have power to photograph any person who is arrested. In addition, any person on whom a prison sentence is imposed has their photograph taken, and in the case of those serving long sentences, the photographs can be re-taken closer to the release date and these can be made available to the Garda. This is a better of way of dealing with the question of photographs than picking out one group of offenders in the way proposed. With regard to offenders from abroad, photographs can be made available through normal police channels.</P>
    <P>The argument can be made that persons can change their appearance and that old photographs might not bear a resemblance to their current appearance. While that is true, the photographs available to the Garda would be recent. It is also the case that even after registering, persons could significantly change their appearance whether a photograph was supplied.</P>
    <P>Other considerations aside, I see no particular benefit in persons being required to give fingerprints when registering. Regardless of whether it is the intention, the amendments would require an offender to provide a photograph and have his or her fingerprints taken every time he or she notifies the Garda in accordance with the Bill.</P>
    <P>The reservations concerning the amendments are based on the firm belief, supported by evidence in other countries, that the less information that has to be notified the more likely it is that the person concerned will comply with the notification requirements. I remind Senators of the compliance figure of 97% in Britain and Northern Ireland. It would be far better to have a very high compliance rate based on the provisions in the Bill than a significantly lower percentage where photographs are supplied and fingerprints taken.</P>
    <P>I remind Senators that as soon as the Bill is enacted the analysis of the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences will take place and if the need for changes to the law is identified Government approval will be sought to prepare the necessary legislation. By then this Bill will have been in operation long enough for any weaknesses that could only be identified from experience gained from its operation to be rectified. If, for example, experience showed that the need for photographs to be produced at the time of registration outweighed the desirability for a very high compliance rate, this could be looked at as part of the review. For these reasons, I do not propose to accept the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little surprised at the Minister of State's comments. Offenders should comply with requirements. I question whether making it mandatory to give fingerprints and supply a recent photograph would frighten people off. As the Minister of State said that photographs would be available anyway, I fail to see what the big <Col N="1376" /> problem is. More mistakes can be made by having names bandied about than having adequate information available on offenders. None of the information should be made public unless an individual behaves in breach of the requirements.</P>
      <P>We want complete information made available about persons who are subject to the requirements. We do not want to demonise them but are calling for an acceptable and normal amount of information to be made available. Nobody objects, for instance, to calls for the introduction of identity cards for young people to tackle under age drinking. There is nothing extraordinary in making people readily identifiable by photograph as well as by signature.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State cited the case of Northern Ireland and Britain. The question is whether the requirement to supply a photograph makes any difference to compliance rates. I do not know what they are in countries where photographs are required. Having both a photograph and fingerprints would provide a more complete information kit about offenders. If people are willing to comply with the requirements, they will not be demonised in any sense but better information will be available. It is unlikely that an offender will move so often that the requirement to provide information each time an offender moves will be a great burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice in support of my colleague, Senator Keogh. I belong to the category of strong defender of people's personal and civil rights. I am no great supporter of overweening intrusion of the State into people's private and personal lives. However we are dealing with people who have been convicted of serious offences. These sexual offenders are very often inclined to move around because it is in the devious nature of their activity to do so. Initially therefore the register should contain a photograph. A fingerprint or other DNA evidence of identity should also be lodged with the Garda. If they move around the requirement to report should mean that they provide at least a signed photograph at any new location. Fingerprinting or the submission of other DNA evidence will only be necessary once in a lifetime.</P>
      <P>I see the Minister of State's point with regard to the very high compliance rate of up to 97% in other jurisdictions. However the law requires compliance and such levels should be achieved in all domains, not only in respect of sexual offences.</P>
      <P>There have been instances of tabloid newspapers using identity photographs of sex offenders to target people by telling readers that a certain sex beast is coming to live in their midst. Everyone deplores this. There is a risk that photographs given to the police can be leaked to people in certain journalistic circles who like to sensationalise these stories and it appears that there is an insatiable appetite for this kind of journalism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1377" /> The amendment should be taken more seriously because there is a great fear among the general public of offenders who move around. It is often in the nature of their activity to be highly mobile. Stricter reporting procedures should be laid down in the Bill. At the risk of repeating myself, while the Minister of State and her officials justify their position by using figures showing compliance with similar requirements in other jurisdictions I, as a defender of personal rights, believe we should go further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not aware of any other jurisdiction which requires the use of photographs and fingerprints. It is important to remember that although they are obliged to notify, the people concerned have served their sentence and are therefore free and no longer felons. Our concern with compliance is mainly due to the psychological fear on the part of sex offenders that their photograph might appear in the public domain. A name is just a name but a photograph is of oneself. If in the follow-up discussions on the paper on the law on sexual offences we find that photographs are needed in the application and enforcement of the register we will re-examine the matter. For now we will follow other jurisdictions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 11, subsection (7), between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f2&gt;d)is detained in hospital and is medically certified as being incapable of complying with the notification requirements of this Part.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a reasonable amendment. We are discussing section 10(7) which reads:</P>
      <P>For the purpose of determining any period for the purposes of subsection (1), (2), (3), (4), there shall be disregarded any time when the person concerned is:</P>
      <P>(f2&gt;a)remanded in custody, </P>

    <P>(f2&gt;c)temporarily released under section 2 or 3 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>The amendment concerns persons detained in hospital and medically certified as being incapable of complying with notification requirements. This could easily happen and it is unfair that a person would be discriminated against in this way if they were ill and unable to comply with notification requirements. We must be reasonable when we talk of compliance. We have spoken about photographs. The Minister was concerned about compliance and about frightening people off, but we must also be as open as possible to ensure that people can comply with the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10(7) of the Bill provides that when determining the time that the notification requirement starts, certain periods can be disregarded. These are the time a person is remanded in custody, the time spent in prison or the time spent on temporary release. If a person serves five years in prison, the lifetime notification will commence seven days after his or her release. If the person is sentenced to nine months in prison, the ten-year notification requirement commences seven days following release.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to stop the clock during the time an offender might be in hospital and is incapable of complying with a notification requirement due to illness etc. The periods that can be disregarded, as set out in section 10(7), are all related to the offender's relationship at a given time to aspects of the criminal justice system. These include being remanded in custody or serving a prison sentence. They are easily definable and understood periods during which the clock stands still as far as the notification requirement is concerned.</P>
      <P>Being in hospital is less definite and adds a level of subjectivity into the process. Also, the offender may not wish the doctor to know that he or she has a notification obligation as a sex offender, or because of a severe medical condition, he or she may be incapable of informing the doctor of the obligation.</P>
      <P>There are other practical difficulties with the amendment such as when the doctor would have to certify the offender as being unfit to comply, and at what point that certification would be lifted. It would be normal practice to excuse an offender who did not comply with reporting to the Garda while on temporary release from prison &ndash; for example, where evidence of detention was produced. I have no reason to believe that gardaí will not exercise similarly appropriate discretion in the case of offenders, subject to the notification requirements. To do otherwise would risk wasting court time with unnecessary prosecutions for non-compliance.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 19, subsection (1), between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;mentally impaired' has the meaning assigned to it by section 5 of the Act of 1993;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The area covering the provision of information for employment purposes is one of the most useful parts of the Bill. During the Second Stage debate, I pointed out that for many years schools in England had a register for sexual offenders. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children has rightly stated that this register was voluntary and not statutory. However, it has been very useful in England and this part of the current Bill is also useful. Those with children in their care should have a choice about whether to employ those who have committed previous offences in this area.</P>
      <P>This section is in the Bill because we consider some people to be vulnerable. We must agree that mentally impaired persons can be vulnerable also. The mentally impaired have been included in most other sections of legislation that deal with sexual offences. The section in which a definition was given in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993 was particularly good and I ask that this section be taken as the definition in this case. Section 5 of that Act reads:</P>
      <P>In this section &ldquo;mentally impaired&rdquo; means suffering from a disorder of the mind, whether through mental handicap or illness, which is of such a nature or degree as to render a person incapable of living an independent life, or of guarding against serious exploitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The phrase, &ldquo;guarding against serious exploitation,&rdquo; is most important for the present debate. <Col N="1380" /> The mentally impaired can be seriously exploited. If the offender has exploited children or mentally impaired people in the past, we would be wise to include them in this section of the Bill. If offenders were to take up employment where mentally impaired people were involved, the prospective employer should be informed.</P>

      <P>I welcome the comments of Senator Henry and I ask the Minister of State to accept the amendment. Senator Henry raised this point at Second Stage and I felt obliged to support her view. We are all conscious that when people are considered for employment with children, notification is necessary to protect those children. We must also remember that many mentally impaired people have innocent minds as children do, and we should recognise that in the legislation. I have no hesitation in asking the Minister to accept the amendment because we must be conscious at all times of the need for safety for the mentally impaired. It is up to us to look after them.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment. Members are aware that while the mentally impaired may be physically normal and indistinguishable from anyone else, such people will be preyed upon as they are so vulnerable. It is important that they are protected as children are. In places where mentally impaired people are cared for, staff should be subject to the same type of scrutiny as those looking after children. The point here is the protection of vulnerable people in the most stringent way possible.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment. The definition outlined by Senator Henry seems very appropriate. Mentally impaired people who are suffering from a disorder and from difficulty in terms of employment have to be guarded against serious exploitation. I understand there is a Garda database that checks the criminal records of anyone employed in the area of child care, irrespective of the nature of the crime. Is there a notification process already in place for child care? A number of issues on that have come to my attention and it seems that the opposite is the case. People whose offences are not of a sexual nature will be disbarred from employment in child care. I am not sure to what extent it operates in terms of mental impairment. There seems to be a blanket ban on employment for anyone with a criminal record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Henry did raise this issue at Second Stage and indicated that she would be raising the question of the protection of the mentally impaired in the context of employment, and their protection from persons who have been convicted of sex offences. Part 4 of the Bill already provides such protection for children. Senator Henry was able to give prior notice of these amendments and has received support from the <Col N="1381" /> Senators present. The Government accepts the amendments.</P>
      <P>In being able to accept them it is important to have a good definition of mentally impaired. The definition proposed by Senator Henry &ndash; taken from section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993, which protects mentally impaired persons from sexual abuse generally &ndash; is the best definition available on a matter that is difficult to define. I thank Senator Henry for submitting the amendments which will greatly enhance the protection available to mentally impaired persons against sex abuse.</P>
      <P>There is a Garda clearance section which deals with persons who are working with children or in the child care area. It is an area in which significant recruitment is about to be initiated. Getting Garda clearance for people working in the area is a big issue. That so many people from abroad are being recruited raises a particular challenge. They do provide a clearance service but that is somewhat different from notification.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 17 refers to access to the register. A short time ago we had some discussion on information about offenders. We talked about ready identification and about frightening offenders off. It is very important that there be confidentiality around the register. We do not want to see scaremongering about people. As the Minister has already pointed out, these will be people who have already served their sentence. If people have complied with the provisions of the register we want to ensure their rights are vindicated. We ask that access to the register be confined to the Garda Síochána and that the information in it not be disclosed to any other person, save with the permission of a designated High Court judge on the application of a member of the Garda not below the rank of inspector. Such an application must be heard <i>in camera</i> and it shall not be granted unless, in the opinion of a High Court judge, it is in the interest of public safety to do so. That must be the criterion. We have to be assured that any information released about people on the register should only be available if it is in the public interest.</P>

      <P>This amendment is concerned with providing a basis through the courts for deciding who will have access to the register. There are some technical elements which I am not happy with. For example, the word &ldquo;register&rdquo; does not appear in the text of the Bill. However, that is not the reason for opposing it. The Government opposes this because it runs counter to the philosophy and policy underpinning Part 2 of the Bill. Access to the register is not covered by the Bill. We consider that access could not properly or adequately be dealt with in legislation; it can more appropriately be dealt with administratively.</P>
      <P>The intention is that the information in the register will be used by the Garda, in conjunction with the Probation and Welfare Service, to assess risk. The existence of the notification system will be the basis for continual risk assessment of convicted sex offenders by the Garda Síochána and the Probation and Welfare Service. No one else will, as of right, have access to that information.</P>
      <P>Any leak of information could only be deplored and we are hopeful and confident that no leaks will occur. Apart from any other consideration there could be no point in leaking that information. Should the worst happen it would be irrelevant as to how it could be properly disclosed, whether on the instructions of a judge or as a result of a decision taken at an inter-agency level by the Garda and probation service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is open to the Garda to draw up a protocol, with the probation service, as to what circumstances should give rise to disclosure in any particular case. The intention, as in Northern Ireland, is that it will only be disclosed when there is a serious and immediate danger to a per<Col N="1383" /> son or persons and even then only to the minimum number of persons who have an absolute need to know. The last thing we need is disorder, personal injury or witch-hunts arising from disclosure. Where the Garda come to the conclusion that another person or persons should be informed of an offender's name it will be because they are sure there is an immediate and serious risk. It is the risk element and its immediacy which is important. These will be determined by using normal crime prevention techniques and the risk assessment arising from a person being obliged to register.</P>
    <P>The problem with this amendment is that it transfers the decision from those who have been watching, assessing and possibly treating the offender on a continuing basis, to the court. The court would be asked to make an immediate decision. Applications to the court take time, reports have to be prepared and so forth. The court might request reports from experts, which as we know can often conflict. It is not a system designed for immediate action. &ldquo;Immediate&rdquo; does not mean tomorrow or next week. It is not the function of the court to be a rubber-stamp, which it would have to be if it was to act as the Garda could where an immediate risk to a child became apparent.</P>
    <P>Giving information from the register to the public carries huge risks and responsibilities, as we have recently seen across the water. I am not aware of any evidence that details of any of the persons whose names were published came from an official source. The Government envisages the power to disclose will be used very sparingly. The Garda will develop their own means of risk assessment and when, where and to whom any public access should be made. I imagine a first move would be, for example, to warn the offender about his or her behaviour and suggest they move to another place where children do not congregate, or else seek a sex offenders order. Some of them want to make it clear that there will be no public access to the register. Information may be disclosed in the exceptional circumstance to which I have referred, and then only on a strictly need-to-know basis. Good policing practices rather than court intervention offer the most appropriate and efficient way to decide when and to whom that information will be made available. I am, therefore, not in a position to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I have a slight difficulty with the way the Minister of State explained that access to the register will be the responsibility of the Garda Síochána, which will be responsible for drawing up protocols. What protocol, if any, has been drawn up at this stage? It may not have happened &ndash; I hope it would not happen &ndash; but if matters are not placed on a formal basis, informal access can prove extremely dangerous. Notwithstanding the Minister of State's indication that a protocol will be drawn up, I believe greater safeguards are <Col N="1384" /> offered by the courts. I do not know whether her comments were slightly contradictory because she indicated that if a child was at risk, this could obviously happen quite quickly but she also said that this could perhaps be too slow. She appeared to be saying that if access is determined by the Garda Síochána and if a child is at risk, action can be quickly taken but she also said that a lengthy process could be undergone and that it would not be apt in that regard. I am confused in terms of the actual point the Minister of State was attempting to make.</P>
      <P>In terms of access to the register, I submit that offenders would feel safer, as it were, from public vilification, from having their names leaked etc., if a more formal structure involving the courts was put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Keogh misunderstood what I said. The lengthy procedures, reports etc. to which I referred would come into play if matters went before the courts. I also indicated that leaving matters in the hands of the Garda, probation officers and people who deal with offenders would allow them to make the decision. I will offer a simple example. If, at 3 p.m. on a Friday, the Garda became aware that there was a real and substantial risk to children at a particular school and felt there was a need for notification or disclosure, a decision could be taken to notify one person, perhaps the principal, without having to take recourse to the High Court which could delay the process. It is on that basis we believe that the more efficient and correct manner in which to proceed is to leave matters in the hands of the Garda. I have no doubt that a protocol will be developed before the Bill is enacted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, announced that he intended to raise significantly the penalties for sexual assault. Originally it had been intended to do so in any further sex offences Bill that may arise from an analysis of the views received on the discussion paper on the law on sex offences. However, it seemed to the Minister that this was a matter of sufficient importance to warrant including it in this Bill.</P>
      <P>To place the amendments in context, I will briefly outline the recent history of the offence of sexual assault and the penalty attaching to it. Prior to 1990, there were two main offences dealing with sexual assaults, that is, apart from specific statutory offences such as unlawful carnal knowledge and incest, the offences of rape and indecent assault. The penalty for indecent assault of a male or female in the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, was set at a maximum of ten years imprisonment. Prior to that, the penalty for indecent assault on a female was two years for a first offence and five years for a subsequent offence.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, totally reformed the penalty structure for sexual offences. Under section 4, a new offence of rape was created with a penalty of up to life imprisonment. This offence was a sexual assault that included penetration. The other new offence in the 1990 Act was aggravated sexual assault. This offence is a sexual assault which involves serious violence or the threat thereof or is such as to cause injury, humiliation or degradation of a grave nature to the person assaulted. The third offence to emerge from the old offence of indecent assault &ndash; and, essentially, its continuation &ndash; was sexual assault of a male or female, with a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As very serious sexual assault offences could be prosecuted under the provisions relating to rape in section 4 or those relating to aggravated sexual assault, the five years maximum for sexual offences probably seems reasonable, particularly as it would include some relatively minor manifestations of the offence such as unwanted touching of a sexual nature. In retrospect, the gap between sexual assault and the more serious offences is probably too wide and does not allow, in particular, for situations where the assaults continued over an extended period. At the upper <Col N="1386" /> level, the assaults could be relatively serious and could have lasting repercussions for the victims, particularly children. Accordingly, the Minister is proposing to raise the maximum penalty for sexual assault of an adult from five years to ten years and for sexual assault of a child from five years to 14 years. These, we suggest, are more reasonable penalties for the type of behaviour that may be involved.</P>
    <P>It will still be possible for a case of sexual assault to be dealt with summarily where the assault is at the lower end of the scale of seriousness. Under section 12 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, the offence of indecent assault could be tried summarily. That provision transferred to the offence of sexual assault in 1990 and will also apply to that offence with the higher penalties now proposed. Before the offence can be tried summarily, three conditions must be met, first, the District Court judge must be of the opinion that the facts proved or alleged against a defendant constitute a minor offence fit to be tried summarily; second, the Director of Public Prosecutions must consent; and, third, the defendant does not object to being tried summarily. There is a constitutional right to trial by jury.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) defines child for the purposes of the section as a person under 17 years of age. That is the age generally under Irish law for giving consent to sex. In the circumstances, it is the most appropriate age to distinguish children from adults for the purpose of the penalty. Subsection (2) rules out retrospectivity in relation to the penalty. This is because a person cannot face a higher penalty than that provided for in law at the time an offence was committed.</P>
    <P>The second amendment is a technical addition to the Long Title which is necessary if the Bill is to accommodate the increase in the penalties for sexual assault. It provides for the minimum necessary, that is, a reference to section 2 in the Long Title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the amendments to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these important amendments which will strengthen our legislation in this area. There have been cases where young victims have been brave enough to allow their names to be mentioned publicly in court so that embarrassment of the most severe kind was visited upon the perpetrators of the heinous acts against them. I do not wish to lay blame upon members of the Judiciary whose hands were tied by the provisions relating to the maximum five year term, but that maximum term did not apply in all instances. There were cases involving sexual assault where sentences of two or three years imprisonment were handed down. The Minister was conscious of that fact and listened carefully to the testimonies of victims who were brave enough to come forward to ensure that the crimes against them would not be perpetrated against others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State is correct that the term of imprisonment for both offences should be <Col N="1387" /> increased. In the case of offences against children &ndash; in this instance, those under 17 years of age &ndash; the sentence has been increased from five years to 14 years. We are all aware that children are much more vulnerable. An adult who is sexually assaulted may be able to defend themselves to some extent. However when it happens to a child, the child's vulnerability must be taken into account. In many cases the perpetrators of these heinous crimes are in a position of trust in society which is all the more reason decent maximum prison sentences must be provided for. I welcome both amendments and hope they will be welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a great believer in avoiding prison as an option and using restorative justice instead. However there is a principle of just desserts and trying to rehabilitate prisoners. The amendments must be supported because the amount of damage done to victims in these cases is very severe, not just in the short term but also in the long term. Frequently little progress can be made with the offender given some of the sentences handed down. This can be forgotten. There is a tremendous sense of denial of the harm done by many of them. This was one of the main problems with early release. Offenders did not engage sufficiently in programmes to try to bring about some form of rehabilitation in their behaviour before they were released early. I support the amendments, although they involve longer terms of imprisonment, something about which I have always been gravely concerned.</P>
      <P>We are aware of the long-term effect of these assaults from the work done, for example, in St. Patrick's on the evidence of depression in women who have been sexually assaulted, especially if there has been penetration or attempted penetration. In case Senator Norris thinks I take no notice of men, I am sure if a similar study was conducted of men similar problems with depression would also be found. The short-term effects are terrible from the point of view of the risk to a woman of pregnancy, sexually transmitted disease, AIDS and so forth. These are incredibly serious offences and deserve these sentences. I did not realise that some were as short as two years which shows a very casual attitude to sexual assault. The amendments should be supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unusual that the amendments have been made to this Bill which relates to notification of information to the Garda after release because the amendments deal with conviction and change substantially the sentences involved. It is appropriate that anyone guilty of assault of a child would receive a stiffer sentence than they would were the assault on an adult. Fourteen and ten years reflect the enormity of the offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that the Minister of State has moved into this arena she must also examine what happens while people are incarcerated. The longest sen<Col N="1388" /> tences imposed are in the area of sex offences, although the law might have been more lenient than it could have been in that area. However judges now view the offences much more seriously than they did. As a result the prison population is increasingly composed of sex offenders, of whom three prisons are almost full. We must examine what happens to these people inside prison. I agree fully with Senator Henry that the question of rehabilitation in prison is a major issue.</P>
    <P>Very few programmes are in place. There is the issue of denial and people convicted of sexual assault not accepting the enormity of their actions and not even accepting that anything wrong has been done. At the same time the State has not made any effort to deal with the matter and greater numbers are being imprisoned for longer periods in inappropriate situations. The Minister of State spoke of a post-release supervision and probation service but we have no such service. The service inside prisons is under-resourced, underfunded and understaffed and there is no contact with an offender after his release.</P>
    <P>Now that we have moved into the area of creating new terms of imprisonment for serious assault what happens in terms of rehabilitation must be examined. Are there any proposals to deal with the probation service, the Cinderella of the prison system? Are there any proposals to examine seriously a range of programmes in which prisoners would have the option of engaging while in prison and also after they are released?</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments, not that I believe in locking people up and throwing away the key. Unfortunately and as has already been noted, the sentences available to judges for sex offences were too lenient. Paedophiles in particular do not believe what they do is wrong, believing that it is the rest of us who are wrong whereas they are right. Obviously we must indicate through the legal system how serious we believe these crimes to be.</P>
      <P>I also agree that if people are to be locked up they cannot be left to rot until released to reoffend because they did not receive any treatment. I am aware there is a difficulty with the take-up by paedophiles of treatment available to them. If people are convicted and serve lengthy sentences some rehabilitation must be provided for within the system. Senator Costello is correct when he says the probation and welfare service is almost non-existent because insufficient funding is provided for it. This means the follow-up for people when released from prison is minimal. Considering the seriousness of the type of activity involved it is incumbent upon the State to ensure every effort is made to deal with offenders. I do not know the success rate of programmes, something which should be monitored carefully. We often put programmes into practice more in hope than expectation of their success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1389" /> An enormous amount of work remains to be done in this regard and I hope in accepting the amendments from the Minister of State we can be reassured that the type of rehabilitation necessary will be available, that it will not be a case of showing offenders that their crimes are heinous by giving them draconian sentences and that instead we will indicate to them that these activities are unacceptable within society by removing them from it while also ensuring society is a safer place by giving them the necessary treatment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their support for the amendments because the Minister was anxious not to wait for further legislation to bring forward these proposals. I accept fully what was said about the need for therapy and treatment of prisoners. Senator Costello, above all others, will be aware of the types of therapy available. There are three types: individual counselling is available in all institutions, a multi-disciplinary thinking skills group programme is available in Cork and Arbour Hill prisons, and an intensive offence focused group programme is available in Arbour Hill and the Curragh prisons. The willingness of the offender to participate in these programmes is required in order for them to benefit from them. The Minister is examining the possibility of extending the range of multi-disciplinary treatment options for sex offenders in other prisons because there are now many sex offenders in prison.</P>
      <P>The role of the probation and welfare service is crucial, particularly for the implementation of the Bill. For this reason, extra resources and more probation and welfare officers will be required. A competition took place for 25 temporary probation and welfare officers. It was so successful that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform obtained funding from the Department of Finance to increase the number of officers to 50, some of whom are ready to take up their contracts. They will be employed initially on temporary contracts. Arrangements are being made to hold a confined competition for permanent appointments at the end of the contract period. The first eight probation and welfare officers took up duty on 14 May and five more on 21 May. Seven will take up duty on 5 June and a further three on 11 June. Others will take up duty in the following weeks and months. This recruitment will ensure a service which can respond to the needs outlined in the Bill and provide a range of other services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not reassured by the appointment of 25 or 50 probation and welfare officers. There are approximately 3,000 prison officers in the Prisons Service, more than the number of prisoners. The numbers envisaged by the Minister of State do not amount to a serious probation and welfare service. We have not adjusted mentally to the need for rehabilitation and what is required by offenders in prison and after their release. The Bill is concerned with the <Col N="1390" /> supervision and welfare of offenders after their release from prison. A small number of additional recruits to the probation and welfare service will not deal with the problem. The number of offenders involved is large and designated recruitment of officers specifically for this area is required.</P>
      <P>The matter is not being taken seriously. Probation and welfare officers and their trade union representatives constantly bemoan the fact that lip service is paid to this important aspect of their service. Once offenders are sent to prison they should immediately begin preparation for their release. This is not happening. This legislation adds a further layer of justice management and administration for which I do not see resources being given. Too often we pass legislation but do not provide the resources to make it successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister accepts that other responsibilities and duties arise from the Bill and that extra resources will be required for the probation and welfare service. These requirements will depend on the level of supervision required and the use made by the courts of post-release supervision orders and so on. Resources will also be needed to provide the necessary therapies. The Minister is committed to ensuring those resources are made available and that the service can be provided and upgraded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the launch of the Government's new national drugs strategy; and notes the ambitious targets which have been set in the strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on having introduced this important national drugs strategy, the aim of which is to reduce significantly the harm caused to individuals and society in general by the misuse of drugs. We all know about the problems illegal drugs are causing in every town, village and parish. Part of the strategy involves a concentrated <Col N="1392" /> focus on reducing the supply of drugs, together with the prevention and treatment of drugs-related problems, including research. We welcome the Government's announcement of this strategy aimed at tackling the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>Central to the Government's approach is the co-ordination of a plethora of key agencies in a planned manner to develop a range of appropriate responses to tackle drug misuse. That is something that had been lacking until now. The strategy relates not just to the supply of drugs but also to the treatment and rehabilitation of addicts. In addition, appropriate preventative strategies will be developed. The strategy recognises that much remains to be done. To date, there are encouraging signs of the progress being made by those involved, which suggest that the current approach to tackling the drugs problems is proving to be effective.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision to bring forward this important announcement is to be welcomed. The strategy will put in place a solid foundation for those involved in tackling the serious problems relating to drugs so that their efforts will not go to waste. It also endorses the existing approach and will expand and strengthen the pillars and principles which underpin it.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that there should be immediate access to professional assessment and counselling followed by the commencement of treatment not less than one month after assessment, which is very important. When assessment was carried out in many cases in the past, treatment did not follow quickly enough. There was a tendency not to treat the person with the problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the number of methadone treatment places. The Minister has predicted there will be 6,000 places by the end of the year, which is more than double the number 12 months ago. A range of training and employment opportunities will be provided through special FÁS community employment schemes. The service user charter in each health board will be in place by the end of next year. There is an ideal opportunity at health board level to address the drug problem because there are structures already in place.</P>
    <P>Treatment services will be based on the key worker approach to enhance movement between the different phases of treatment and rehabilitation. A protocol for treating those aged under 18 with serious drug addiction problems who present themselves for treatment will be in place by mid-2002, which will be very welcome. Provision has been made to support families and the wider community.</P>
    <P>The Minister estimates that the volume of drugs seized will increase by 25% over the next two years and it is important to stop the supply of drugs. He then outlines the assets of some drug dealers in the strategy documents. The middle ranking criminals involved in drug dealing will be targeted. That is a new initiative, which must be welcomed. Some drug dealers have become very wealthy. Resources will be made available to <Col N="1393" /> existing Garda drug units to target drug dealers at local level. In targeting drug dealers, venues where drugs are pushed must be investigated and serious action must be taken in regard to pubs and night clubs where drugs are pushed practically openly. The Minister said he will take the necessary action but support and help must be given to him, his Department and the Garda to ensure drug pushers in pubs and clubs are taken out.</P>
    <P>We must also examine how drugs get into the State by undertaking initiatives such as coastal watch. The River Shannon is recognised as a drug supply route and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform deployed a police launch and trained drug enforcement gardaí on the river last year which was very welcome at the time. Every effort must be made to ensure the supply of drugs is cut off. Drugs have been brought into the State through various means over the years.</P>
    <P>The supply of heroin in prisons must be addressed. I was informed that sliothars containing the drug were hurled into prison yards and the Department shut off the areas involved when it discovered the problem. However, when the individuals involved realised they could not drive the sliothars over the prison walls into the new areas where the prisoners were exercising, they used golf balls instead. That supply must be eradicated and prisoners must not have drugs available to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to improve many areas relating to drugs. He has outlined the progress that has been made in recent years in the strategy. Six monthly progress reports on the implementation of the strategy will be submitted to the Government. That is important because when a strategy is introduced everybody reads it and expects it to work well but monitoring progress is essential.</P>
    <P>The most commonly used illegal drugs are cannabis and ecstasy and we are all aware of the harm both soft and hard drugs can do. There are many broken homes and many people are seriously ill as a result of drug abuse. Many people have become wealthy through the addiction and serious illness of others. Many people have been robbed and beaten up for small amounts so that drug addicts can get money to buy drugs. A major plus for the Minister is that most people are working and the Government's announcement that the unemployment rate is down to 3.6% is welcome. Given that the unemployment rate is so low, now is the time to tackle the drug problem.</P>
    <P>Some people do not work and as a result they have more time to get involved in drugs. It is important that those who have had a drug problem in the past are encouraged to return to the workplace and participate in employment schemes. People may criticise FÁS schemes and say they have outlived their usefulness but they provide an ideal opportunity for those who have been involved in drugs to get back into the work<Col N="1394" /> place quickly so that they can make a contribution to their local communities.</P>
    <P>There is also a major problem relating to legal drugs such as alcohol. We should seriously examine the liquor licensing laws, particularly in relation to the sale of alcohol to young people. We have to change our legislation because those people who serve alcohol to young people have a lot to answer for. I hope the Government will ensure that young people find it much more difficult to get alcohol.</P>
    <P>We welcome the document on the strategy which the Minister's Department circulated yesterday. People might say the strategy is late in coming but better late than never. I compliment the Minister and his Department in that regard. I also compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Ryan, on the work he has done in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to extend a second strand of the programme to the larger cities but I hope he extends it to the towns also. The programme will focus on designated rural areas. In many rural areas there are groups such as ADM which are ideally placed to promote and develop the expansion of the programme. I hope that is working well. It is early days but the Minister is planning a second strand which I hope will be introduced at an early date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleague, Senator Moylan, I too welcome the Minister to the House. I am happy to second the motion moved by Senator Moylan. In 1998, the then Minister of State, Deputy Chris Flood, launched a youth at risk programme which targeted 13 areas devastated by the heroin problem. If I recall correctly, the proposals were part of the young people's facility and service fund, which had £30 million allocated to it of which £20 million was specifically earmarked for those areas. The guidelines for that fund, which were set out by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs, were to provide enhancement and integration of existing facilities and services for young people; develop new and viable facilities and amenities, including sport and recreational facilities; develop a strategy to attract young people suffering drug problems into these facilities; and further develop additional facilities to target those specific young people.</P>
      <P>There was also a provision to support the voluntary and community groups and organisations which worked with young people at risk. Those organisations were in operation long before funding was a real possibility and many fine local community workers and activists gave of their time day and night to rid their communities of the scourge of drugs. It was a great pity that some of those communities were infiltrated by so-called political movements and organisations which passed themselves off as that but which had their own agendas. The fact that this happened in 1998 is an indication of the importance of this issue to the Government and the serious consideration it intended to give to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> We then had the launch in February this year by the Minister of State, Deputy Ryan, of the RAPID programme, which means revitalising areas by planning, investment and development. That programme fulfilled a commitment given initially in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to identify 25 areas of serious disadvantage. It was part of a commitment given also in the national development plan. Those areas were to be seriously targeted for investment and we were told at that time, and I have no reason to doubt it, that it would benefit somewhere in the region of 165,000 people. That was a major commitment.</P>
    <P>The national development plan also provides for £15 billion over a period of six years, and most of that money will be front-loaded in the first three years of the measures. That is a good way to proceed because if there is to be capital outlay, it should be at an early stage so that the monitoring can take place subsequently in terms of what needs to be done half way through the investment period.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the launch recently of the new national drugs strategy. We are all aware that despite many of the ongoing Government initiatives, there are still families and communities devastated by the scourge of drugs &ndash; none more than in the area I represent, the north-east inner city. Indications are that serious drug problems in this country are on a par with those experienced by our European counterparts. A number of years ago we were comparing ourselves to countries like the Netherlands. When we were youths, we always looked to the Netherlands as the place where drugs were available. That we are now told we are on a par with the Netherlands is frightening in some respects.</P>
    <P>After so many years of fighting this scourge, there is no harm in stepping back and examining what has been done to date, the amount of money that has been put into the system, the way it has been spent, the benefits that have accrued in terms of work done and what needs to be done in the future. The honest answer is that we have only begun to realise the dynamics of the misuse of drugs and, to be effective, we have to tackle the problem on a number of fronts. We are making very good inroads and there are encouraging signs that we are heading in the right direction.</P>
    <P>In recent years, a number of initiatives have been targeted, particularly where heroin is in use, and there has been much positive feedback from those initiatives. One example is the international assessment of the methadone treatment programme which stated that ours was one of the most innovative and successful in Europe. Bearing in mind that we are relatively new to this area in terms of our European counterparts, it is good to hear that we are doing the right thing. Other work is long term and it would be foolish of us to expect any immediate impact.</P>
    <P>Most programmes now in place have developed over a short period and were based on <Col N="1396" /> entirely new ways of doing things. I congratulate the Cabinet committee chaired by the Taoiseach who initiated a comprehensive review of all the work done in Ireland versus international best practice. Led by the Minister of State, Deputy Ryan, that review involved the largest ever public consultation on drug policy in this country. I am also advised that it also involved detailed study and consideration of a large number of programmes in other countries. That is welcome because it is important that we examine ways and means of tackling the problem which have been proved worthwhile in other countries, particularly in Europe, where they have been dealing with it for a much longer time.</P>
    <P>The issue of treatment places has been contentious. The number of places has been expanded significantly and research shows it is now producing positive results in terms of improved health, reduced crime and increased employment. However, by way of criticism of the health boards, the centres have been introduced to areas in the wrong way. I have attended many public meetings where local communities have been severely critical of what has been done. The boards refurbish premises which they have acquired or held for some time. They then leak to the community that a centre is about to be opened and inevitably there is a backlash which only serves to build bad relations from the outset. The boards must reconsider their approach. Dublin 1 and Dublin 7 have taken more than their fair share of these centres and there is a need to spread them more evenly.</P>
    <P>Drug misuse in this country will continue to be a major public policy issue for some time. Tackling it requires an integrated and unified approach. This is an ambitious strategy which combines the best international practice with the most experienced personnel. It has the potential to make a massive contribution to reducing, improving and, I hope, ridding ourselves of the drugs scourge. I wish the Minister of State well in his endeavours and congratulate him and all involved on introducing the strategy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on the very difficult work he has done on the drugs issue. I welcome the national drugs strategy report and I am glad the Minister of State has allowed the implementation period to extend to 2008 because it will be very difficult to meet the report's ambitious deadlines. This strategy is the result of a review of the national drugs strategy, established by the rainbow Government and nobody could disagree with its objective, which is to reduce significantly the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on supply, reduction, prevention, treatment and research. This embraces everything required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to a 1997 publication dealing with an overview of drug issues in Ireland, the first report of the Commission of Inquiry on Mental Illness, published in 1966, considered the drugs <Col N="1397" /> issue and advised that what was not a problem then would change unless concerted efforts were made to avoid the misuse of drugs. We associate 1968 with student unrest but it was also the year when the Garda drugs squad and the national advisory and treatment centre at Jervis Street Hospital were established. The latter was the first statutory out-patient treatment facility in the country. Drugs abused then included amphetamines, barbiturates and tranquillisers. By the end of the 1960s the most commonly misused drugs were cannabis and LSD. There was no evidence of any significant use of heroin but a dramatic rise in the use of opiates occurred in the 1980s. In successive years the Eastern Health Board task force, the special Government task force, established in 1983, and the life skills programme were put in place. The 1980s was also associated with the AIDS epidemic and in subsequent years drug trafficking became a major cause of concern.</P>
    <P>The ESPAD report on substance abuse interviewed young students in European countries. It found that Irish youngsters of 16 years of age had the easiest access to drugs, even more so than Swedish, British or other students. I was shocked to note that not only was Ireland in the top league in terms of alcohol abuse and cigarette smoking but young Irish students knew not only the price of drugs but how to access them with ease.</P>
    <P>The targets of the new national drugs strategy are very ambitious and in one sense they must be aspirational. A commitment is given to the immediate methadone treatment of heroin addicts despite the fact that in many areas there is a six weeks waiting list. I hope the Minister will be able to deal with this ambitious timeframe. The undertaking is to provide access to professional assessment and counselling followed by the commencement of treatment not later than one month after assessment. If successful, it will be a significant improvement on the present waiting list.</P>
    <P>Many of those deciding to present may not return if they do not get immediate treatment. In this context a delay of one month in the giving of treatment to those who make the courageous decision to quit heroin is a long time, especially when the implications for their future health are considered. Like those who wish to give up smoking, the great efforts of the first day may be followed by a relapse on the second or subsequent days.</P>
    <P>The provision of and access to methadone treatment is difficult. I am a friend of the president of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union who is a pharmacist in Limerick and who visited the Oireachtas last night. She has built up relationships with those who visit her pharmacy for treatment. This can be a positive aspect in that those attending treatment centres need not be stigmatised. They are provided with an extra support when they can attend their local GP or pharmacy. The pharmacist I referred to treats such people very well and they know she will deal with them at an appropriate time while preserving anon<Col N="1398" /> ymity. That is an outstanding facility and I compliment the GPs who have volunteered to be part of the protocol for the prescribing of methadone under the methadone maintenance programmes.</P>
    <P>Our ultimate wish is that people should not be involved in methadone treatment. It is disturbing that there has been a 16% increase in the numbers using it. Over 5,000 people are now on methadone. While it helps in the treatment of heroin addiction it is also disturbing that the number of heroin addicts outside the Dublin area is increasing.</P>
    <P>The positive developments in local communities point to the way forward. The drugs task force has established 12 centres in Dublin and one in Cork. The Minister of State should ensure that centres are established in other cities and towns, especially Limerick, Galway and Waterford. The task force envisaged will have a more regulatory focus while the health boards will have a monitoring focus. They should have a say because they have a role to play and they cover huge areas. I would prefer if local areas were pinpointed in a more comprehensive way because health boards are overloaded with work at present and I am not sure if they can take on this extra monitoring role. Perhaps they could do so if they had extra personnel.</P>
    <P>Local empowerment works and extra resources are needed. Perhaps it would be possible to beat the drugs problem by extending the measures to all areas. All Senators are aware that the drugs problem affects even the most remote rural village. We are not being honest if we do not accept that drugs have infiltrated every part of rural and urban Ireland. We must reach out to rural areas even if extra expense is involved.</P>
    <P>The drugs customs team target is ambitious and I am conscious of the need for a massive increase in resources. There has been no increase in the number of personnel for many years. The drugs court pilot project is most helpful in inner city Dublin. It deals with drug addicts in a humane way. They must be punished, but they also receive rehabilitation in conjunction with it. This is most necessary in the context of when they return to their communities after serving their sentences. However, the drugs court does not operate outside Dublin. There is a need for such a system outside Dublin because the recreational aspects of drugs in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway and smaller towns must be addressed. The pilot project should be extended.</P>
    <P>There was not much of a drug problem in the 1960s. However, Ireland now has the highest rate of ecstasy use among 22 western European countries. The country also has the fourth highest rate of cocaine use and the eighth highest rate of opiates use, including heroin. In the European survey to which I referred, Ireland's rate is just 1% less than the UK's rate with regard to experimentation with cannabis and ecstasy. It is frightening that we did not detect what was happening in Ireland since the 1960s.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1399" /> I do not have time to deal in detail with the problem of HIV which must be addressed. However, I understand money seized from big dealers by the Criminal Assets Bureau is not given to the fund that is used to support drugs projects. A certain percentage of that money should be given to the Minister of State to enable him meet more speedily the ambitious targets outlined in the drugs strategy. I do not know if legal issues are involved, but such an influx of funding would be most welcome in ensuring the ambitious targets are met. According to the drugs strategy, Ireland and Sweden only use methadone as a substitute substance. I hope more research will be carried out in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and the ambitious national drugs strategy. I also thank the Leader of the House for inviting the Minister to the House for this debate. Members constantly call for a debate on drugs and it is splendid that the Minister has presented his strategy to the House. I ask the Chief Whip to pass on my thanks to the Leader for arranging this discussion.</P>
      <P>The strategy is excellent, although I have only gone through it in a superficial manner because I received the document only today. However, one aspect which is not covered in as much detail as I would wish is the abuse of prescription drugs. A report in a newspaper recently included an interview Dr. Ide Delargy, who has done much splendid work in the area of drug abuse. The unhelpful headline on the front page was &ldquo;Doctors making addicts of their patients&rdquo;, while the headline inside stated &ldquo;Rogue doctors worse than back street traders&rdquo;. When one read the substance of the interview, it was not as sensational as the headlines suggested. However, it is a serious issue and perhaps the Minister could address it as well as the abuse of illicit drugs.</P>
      <P>The commission on benzodiazepines is sitting at present and is due to report next month. However, there is an old notion that children who see the abuse of prescription drugs at home, particularly for minor stress problems, must after a certain time start believing the old adage that there is a pill for every ill and there is some way they can improve their lives by the use or abuse of drugs. My profession must take a certain amount of blame for this because for many years it did not recognise that neuroleptics of almost every type are addictive &ndash; I cannot think of any one that is not addictive. They were habit forming and they created dependence. The pharmaceutical companies must also take some of the blame because their advertisements show people springing out of depression into new lives with the aid of little pills they produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister read the book written years ago about drug addiction involving barbiturates,<i> I'm Dancing As Fast As I Can.</i> Barbiturates were first produced 40 years ago and they were supposed to be the most marvellous <Col N="1400" /> thing since sliced bread &ndash; which was probably introduced around the same time. However, after a short time, it emerged that they were highly addictive and they destroyed people's lives. It has been said about every generation of new neuroleptic since then that it would not be addictive or cause dependence. However, the same problem emerged after a few years.</P>
    <P>The use of these drugs must be taken more seriously. I understand that when the commission on benzodiazepines reports, the Department of Health and Children will produce guidelines for doctors. However, that is not before time. In the interview to which I referred, some GPs who oversubscribe drugs of this type were blamed. However, the vast majority of them are in busy general practices and they give patients such drugs once. If people find that the drugs improve their lives, they seek repeat prescriptions every month. Unless the medication is carefully regulated, a person can become totally dependent on the drugs.</P>
    <P>Regular follow ups are required for such medication, most of which is only for short-term use. Long-term treatment with such drugs is only for people who are chronically phobic or have severe anxiety problems. However, some people seem to believe that any type of mild depression, which may be due to genuine distress that is a normal reaction to life, can be alleviated with drug treatment. We need to start in the constituency of the Minister of State by promoting the idea that one can cope with life without needing a pill to fix one up in the morning or put one to sleep every night.</P>
    <P>I cannot but remember reports that stated a considerable number of children started taking drugs within their own homes. This was particularly the case when Valium and lithium were readily available. Those drugs were initially thought to be harmless. Now, if one announced one was taking either, people would consider it to be very serious. Ten years ago these drugs could be got in the same way as Prozac. A major public awareness campaign needs to be initiated which the Minister of State could combine with his. We are aware that most people who take drugs take them to alleviate a condition in order that they will feel better. If they see parents or anybody else taking prescription drugs, it is not helpful.</P>
    <P>There is a very casual approach to hypnotics. We see the problem of insomnia described everywhere. People claim they are only taking mild sleeping tablets. I do not know what they are. All hypnotics are habit-forming and in a very short length of time one has to increase the dosage. The approach in hospitals in this regard is too casual because it is <i>de rigueur</i> that sleeping tablets are offered to patients. I have always been offered them but as I sleep like the dead there was no need to do so.</P>
    <P>Addictions can start by administering sleeping pills in hospital. After hospitalisation, a patient may visit his or her general practitioner and won<Col N="1401" /> der why he or she cannot receive more pills because he or she got them in hospital. He or she will claim he or she will be sleeping much better in a few weeks and plead with the GP. Next, repeat prescriptions are given and an addiction is formed. A child at home may see his or her mother taking sleeping pills going to bed and feel that if they are good for his or her mother, they must be good for him or her.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State put more emphasis on the abuse of prescription drugs? I realise his main task is to deal with illicit drugs but keeping a tight hold on prescription drugs is extremely important because they are seen as more acceptable socially. People take large doses of neuroleptic drugs which they would not dream of taking if they were illicit but they are just as habit forming.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his strategy and hope it works well. Because we live in the same area we are aware drug treatment centres work. However there is much resistance to them about which I wish something could be done. My life and that of the Minister of State have been made far more peaceful since we have had a proper treatment centre in our area. Before that, every time I walked home from the Seanad I fell over drug addicts. I am aware methadone is not the answer to everything and it is moving people from one drug to a legally prescribed drug over which we have control. It does, at least, make the lives of addicts and their families more regulated and ordered, and society in general.</P>
    <P>One can make people amenable to discussion about treatment and weaning themselves off drugs. If I can be of use in advertising a drug treatment centre in the constituency of the Minister of State, I would be delighted to co-operate. The proper regulation of the clinic in Baggot Street Hospital has made a great difference to the drugs problem in the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome this debate as it provides an opportunity to discuss in some detail our new national drugs strategy launched earlier this month. As in many countries throughout the developed world, drug misuse is one of the fundamental problems facing our society. It affects individuals, their families and entire communities. Tackling this scourge and ending the inter-generational cycle of drug dependency is a major challenge, particularly in these times of economic prosperity.</P>
      <P>The Government believes that drug misuse in Ireland remains a major public policy issue. That is the reason our new national drugs strategy is so important. The new strategy will tackle the drugs problem in the most comprehensive way ever undertaken in Ireland. The strategy is the first to clearly assign responsibilities and set targets for the different Departments and agencies delivering drugs policy in the four spheres of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1402" /> In April 2000 the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs, which is chaired by the Taoiseach, requested that a comprehensive review of our existing drugs policies be carried out. The objective of the review was to identify any gaps or deficiencies in the existing strategy, develop revised strategies and, if necessary, new arrangements by means of which to deliver them. The review was managed and overseen by a review group comprising senior officials from key Departments and the national drugs strategy team. The review group was assisted in its work by a team of independent consultants &ndash; Farrell Grant Sparks, Dr. Michael Farrell and Nexus Research Co-operative Consultants.</P>
    <P>As part of the review, an extensive public consultation process was undertaken. This gave individuals and groups an opportunity to tell us how effective the current strategy was and how it might be improved. Over 190 written submissions were received and eight regional consultative fora were held throughout the country. In addition, 34 different organisations and groups &ndash; representing Departments, State agencies and service providers &ndash; made presentations to the review group and me.</P>
    <P>Members will recall that we had a two hour debate on the national drugs strategy on 21 June 2000 which also contributed to the review process. I am indebted to all those who participated in the review, particularly for the many insights they provided into this complex problem from a variety of different perspectives. As policy makers, we have learned in recent years that it is fundamentally important to listen. It is equally important to act upon what one has heard. I am glad to say therefore that the new strategy has been developed taking into account the broad range of issues raised during the consultation process.</P>
    <P>During the review the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs was regularly briefed on the key issues emerging. At all stages it was eager to be in a position to act quickly and, where necessary, bilateral meetings were held with Ministers to tease out issues. When the review was completed last month it was cleared by the Cabinet committee and, immediately afterwards, by the Government.</P>
    <P>A striking feature of the consultations was the serious concern expressed over the widespread abuse of alcohol among young people, particularly outside Dublin. There is a common perception that alcohol abuse can act as a stepping stone or gateway to illicit drug misuse. Our society has always had a somewhat paradoxical relationship with alcohol. We take pride in promoting our friendly pub culture to an international audience. In addition, young people are being constantly bombarded with glamorous images involving alcohol by all sections of the media.</P>
    <P>In the light of the concerns expressed during the consultations the national alcohol awareness campaign recently launched by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is timely. It <Col N="1403" /> is particularly aimed at young people. Allied to this, the new drugs strategy contains recommendations designed to ensure increased co-ordination and co-operation between the drugs and alcohol strategists.</P>
    <P>As part of the review, the latest available data on the nature and extent of the drugs problem in Ireland were examined. This shows that the most commonly used drug in Ireland is cannabis followed by ecstasy. However heroin causes the greatest harm to individuals and the community. Both treatment data and data from the Garda Síochána indicate that heroin misuse continues to be a Dublin phenomenon, almost exclusively. Research also shows that heroin abusers are predominantly male, under 30 years of age and unemployed, and over half of those presenting for treatment had already left school by the age of 16 years. Members will agree that these are stark statistics.</P>
    <P>There are one million to 1.5 million problem drug users, mainly of heroin, in the European Union. Prevalence estimates put Ireland marginally above the EU average for problem drug use. As part of the review, the drug strategies of a number of other countries were examined. In shaping the new strategy the review group took on board proven international practices in tackling drug misuse.</P>
    <P>Ireland's current approach to tackling drug misuse incorporates the broad range of activities which are the hallmarks of modern drugs strategies in other jurisdictions. Central to the approach has been the bringing together of key agencies to develop a range of appropriate responses to tackle drug misuse. These agencies are working, not just in relation to the supply of drugs, but also in providing treatment and rehabilitation to those who are addicted and in developing preventative strategies. This type of co-ordinated working, where all the key players come together to build on each other's experience, is in my opinion the only way that the complex and deep-rooted problems of drug misuse can be solved.</P>
    <P>The local drugs task forces have embraced this way of working from the outset, in a true spirit of partnership between the local communities and the State agencies. It is fair to say that over the last few years a new process of engagement has emerged between the communities and the State. Community representatives, residents and State agencies are united in a common purpose. I am confident that the local drugs task forces will continue to build on their considerable achievements through their new action plans. To date, the Cabinet committee has approved almost £6.9 million for 11 updated plans. These plans cover a wide variety of issues in the areas of treatment, rehabilitation, awareness, prevention and education. Earlier this evening the Cabinet sub-committee approved another two plans out of the 14.</P>
    <P>While the review group recognised that much remains to be done, there are encouraging signs <Col N="1404" /> of progress in recent years, which suggests that the current approach to tackling the drug problem is proving to be effective. The current approach, therefore, provides a solid foundation to build on for the next seven years.</P>
    <P>I congratulate local drug task forces for the work they have done over many years and the time they have put into it, many of them on a voluntary basis. Internationally they have been seen to be doing a great job, and this has been acknowledged during visits to them. The work within communities to build them up, with local people in charge of projects, had the advantage of training people up on an educational level, but also because they were part of the community they knew what was going on. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in Lisbon told us that one of the biggest hits on their own website was local drugs task forces in Ireland, which is a great compliment to the task forces. There is a lot of activity in Europe on this subject and people are looking at other strategies. We have to recognise the work of those local people over the years who went out and delivered when they were given the help and resources.  </P>
    <P>Consequently, the new strategy endorses the existing approach and will expand on and strengthen the pillars and principles which underpin it. The overall strategic objective of the new strategy is to reduce significantly the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research.</P>
    <P>What is different about the new strategy? This is the first time that all elements of the drugs policy in Ireland have been brought together into a single framework with responsibilities clearly assigned. The new strategy sets out a policy framework through which all those involved in addressing this problem can work for the next seven years. It clearly assigns responsibility to, and sets targets for, the different Departments and agencies involved in delivering drugs policy across the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research.</P>
    <P>Under each of the four pillars, a series of objectives and key performance indicators have been set &ndash; with specific targets that Departments and agencies will have to meet. Around the pillars we have no fewer than 100 individual actions. These actions are designed to build on what has been achieved to date and drive the new strategy forward.</P>
    <P>One of the key recommendations in the new strategy is that regional drugs task forces be set up throughout the country to develop appropriate policies for their regions. While heroin misuse remains predominantly a Dublin phenomenon, drug misuse is occurring throughout the country. The regional drugs task forces will have a key role to play in the whole area of prevention and will also be responsible for identifying and addressing any gaps in service provision to tackle the drug problem in their areas. What this adds up to is national coverage. For the first time, we <Col N="1405" /> have an integrated strategy covering the whole country.</P>
    <P>One of the interesting aspects of what has happened is that there are 14 local drugs task forces, most of which are in Dublin. There is one in Bray and one in Cork, but there is no real heroin problem in Cork. The local drugs task force launched some time ago a fantastic plan in Cork, with a lot of money going into prevention. If there is prevention on the ground, these problems can be overcome. The people who have worked on the local drugs task force in Cork deserve much credit for being there on the ground and for their excellent plan which covers the whole city. If heroin suddenly came into Cork on a large scale, they would be able to identify it very quickly and act immediately to counteract it. Cork is lucky that it does not have heroin.</P>
    <P>Anybody whose constituency has heroin in it &ndash; Senator Costello's certainly has it and Senator Henry also knows it from her own area of Dublin South-East &ndash; knows that once heroin arrives an area completely changes. The whole atmosphere changes and it is very easy to identify it because it brings individuals, families and the whole community down. It is a scourge of a drug. I believe regional structures are the way forward with our strategy, on the basis of the experience with Cork.</P>
    <P>Other key actions to drive the new strategy forward include, under the supply reduction pillar, increasing the number of Garda deployed in local drugs task force areas by the end of 2001. In addition, the volume of all illicit drugs seized will be significantly increased, by 25% by 2004 and by 50% by 2008. Under the prevention pillar, an on-going national awareness campaign highlighting the dangers of drugs will be launched with the first stage to commence by the end of 2001. Comprehensive substance misuse prevention programmes will also be taught in all schools. The national awareness campaign will not be merely a &ldquo;Do not take drugs week&rdquo;, it will have to be ongoing, consistent and will need to involve the media, schools, and others.</P>
    <P>Under the treatment pillar, the number of methadone treatment places will increase to 6,000 by the end of 2001 and to 6,500 places by the end 2002. There will be immediate access to professional assessment and counselling for the individual drug misuser, followed by commencement of treatment not later than one month after assessment. A range of treatment and rehabilitation options will also be developed in each health board area and a protocol will be developed for treating under 18 year olds presenting with serious drug problems by mid 2002.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman talked about other options and we are looking at alternatives to methadone. We are aware that there has been some criticism about methadone, but it is the choice which most people presenting for treatment want. We have to make sure that they are not just dumping methadone, but they move through to rehabilitation and counselling and hopefully out the <Col N="1406" /> other side. There are many projects throughout this city where that is happening. An independent assessment of the treatment showed that 40% of those treated were back to work, and over 70% were no longer on heroin. There is a problem with poly-drug use and benzodiazepines, which Senator Henry referred to, and this will be tackled. The protocol on benzodiazepines should be launched in June and this will hopefully address that problem. It will be difficult to meet the demands of the proper use of benzodiazepines, while at the same time trying to stop people prescribing them, and using and abusing them as they are at the moment.</P>
    <P>On the treatment side, it is local opposition that is causing the problem. In Crumlin, for example, there were approximately 80 people on the waiting list in April 2000. Since we opened three treatment centres in the area, that figure has fallen to fewer than ten which shows that if we can get the centres open we can get people into treatment. Ballyfermot, which had 150 people in treatment, now has 380 in treatment. The waiting list in the area in 1998 was 250 people. There are now fewer than 50 people waiting for treatment. That is because we managed to open the treatment centres.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, as Senator Henry has said, there very often is great local opposition to new centres. The matter needs to be approached in the right way. Senator Kett mentioned criticism of the health board. The health board has learned from its past mistakes. Many of us have had the experience of attending public meetings having been told one thing only to discover while standing on stage defending it that it is not true. The health board has learned from events and is working with local communities.</P>
    <P>Some people who once objected to treatment centres have shown a willingness to tell public meetings that the establishment of a centre, as Senator Henry said, has considerably improved the position on the street. I took part in a radio programme recently, during which the chairman of a residents' association in Crumlin phoned in to say that his group, which had objected to a treatment centre being opened in the area, now agreed that the scheme is working. That message will slowly get across to people.</P>
    <P>The Government is firmly committed to implementing the various actions set out in the new strategy. To ensure this happens, I will chair the interdepartmental group on drugs which will oversee the implementation of the strategy. This group will be responsible for bringing six-monthly progress reports to Government highlighting emerging operational difficulties or conflicts which are blocking implementation of the strategy. Any such impediments will be overcome. An annual report on progress made in implementing the various actions will also be published and an independent evaluation of the strategy will be carried out in 2004.</P>
    <P>While the review was taking place, progress was also made in enhancing the current strategy <Col N="1407" /> and a number of landmark initiatives took place. Over 120 of the original local drugs task force projects have been mainstreamed and the task forces are currently updating their plans for the next three years. The National Advisory Committee on Drugs, which was established in July 2000, is overseeing a three-year prioritised programme of research and evaluation on the extent, nature, causes and effects of drug misuse in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Over 340 projects are being developed as part of the young people's facilities and services fund. The important role that diversionary activities such as involvement in sport and recreation can have on young people at risk of drug misuse has long been recognised. It is also time that we recognised that there are many young people who would not kick a football if their life depended on it. Other activities, cyber cafes for instance, will also have to be considered. A lot of money is going into sport but we should remember that not everyone is interested in sport. These areas need to be examined and developed.</P>
    <P>A joint policy on prison-based drug treatment services has been agreed between the Prisons Service and the Eastern Regional Health Authority and is being implemented. In addition, a pilot drugs court has been set up in the north inner city of Dublin which will provide opportunities to divert people away from the criminal justice system into alternative and more effective treatment and rehabilitation programmes.</P>
    <P>It is also worth mentioning the RAPID programme in this context. This programme, which was launched in February 2001, is a focused initiative by the Government to tackle the most concentrated areas of disadvantage in the country. The 25 areas selected are located in large urban centres of population. The programme will prioritise the needs of these neighbourhoods and, through investment and improved services, will aim to develop the areas in relation to health, education, housing, employment, drug misuse and policing, depending on the needs of the individual areas which will be identified in an area plan.</P>
    <P>All this is being done against the backdrop of substantial funding being made available under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for social inclusion measures. Over the lifetime of the strategy approximately £1 billion will be made available for such measures.</P>
    <P>What are the prospects for the future? After years of hard work and concerted effort by a range of individuals and bodies, we can say that the foundations are solidly laid. We are entering into the next stage of the drugs strategy with a clear focus on what needs to be done. With the implementation of the recommendations contained in the new strategy and the active involvement of all the relevant players, we will turn the tide on this modern day menace.</P>
    <P>We should not underestimate the task which is facing us in eradicating drugs from society. We can succeed, however, in making a measurable <Col N="1408" /> difference for the first time. By working together through the Departments, State agencies, front-line workers, the community and the politicians, we can stake our claim on a more fair and socially inclusive society. The new strategy will open a window of hope for all those individuals and communities suffering because of drugs and make this a country of which we can all be proud.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman mentioned the ESPAD report. The figures in that report are worrying but they were compiled differently in Ireland than in other countries. No consistent methodology was applied across the EU. One of the reasons we set up the National Advisory Committee on Drugs was to get data that stood up to analysis. I am not saying that the report is wrong but people around Europe have questioned the way in which it was compiled in some countries. One of the problems people have pointed out in relation to our strategy is that no one has been carrying out proper studies in this area. I met Des Corrigan, the chairman of the committee, this morning to discuss a number of issues. The committee, which is producing some exciting results in parts of its research, will be referred to by many people in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The drugs court is a pilot project in the north inner city. As it is only concerned with treatment, no one is sent to prison.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the choice is that when one goes before the court, one is told by the judge that by sticking to the treatment and counselling and staying off drugs one will avoid prison. Failure to do so, however, means re-entering the conventional judicial system. People are given several chances and the system has definitely worked. I saw it in operation in Australia. The feedback is also very positive here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell us about the level of success it is achieving?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is successful. That is probably best summed up by one of the people working in the courts, a man with 30 years experience working in the Australian judicial system. He said that the court was the most exciting and positive court in which he had ever worked. We spent an interesting morning watching the various cases come before the court. Some defendants responded well, others did not. The excellent judge told one defendant that the programme was not working because he had appeared before her and lied to her so many times. He was thrown out of the scheme and returned to prison. In other cases, defendants were encouraged. I was very impressed with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding CAB and the money, the funds do not come directly back into the system. Through the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion there has never been much of a problem securing moneys to fund local drugs task forces or other <Col N="1409" /> projects in this area. There is a Government commitment to release the funds. It may look well to say that CAB money should go back into the communities, but we are receiving sufficient finance from central funding.</P>
    <P>This is really a matter of perception as we do not encounter problems in securing funds. In the budget, for example, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, gave us an extra £10 million for capital projects in local drugs task force areas. That was made available for premises and other types of buildings. There has not been a financial problem. Some £45 million has been spent on the young people's facilities and services fund in these areas. I very rarely have to turn down requests from projects for funds. Where that is the case, it is because they have not passed the assessment or people are not satisfied with the project's prospects of success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell us what has happened to the resources for extra customs officers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been certain divisions between the Garda Síochána and the customs officers. We have got them working together. We are also introducing new passive sniffer dogs to the ports and airports. We have set targets for increasing the amount of drugs seized. Most seizures involve cannabis but I am anxious that heroin finds increase dramatically. We will only be able to detect it using machines and passive sniffer dogs, both of which have been used successfully in other countries and will probably be used here in future.</P>
      <P>We are looking at treatment options other than methadone. There is detoxification, which many people do not want to go into as it is a difficult type of treatment. Buprenorphine is another treatment we are considering. I met today the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, which has a number of sub-committees, one of which deals with treatment and is considering international best practice and what is used in other areas. Naltraxone is a drug that has been used reasonably successfully in Portugal where there is good family support for the drug user. Naltraxone is an inhibitor. Patients take it in the morning and a family will recognise if they are no longer taking it. While using Naltraxone, no other drug will take effect on a user. We are considering different solutions but addiction is a complex area. There is no simple answer. The treatment that suits each individual is the one they should follow.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry spoke of the abuse of prescription drugs. I agree there is a problem. The protocol on benzodiazepines will be published in June this year. When I spoke to Mr. Des Corrigan of the National Advisory Committee on Drugs this morning, he raised the subject of prescription drugs. That matter needs to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Poly-drug use is a big problem. People are mixing different drugs, including alcohol, cannabis, <Col N="1410" /> ecstasy and heroin. There are anecdotal reports of ecstasy users smoking heroin to avoid a down from the ecstasy. That is very worrying. We have few hard facts on this, but that is why we have set up the committee. The anecdotal evidence suggests that younger people, who did not see the past damage done to communities in lives lost and families destroyed, are beginning to slip back into heroin use. Heroin is being dumped around Europe and is inexpensive. It is about £25 for an amount that used to cost £80 to £100.</P>
    <P>The more research we undertake the more we will be up to speed on the issue, and that is the way to tackle the problem. The slogan, &ldquo;There is no pill for every ill&rdquo;, is a good one for a campaign &ndash; Senator Henry has gone against what our grandparents told us about there being a pill for every ill. That covers most of the issues raised by Senators Henry and Jackman. I hope we can all work together to tackle the problem in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. This is a very useful debate and I commend the party that put it on the agenda for discussion. The Minister of State is doing an excellent job and that is the universal opinion of the manner in which he has approached this difficult and intractable issue. He has gone about it in the right way and there is great support for what he is attempting to do, even if there is at times local resistance to particular measures. The Minister can count on the support of all right-thinking people. However, this also creates challenges for him as there are great expectations as to the success of the strategy. I have no doubt he will measure up to those challenges. I am optimistic about the outcome.</P>
      <P>The Minister has set the strategy on a very stable foundation, that of locally based initiatives. There is great strength in a local community no matter what problem one is trying to confront. I mentioned that in the House in connection with racism some weeks ago and I pointed to a number of localities where local leadership educated a community to changing its attitude, approach and mindset. Because of that, people who came into the community were, in time, made welcome and made to feel a part of the fabric of that community.</P>
      <P>That is just one example of a community working for the benefit of all the citizens of that community. The locally based element of the Government strategy on drugs is a great strength. Another strength is that the Minister of State consulted widely with those who had experience of what had worked in the past, what had partially worked and what had failed. The Minister listened carefully and developed his thinking from what he heard. The strategy has a solid framework. While that creates huge challenges it also gives room for optimism that this scourge, which has brought such havoc to families and claimed the lives of so many young people, can be confronted and surmounted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1411" /> Once young people get into the habit of using drugs and become addicts, it is very difficult to reverse that trend. Prevention is the key, and the most effective drug prevention programmes in a locality are the ones that are not called drug prevention programmes. In light of experience, it should be possible to predict localities and families where young people are at risk. We need to build diversionary tactics into those communities. It is crucial that young people are given a sense of value and worth.</P>
    <P>What is on offer often does not meet the needs of young people. We must consider how we can reach out to young people, not only through the medium of sport, although there is no doubt that sport can be very powerful. Juvenile teams playing for their locality give young people a great sense of self-worth and pride. However, not everyone is interested in handling a camán or kicking a football. There is much else that young people can be taught to do. Mayfield, in my area of Cork city, has a thriving brass band for young people. These young people might otherwise be aimless and could be candidates for many things, perhaps not drugs, but largely unproductive activities. They are trained to read music and play instruments. They play as a team and that gives them a sense of identity, purpose and worth as well as occupying their free time.</P>
    <P>A number of measures should be introduced to give young people the skills to do useful things. If that is done, they are far less likely to get caught up in drug use. That is an area I would like to see developed more. I would like to see the RAPID fund, which is a good shot in the arm for communities where young people are at risk, used to provide better amenities and facilities. There are so many things that can be built around a branch library. There is so much that young people can do in a family context, at a branch library, a playing pitch, a tennis court or a band room. That is the best kind of investment we can make for the well-being of our young people. Those are the best kinds of drug prevention programmes.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to know what drives people to take drugs but there are common factors which we know enough about. Low self-esteem, low self-worth or no sense of purpose are some of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I detect many strands being brought together in this programme. That is important because initiatives were put in place which, because of a lack of cohesion, did not seem to deliver the desired results. Workers approached families or localities from different angles, but there was limited development and the desired results did not accrue. One of the strengths of this strategy is its coherence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim at all times must be to keep young people away from drugs and to keep drugs away <Col N="1412" /> from them. The Minister talked about the gateway of drink. That worried me greatly. I am convinced that physical education, from nursery school upwards, must be included in our formal education system. It will not be an exam subject. The NCCA in its recent proposals concurs with this. Unless physical education, the promotion of well-being and good health practices are built into the formal education system, problems with drink and smoking will continue. It is that culture which can sometimes lead to drug taking.</P>
    <P>Families must also be worked with. From personal experience in Cork city, I know that addicts whose families were there to support them, for the duration of their treatment and afterwards, were the ones who made progress. I pay particular tribute to VEC schools in Cork who took young people, whose mainstream education had been interrupted for years and might never have taken a State examination, as mature students. They took them into the system, gave them good skills and prepared them for examinations and work. Not alone were they reformed addicts, they became useful people in the community. It is not enough to get people &ldquo;clean&rdquo;, they must be given a good life too.</P>
    <P>We should come together with the Minister for Health and Children to do something about teenage drinking. A comparison was made in the House between what the French consume and what we do. The French drink to enjoy themselves, while most of our young people drink to get drunk. That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I am the glad the Minister has put in place a system of independent evaluation for the drugs strategy. It means it can be monitored. I wish him well with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. It is a momentous occasion in that it is the first time that a comprehensive document on drugs has been presented to the Oireachtas and to other agencies. National, statutory and voluntary agencies as well as community groups and local drugs task forces will discuss this in forthcoming months. The process that was engaged in was remarkable. It was a wide-ranging consultative process where submissions were made by the local drugs task forces, the community contributed to it and regional meetings also took place.</P>
      <P>It is a shame that it has taken us so long to get to this point. That is not the Minister's fault and I have no intention of levelling any criticism at him. It was not until 1995 or 1996 that any sense of urgency about this emerged within the institutions of State with responsibility for it. The Department of Education and Science still does not put a high priority on this as it does not see fit to send representatives to any of the drugs task forces. That is an outrage. Yet it is no different from what doctors did in the past when they refused to treat in their surgeries patients who were heroin addicts. The Hippocratic oath did not mean too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1413" /> The agencies tasked to deal with the problem simply reneged on their responsibilities. It took the death of a well-known journalist before the institutions of State took action. That started with the Criminal Assets Bureau. A recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> stated that in the region of £78 million is being targeted by the bureau, of which £50 million has already been obtained. Most of the major drugs barons are out of the country and will hardly return.</P>
    <P>The initiative with the local drugs task force is based on a initiative in the north inner-city, where a multi-agency approach was adopted. An inter-agency group, which I sat on, was set up in 1995. This has been a key element in carrying out a lot of good work. I am glad the Minister has seen fit to have the local drugs task forces as the core for the delivery of these services. There has been a good consultative process and I hope we will have a good delivery process.</P>
    <P>The profile of the heroin addict presented by the Minister is male, under 35 and unemployed. I always thought that there was a possibility of beating heroin. It is almost unique to this city in that statistics show that nowhere in the country, other than Dublin, has a heroin problem. Heroin abuse, in an intensive form, has been going on for more than 20 years, but it still has not moved beyond the greater Dublin area in any threatening fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is. Heroin is deadly, it kills people or ruins their lives, it turns them into zombies and it ruins other people's lives because addicts commit mindless crimes to get money to feed their habit.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to see an increase in methadone treatment places, up from the approximately 5,000 places at present to 6,000 next year and 6,500 after that. I am also delighted that the increases taking place are beginning, at last, to make substantial inroads into waiting lists. There is not a single person on the waiting list at my local clinic on Amiens Street. That is a first. Everybody has been treated and that was one of the clinics with the longest waiting lists anywhere in the country. That is partly because the system has spread out. There is less concentration on dealing with people in central areas. Each area now takes care of its own problems to a much greater extent. A local response to local problems is the key, irrespective of what local communities may think about it. They must come to terms with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied, on foot of what the Minister of State said, that heroin is being targeted. In respect of Cork and other parts of the country, the statistics clearly show that this problem relates, in large part, to Dublin. For example, in the Eastern Health Board area in 1998, 81% of those attending for treatment in Dublin were heroin users while 4.2% were cannabis users. In the Southern Health Board area 4.6% of those <Col N="1414" /> attending for treatment were heroin users while 39.6% were cannabis users. In other words, positions were reversed. The medical problems that arise as a result of the misuse of cannabis are always of a lesser nature than those caused by heroin abuse.</P>
    <P>The point I wish to make is that I am not satisfied that the measures put in place by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform are doing anything other than compounding the problems relating to heroin abuse. Under the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, he has seen fit to place everybody in the same boat, irrespective of the type of drugs they use. In other words, if they are found in possession of £10,000 of drugs &ndash; whether it be cannabis, ecstasy or heroin &ndash; they are subject to a mandatory prison sentence of ten years. That is lunacy and terribly crude because no distinctions are made. The result is that seizures of cannabis far outnumber those of heroin.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána and Customs and Excise officials are not focused on the real problem because over 60% of seizures are of cannabis, whereas only 13% are of heroin. It is great that such seizures are being made but we need to target heroin. If we can beat heroin, we will overcome the most serious aspect of the problem. The strategy does not place sufficient emphasis on the need to target heroin in terms of how its importation can be stopped by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the security forces, etc. I accept that the strategy's focus on treatment is good, particularly in terms of the number of extra places being created, the assessment procedures, counselling services and the lead-on into housing provision and job opportunities. These are wonderful developments but we are being let down in terms of the way in which the law is being applied. There is simply no way, as matters stand, that the level of supply will be reduced.</P>
    <P>The pilot drug court was established in my area and 22 people have been identified and agreed upon to be dealt with. However there is not yet an infrastructure in place to deal with them. Until it is put in place they will not be dealt with properly. It would be a shame that a pilot court which offers the best way forward will not receive the support of members of the local community because they believe it is not being properly resourced and lacks the requisite infrastructure. I am informed by some people that the court is also being abused. The Minister of State should address this matter and I am sure he is aware that a meeting is due to take place next month to consider developments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State who spent a period in this House which prepared him for his move to the Lower House. I wish to place on record that, in terms of the portfolio he now holds, he has made huge strides in helping society to get rid of the drugs problem, assisting those who misuse drugs and establishing treatment units. I have been trying to figure out <Col N="1415" /> where one starts in respect of this matter and came to the conclusion that one must start somewhere.</P>
      <P>I was impressed by the contributions of previous speakers. I do not want to pick out anyone in particular but I was extremely impressed by Senator Henry's contribution. Being a doctor, I suppose she has an advantage over everyone else. The Senator made one remark about which the Minister of State should be proud. She stated that they both live in the same area and recalled that a number of years ago she used to trip over the bodies of drug addicts while on her way home. Now however she can walk the streets without any problems. That is a major statement for someone of the calibre of Senator Henry to make and it shows that the plans that have been put in place are working. I was also surprised by her remarks because, as someone who lives outside the city, I had thought we were not making progress in our fight against drugs.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers, including the Minister of State, indicated that heroin abuse is, to a large extent, a problem which affects Dublin. However I do not want anyone to fool themselves into believing that the problem relates only to the capital and we must be careful to monitor what happens in other cities and small towns, particularly those with major tourism industries. We must be vigilant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, although I am aware it is the Minister of State's favourite town. I am merely stating that we should be on our guard.</P>
      <P>How do problems with drugs start? As the Minister of State indicated, there is widespread abuse of alcohol among young people in particular. If that is the case, it is probably easy for someone who is inebriated to be exposed to drugs. For example, a person might come along and offer them some drugs and state that they will feel great after they take them. The only thing I ever felt after consuming a few drinks was the pain in my head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one group which has not been addressed in this strategy and that is parents. Discipline has disappeared from the family unit. We have introduced laws to protect children and families but perhaps we overstepped the mark. Approximately four weeks ago I was entering a shop in Dingle outside of which 20 or 30 teenagers had congregated to eat their lunch and I saw one person whom I know taking the wrapper off his sandwich and throwing it on to the street. I was amazed because there were two refuse bins on either side of the entrance to the stop. I tapped him on the shoulder and informed him that he was breaking the law. He did not look at me but he looked at his shoulder, asked me if I would like to do it again in front of witnesses and told me exactly where to go. I will be honest and state <Col N="1416" /> that I was shaken by this incident. One cannot say anything to young people without their quoting the law in reply.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello was a little hard on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is rooting out the dealers &ndash; I would also say that if he were a Minister in a Government formed by Opposition parties. The number of drug seizures which have occurred in the past few years, not just under this Administration, is huge and it has increased under the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Reference was made to the amount of cannabis being seized. I understand it is much easier to detect than heroin or other drugs, possibly because of the smell.</P>
    <P>Our island is fast becoming a place for European people to visit, especially in their yachts. We have an unprotected coastline. While some places are used as regular fishing ports and harbours, there are numerous other places where drugs can be imported without detection. They can be the most unusual places, such as nice little coves in Clare, Galway, Kerry, Cork or elsewhere. Yachts have been seized and huge amounts of drugs found on them.</P>
    <P>I mentioned when the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources was in attendance that we should strongly consider establishing a coastguard service for the coastline. A number of rescue services exist around the coast, such as Clifden Sea Rescue, but I had more in mind a type of local watchdog. Under the Department of the Environment and Local Government, all county councils have what are known as harbour constables who are appointed to every pier and slipway throughout the country. In my area, Kerry County Council pays a person a small amount of money, usually £100 a year, to monitor a slipway which is not used. The person is given a logbook in which to write the names of visiting boats. Such a scheme would be of immense benefit to those wishing to track the movements of boats.</P>
    <P>I will conclude although I have not touched on many areas. A great deal has happened since last June when this motion was last debated in the House. If the same were to happen each year over the next few years, I would brand the Minister of State, his Department and all involved as heroes in the fight against drugs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely thank the Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan, for his speech and compliment the many Senators who contributed to a worthwhile debate during which many useful points were made about the national drugs strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State's review, which was circulated to Senators, stated that the majority of those presenting for treatment are unemployed males under 30 years of age and that more than half left school by the age of 16. Many Senators commented on those points. There is a clear message in that about young people leaving school and the Minister of State commented on that. Were one to speak to those people's <Col N="1417" /> teachers, they would probably say that some of those people went to school without breakfast or lunch and that they were vulnerable and easily manipulated. It was not difficult to get them to sell and use drugs. Those are points which are clear from the review.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's guide is for 2001 to 2008 and his strides to date and work in recent years have made an immense contribution to the reduction in the use of drugs. I hope he obtains the help and co-operation of all Departments and the necessary funding. While he said funding is not a problem, times change and he must be given the funds to continue the work and build on the achievements he has made.</P>
    <P>There is evidence of a significant level of drug use within prisons. Overall surveys estimate that two fifths of the prison population have a history of injecting drugs and almost half continue to inject while in prison. There is work to be done in that regard and we must tackle it quickly.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's Department has responsibility for a significant amount of lottery funding and he must have a say in where it is spent. I have in mind funding for sports development given the great work of sports organisations with the aid of lottery funding in developing facilities to enable young people to take part in sport, whatever it may be, athletics, soccer, rugby or GAA, in which I have a keen interest.</P>
    <P>Coupled with that, we must examine the provision of proper PE facilities. People take part in field sports during the summer and if PE halls are available they can also participate during winter. It would allow young people to become involved in sport during winter, such as boxing, handball, tennis or whatever. That would keep them off the streets. It is something we must take on board. We must also ensure that PE halls in schools are open to the public and not closed at 4 p.m. when schools close. That should be tackled to enable full use of the facilities which the taxpayer has provided. The Minister of State must ensure that is done quickly.</P>
    <P>While we all welcome new technology, one of the greatest blights in the movement of drugs is mobile phones. My information is that the Garda authorities are unable to scan the 087 network, whereas they can scan the 088 and 086 networks. If that is the case, access to the 087 network should only be granted on licence to people who will not abuse it. While we welcome modern technology, it is being abused to a huge degree.</P>
    <P>We should welcome the pilot drug court. The Minister of State commented upon it and I was delighted to hear him say that the people before it are given another chance, whereas no such chance would be afforded to them in other courts, which means they become a greater problem than they were previously. Senator Quill referred to local leadership. Parental leadership was also mentioned.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister. I hope we will be back in the near future to review the Government's suc<Col N="1418" /> cessful drugs strategy. I compliment all Members on their contributions this evening </P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform if the resources allocated to Henry Street Garda station in Limerick could be used to include the establishment of a Garda station in Castletroy.</P>
      <P>I have sent many letters to the Minister regarding the need for a Garda station in Castletroy. In an area where land is at a premium, Limerick County Council has offered a prime site on which a Garda station could be built. It is essential to act on this offer now.</P>
      <P>The population in the area of the Castletroy development plan is 22,000. If the scale and pace of residential development continues the population will be even greater. The population of Castletroy is roughly equal to that of Clonmel, where there are more than 50 gardaí, yet there are none in Castletroy. It is the busiest area of the county on midweek and weekend nights. The area has high technology industries and is the second largest area of employment, after Raheen. There is a very large percentage of young people among the population, including a large student population. The students' union and president of the University of Limerick have supported my call for a Garda station. In October next Superquinn will become the anchor tenant of Castletroy shopping centre, adding to traffic in the area.</P>
      <P>There have recently been attacks on students in the area. Three students, one male and two female, were attacked, allegedly by attackers armed with a gun and a knife. This is a fairly regular occurrence. Recently a student taking part in an outdoor pursuits activity at an old castle was stoned by youths, fell to the ground and suffered a broken nose. These are not isolated incidents.</P>
      <P>I feel the Minister does not listen to me. I hope he is not simply saying that the reserves in Henry Street Garda station can deal with Castletroy. If the Minister reads the newspapers and is aware of what is happening in the Limerick area he knows that Garda resources are required to deal with ongoing feuds in the Limerick area, which are a cause of great concern. The deployment of gardaí in the Limerick area is 100 under strength.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Castletroy cannot be served from Henry Street Garda station, which is five miles away. In the case of attacks on students, by the time gardaí from Henry Street reach Castletroy the per<Col N="1419" /> petrators have disappeared. The traffic on the Castletroy Road is intense and the road is one of the slowest traffic arteries in the country. The difficulty of coming to the aid of anyone needing a garda in Castletroy can be imagined.</P>
    <P>I will continue to raise this matter until the Minister sanctions a Garda station in Castletroy. Residents, students, the president of the University of Limerick, local gardaí and multinational companies based in the area have joined in this call. The population is now 22,000 and is projected to rise to 25,000. There are 50 gardaí in Clonmel and none in Castletroy. I hope the Minister will give me a positive answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I welcome this opportunity to set out for the benefit of the House the policing arrangements in the Garda division of Limerick.</P>
      <P>First, I will deal with the issue of Garda strength. As the Senator will appreciate, the Minister is responsible for the overall provision of resources to the Garda Síochána, while the Garda authorities are responsile for the detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas.</P>
      <P>In respect of overall resources provided to the Garda, the House will be aware that since the Minister has taken office the strength of the force has increased consistently. It has gone up from a figure of 10,800 in 1997, when the Senator's party was in Government, to a current situation where the number of gardaí is now 11,656, the highest ever level. Last year, the Government approved the Minister's proposals for a further Garda recruitment competition which is now under way. This latest recruitment competition will fulfil the comitment in the programme for Government to increase the strength of the force to a new record of 12,000.</P>
      <P>As well as increasing the strength of the force, the Minister is also providing additional financial resources. The provision of the Garda Vote when he took office was £457 million. The provision for this year is over £690 million. This is a significant increase by any standards. It can be safely stated that never in the history of the State have more resources been allocated to combating crime, purchasing modern technology and equipment for the Garda Síochána and ensuring that the number of Garda personnel is increased. Never in the history of the State have we had such a major prison building programme to ensure that those convicted of crime serve their sentences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now turn to the question of Garda strength in Limerick. The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that the manpower strength of the division, as at 29 May 200, is 446. The Minister is further informed that the manpower strength of the division, as at 1 January 1998, was 427. As the Senator can see, there has been an increase of 19 gardaí in the division. The Minister <Col N="1420" /> has also been informed that the Garda management is keeping the situation under review and that when additional manpower next becomes available the needs of the division will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda districts throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on some recent developments in the context of resources for Limerick. Limerick is one of ten areas that are included in the first tranche of Garda CCTV systems to be introduced, following the Minister's announcement last November of the expansion of Garda CCTV systems. Tenders have been sought for the supply, installation and commissioning of town centre CCTV systems in Limerick and a number of other locations. It is planned that the system in Lmerick will comprise 23 cameras.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked me to say that he was very pleased to open officially the new Mayorstone Garda station last February. The old Mayorstone station was built in 1965 as a private residence initially and then converted into a shop. It was formally opened as a Garda station in March 1973. The strength of the station then was one sergeant and six gardaí. However, given that seven sergeants and 32 gardaí are now deployed at Mayorstone, a new station was clearly required.</P>
    <P>The Senator asks about the provision of a Garda station in Castletroy. The Minister raised this issue with the Garda authorities arising from representations he received in the matter. He has been informed by the Garda authorities that, while acknwledging that Castletroy is a developing area with a large student population, they are of the view that the current policing needs are best addressed by providing resources from Henry Street Garda station. Accordingly, there are no plans for the establishment of a new station in the location in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ó Fearghail</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, for being here to represent the Tánaiste. When the Tánaiste visited Athy on 27 April last the local community and those who attended the launch of the Athy Developement Forum's promotional brochure for the town were enormously impressed by her detailed knowledge of the potential of the area and of the challenges faced by Athy with regard to job creation. Having heard her speak, those who attended the meeting with the Tánaiste were enthused by her understanding of the local situation and optimistic about the prospect of decentralisation and new jobs for the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a great disappointment therefore that in the almost immediate aftermath of her visit and <Col N="1421" /> at a time when expectations were higher than ever before the management of Peerless Rugs (Europe) Limited should have announced the laying off of its entire workforce of 65. The workforce had dwindled in recent years from a high of 200 to 120 about three years ago. It will now cease to exist as an operating concern.</P>
    <P>A special meeting of Athy UDC held last evening heard details from the town clerk of £67.45 million worth of investment projects under way in the town, a record investment figure. Despite all this, unemployment levels remain unacceptably high &ndash; double the levels that prevail in other parts of County Kildare. This is occurring at a time when record levels of jobs are being created nationwide. In this context, the loss of 65 jobs in Athy might not make many headlines but in relative terms its impact on the town and south Kildare generally is enormous. It is equivalent to the loss of 1,000 jobs in any one of the major centres of population across the country.</P>
    <P>The local authorities and the community have responded to the challenge of promoting job creation in the area by establishing the Athy investment and development forum in which IDA Ireland and FÁS are represented. I am specifically requesting the Tánaiste, through the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, to assist us with our difficulties in Athy by establishing a special task force to actively pursue job creation in the area. This could be done by simply upgrading and restructuring the existing forum to the status of a task force. As the Minister of State is aware, such an approach has proved to be successful in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The workforce at Peerless Rugs in Athy has demonstrated great commitment to their employers over 20 years. Earlier this week I met a group of the company's workers and noted that the employee with the shortest service had worked there for 15 years. One individual could record 27 years service, 26 years on the part of his wife and 21 years by his daughter. One can only imagine the scale of devastation caused to such a family by the redundancies.</P>
    <P>The loyalty of the workforce should be recognised through the offer of an acceptable redundancy package. The employer should be encouraged, together with the State agencies, to be generous in honouring its obligations to the workers, some of whom are pessimistic about ever working again. The first question occupying the minds of the soon-to-be redundant workers is the nature of the redundancy package likely to be on offer. The second question focuses on what exactly the company is doing. Is it, as has been suggested in its press release, closing down operations due to an inability to compete with low-cost manufacturers in the Far East, or is it simply relocating its operations to a sister company elsewhere in the State?</P>
    <P>I understand FÁS has already visited the plant and offered its services to the employees. It will need to maintain contact with the individuals con<Col N="1422" /> cerned. It will be necessary to liaise with the VEC to ensure the question of upskilling and second-chance education opportunities are addressed.</P>
    <P>Athy's population is mushrooming in accordance with County Kildare's development strategy of encouraging population growth towards the south of the county. More than 400 homes are under construction and there are planning applications under consideration for 520 more units. As the county's population grows, the demand to provide employment locally will also increase. This issue needs to be tackled urgently and it is the considered opinion of the local authorities, that is, the local urban district council and county council, and local agencies that the best way to do this is by establishing the task force I have recommended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The closure of Peerless Rugs will be a great disappointment to the people of Athy and the surrounding area. I fully appreciate and share the concern that the redundant employees and their families are experiencing. Although the closure was only announced last Friday, discussions have already taken place with FÁS, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland which have been asked to ensure every effort is made to find alternative employment for the workers who are to lose their jobs.</P>
      <P>As the Senator acknowledged, FÁS has already been in contact with Peerless Rugs in Athy to offer its services to the employees. I am aware that the services available from FÁS have already been discussed with the managing director of the company. FÁS officials met with the factory supervisor, 50 of the staff and trade union representatives yesterday to discuss the details of how best to provide this service.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, Athy has suffered from a decline in traditional industrial sectors within the town. The Athy investment, development and employment forum was established to address the issues of above average unemployment, the deficit in necessary infrastructure and the lack of substantial new investment in the area. This initiative is jointly operated by Kildare County Council, Athy UDC, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Kildare County Enterprise Board. The Athy development forum is a good example of partnership between the local business community, local and county authorities and the relevant State agencies all working together to ensure a prosperous future for the Athy area.</P>
      <P>Over 50,000 people live and work within a 20 miles radius of Athy. As the Senator stated, the town has a population of over 6,000 which is expected to double during the next five years. Many of the people, especially those who have moved to Athy in recent years, work in the north of the county and Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next step in the process of encouraging new industry into Athy is to undertake a skills <Col N="1423" /> survey which will provide vital information on the skills and experiences of residents who would prefer to work locally and would be a major asset in encouraging new businesses into Athy. FÁS proposes to undertake this survey in the next few months.</P>
    <P>In addition, Athy has been identified as a high priority for investment and development by the relevant State agencies. In particular, Enterprise Ireland is encouraging the provision of a community enterprise centre in the town, incorporating training facilities, a crèche and small units for micro-companies. Athy must therefore prove to prospective investors and businesses that it has what it takes in terms of infrastructure, workforce and facilities and the right attitude that will clearly show that it is a place in which to invest. Athy is well placed to be a strategic development growth centre in terms of jobs. It also has the quality environment sought by people who wish to live and work there. Athy is undergoing a transformation with major investment planned in coming years in the industrial and commercial sectors, as well as in housing, roads and leisure facilities.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the plans supported by Athy Urban District Council and local business interests, in addition to the efforts by the agencies under my remit, will see Athy develop into a town offering excellent opportunities for working, living and leisure in the years ahead. Overall therefore I am satisfied that a focused agency approach combined with a locally based approach, both of which address the jobs situation, make it unnecessary to establish a specific task force for the Athy area. I appreciate that the Senator may be somewhat disappointed with this fact but he will acknowledge that a concerted effort is already being made by so many State agencies. A specific task force would only serve to add an additional layer to the combined and committed efforts of local organisations already working effectively together on the ground.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Senator's particular interest in this matter. The Tánaiste and I will continue to monitor the situation closely. I would ask the Senator to keep in contact with me and with the Tánaiste in the weeks and months ahead with regard to such developments. We have heard much talk about unemployment being reduced dramatically and the Government is pleased that it is in decline. Clearly however there are regions where problems emerge. The Government must work to ensure it fills such gaps by helping areas where such deficiencies exist. I would ask the Senator to maintain contact both with the Tánaiste and me to ensure we can obtain the best possible deal for Athy. Equally, in the context of the need to expand beyond Dublin, it is quite clear that Athy is an area that requires special attention. I acknowledge the fact that the Senator has tabled this motion on the Adjournment. As the Minister of State responsible, I will help in <Col N="1424" /> any way I can to address the problems that he has rightly raised.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I congratulate him and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development on the wonderful work they did in ensuring the foot and mouth disease outbreak was contained. It was a great achievement and the farming community appreciates the work that was done.</P>
      <P>It was decided earlier this month that farm to farm movement of breeding bulls would be allowed. Prior to that there was only movement of cattle from farms to slaughtering factories for which permits could be obtained from the local Teagasc office. For farmers in my area to move breeding bulls from farm to farm one had to obtain an application form from the local Teagasc office and send it to the south-western cattle services office in Bandon, County Cork, which would issue a permit by return post. Every precaution had to be taken to ensure there would not be a recurrence of foot and mouth disease and that rogue dealers would not cause problems. However, breeding bulls are moved between farmers who are very conscious of taking every precaution to ensure there is not an outbreak of disease.</P>
      <P>Farmers have experienced difficulties because breeding bulls must be blood tested and tested for TB and brucellosis, and they often have to wait for nine or ten days to get the results. A farmer cannot do anything until his bulls have passed the TB and brucellosis tests. He must then send his application form to the south-western cattle services office in Bandon and wait until he receives a permit to move the bulls. Breeding bulls are very important to beef production. At this time of year farmers are anxious to get their cows in calf as early as possible and, therefore, the delay in the granting of permits for breeding bull movement created hardship for both the purchasing farmer and the seller.</P>
      <P>One farmer told me he sent three application forms to Bandon on a Monday and received two back on the Friday. He rang the office in Bandon, but it was difficult to get through, which was another problem experienced by farmers. The farmer was told the form had to be forwarded to the DVO in Limerick. He rang that office and said he would call there to collect the form but he was eventually told that the office had posted it to him and as a result it was a week before he obtained the third permit. Meanwhile, the farmer to whom he had sold the breeding bull was extremely anxious to get his bull.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for allowing the applications for permits to be sent by fax as they could only be issued by post initially. I am aware of a farmer who sent in three application forms via fax but only received two back. When he inquired about the third application, he was informed that it did not arrive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1425" /> I do not know what will happen with regard to cattle movement on 18 June when marts re-open, but I am sure the Minister of State will inform me. The south-western cattle services office in Bandon is over-burdened as it is also responsible for calf birth registration. I have an envelope addressed to the Department of Agriculture and Food, Farm to Farm Cattle Movement Notification Agency, Freepost, Kilfinane, Kilmallock, County Limerick. It was originally decided that the farm to farm movement agency would be based in Kilfinane. Since the office in Bandon is over-burdened a better service might be provided if the agency was located in Kilfinane, although I am open to correction.</P>
    <P>The permits could also be granted through local DVOs because prior to this all one had to do was provide the identification number of one's animal, the herd number and the purchaser's number. The purchaser and the seller would send forms to each other, which were kept, and that sufficed. It was understandable that the Department had to go to extremes following the outbreak of foot and mouth disease and the fear of its spread and take the precautions it did, but at this stage the restrictions could be eased and cattle movement permits expedited more quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for his kind remarks about our efforts and those of departmental officials, the Garda, the Army and members of the public in regard to preventing the spread of foot and mouth disease. This House has, throughout the foot and mouth disease crisis, been solidly behind the national effort to prevent the spread of the disease and has been generally supportive of the Department's efforts in that regard. Senators were quick to recognise the magnitude of what was at stake and the consequent necessity for a range of restrictions on animal movements and other aspects of daily life. The House is to be commended for adding at an early stage its voice to those of the Taoiseach, members of the Government and Members of the Dáil in underlining the importance of vigilance and of adhering to the necessary restrictions. The Members of this House have played a significant role in contributing to the success to date of the national effort on foot and mouth disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, therefore, no doubt that the House will recognise that we are not yet out of the woods as far as foot and mouth disease is concerned. We can take great comfort from the fact that we have had just a single case of the disease and that more than two months have elapsed since that occurred. However, there remains good reason to ensure that precautions continue to be taken against the disease for the time being. New cases of foot and mouth disease continue to arise in Britain and it is expected that this will continue for some time to come. There remains uncertainty about aspects of the four cases of foot and <Col N="1426" /> mouth disease which occurred in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are in the throes of a major programme of serological testing of sheep flocks throughout the State in the context of obtaining the degree of assurance which will ultimately enable us to declare Ireland once again foot and mouth disease-free under OIE rules. Foot and mouth disease is still a live concern and we are still some way from the point at which we can feel totally relaxed about the issue or consign it to history.</P>
    <P>Controls on the movement of susceptible animals and a range of protocols and precautions therefore remain necessary. It has, however, been possible to bring about a significant easing of these restrictions over recent weeks, having regard to prevailing conditions and taking account of advice from the expert advisory group. This has relieved some of the pressures which farmers in particular have endured over recent months. Further easing of restrictions will be possible if matters continue to move in the right direction and as and when we reach the point of being able to make the foot and mouth disease-free declaration to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The permitting systems which have underpinned the easing of restrictions on animal movements have worked well. Cattle are the most relevant species as movement of other species, other than to slaughter or on welfare grounds, remains prohibited for the time being. Since farm to farm movement of cattle under permit was allowed, 145,000 cattle have been permitted to move to other farms. That number was covered by almost 13,000 applications from individual herdowners. Where applications are fully in order, they are processed on receipt and the permits posted to the herdowner without delay. The available evidence would support my view that this system is working well.</P>
    <P>As the House would expect, permits are issued only in cases where everything is in order on the application. In the context of foot and mouth disease controls, it would be entirely inappropriate to permit movement where there was a question mark over an application and until concerns had been satisfactorily addressed. The type of anomalies which have occurred in relation to some applications were the use of an invalid herd number, seller's details not corresponding to the details entered on the CMMS database and buyer's details which were similarly inconsistent with the CMMS. Where minor issues arose, it has often been possible to rectify those over the telephone and to subsequently issue the permit with little or no delay. That will continue to be our approach. Where more significant anomalies arise, this may result in necessary delay while the herdowner addresses the particular issue or in refusal of a permit on stated grounds.</P>
    <P>Given the volume of applications received, the system is working well. From next week, as already announced, it will be possible for <Col N="1427" /> herdowners to seek permits to facilitate the assembly of cattle at marts to make up consignments for onward movement to other farms or for export. That will further relieve pressure among livestock farmers as we move towards eventual normality.</P>
    <P>The Senator will appreciate that there have been some other aspects of animal movements which we have had to take account of and which may have a long-term effect on disease control. We are extremely conscious of that and there is sufficient evidence to show that we need to be restrictive in this area.</P>
