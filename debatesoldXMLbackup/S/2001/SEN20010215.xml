      <P>I have received notice from Senator Cosgrave that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to order a full scale review of prison escorts, having regard to an increase in the number of incidents where prisoners have escaped from custody with the ongoing dangers to prison staff and the public.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to explain why a young girl, details supplied, has been waiting seven years for orthodontic treatment and if he will state when the treatment will be provided.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to immediately instruct the Mid-Western Health Board to provide funding for the purchase of a mammography machine at Ennis General Hospital and to ensure this service is continued on a long-term basis.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Cosgrave, Costello and Taylor-Quinn as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Cosgrave and Costello and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Taylor-Quinn may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Broadcasting Bill, 1999 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed), with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes; No. 2, motion re referral of the report of the Ombudsman on <Col N="278" /> nursing home subventions, to be taken at 2 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes, and Senators may share time.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. Will the Leader of the House indicate what legislation he intends to take during the remainder of this session? It would be useful to have an informed debate on a subject that occupied much of the airwaves this morning, the problem of teenage and under-age drinking. It is a problem of almost epidemic proportions in some parts of the country. While I do not hold myself up as a role model as far as drinking is concerned, I am shocked by what I see on almost a daily basis in universities, the extent to which virtually every event is sponsored by drinks companies, not only beer companies but hard drink companies, producing vodka in particular. The drinks industry seems to have no conscience or scruples about the way in which it encourages and makes it easy for young people to get drink at a very cheap price and often free. The encouragement to join a society is often that there will be free vodka and free beer. As Senator Fitzgerald will be aware, the governing authority of UCD has set up a body to ascertain how curbs can be put on such sponsorship. It is major problem. I am sure Members on all sides of the House would like the Leader to make time available for a debate on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>A leader article in <i>The Economist</i> this week states that the most important aspect of fiscal policy is not to do with inflation, interest rates or gross national product and that the most important future indicators have to do with productivity. In yesterday's <i>Financial Times</i> an article outlined that Ireland's unit of productive cost in comparison to the rest of Europe, the US or elsewhere has continued to reduce. That is the information this House should convey to Commissioner Solbes when we meet him. I did not ask, nor am I asking for the Commissioner to address this House. I want to make it clear that I intend to write to the Commissioner to ask him to have a meeting with interested Senators. It would be far more important if that were done by the House, that we could meet and have a discussion and invite the Minister for Finance to discuss these issues with the Commissioner. I make this point seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will meet Commissioner Solbes as one of the social partners. People in this House have asked me time and again why are we never allowed to have an input or influence where it matters. The Commissioner is coming to Ireland and this is an opportunity for us. At least Senator Ross is consistent, he wants to have an input and does not want to leave it to only the social partners and others. Let the public representatives share their viewpoint on this matter and let us discuss it. Let the Commissioner put up or shut up in regard to <Col N="279" /> his arguments. This is the place to do it. Let us hear what he has to say and let us respond to it. I appeal to the Leader&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is a matter that could be pursued further at a meeting of the Whips of the parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh. I seek the support of the other groups in doing that so that we will have relevance and topicality on a matter of gross national importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Second Stage resumed debate on the Broadcasting Bill, each spokesperson had 30 minutes to make their contributions last week. As our spokesperson is the last remaining spokesperson to speak, I presume last week's time ruling on the contributions of spokespersons will hold for my colleague, Senator Ryan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter on which I intended to seek clarification from the Leader before I called on him to conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the matter raised by Senator Manning on under-age drinking, the figures that are about to be revealed show that Ireland is the worst country in Europe in this regard. It is unbecoming of the Minister's spin doctors to churn out material to cover him on this matter. He is tilting at various windmills in terms of being opposed to deregulation of the industry as if that had anything to do with this. There should be a debate when the report is published so that we can examine the areas which have been neglected.</P>
      <P>One area that has been seriously neglected is enforcement of legislation. Photographs are published in newspapers every September of students who receive their junior certificate results in Dublin and proceed to Temple Bar and elsewhere, yet there is no enforcement of legislation. The sponsorship of sports by drinks companies is atrocious. Virtually every sport is sponsored by the drinks industry. These issues can be addressed. Over recent days the Minister churned out material about what he will do but said nothing about what he could have done previously. He should come to the House when the report is published and be accountable for his stewardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When will No. 8, the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000, be introduced? We are not able to get a commitment on this. It was raised in the Lower House yesterday. Donations to political parties are part and parcel of the legislation but the Taoiseach thought it was too simplistic to examine this area because there were constitutional issues involved. If so, surely we can examine the possibility of a referendum. However, we must find out where we stand on donations to political parties because of the corruption there has been in <Col N="280" /> this area. This important legislation should be taken at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of litter has been debated extensively in the House in recent times. I am happy that finally the Minister for the Environment and Local Government announced a new set of initiatives yesterday to tackle this issue. What resources will be put in place to enable the implementation of these new initiatives on the ground and to enable new measures to be taken to tackle that scourge? It is good for those of us on local authorities to know that the Government believes that litter wardens must be on the streets 24 hours a day. However, local authorities have adopted their estimates and no provision has been made for the additional expenditure to enable that to happen. Will the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House as soon as possible to debate this issue again? We welcome the initiatives but we want them to be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's comments on the report of the problem of teenage and under-age drinking. It is extremely serious. It costs the country a minimum of £1.7 billion per year so it is also a major negative economic indicator. I pay tribute to my colleague on the other side of the House, Senator Farrell, who has consistently raised this problem through most of the period I have been a Member of the House. It is very important that we discuss it. It is not just that we appear to have inadequate laws but they are not properly enforced. I hold the Judiciary partly to blame. Why is it giving licences all the time? Why does it never reject licences? Why does nobody control the behaviour of publicans? Why not close public houses that behave outside the law&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <P>The Senator is pre-empting the debate which he seeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be against my nature to do that. Will the Leader organise a debate on Northern Ireland or at least, as a matter of considerable urgency, talk to his colleagues in Government about the alarming situation that emerged today in the North where medical staff in the Mater Hospital, Belfast, walked out because they were being targeted by the so-called Protestant paramilitaries? A call should go out from the House to people such as the Reverend Ian Paisley, who poses as a Christian and who is a parliamentarian. It is time for him to speak out unambiguously to his own people and say this is simply not acceptable in a democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader invite the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the House? The activities of Chorus, a cable television company, have been brought to <Col N="281" /> my notice. Its activities. which are evident in my home town of Mullingar, are scandalous. Through slithery means it has obtained a £30 increase for its service and if people opt out they must pay a £45 fee. If the service breaks down and it is the cable company's fault, the customer must pay. That is outrageous and it is an underhand way of obtaining an increase. This issue has received a sound airing on the airwaves and it is not a new problem but something should be done about it. It is a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Manning and others for the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to debate under-age drinking. I am concerned about second level students. Senator Manning described the activities on the campuses of third level institutions but at second level absenteeism is a problem among 12 and 13 year olds on Mondays &ndash; the problem is particularly prevalent among young girls. I am concerned that, according to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, there has only been one prosecution in this regard. This issue has been debated in the House on numerous occasions. Prohibition and the implementation of the law are the primary concerns. We must impress on the Minister when he comes to the House that we can debate the issue forever, we are aware of the problem and the statistics but we need to know how he will address it.</P>
      <P>I refer to Senator Quill's call. Limerick County Council employs two litter wardens. Where will the council obtain the money to fund additional posts? We can debate this issue as much as we like but unless there are prosecutions and hands-on deterrents, it will not be addressed. I support her call for additional resources.</P>
      <P>I refer to the extra charge of £2.50 which has been imposed on customers who took on the Chorus multichannel service. That is disgraceful because one must pay the charge whether one ever has a call out. It was slipped in quite insidiously and must be addressed in the interest of fairness and competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House to discuss law and order issues? In recent years the number of unprovoked attacks in Dublin and throughout the country has increased. A common feature in a number of these attacks is kicks to the head and face. Such a kick is potentially a lethal act and is no different from someone being knifed in the back or chest. It is time for the Minster to consider mandatory sentencing. The entertainment value of such acts would soon disappear if such a decision were taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a long time since the Government promised a decision and an announcement on the single regulatory authority for financial institutions, but they still have not been made. Will the Leader explain why? Are the <Col N="282" /> two Departments involved still at loggerheads? When can we expect a resolution of the matter?</P>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on teenage and under-age drinking. There is no doubt this is a serious, growing problem and something must be done. I look forward to that debate.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Costello in regard to No. 8. Donations are too important to be a grey area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Norris for his kind remarks about my campaign against teenage drinking and alcohol abuse and I would welcome a debate on the matter. I do not think prosecutions are the answer. I would appeal to parents, teachers and society to play their part. It is a social problem, not a joke, and they must get involved. I congratulate the Minister for Health for taking a hands on approach in the matter. He should get the support of football and sports clubs, parents, teachers and all of us in helping to eliminate this scourge from society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too join in the request for a debate on this subject. Senator Manning indicated how, in third level institutions, companies are giving drink free to societies and clubs. Advertisements of night clubs offering cheap drink also encourage students to drink. There is a need for debate.</P>
      <P>The Leader gave a commitment that the local government Bill would be taken by the second week of this month. Are the rumours that the Government is having difficulties with this Bill true and is it still intended to take it? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the call for debate on under-age drinking. On radio this morning a parent referred to the fact that society was different and it was easier to rear sons in the 1970s than it is today. I was a student myself in the late 1960s and 1970s and I liked to enjoy myself. Circumstances and society were a lot different then. I blame a lot of our problems on night clubs and discos. Evidence of unsocial behaviour is to be seen late at night. Our only entertainment was in dry halls with the like of Joe Dolan or Senator Cassidy and so the problem did not really exist.</P>
      <P>Can we have a debate on the Comptroller and Auditor General's report yesterday on housing for the elderly? We need further funds and a review of the system to enable elderly people to have a better quality of life. I would like to extend that debate to cover local authority grants for elderly or disabled people. I find that system even worse than the health board system because they seem to wait till the elderly are ready to die before they carry out repairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to raise an issue in relation to the National Roads Authority. I was disgusted to read in the newspaper yesterday the corporate manager's solution to the problem when asked about the tragedy on Slane bridge. His solution was to divert the traffic on to the N1 at Ardee. <Col N="283" /> That is no solution considering the funds available. That traffic would increase traffic levels on the N1 and we already have problems between Swords and the airport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader clarify the time limits for the Broadcasting Bill to avoid problems arising with the Order of Business? I do not think we should make too much of a connection between deregulation and teenage drinking. Enforcement is a problem. I could tell the House what night club in Cork is avoided by 17 year olds because it is full of junior certificate students. I could give the Garda that information but they already know because they have teenagers of their own. I know the names of the pubs in Cork where under-age drinkers will be served. The law enforcement agencies are the only people who do not seem to know. Lack of enforcement has a lot to do with the problem.</P>
      <P>Another concern is the service that cable monopolies pretend to provide. When debating that issue we should discuss the abysmal failure of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation to look after consumer interests. She seems to be lost in a world of high technology. The fact that these companies provide an abysmal service to consumers does not appear to be on her agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in the call for a debate on under-age drinking. It came to my notice recently that a certain drinks company has appointed a full-time development officer in a third level institution. That gives some idea of the extent of the problem. A sports stadium in Dublin has more advertisements for drink around the perimeter of the pitch than there are in an average pub. It is out of hand. There are difficulties in relation to enforcement and I look forward to a full debate.</P>
      <P>Just as there are responsibilities on us as legislators to debate the matter there is also, as Senator Farrell mentioned, a serious responsibility in the community at large to deal with it. We could consider the licensing process, on an annual basis, for all vendors of alcohol. A public information campaign in relation to the licensing process would be of benefit and I look forward to the Minister coming to the House for this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support Senator Manning in his call for a debate on under-age drinking. Will the Leader also arrange for a debate in relation to the BMW region and its funding? We should have a progress report on the matter. There is little point in debating it if its term and funding have ended. Will the Leader arrange for the Minister to come to the House to give us an up-to-date progress report? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Bonner in regard to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report. It is time this scheme was taken from <Col N="284" /> health boards and put back in the control of local authorities as county councils and corporations have responsibility for housing. The report was quite damning, saying that many thousands of pounds remain unspent annually for various reasons. This scheme should be run in conjunction with the essential repairs grant and disabled person's grant in our county councils. I look forward to a full debate on this in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Leader replies, I point out that the time limits agreed last week for the Broadcasting Bill were 30 minutes for spokespersons and 20 minutes for other speakers. There are still two spokespersons to contribute. Will the Leader clarify that they will have 30 minutes? If the House agrees, the limits for other speakers can be 10 minutes as suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in full agreement. I propose 30 minutes for spokespersons and 10 minutes for all others as there are a lot of Senators offering to speak on the Bill. Senators Manning, Costello, Jackman, Coghlan, Farrell, Coogan, Ryan and Glennon all called for a debate on under-age drinking and alcohol abuse, on the whole issue of licensing and for the banning of advertising. I compliment the Minister for Justice on bringing in strict and stringent regulations and penalties on anyone found serving drink to under-age drinkers. It is up to law enforcers to enforce regulations that have been passed by both Houses. I compliment all sporting organisations on what they have done for our youth, the youngest population in Europe. We must continue to support the sporting organisations and as legislators do everything we can to eliminate the scourge of under-age drinking. This was not a problem when we were young as we did not have the money. Today money is available and the temptation is there. As Leader of the House, I will afford the Seanad any opportunity to debate this very serious issue. I will allow as much time as possible and I propose to have an all-day debate on this subject on Tuesday, 27 February 2001, with the permission of the House.</P>
      <P>This side of the House fully supports Senator O'Toole's proposal to invite EU Commissioner Solbes to come to the House. With your permission, Chathaoirligh, I request that the Committee on Practice and Procedure convene to discuss this proposal.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello and Coghlan inquired about the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000. Second Stage will be initiated on Wednesday, 21 February 2001. Senators Quill and Jackman called for funding to be put in place for the employment of litter wardens by the local authorities. I will inform the Minister of their views. Senator David Norris called for a debate on Northern Ireland. I agreed yesterday to allow time for this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Glynn, Jackman and Brendan Ryan expressed dismay at the increase in the number of cable TV companies, especially in the midlands. I <Col N="285" /> will ask the Minister for a reply. I note Senator Ryan's remark about the Competition Authority. It is a very worthwhile suggestion and I will pass his views on to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Kett called for mandatory sentencing for unprovoked attacks which are taking place in major cities and towns. I agree with his views and I will pass them on to the Minister for Justice and Law Reform. I will pass on the views of Senator Coghlan regarding the single regulatory authority.</P>
    <P>I wish to inform Senator Coogan that the local government Bill will pass all Stages by Easter and that is still the Government's intention. Senators Bonner and John Cregan inquired about the report on housing aid for the elderly and they ask that this become the responsibility of the local authorities. I will pass those views to the Minister and also Senator Bonner's views on the National Roads Authority and the tragic road accident at Slane, County Meath.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke called for a debate on the BMW regional fund. Each local authority must have its plans in place for the enormous funds available. For the six years from 2000 to 2006, £6 million per day is being spent in the BMW region. This region consists of 13 counties and it is up to every local authority and county development board to have its plans in place. I fully agree with Senator Burke that we should review the fund annually.</P>
    <P>The following is a list of 18 Bills expected to be published during this session: the Agricultural Appeals Office Bill, the Heritage Fund Bill, the Licensing of Indoor Events Bill, the Road Traffic Bill, the ACC Bank Bill, the Audit of Allowances of Parliamentary Party Leaders Bill, the Dormant Accounts Bill, the Euro Changeover Amounts Bill, the Finance Bill, the Ordnance Survey Bill, the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Bill, the Courts and Courts' Officers Bill, the Human Rights ( Incorporation of European Convention) Bill, the Irish Energy (Central) Bill, the Postal (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the Transport (Rail Infrastructure) Bill, the Pensions Bill and the Social Welfare Bill. The Government will publish all these Bills in the present session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister back to the House. I am afraid I may be a little less eloquent this morning than I was last week, as I had eaten and drunk well on the night in question. I reiterate the point I made last week regarding RTÉ. <Col N="286" /> While it is worthy of support as a public service broadcaster, it has obligations as well as rights. It is obliged not to be coerced but to reflect the real and genuine complexities which make Ireland an interesting place. RTÉ's function is not to replace a, perhaps dated, version of Irishness with another which reflects a particular view of the world, what I would call <i>The Irish Times</i> view of the world. <i>The Irish Times </i>is entitled to have its view of the world because its readers share that view. It rarely provokes the world view of its readership. Many of those who form opinions in RTÉ only read <i>The Irish Times </i>and believe that is the entire world, not the 90,000 people who buy that newspaper.</P>
      <P>RTÉ is very good at producing investigative reports on two sectors who fully deserve it, the public sector and the church. I have said a dozen times in this House and in other places that the old Goldenbridge orphanage is one of the places RTÉ loves to film. There has been a procession of photographers, cameramen, colour piece writers, etc., out to write about it. Beside Goldenbridge is the worst complex of high-rise flats in Dublin and I know it very well because I helped some of the people there to put together a development programme. What intrigues me is that not one of the commentators, writers, camera-persons, photographers or journalists who went out to look at Goldenbridge even saw the appalling complex of high-rise flats that was beside it, because that was not the issue they were pursuing.</P>
      <P>There is a great need for criticism of current mores and of things that are invisible. One of those is the absence of prosperity from about 40% of the population who are either in poverty, or living on close to poverty wages, with public services in health and housing that no-one in this House has to live with. That is to a considerable degree invisible. While there are worthy programmes about these issues, the basic principle is that Ireland is now prosperous and we are all much better off. That is the assumption. It is occasionally challenged by bits of programmes, but the overall assumption remains the same.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go back over my comments on RTÉ's extraordinary Dublin bias, including the predilection of &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; to focus on people from Dublin in its panel choice. I reiterate that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin's announcement of a code of practice on advertising and young people will, if enforced, close down a number of the new radio stations opening up. If there is no alcohol advertising where more than 25% of the audience is under 18, then a good number of those stations will close and if their viability is based on advertising alcohol to people under 18 then they should close.</P>

    <P>The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaelteacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, like many of her predecessors, has talked about choice and the need to produce high quality indigenous services. Let us not get carried away with choice. The satellite services rarely break 10% of the audience. <Col N="287" /> Some 90% of viewers in Britain watch the dull old reliable terrestrial services that were supposed to be under threat. I suspect the figure here is even higher. If Sky Sports did not carry premiership soccer the percentage who watched satellite television would drop to about 3% or 2%. It is an effective monopoly given that Sky Sports purchased something that everybody is interested in by spending an enormous amount of money. That has given the satellite services a foothold among British viewing audiences.</P>
    <P>What we did was different when we introduced commercial television. In Britain that service provides different views of the country and of British life. It looks at different things, some high brow, some low brow, but provides different choices as well as being essentially made in Britain. What we have, in the name of diversity, is a singular view represented by &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo; first, second, third, and fourth, &ldquo;Eastenders&rdquo; fifth and sixth, &ldquo;Emmerdale&rdquo; ninth, &ldquo;Eastenders&rdquo; tenth and &ldquo;Emmerdale&rdquo; eleventh. Those placings represent one week of top viewing audiences for TV3. I am intrigued as to what new choice we have as those programmes were available before, and are still available from their country of origin now that we have TV3. A small minority cannot view the British television channels, but that is all.</P>
    <P>The Minister has got to insist, if necessary in this legislation, that a third Irish television channel has something about it which makes it identifiably an alternative choice. There is an alternative television station available and it is called TG4, but that station is under-funded and under-resourced.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the licence fee. If you believe the myth of the market, which I do not, then the licence fee is a nonsense. If, as most people are beginning to realise, you have limited resources in terms of technological skills or scale, etc., then it is necessary to intervene in the marketplace to provide diversity. One of the most imaginative ways is by a television licence fee. I am not sure about the scale of RTÉ's licence fee increase, but they are under-funded in terms of licence fee income and that is a great pity. Senator Ross and myself had a motion down for years, in the days when I was an Independent, supporting a once-off licence fee, and a mechanism independent of Government for a regular review and increase of that licence fee. RTÉ might do things I do not like, but if they were not there nothing that most of us are interested in would be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence that the alternatives to RTÉ will do the things that most of us believe are important. The new television service, TV3, does not do any live sports broadcasting, but buys other things and uses other people's facilities. TG4, on a limited budget and with a <Col N="288" /> limited mandate, does more to cover Irish sport than the so-called competitor to RTÉ, TV3. That is a commentary on our failure to put together regulation of television that guarantees that a further channel would be commercially viable and represent serious diversity. A licence fee is for the encouragement of diversity, for looking at alternative ways, for innovation, for minorities, etc.</P>
      <P>Providing more and more channels, as has been the case in most other countries, will not provide different television programmes. It will provide a miasma of sameness with a few spectacular exceptions. That is an issue that is far from being addressed and it is true whether we talk about television or much that passes for radio.</P>
      <P>Where it is has been done properly, local radio has been an enormous success but there is no local radio in Dublin, for example. There are just two stations which are unashamed competitors of 2FM. Those who live in Cork would say that RTÉ is the Dublin local radio station. There is a degree of truth in that but it is not the point. I am not entirely sure why, as Senator Mooney said, a diversity of radio stations to cover a diversity of tastes is not possible. Why is there the belief that one particular market is the only market? I know that people with grey hair might have lots of money, but they are not as easily parted from it by sophisticated advertising as younger people with lots of money, and there is no point trying to focus advertising at older people.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about section 37 of the Bill which seems to give the multiplex or the transmission company a monopoly on the necessary equipment to convert digital back. I do not see why there should be one single provider of that. I may be looking at the wrong section; I will come back to it.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that the transmission company and the multiplex company should be referred to as companies incorporated under the Companies Act. We have perhaps the most secretive companies legislation in the world under which it is virtually impossible to find out much about what a company is doing. These are companies that will have effective monopolies and they should be covered by company legislation which reflects their unique status and not by the catch-all of the Companies Act which as I said is profoundly secretive and profoundly unfriendly to anybody who wants to find out anything about it. We should have some commitment that the transmission company and the multiplex company will be covered by something similar to the Freedom of Information Act and that they ought to be accessible and accountable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá an-díomá orm faoin laghad airgid atá á chur ar fáil do TG4 faoi láthair agus, b'fhéidir níos tábhachtaí, nach bhfuil aon bharántas ann go mbeidh airgead ar fáil dóibh as seo amach. There is nothing in the legislation which will guarantee TG4's continued funding by the State. There is nothing that says that it must be funded in any <Col N="289" /> way directly or indirectly. That fund could be halved, quartered or &ndash; I do not think this will happen &ndash; ended and they could be left to sing.</P>
    <P>TG4 is also hopelessly under-funded. The sum of £16 million per year is a very small amount on which to run a television channel. At a time of considerable affluence and in the interests of both the language and diversity in television, TG4 deserves to be much more generously funded. What it has done with its resources is a marvellous achievement and it deserves much more. It needs statutory guarantees about its future funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an Aire agus tá áthas orm go bhfuil an Bille ós comhair an Tí. I welcome this legislation to the House. It has been a very long time in gestation and I am glad that it is here now &ndash; not before its time. We are now on the threshold of the advent of digital television, which will change everything fundamentally. We must make proper provision in law to ensure the new regime will be made to benefit as many viewers and as many citizens as possible. The prospect of a choice of 30 channels is indeed an exciting one, provided that there is real choice as opposed to the kind of choice between weak tea and cold coffee. It is also a very daunting prospect, particularly when we consider how our national broadcaster, RTÉ, will fare in the new regime. That is the first question I want to explore.</P>
      <P>A key question is how the national broadcaster will fare in this new maelstrom. How will it continue to discharge its public service remit? How successfully will it be enabled to compete for advertising, for example, in the teeth of such unprecedented competition? To what extent will it be enabled to promulgate the cultural values that enrich contemporary life and promote citizenship?</P>
      <P>Citizenship is something that needs to be considered very carefully. The question of promoting citizenship is one that is more acute now than ever before considering the large number of people who feel disenfranchised, who feel democracy is not worthy of support and who demonstrate that by their reluctance to come out and vote on polling day. There is a strong obligation on a national broadcaster to seek with greater intensity to promote citizenship, to keep in place current affairs programmes of a very high calibre and of independent turn of mind and to put in place very well researched news bulletins, which RTÉ does very well, frequently and on a daily basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The making of quality television programmes does not come easily and does not come cheap, yet when quality programmes are on offer, the viewership soars. We have evidence of that from the viewership, for example, of Sean Ó Mordha's wonderful documentary &ldquo;Seven Ages&rdquo; and also, more recently, the viewership for Gerry Stembridge's programme &ldquo;Black Day at Blackrock&rdquo;. <Col N="290" /> There is an audience and an appetite there for quality television and this has been demonstrated.</P>
    <P>In addition to its obligation to make more of these types of programmes, that would I hope be the norm rather than the exception, RTÉ is expected to support the National Symphony Orchestra, the RTÉ Concert Orchestra and the Vanbrugh String Quartet. We put a very heavy obligation on RTÉ.</P>
    <P>While we rightly ask a great deal of RTÉ, what are we prepared to pay for all we ask? The environment in the future will be more challenging than in the past. That is a key question for policy makers. RTÉ is looking for an increase in the licence fee from £70 to £120. That is the magnitude of the increase sought. If RTÉ is to be given any increase, it must demonstrate that it will continue to make programmes to the high quality I have mentioned. It must demonstrate that it has the capacity, expertise and sufficient staff to produce the kinds of programmes I have picked out for special mention.</P>
    <P>Before RTÉ can confidently ask for an increase in the licence fee, it should be prepared to look at what it already has. RTÉ does not need three channels to enable it to discharge its public service remit. Network 2 does not add greatly to the kind of quality programme making that I speak of. It is largely a channel which specialises on imported television programmes and movies and RTÉ should now sell it off or franchise it out. This then would free up RTÉ to develop a new dynamic, digital service in conjunction with RTÉ1 and TG4. TG4 is grossly underdeveloped and under-funded and is not available in large tracts of the country. I argue very strongly that RTÉ could discharge its public service remit in a dynamic fashion with the use of two channels. I ask the Minister to consider that.</P>
    <P>This would enable RTÉ to make quality programmes, like Seán Ó Mordha's &ldquo;Seven Ages,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bad Day at Blackrock.&rdquo;  They were successes, attracting huge audiences. These are the conditions that should be imposed for an increased licence fee. The leap from £70 to £120 is excessive. It has to be proved that it is deserved. RTÉ is at a crossroads and should restructure itself as a first step.</P>
    <P>I admire radio, and television too although I do not have much time to watch it. I was breastfed on RTÉ 1. Radio opened up the world to and kindled the imaginations of my generation. It set the world alight for us. I admire RTÉ 1. I rejoice in its achievements as it celebrates a tradition of 75 years.</P>
    <P>Good quality local radio is of social and cultural benefit. It is important that it is nourished at a time of globalisation. Local radio keeps the folk tradition, colour and personality of a locality alive. It maintains the richness of our culture. It is the bulwark against the dumbing down caused by globalisation, that is soap to suds and suds to soap.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> I am concerned about the provisions in the Bill dealing with radio. Should it be the function of the Independent Radio and Television Commission to regulate licences that are due for renewal? It must continue to fulfil its duties responsibly in its new form. The Independent Radio and Television Commission is not required to re-advertise every five years. This does not benefit local radio. Market forces apply and the better local stations rise to the top like cream. Those with no proper structure and nothing to offer are weeded out. A number of bodies have invested in management and training in local radio. Consequently the standard has improved greatly. We must not endanger this in the Bill. People in the industry need to have a certainty about future regulation. This is needed to attract investment and retain staff. I ask the Minister to consider this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Lyric FM is a great success. It recognises that people have different tastes and like to listen to different things at different times. It is increasing its audience. It gives a good service which is an alternative to constant talk. It is refreshing, particularly if travelling in a car, to tune in to Lyric FM. People ringing in to chat shows with their complaints and ailments is overbearing. I remember a pop song, &ldquo;Don't Tell Me Your Troubles, I've Got Troubles Of My Own&rdquo;. I sometimes feel like that about chat shows. The option of Lyric FM is sustaining.</P>
    <P>We need a television channel dedicated to education, for young and old embracing the concept of life-long learning. I heard an American economist saying that 20% of the jobs that will be needed in 20 years' time have not yet been invented. Unless we value life-long education we will not be able to cope with that kind of change. Television is a powerful educational medium, if properly planned and linked to other institutions. I hope that in the digital era we have a station dedicated to education. In particular it must address European languages and cultures which are dealt with in a threadbare manner in schools. The pressure at second level to take nine subjects, to get 999 points for the CAO limits time for other subjects. Television enables people to return to education in a setting and at a time which suits them. There must be such a television channel, similar to Lyric FM on radio.</P>
    <P>There is a resource in TG4 which is underutilised. The Minister must consider this in regard to the capacity which would allow RTÉ to discharge its public service remit. This Bill is vague on TG4. It will be put on a statutory basis but to what end? What benefit will it confer on the station, viewers and RTÉ? When will this happen? What other changes will follow?</P>
    <P>Many bright young people produce programmes for TG4. We should see more of these, but they are not on offer. There is great scope for developing the young people concerned, for using the channel for commissioning films and drama <Col N="292" /> programmes, of which there are not enough on television. If there were more such programmes, I am sure I would make time to watch them. If indigenous films were available for viewing more frequently, I am sure I would make time to watch them also. I cannot see how TG4 can achieve that aspiration. It is most disappointing that it is not available in large tracts of the country many years after its establishment. It is one of the matters which must be examined in what is a new era.</P>
    <P>I am not certain that I have anything else or useful to say. If that is the case, perhaps I should do the honourable thing and sit down. If I was to suggest that there are times when television is filled with programmes which are largely meaningless, perhaps I should not fill my contribution with comments which are not full of meaning.</P>
    <P>I am serious about the future of public service broadcasting. We regularly discuss items and state that they are matters for legislation and then societal matters, but the major carriers of meaning in society are education, religion and the media. It is in that context that we should consider the importance of nurturing the national broadcaster and assisting it produce the best programmes at all times. That is my intention. I hope that, as a result of the enactment of this legislation, there will be a renewed effort to make that happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much enjoyed the contribution of Senator Quill. I am in agreement with what she said.</P>
      <P>The Bill has come close to celebrating its second birthday. I am sure, therefore, the Minister will be happy to see it on the Statute Book before we have a party and light candles. As it has been widely debated, I will only make a brief contribution. The main points of principle have been made by my party colleagues in the Dáil and by Senator Coghlan. I will unashamedly concentrate on one issue, which was raised by Senator Quill. The other points I wish to make will keep for Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I declare an interest in the matter. My brother works for RTÉ, although I have never appeared on his programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps for different reasons. I delcare my interest, lest I am accused of not doing so.</P>
      <P>I would strongly support a substantial increase in the RTÉ licence fee and urge the Minister to consider the case for it. I would do so without apology. It may not be necessary to increase it by £50, as RTÉ is asking; slightly more than half may be sufficient, but its case must be analysed properly. I ask the Minister not only to have an open mind, but to place the concept of public service broadcasting high in her thinking in coming to a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="293" /> RTÉ is at the heart of the country. The concept of public service broadcasting, as developed by it, is one which stands up to the closest scrutiny. Not everything within it is perfect, however. None is of us is under an illusion about that. There are broadcasters who annoy us and whom we think are unfair. There are areas, of which Senator Quill outlined a number, where the station could do a great deal better. There are some appallingly bad programmes. While I accept all these assertions, it is an institution made up of human beings and has its failings. It has missed opportunities. At times it can be guilty of corporate arrogance. Some of its presenters can be guilty of personal arrogance. All those points can be made, many of which can be sustained.</P>
    <P>What put this matter in perspective for me were many of the programmes over Christmas commemorating the 75th anniversary of RTÉ. They placed it in a wider perspective because RTÉ is almost as old as the State and its history mirrors its many developments. When one looks back one thinks of the early days where in a single room studio in Great Denmark Street two or three people kept the service going, and of the move to the studios in Middle Abbey Street and over the GPO. This shows how far RTÉ has come. It can also be seen that the philosophy underpinning the station from the very beginning has been the right one.</P>
    <P>In the early years especially, RTÉ suffered from chronic under-funding and considerable bureaucratic interference by the Civil Service. At times it suffered from political censorship or timidity. In the 1940s James Dillon, who was frequently ahead of the pack, proposed that the full proceedings of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann be broadcast live. He was of the view that this would be one way of bringing Parliament directly to the people, but he was laughed at and told that the people were not interested or that it could not be done. I hope with the advent of digital television that with a press of a button citizens will be able to see what is happening in Seanad Éireann, Dáil Éireann and committees. That day is not far off. It is in that sense that broadcasting would be bringing the workings of Parliament directly to the people.</P>
    <P>When one looks at RTÉ today in an international perspective one will see that it is a station which has high editorial and governance standards, which were laid down in legislation during the years, the aim of which is to create a radio and television station which will be at the service of, not a slave to, the people. It fulfils that service, as far as possible, by telling the truth about current affairs and events, allowing us to engage with our literature and film, helping the creative arts, bringing sporting activity directly to the people and providing recreational entertainment, all of which it does well.</P>
    <P>Senator Quill mentioned Lyric FM, an absolutely marvellous radio station. There are many other services provided by RTÉ which would not <Col N="294" /> stand up to the highest or tightest commercial scrutiny. We live in a world where the influence of the market has become excessive, but there is more to a country than market forces. There are other values which are part of a nation. A service such as that provided by RTÉ is a vitally important part of what we are. The bad things one could say about RTÉ are outweighed by the good it has done in helping us to evolve as a people, to better understand ourselves and in performing its basic functions of bringing us in a fair manner news, comment and information on the world about us. We should stand back from this rush to allow market forces rule. Everything should not be dictated by market forces in respect of which I have huge worries. I would much prefer to see a strong RTÉ within a statutory framework, with a broadly representative board of governors selected by the Government, some of whom would be elected by the staff, which does take its brief seriously in a dominant position than one controlled by Rupert Murdoch&mdash;</P>

However, equally, public service broadcasting must be strong, vibrant and capable of fending off the attacks of commercial predators while also having a space within which it can grow.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will subject the RTÉ request to the most rigorous scrutiny on the basis that public service broadcasting is a fundamental part of our value system. It is something the country needs and which has been enormously beneficial. I am an unapologetic supporter of whatever increase the Minister decides is warranted.</P>

      <P>If we believe in strong public service broadcasting, we must give it the resources, subject to scrutiny, to enable it to be strong. We do not want an enfeebled, cowardly public service broadcasting system prey to attacks from outside groups and unable to do its best in presenting what it has done best over the years. That is the point I wanted to make. We need to stand back, see it in perspective, examine what RTÉ has done over the years, examine how important it is to have strong public service broadcasting and be brave after that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill. I congratulate the Minister and her officials for bringing this fine legislation before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the great work RTÉ has done in its 75 years of working for Ireland as the media face of Ireland from its beginnings under the Minister's grandfather, the former Taoiseach and President, Éamon de Valera, through the periods <Col N="295" /> in office of various Taoisigh, Presidents and Ministers with responsibility for communications who have had the privilege to hold the office and who have over the past 75 years made RTÉ the great station we know it to be. The media clips from the past 75 years serve to remind us of the achievements our country has made in that time and it is wonderful RTÉ was present to record historic events and keep them in its archive. It reminds us from time to time how difficult it was in the early years of the State and what we have achieved to bring us into the digital age, as Senator Mooney called it, the challenge of which we now face and which heralds another great phase in broadcasting to which we look forward.</P>
    <P>RTÉ, the public service broadcaster, must be and will be supported by the Government, especially under Fianna Fáil. Public service broadcasting is something of which we are proud and which forms part of our heritage and part of Ireland. With the legislation under discussion, we will ensure the wonderful work done by RTÉ continues. It faces enormous competition which it has never faced before. It is a challenge in which we must support it fully by giving it the tools of its work, namely, the financial resources to continue its endeavours on behalf of the taxpayer and the people.</P>
    <P>RTÉ has risen to the challenge of broadcasting special events which take place here occasionally and which need enormous resources. This was never more obvious to people, inside or outside Ireland, than in the late 1970s when the Holy Father visited Ireland and RTÉ responded in a wonderful manner to the challenge of covering the his visit. In the world of entertainment, no other country of similar size has achieved the success we have with our Eurovision song contest entries. Enormous resources had to be spent by RTÉ to cover these events but it showed Europe how well it responded to the enormous challenge. I congratulated the station as Fianna Fáil spokesperson in the Seanad on communications, a position I held for 11 years, on the way it responded. Despite things being very difficult in Ireland, it showed Europe what a marvellous young population we had, how successful we were in winning the Eurovision on many occasions with the talent of our writers and composers and what talent existed in a small country of 3.5 million people. This was shown through the terrific national broadcasting public service station known to us as RTÉ.</P>
    <P>I have worked with many producers and presenters in radio and television for more than 30 years and it has been a complete labour of love. Product, such as a new release, was judged on the basis that if it was good, it was given fair play and exposure and if it was not, one was told so in no uncertain terms. There had to be a standard and one was rewarded if one's product was of that standard. I had a sponsored programme on RTÉ when it only had one radio station. That one <Col N="296" /> station had an unbelievable impact in that, if a programme was broadcast in the afternoon, such as mine which was broadcast at 2.15 p.m. after the Glen Abbey programme, one was in the office until 12 o'clock that night because 75% to 80% of people listening to radio were listening to that programme. At that time artists had a magnificent business, as Senator Mooney would know having been in the business for a long time, being very respected and having achieved an enormous amount on behalf of artists. When only one radio station existed, it was easier to give artists a start.</P>
    <P>The position is different and more difficult today. I wish to be helpful to artists in my contribution because when I entered this House I was a musician and had been a band leader for 18 or more years. Public service broadcasting has a duty and an obligation to create an opportunity, a shop window for artists. Private enterprise can do as it wishes because it comprises commercial entities. However, the public service broadcaster should always be in a position to give young talent and existing entertainers a right to live and have their wares aired in their own country. In the days of sponsored programmes, there was the single, album and power play of the week on Radio One. Now, for reasons best known to us all, they no longer exist on that station or on 2FM. I say this as one of the largest and best supporters in the commercial world of local record company people and publishers.</P>
    <P>Everyone with whom I have been associated over the years will know I have been a committed supporter of radio and television under the auspices of RTÉ and will continue to be so. In an effort to be helpful, perhaps something could be done on behalf of the many hundreds of artists, songwriters, publishers and record company people who depend on public service broadcasting. Perhaps the RTÉ Authority, the director general and the controller of programmes could re-examine this issue to see if the single, album and power play of the week could be brought back. We could then develop a business. If there was an opportunity for a young, talented person from Clare or Westmeath who makes an album to display that album and sell 30,000 or 40,000 units, that would also give an opportunity to the recording studio in Scarriff, Headford or wherever. The people behind these studios would make a great contribution. Ten jobs created in Castlepollard or Scarriff are as important as 100 jobs in a larger town.</P>
    <P>I thank RTÉ television for the wonderful programmes it has produced down through the years, &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;, Donncha Ó Dulaing's programmes and Liam Ó Murchú's &ldquo;Trom agus Éadrom&rdquo;. Many wonderful people have been involved in helping Irish artists. &ldquo;Open House&rdquo; looks after the interests of Irish artists now.</P>
    <P>Many contributions have been and will continue to be made about RTÉ during this debate and the debate on Committee Stage. The success of &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo;, Lord of the Dance, U2, Enya, <Col N="297" /> Clannad and the Corrs has given us massive credibility as a young vibrant nation. They have been wonderful ambassadors. People providing middle of the road music have also been very successful. We have achieved an enormous amount, but upcoming artists will also need support.</P>
    <P>Radio 1 provides speech only programmes from 8 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. when Ronan Collins's show comes on air. Lyric FM is a wonderful station. RTÉ radio does not broadcast programmes which play music aimed at people in the 35 year old and upwards bracket. I played a major part in the introduction of local radio licences. Local radio stations have made a marvellous contribution to the airwaves. I wish to pay tribute to local Radio 3 in the midlands and all other local radio stations for their commitment to local matters. They have a tremendous advantage in being local and that is the reason they are so enormously successful. Surely RTÉ can broadcast music which promotes Irish artists from 8 a.m. until 3 p.m, which is prime time listening.</P>
    <P>Compliments are deserved on everything that has been done to date. Lyric FM has a listenership of 3%. If it broadcasts a middle of the road music segment for two hours, that percentage might increase to approximately 20% or 25 %. I say that as an advertiser and a person who has been associated with this business for a long time. Those in the 35 years of age plus group are starved of music.</P>
    <P>I am ware there is a time limit for contributions &ndash; I proposed it myself. I look forward to enhancing this debate. I congratulate local radio for their contribution to Irish broadcasting.</P>

      <P>It is always a pleasure to welcome this Minister to the House and to listen to the Leader's contribution. However, I must disagree with him on one matter. I think he should declare an interest in this debate &ndash; perhaps he has, he usually does. I would like to nail my colours firmly to the mast in that Lyric FM is one of the best things that has ever happened in wireless broadcasting in Ireland. It is very important that we maintain our high quality of music and it is also educational. Many people who may not have suspected they had an interest in classical music have been led to it by the superb quality of broadcasting at that radio station. Of course one would <Col N="298" /> receive more advertisers if one played Foster and Allen's music but I think there is another place for that.</P>
      <P>I will not waste time attacking Rupert Murdoch &ndash; the House is aware of my views in that regard. I am delighted a bulwark to protect the integrity of our national airwaves has been negotiated into this Bill and I am very pleased it provides a clear definition of public service broadcasting. That is badly needed because there is a great deal of pap out there. I am currently suffering a little from insomnia and have been watching the television from my bed zapping from station to station. Horrendous programmes are being broadcast and we are subjected to the vulgarity being induced from highly intelligent people such as Jerry Springer. This is cascading in, we cannot defend against it by jamming but we can at least provide an intelligent alternative.</P>
      <P>We can produce wonderful programmes here. I am very proud of much of what has already been produced. I am thankful we are now employing people like Gerry Stembridge. Half of the broadcasters in the BBC, such as Terry Wogan etc. are of Irish origin. Let us use our own talent. I do not think RTÉ should be exclusively driven by contract, that is neurotic. Artists should be nurtured in RTÉ.</P>
      <P>I am also happy to see that provision is being made for subtitling. I have been approached by people in this regard who are hard of hearing. I do not think the provision is strong enough and it is my intention to table an amendment to it. I hope the Government will be in a position to accept it.</P>
      <P>The question of accessibility throughout Ireland to RTÉ programmes which reflect Irish culture has been raised. It is not technically possible to receive the RTÉ signal throughout the entire island. If we are serious about creating harmony &ndash; I am not talking about political union &ndash; we need to achieve this degree of penetration so that we at least hear what the other is saying. It is very important that we do this.</P>
      <P>I would like to draw attention to the questions raised by Muiris Mac Conghal in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> in which he says this Bill is only of interest to broadcasting organisations, it is very narrow, it is a turf war between different Ministries and the selling off of Cablelink. I am sure the Minister is aware of those arguments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly support TG4. I will not say, tá an Gaeilge go maith agam agus ba mhaith liom an Gaeilge a labhairt go minic sa Seanad because it simply would not be true. I possess a cúpla focal of buntús comhrá which I like trotting out sometimes. It is a mark of our definitive cultural status. We have an opportunity, with the establishment of digital terrestrial television, to improve the TG4 signal which is not universal. We must undertake to ensure that it is available throughout Ireland. There is a strong argument for it to include a must carry status on MMDS. It has car<Col N="299" /> ried out a survey in this regard and is aware that it is not covered.</P>
    <P>The question also arises regarding TG4 as an independent entity. I have received a briefing on this. It contains a certain amount of pious aspiration saying things like, &ldquo;we are going to do this&rdquo;. Let us set a date for the establishment of TG4 as an independent separate entity. We should set out clear milestones so that we know the way in which we are advancing. We should state clearly what Exchequer funding will be provided, otherwise it will remain in the realms of a pious aspiration. We ought to receive guidelines in this regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation which should be used, if we are serious about supporting the language, in a more vigorous manner to support TG4. TG4 may never be self-sufficient and may require Government funding. There is an appetite out there for the language. One only has to look a short distance from here to see two or three Irish speaking cafés, Dáil Bia and Trí-D &ndash; there is a nice little bilingual pun there. We have moved away from the old-fashioned idea of rejecting a vision of Ireland with which the Minister's grandfather was associated. I sometimes wonder why. The notion that is pilloried about healthy active young people being able to enjoy themselves in a decent relationship with their environment is not laughable. I do not know why it was ever pilloried. It is something we can return to.</P>
    <P>Even though it was purported that I had been sentenced to death by the Provisional IRA, I strongly supported the abolition of section 31 as it was not useful in terms of civil rights and should have gone. There are other ways of protecting ourselves against this insidious material and the best way is the kind of argument we traditionally make here. We are not babies and do not need to be protected in this way, which is a violation of civil rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This welcome Bill is moving forward well. I do not have significant problems with the issues it raises, though I will also be tabling an amendment on subtitling. That is an important issue as broadcasting services should recognise the requirements of those with special needs and respond accordingly and proactively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding digital broadcasting, there has been a huge debate over the past two years about masts. I made the same point when we started debating mobile phones many years ago: why did we not skip a generation and go straight to satellite? Why do we need masts at all, apart from having a backup system? Why do we not concentrate on satellites, which means no unsightly masts or rows with local communities or environmental groups? We should use geostationary satellites, as there are now backup systems and we would not have to rely on just one and could move the service from one satellite to another if <Col N="300" /> change was needed. That would bring a welcome improvement to the countryside.</P>
    <P>Is there a significant difference between terrestrial digital broadcasting and satellite digital broadcasting? If the Bill explains any such difference, perhaps the Minister will point it out to me, but as far as I know there is none. I am particularly interested in technical issues such as the range of digital terrestrial broadcasting as opposed to conventional terrestrial broadcasting. Is there a difference in range? Could one satellite cover the whole island and much more? I raise the issue with reference to those living in remote areas and reception black spots, as satellites would solve their problems.</P>
    <P>The future of broadcasting will be much more specialised. I do not watch a lot of television, but I have had digital television for a number of years and it is very useful for information. I see no future for MMDS, no more than I saw a future for deflector or mast systems; the whole system should be satellite based. The joy of digital broadcasting is that if someone is interested in money, there are four or five different finance stations: the Money Channel, the Financial Times Channel, the Economist Channel and CNBC. They are available on digital television at the touch of a button. If someone is interested in news, there is ITN News, Sky News, CNN and several others. There are also five MTV channels. One may ask why there is a need for five such channels, but it is good to have them because that is how people learn to use broadcasting; they can select the kind of music they want.</P>
    <P>Digital television also includes the National Geographic Channel, the History Channel, the Biography Channel and drama channels, which give a great choice. A new Arts Channel which began last month would address many of the issues raised by Senator Norris. I made a point of watching that channel last weekend while preparing for this debate and it showed some extraordinarily good shows. There are also movie and sports channels available.</P>
    <P>We discussed pay-per-view at length with the Minister some time ago and welcomed her protection of the annual events of various national sporting institutions. That was very important, but whether people like it, pay-per-view is the future as long as it is affordable. Fans of Celtic and Rangers had to pay £12 to watch a football game on television at home, which is outrageous, but people do not find it outrageous to pay £3 for a film because it compares with going to the local video shop. We have to have a rational view on this.</P>
    <P>Tá an-jab ar siúl ag TG4 agus tá a lán de na cláir atá ar fáil uathu i bhfad níos fearr ná mar a cheap aon duine againn go mbéadh. Is cuimhin liom a bheith ag plé Teilifís na Gaeilge anseo le deich mbliain anuas. Is cuimhin liom féin agus Éamon Ó Cuív ag cur brú ar Charlie Haughey na blianta ó shin chun £5 milliún a chur ar fáil chun an tseirbhís nua a chur ar bun. Is cuimhin liom, <Col N="301" /> go mór mór an bhliain seo caite, go raibh clár amháin acu, &ldquo;Rothaí Mór an tSaoil&rdquo;, mar shampla, a chuaigh go gach cúinne den domhain, i ndáiríre.</P>
    <P>Tá an talent acu siúd chun jab an-mhaith a dhéanamh ar son na teanga agus ar son cultúr na tíre. Tá sé an-tábhachtach go mbeadh an tacaíocht ann dóibh.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire agus roimh an mBille. Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá faoin raidió áitiúil.</P>
      <P>Local radio has done great work and deserves our congratulations. The difference between local radio and national broadcasters is that when one is on local radio one is allowed to say what one has to say. Unfortunately, national radio and television sometimes carry comment on what different Ministers have said. It is sad to see two or three journalists interviewing each other about what they think a Minister will say. That should be discouraged. We should wait until someone says something, then their comments can be discussed.</P>
      <P>There should also be more balance in programmes from the national broadcaster, though the Minister cannot do anything about that. A recent programme about St. Theresa's Gardens was completely one-sided, showing only the bad side of the area. There are two good football pitches in the area as well as good social workers and voluntary workers, but that good work was ignored. The cameras should show both sides, as what is broadcast is taken as the norm by those watching. They are of the view that that is what the whole area is like. Credit should be given to the many people working hard to improve life in the area. Praise should also be given to successive Governments, councils and health boards for investing money in the area. There should be more balance and both sides should be shown. A whole area should not be condemned because of what one small section of the population is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The media can be harsh about politicians. I am not worried about fair comment, but there is cynicism about the political system because of the manner in which politicians' actions are fed to the public. There are many good things said both here and in the Dáil, but a report is crushed into three or four minutes. If someone says something daft or foolish, that is what will be highlighted. Senator Manning made a positive speech, but there will not be one word about it on the national airwaves. The media should adopt a more positive approach. We need a national ser<Col N="302" /> vice, but they should give a fairer crack of the whip and report both sides of a story.</P>
    <P>The media also seem to be anti-mast, but we all want a mobile phone. Every parent in the country will tell you how great it is that their children have mobile phones. They can ring home if they cannot get a lift or if something is wrong. We cannot have mobile phones and services if we do not have the infrastructure. The infrastructure is a mast. I believe masts will be short lived and that over the next five to ten years a completely satellite infrastructure will be put in place.</P>
    <P>In the short term we must put up with masts. The media encourages the perception that masts are deadly. If that were true everyone out in Montrose should be ten years dead. There are more aerials and high-voltage cables there than in any other part of Ireland, yet it is also the most valuable property in the country. I think we should therefore ask the media to be more broadminded on this subject. I would like the Minister to do something about it.</P>
    <P>I understand that An Post has the obligation of collecting television licence fees and is not doing it. About a third of people do not pay due to the bad collection system. I believe the Minister should give the responsibility to RTÉ and let it tender for an agent to collect the money. It is scandalous that there are so many houses and apartment complexes being built yet the number of licences is not increasing. I ask the Minister to look at the area of licence fee collection and return it to RTÉ which can in turn delegate it to the private sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOFearghaillFF" hpid="Mr. Ó Fearghail Mr. Ó Fearghail">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ó Fearghail</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fíorchaoin fáilte a chur roimh an Aire chuig an Teach. I acknowledge the generous manner in which the Minister has given her time to the House to debate this matter.</P>
      <P>I recognise the importance of the Bill, given the magnitude of the influence radio and television have in our lives and on society as a whole. I also acknowledge that the huge array of new channels that will flow from the enactment of this legislation will be predominantly commercial. I welcome the fact that this Bill puts in place a framework within which those channels will be transmitted. It is more important now than ever that this legislation redefine and support the public broadcasting remit of RTÉ.</P>
      <P>Other Senators in excellent contributions explored the current performance of RTÉ in pursuit of its public service remit across its two television stations and its two principal radio services. Notwithstanding the general high standards which prevail in RTÉ I share the concern that was eloquently expressed by Senator Paschal Mooney regarding the current scheduling on Network 2. Questions were raised about the absence of adequate daily current affairs, educational or informative programming on 2FM. This is a point of particular significance given the huge share of the young audience that that radio station has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> RTÉ has quite rightly involved itself in a nationwide consultation process and is seeking a licence fee increase. Given the strong commitment in this House to the concept of public service broadcasting I am sure that after due consideration every Member will support RTÉ in its request for furthur funding, as l am sure the Minister will. If we are to have a quality service that service must be resourced.</P>
    <P>What RTÉ is learning in its consultation process across the country and what we are saying here is that what is wanted is more quality programming. Let the station have the self confidence, the courage of its convictions if you will, to produce more of its own material. It should develop on the work being done regionally where there is a network of RTÉ units in places like Cork, Galway, Sligo, Athlone, Waterford and Dundalk. What we want to see is more programming of the type that we see in &ldquo;Ear to the Ground,&rdquo;&ldquo;Léargas&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nationwide.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have identified the fact that standards are generally high in RTÉ but what of complaints? What of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission? I note that in the nine years up to early 2000 only about 80 complaints were processed by the commission in relation to RTÉ. Some 83% of those complaints were rejected, yet four out of five complaints against the independent stations were upheld. I wonder if RTÉ has reached a state of near perfection or is the Broadcasting Complaints Commission under resourced? Given the breadth and scale of material that will be broadcast into this country in the years ahead would the Minister tell us how the commission will be resourced?</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tacú le gach rud eile atá ráite ag na Seanadóirí eile. Irish language speakers must be very proud of what is being done by TG4. It has proved its worth. It has become a resource not just for schools, language enthusiasts and gaeilgeoirí. It is a major resource for the host of young families who have decided to educate their children through the medium of Irish. It brings the language to life for many young people living in communities where the language would not otherwise be heard. I endorse the call to give must-carry status on MMDS systems to TG4. I also seek assurances in relation to the continuance of funding for this station which is doing a superb job.</P>
    <P>In the area of local radio an absolutely superb job is being done. I see local radio as an important tool for local and community development. That they are is through the medium of the 20% news and current affairs not through the provision of wall to wall music. If that 20% demand was not there we would not be getting that particular service. I commend those who have been involved in ensuring that that is the way in which local radio has evolved. Maybe the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland would look at the pay and conditions of those who provide <Col N="304" /> that 20%. I understand the conditions are poor. Working hours are long and remuneration is not great in the local radio sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is very welcome. I will not go into the detail and technicalities of modern broadcasting nor would I be able to. I would be very conscious of how multi-channel is now dictating with regard to television and local radio. There is Chorus, for example, who are now taking over in Munster and will be based in Limerick. When I look at the Cork multi-channel situation and the deal done by the State to give them the benefits I often wonder about the line we took.</P>
      <P>I would be socialistic when it comes to RTÉ. There are four to five acres of equipment sheds in Donnybrook that in my opinion should be working a lot better. I think we should have total control in respect of all channels and I do not see why RTÉ could not have been handling them. They had the equipment and the facilities to be able to do that. More could be done by RTÉ, given the number of people working there, particularly in the Dublin area. We should be promoting RTÉ more. We cannot do this if it is a contradiction in terms.</P>
      <P>With regard to local radio, we are well served in Cork by private stations. The way they work with the small numbers they have makes us wonder why it takes RTÉ so much effort to operate. The amount of money that was put into equipment in Cork that is not being used mystifies me and I do not understand why Cork local radio station had to be closed. Yet private local stations can make profits in that region by providing a service RTÉ could very easily provide. Is RTÉ examining what is happening locally? Other Senators have also raised that point. RTÉ's coverage is only relevant to and oriented towards the Dublin area. I am not being biased, although I am a Cork man and why would I not be biased about Cork? When I travel to Dublin by car I constantly listen to RTÉ and if the listener phoning in is not from Inchicore, he or she is from Templeogue or some other area in the Dublin region. It appears nothing in that area is being done in the provinces. That is a big mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a mistake to close down local stations. We, as taxpayers, provide the funding for such facilities and then they become non-events in places such as Limerick, Tralee and Cork in particular. Cork has two stations, which were built at an enormous cost, but RTÉ is not using them to their potential. For example, it broadcasts only about two or three programmes from the Cork region every week, although programmes may be broadcast from that region on a particular Friday. Senator Mooney will be aware that the late show, which runs from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m., is broadcast from the Cork station, for which I thank the Minister. Probably nine-tenths of the nation are asleep when it is broadcast. While public representatives like myself travelling from Dublin would hear the <Col N="305" /> programme which I enjoy, I do not know who else would.</P>
    <P>While stations such as 96 FM and 103 FM produce great programmes, RTÉ used to produce excellent programmes in Cork. However, it did not get enough air time. The calibre of RTÉ staff in Cork at the time was excellent and they opened up debate on many issues. Senator Farrell made a good point, that when a listener from Dublin phones in to a radio programme, he or she is asked only for a comment, not his or her view on the subject being discussed. Listeners who phone in to Cork local radio can speak up, get replies to their questions and there is a good debate on the various issues.</P>
    <P>There are not many local affairs programmes on RTÉ. The local affairs programme introduced by the broadcaster after the news on RTÉ is excellent. There should be many more such programmes produced.</P>
    <P>I am concerned when I think of the amount of money we, the people, have put into two buildings to provide broadcasting facilities in Cork, which are now virtually bird sanctuaries. That is not the way to move forward and I will defy anyone to say otherwise. Millions of pounds was spent on those facilities and in other areas in Cork by RTÉ, but, as the Minister knows, they are not being used.</P>
    <P>The station provided no more than four years ago in Fr. Mathew Street in Cork is great, but I do not know what it is being used for. One would not get a second cheque for it, if that happened in the private sector, as there is no logic to it. I would like the Minister to explain why local radio in Cork has been eliminated. While Cork local radio was popular, it had only a limited number of hours on air and was not allowed to compete with private stations such as 96FM and others. I am not knocking 96FM, it produces great programmes, but people in Cork do not have access to local current affairs or local news programmes, although they hear a good deal of music on radio. I am not saying that there should not be as many music programmes on radio. The 96FM music programme on Sunday morning is excellent. All of Cork listens to it. RTÉ in Cork could be producing that type of programme, as it has the necessary staff and ability to do it.</P>
    <P>I am mystified by the amount of building taking place in RTÉ in Donnybrook and the manner in which its facilities in other parts of the country have been downgraded, a matter on which I seek clarification. I do not know how many producers or staff in general are employed in RTÉ, but I would like to know what they are doing in providing local coverage in my area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. I would not like anyone who has the ability to produce or direct not to be employed, but I would like them <Col N="306" /> to be employed throughout the country. I do not want them to be employed only to facilitate the transmission of a listener from Inchicore who phones in to Joe Duffy's radio programme or a listener from Greystones who phones in to Mr. Kenny's radio programme. They should facilitate listeners from Portloaise to the southern end of the country. It is as if those listeners are not there. They are taxpayers who must pay increases in licence fees and listen to programmes orientated and relevant only to the Dublin region from which they do not get local information. I am not jealous. It is most unfair that RTÉ local radio coverage was eliminated in Limerick and Tralee.</P>
      <P>The Irish television service in the west is doing well. I wish it well, although I do not watch it that often. I have no hesitation in saying that the satellite stations, such as Sky, are providing viewers with a choice of programmes, but RTÉ could have paid Sky and other such stations for the programmes they broadcast. Why was that not done? There are four acres of land in Donnybrook, parts of which have probably never been walked on. There are lamps in RTÉ which are probably covered in cobwebs and have never been lit. I am not being disrespectful, but factual. There are parts of RTÉ which have not been visited in a while. I will take that comment back, if I am wrong. I hope such areas are being used more than in the past. I do not know how many people are directly and indirectly employed by RTÉ.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to a point made by one of our best, Gay Byrne, who when asked in an interview last week why things are changing, admitted that local radio is locally orientated, that RTÉ is not the station it was 20 or 30 years ago. That is an admittance it was not able to handle local radio, nor was it prepared to fight to provide that service. I would not give in that easily and ask RTÉ to do likewise. As it had a facility before other stations, it should have used it to its potential. When 96FM first started it operated from a bungalow in Whitechurch. When Lord Mayor of Cork in 1991 I went to that bungalow to make a broadcast. If I had to go to RTÉ to make a broadcast, I would have to go through many offices and rooms of cable. 96FM's premises are no bigger now and it is doing extremely well, as are other local stations. I cannot understand why RTÉ has withdrawn its local radio service from the area. If one were to see the equipment in the facility in Father Mathew Street, one would think one was in Titusville, in Florida, from where the satellite stations operate. There is almost as much equipment in the facilities in Cork, but they are not being used. Why is RTÉ not making more use of its existing facilities in this area? Why is it not availing more of the skills of the exceptionally good staff it employs? I could name some exceptional individuals for whom Cork would be very relevant but are not being used there. Why is it not competing more with other private radio stations? Why is it afraid to compete with those it considers can pro<Col N="307" /> vide a better service, but which cannot? RTÉ and its technical staff can be very good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I listened with interest to Senator Cregan. While he accepts that Dublin is the capital, we, in Munster, especially in Limerick, recognise that Cork is the capital of Munster.</P>
      <P>Radio and television broadcasting is an important service, especially for those confined to their homes. I am aware that RTÉ is seeking an increase in its licence fee, but I would like to see an improvement in the quality of its programmes. Not enough sport is broadcast live. I mentioned on the Order of Business that a meeting in Down Royal some time ago was transmitted live on Channel 4 and a French television station, but could not be transmitted live on an Irish television station. More sports, especially field events, should be transmitted live on television. If that were the case, the increase in the licence fee would be justifiable.</P>
      <P>I never featured much on television and radio, unlike some of my colleagues. My former neighbour, Nollaig Ó Gadhra, who lives in Galway, produced a series called &ldquo;My Home Place&rdquo; and he featured our native village in one programme. He interviewed me on that occasion and I have appeared on television on a number of occasions through my involvement in the GAA. I appeared on Liam Ó Murchú's programme &ldquo;Up for the Game&rdquo; and it was an honour. Communities are proud to see local people on television. More ordinary people should feature on television because it would encourage greater viewing figures. There is a good audience but everything should be done to improve numbers.</P>
      <P>I recall the advent of television in the early 1960s. There was no television in my house at the time but a neighbour had one. He was very generous as he allowed us to watch television programmes in his house. Many people became addicted to television but as time went on they grew out of the addiction. They would even watch the advertisements but that has changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pirate radio stations were also broadcasting but the Government decided to set up the Irish Radio and Television Commission to grant licences to local radio franchises. Given the scenario in Limerick, what power has the commission? A licence was granted to a station in Limerick and it was then threatened with the suspension of its licence because, according to the Independent Radio and Television Commission, the station was not complying with the regulations. I was asked if I could do something. I made representations to members of the Independent Radio and Television Commission but they said there was no way they could allow the licensee to continue broadcasting and his licence was suspended. It meant nothing because the station is still broadcasting. I was asked to partake in a programme <Col N="308" /> but I would not do so because I thought it was illegal. However, every other politician in Limerick has featured on the station since then.</P>

      <P>A licence was then granted to 95FM but RLO is still broadcasting. It provides a better service than 95FM. What power has the Independent Radio and Television Commission to regulate licences when that can happen? I have nothing against the holders of the 95FM licence. I spoke to people working for RLO over the past few days and told them I would mention their position during this debate. One must have power if one is to regulate. There are other radio stations operating in Limerick without licences. What power will the commission to be set up under this legislation have to deal with these matters?</P>
      <P>I do not want these people to be put off the air, but one radio licence is enough in Limerick. Senator Cregan referred to RTÉ being put off the air in Cork. This is a serious problem which must be considered. The two radio stations in Limerick are providing a good service. RLO, which operates without a licence, is giving a much better service. The draws for the GAA championship were made at a county board meeting, at which I was present, on Tuesday night and they were transmitted live by RLO. What regulations cover such licences?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been too great an emphasis in this debate on RTÉ. RTÉ is the monolith which dominates broadcasting but we have not heard much about TV3, Today FM and the other independent broadcasters. I pay tribute to the independent stations, particularly TV3 and Today FM, which have managed somehow to break RTÉ's monopoly. I say that in no sense of hostility to RTÉ. However, it is a good, brave and laudable achievement to have been able to break into that market against the odds. The road for TV3 was extremely long and difficult to break into this market but it has done so successfully. The result has been, contrary to many predictions, that there has been a growth in the number of people watching Irish stations. People may say <Col N="309" /> that quality of programming has improved but the result is that the universe has grown and that should be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Having listened to and been lobbied by both sides on this legislation, both have spoken highly of the Minister, and that is a great achievement. They see faults and difficulties in the legislation but they see it as an honest attempt to lay a playing field which is level. That is quite a tribute. However, they have criticisms which I will voice later. They feel that at least the legislation was drafted with motives in mind which were not nakedly political or biased. That is unusual and I congratulate the Minister on that.</P>
    <P>I wish to voice one or two of those criticisms. First, there is a problem with the RTÉ Authority. RTÉ's problems stem from the way it is appointed. The history of appointments to the authority has been deplorable. There is absolutely no doubt &ndash; there are always howls of protest when I say this &ndash; that political parties from both sides of the House have been wantonly political in the appointments to the board of the authority. The most recent board does not err badly in this regard. There are not such obvious people with party political affiliations as there have been in the past but there are still some. There are people who stood for various elections under party banners and others who would not have been chosen unless they had a loyalty to a party.</P>
    <P>I cannot normally identify people who belong or have affiliations to other political parties except the Government in power. I can on this occasion and this is worthy. The fact that this Minister has behaved in a highly commendable way, and she has erred maybe in one or two cases very obviously here, is a tribute. It should not be taken because it has happened on this occasion that it will not in the future be abused.</P>
    <P>RTÉ authorities have in the past been abused. They have been abused because people have been put on them because they have been seen to be 'safe' by the Government. They are people they can telephone and say they do not want something on and they can bring pressure to bear concerning various political programmes. There has been a history of this and there have been high profile incidents of it. The fact this Minister has not brought pressure does not mean it will not happen again. It is certain to and the next authority will again be riddled with political puppets.</P>
    <P>The RTÉ Authority should be taken outside the political arena. I have the highest respect for Mr. Paddy Wright, who was appointed by this Minister as chairman of the authority. I have every reason to believe that had the authority been chosen by a non politician he would have been found worthy of appointment. He is exactly the sort of person we need at the moment because we need private sector ethos to be injected into a public sector company. It would <Col N="310" /> have been better, however, if that appointment had a different source. That is the point I am trying to make. The Minister might look at ways whereby she and her successors can at least be at arms length from this particular procedure. There should be at least a layer separating the Minister, as in the appointment of judges.</P>
    <P>The issue of the licence fee is dominating the debate. I do not believe there will be a licence fee increase before a general election. People do not want to have to pay an extra £50 and politicians do not want to impose increases. It is a political decision. Is it fair to TV3 that RTÉ should get another subsidy of £50 per household? Leaving aside the issue of whether a licence fee or public service broadcasting or even a national broadcaster is either necessary or a good thing, if it is necessary to charge an extra £50 we should know where every single penny is going. We do not know and it is not required. That is not fair to TV3. TV3 is happy to compete with RTÉ but it does not know what it is competing with because this money will go into the pot. Some of it will go towards the orchestra, some to minority programmes, some to other public broadcasting areas, but we will not get a full account.</P>
    <P>What we ought to have is TV3 competing with a rigidly defined commercial sector in RTÉ. There should be no overlap. RTÉ will take this money and we will never get an account of it. So TV3 will be competing with a subsidised part of RTÉ. Can the Minister respond to that? That is what will happen. The definitions are not in the Bill in the crisp form they ought to be. It is not fair if the competitors do not know what they are competing with or are competing with a subsidised element. If there is any overlap between the commercialised and subsidised side then the competitors are not being asked to compete on a level playing field. To TV3's credit, they did not object to a licence fee but they do want to know exactly where it is going so they can compete happily. Let RTÉ have this licence fee but let us see where it is going. It is only then that we can question the whole fundamental area of public service broadcasting.</P>
    <P>What is public service broadcasting? I know what I think it is. It is whatever the Minister or anybody who makes a decision thinks it is. It is the most subjective and objectionable phrase and everybody's pet hobby horse. We have heard Senators today say they think some programme or other is good and we should spend more money on this or that. That is public sector broadcasting. It is whatever whoever is in power thinks it is and thinks is good for the people of Ireland. It is a very paternalistic type of attitude. It is a Minister saying we should have an orchestra. Why the hell should we have an orchestra if the people do not want one? Why should we have minority programmes if the people really do not want them and they are so minority that nobody wants to watch them? They are broadcast because, apparently, they are good for us. Who <Col N="311" /> makes that decision? It is a subjective decision made at the top.</P>
    <P>I do not say we should not have subjective decisions because there are some elements in our society we have to make decisions about. We cannot have criminals, subversives or paramilitaries running riot on the airwaves. Obviously we have to make fundamental decisions but within broad parameters.</P>
    <P>We should look again at the question of public service broadcasting because it is open to political abuse and abuse by those who believe that they are right. That is happening in RTÉ. I have no doubt that RTÉ was responsible for the passage of the divorce referendum because people there have a certain view on that. Every programme that I have listened to over the last ten years on that issue has been biased in favour of divorce. Is that fair? Of course not, but the culture in RTÉ is pro divorce, pro liberal and pro what they term politically correct. That has now become public service broadcasting. We must ask if that sort of culture is something we should support with the licence fee. It is an insoluble question but one we should continually ask. At the moment this licence fee comes under the control of very few people who use it to push their own views and minority interests on the people. We should have full accountability on the licence fee.</P>
    <P>What is meant by a high quality programme? It is what you and I like or what some middle class member of a political party thinks is good for everybody else, and so the Irish people must be educated up to high quality programmes. There is no such thing as high quality programmes. It is intellectual snobbery which means nothing at all. I question what public service broadcasting is.</P>
    <P>We should ask a question about the regulator. I am sure the Minister will enlighten me as to why there is not a single regulator for all television stations. We have the Independent Radio and Television Commission on one side and the Minister on the other, and this is one of the roots of the problem. There are two television stations answering to different authorities.</P>
    <P>A politician's loyalty is to politics, political survival, popularity and many other things. The Minister makes decisions for one station and ultimately the buck stops at the Minister's door, even if it is a very hands-off Minister. The Minister can sack the RTÉ Authority and this has happened in the past. On the other hand, the Independent Radio and Television Commission controls TV3 and other media. This means that different cultures and different standards pertain and infiltrate the different stations. This is very unfair to TV3 which comes under more stringent standard rules and it is unfair to RTÉ because it comes under more stringent political pressure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to see the Minister in the House for this debate. I am confused as to what areas should be prioritised. Many important <Col N="312" /> points have been made this morning and the Minister seems very intent on taking on board all those points. The Senators' contributions have been superb and I may not have much more to add.</P>
      <P>We are in a changing world and digital television is helping to bring about these changes in television broadcasting. This growth will certainly increase the number of commercial stations. Television is a powerful medium in terms of information and public opinion. I am worried that with this huge growth we may not be impartial and it may be difficult to maintain standards. Senator Shane Ross has referred to quality of programming and I will refer to this in another way. New technology such as the Internet means that it may not be possible to prevent undesirable content being viewed by the consumer. How can the consumer be educated to recognise good and bad programmes? I do not mean censorship but rather education and that is the core of my argument.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross also mentioned that the quality of material available may not improve and that there are real fears the quality of programming will diminish in the new world of broadcasting. We have examples in the United States and in countries in Europe where the material programmed is not intellectually challenging. I am not an intellectual snob but I would not like to see some of the programmes from Europe, the United States and Australia dominating Irish screens in the future. The Minister has indicated this concern in her speech. She said it is important to get the balance right between protecting and enhancing the needs of Irish society in terms of programme content and the expectations of those working in the broadcast sector with regard to commercial exploitation of radio and television. I agree with those views. We need to attain that balance. I welcome section 24 of the Bill which provides for complaints to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission with regard to breaches of the code of taste and decency for programme material.</P>
      <P>RTÉ has delivered a service to the State for many years with current affairs, drama, comedy and news programmes. Its programmes opened Ireland to the world. We have benefited greatly from this service and I compliment RTÉ.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the power of journalism and journalists. Are journalists impartial? Are they operating to another agenda when they conduct interviews? I referred to people in RTÉ when I asked those questions yesterday. I recall George Lee speaking on radio after the budget speech last year when he turned the whole country against individualisation. This was before the public understood the concept of individualisation or how it would be implemented. Here was a commentator who personalised the issue, for whatever reason. Why should RTÉ be supported if that is its agenda? I want a public broadcasting service. We need a national service to reflect our culture and our value systems and if RTÉ pro<Col N="313" /> vides that service, then I will support funding for it in the future.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister has given a statutory basis to TG4. This shows the Government's commitment to the Irish language and to the promotion of our heritage and culture. I welcome that. Irish radio and television services will be available worldwide and that should be seen as an opportunity for many Irish people to claim their heritage. It will also provide a receptive new market for broadcasters.</P>
    <P>RTÉ has attempted over the years to provide cultural and educational programming. Links have now been established with schools such as Ballyfermot Senior College and Coláiste Dulaigh, where there is a very good local community broadcasting station. The Bill has acknowledged this link with communities. School students should be made aware of good quality programmes and how to evaluate them. Media studies are now part of the leaving certificate curriculum. This should be extended so that it becomes broader than just a literature critique. Closer links between school and community, and teacher and parent should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>Last year the Government invested in technology in schools and colleges so that we would be up to date with e-commerce and electronic information. Everything should start in our schools. Although we cannot stop the proliferation of programmes coming to our country, we can show children how to assess what is good and bad. This must be done in schools. The RTÉ Authority must help young people to make judgments. The future growth of stations will present dangers.</P>
    <P>Television is the most important organ of public opinion and it has enormous impact on society. We will destroy our ethos, culture, heritage and language if we do not get this Bill right. We will subject ourselves to low standards in all walks of life. The media have such an enormous impact on society that they must shape our future through education of our young people. This is landmark legislation in the history of Irish broadcasting. It will provide the framework for the future planning of RTÉ programming. It must reflect our cultures and values. The Minister's speech, which I have read in depth, showed that she understands these concerns. I am sure we will be protected in her hands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House, after a long delay in getting this Bill to both Houses. I am a member of the joint Oireachtas committee which spent over a year and a half debating the introduction of digital television and meeting the companies involved. The Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation did a lot of work on this last year and eventually licensed the deflector systems. The director intended that this Bill would be passed by the end of last December and that deflectors would be gone, but it is better late than <Col N="314" /> never. I welcome the Bill as it primarily facilitates the introduction of digital terrestrial television.</P>
      <P>Other items need to be addressed, particularly the expanded functions of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, including its name change to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. Local radio was an excellent introduction. Highland Radio, which serves Donegal and much of the North, is the most successful local radio station in Ireland. I compliment its directors and founders. People in every home in Donegal, particularly in the north of the county, listen to it. Highland Radio and Radio na Gaeltachta are the only radio stations listened to by the majority of the population of Donegal. The younger generation listen to the RTÉ stations and Today FM. Very few of those over the age of 30 listen to RTÉ. They prefer the local stations because of the local content, including music and news, provided by those stations. Only when I leave the county, and when Radio na Gaeltachta is dealing with areas such as Senator Tom Fitzgerald's part of the country, do I tune into a national broadcasting station.</P>
      <P>I welcome the elimination of the levy on local radio stations. It will give them more funding to expand and improve their service. I also welcome the £500,000 provided to the broadcasting commission to assist with capital expenditure in local radio. There has been a lot of talk in recent years about the make-up of the board of the Independent Radio and Television Commission. It has been argued that it is more orientated towards urban than rural Ireland. Like Senator Ross, I am confused regarding the expanded functions of the broadcasting commission. I do not know whether the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation or the commission will be in control. Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on that.</P>
      <P>Licensed local radio stations undergo critical examination of their programme content. Illegal stations are still in operation. Highland Radio has informed me of its concerns on this matter, and I have written to both the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Local radio stations are losing both revenue and listeners. Illegal stations are not required to provide any content other than entertainment.</P>
      <P>The Minister's memorandum states that she may set up a separate corporate body for TG4. I would like to see control of TG4 taken from RTÉ. TG4 has received unjustified criticism. Many people feel it should only promote the Irish language and broadcast Irish language programmes. It provides a great balance in its programmes, including re-runs of old GAA and soccer matches and its own news service. I watch TG4 news and I find that it mixes international and local news. A snowflake falling in Donnybrook would almost make the headlines on RTÉ. RTÉ would not mention that west Donegal was snowed in for a week, as was the case this year when the area had a month of solid frost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" /> As regards sports reporting, Donegal has to win the All-Ireland before it gets a headline on RTÉ.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Senator's county ever win the All-Ireland ?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>More often than Monaghan has. If a player from Dublin, which is well down in the national league, hurts his toe, there is a headline on RTÉ about it.</P>
      <P>TG4 has made up for deficiencies in RTÉ. TG4 often has interesting programmes on at night when there is nothing of interest on any of the six main channels. Cathal Goan, who is now with RTÉ, deserves to be complimented for his work in setting it up. Pól Ó Gallchóir, the present ceannaire of TG4, and the leas-ceannaire, deserve similar praise. The biggest problem they face is lack of finance. I hope the Minister can provide additional funds for TG4. I have spoken to Pádraig Ó Ciardha, the leas-ceannaire, about this problem. TV3 is also an excellent station, both in terms of its sport and current affairs programming. Many Irish speakers had no service from TG4 until the good work done by its head of reception, Tom McCarthy, and the same complaint applies to TV3. One of the biggest towns in Donegal, Ballybofey, still has great difficulty getting TV3.</P>
      <P>The introduction of digital television will produce powerful commercial opportunities, not alone for the television companies but also for advertisers who use the service. It should be regulated properly, because television and radio broadcasting is an important means of communication and has great influence on how people think and operate.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of digital television, but the effect it can have on local communities and the services provided to them is important. When we met the different companies at the joint Oireachtas committee on the introduction of digital television there was no difficulty as to digital television in Donegal. There was a hectic battle three years ago at the time of the general election. I am best qualified to speak about that battle because I suffered most by not getting elected to the Dáil due to the victory of the single-issue deflector candidate. Despite talking to the Government, officials and our own party in the lead up to the election, nobody took the issue seriously except the people of Donegal.</P>
      <P>Through the telecommunications regulator we eventually got a licensing system for deflector groups and when we were dealing with the matter at the joint Oireachtas committee I was excited at what I saw happening. RTÉ was to join up with a commercial company, Digico, to provide digital terrestrial television, which in Donegal is the only transmission service that will operate because of the mountain terrain. I was disappointed that this was held back and is now being shaped in a different direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> RTÉ, much as I have criticised it, was the only company that provided services for Donegal. It set up a transmission structure which serviced just 30% of the population 30 years ago, but has developed and now serves between 95% and 98%. I was very excited that it was to provide the service, but this Bill will see another company take over the transmission service, with RTÉ having 28%. When RTÉ was lagging behind, it was the local community who set up piped television services initially, eventually changing over to the deflector system.</P>
    <P>The regulator appreciated and accepted that legislation was deficient and that there was need and demand for deflector systems. The commercial companies, who have a job to do, came in heavy-handed and the deflectors were threatened and in some cases put off the air, particularly in the run-up to the last general election. The regulator has accepted that in her report but she did not listen to me, the only public representative to make a submission on the matter.</P>
    <P>Due to the delay she has had to extend the licences for one year with the possibility of another year after that, but nowhere in this legislation is provision made for the small minority who cannot afford or receive digital television. If digital licences come in, the Minister must ensure that the deflector system remains in place. Deflectors will provide service for people who cannot afford digital, or who live in geographical pockets where the digital service cannot be received. This includes many areas in Donegal, particularly in the mountains.</P>
    <P>The deflectors may become compatible with a digital system. The south and west coast have introduced a system from France that they hope will be licensed. To allow the analog and deflector systems to remain in place, as they have been for 30 years, is vital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte fé leith roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach agus aontaím leis an mBille. Television and radio can be very dangerous in the hands of the wrong people. They can make or break a politician depending on its liking for him or her, and I agree with Senator Ross in his views on media coverage of the divorce referendum.</P>
      <P>It is important that programmes are edited carefully, especially in the context of future referenda, but I foresee RTÉ going in one direction on the abortion issue. This has to be played straight down the middle. The Seanad has a Cathaoirleach who gives fair play to both sides, and I hope that RTÉ gives fair play to both sides in any future referendum. I could be wrong, but I feel that its views are already set in a particular way on the abortion issue. It is definite that the RTÉ view was that divorce must come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What RTÉ should do is project the views of the people. Local opinion is broadcast by Radio Kerry, which attracts probably the biggest listenership in its broadcast area. The broadcasters emphasise the point, when they introduce pro<Col N="317" /> grammes with the words &ldquo;Guth na Ríochta&rdquo;&ndash;&ldquo;The Voice of the Kingdom&rdquo;. It is not the voice of the commentators which matters, because they listen to everybody, no matter what opinion is voiced. The lot comes out, and if you have a complaint against the station, it will be dealt with immediately. It is impossible to contact RTÉ with a complaint, although I will not keep knocking the service. I am very proud of RTÉ and its achievements and we should support the Broadcasting Bill in every aspect.</P>
    <P>Everyone does not get the programmes they are looking for. There are people who sit in front of the television from when it starts in the morning and they want their programmes &ndash; and only their programmes &ndash; to run until midnight. Many people were disappointed because of &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo;. I got drunk that night. I was delighted to see it go. My wife and my mother-in-law always had to change over to it regardless of what was on. The droning music got on my nerves. However, it was two to one and I had to concede.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney has just come in. I spent many pleasurable hours listening to his programme. I would say that to Senator Mooney whether he were in this House or not. He filled a particular gap that has not been filled since. &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo; and its impact were mentioned earlier. A number of artists were introduced on different television and radio shows went on to become popular. While Senator Mooney, with his particular country and western programme, did play plenty of music from singers outside Ireland, he also was quick to introduce new Irish singers. I am not saying to take Senator Mooney back; I am saying a programme like that&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not indeed. A programme like that is still needed in RTÉ. &ldquo;Trom agus Éadrom&rdquo; was mentioned and that was my favourite programme. I used to love Liam Ó Murchú and his ways. Some would say that he was not very professional in his presentation. That had nothing to do with it. He was like me. I am not professional at standing up here and speaking properly, but I do it anyway because that is the way I am. Who are they trying to reach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On my behalf and on behalf of Senator Bonner, I believe there is a need for a half hour programme on the fishing industry. It is broadcast on radio by the excellent presenter Tom McSweeney. I cannot understand why the same programme could not be on television, although not perhaps throughout the year. At present there are a number things happening in the fishing industry and as the Minister knows, representing the west, we depend heavily on tourism and fishing. Take the fishing away from Killybegs <Col N="318" /> and there is nothing. People love the sea and love boats.</P>
    <P>I return to the issue of the commission. It must have power to go to RTÉ and call a halt to its presenters projecting only one view. I do not mind individuals, people off the street, who go on and express their own view, but the presenters on RTÉ should not project their personal opinion. Senator Ormonde mentioned last year's programme about the budget and a number of similar things have happened. I do not like the political bashing that we are getting. It is wrong to say, in a broad sweeping statement, that all politicians are corrupt. We could decide to take RTÉ to court on the issue. All of us are branded and that should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>A presenter or a newsreader may confront a Minister and asks him to justify his pay increase but we do not know what that presenter is earning. I disagree with RTÉ broadcasting the news live from Jerusalem or somewhere like that and yet they are looking for extra money. Within minutes Mark Little, who has been brought from the US broadcasts from some part of Europe and then Seán Whelan gives an overview and finally Tommie Gorman tells us what he thinks. Why do they not stay at home? There are plenty of people out there to give them the information they want.</P>
    <P>I came home recently to find a notice asking me to fill in a form assuring an Post that I had a licence. It was a waste of time to go to my house to see if I had a licence. I was threatened with legal action if I did not complete the form by return. I specify my house because my licence states: Fitzgeralds, Dingle Heights. Outside my home is a four-foot square bed and breakfast sign saying: Fitzgeralds, Dingle Heights. How could a person waste his time just because I have a television aerial? Is there not a list available of those who have licences? These people are strangers knocking on doors at random. This should be done by the postman who knows every house and everybody who has a television. The postman could be paid extra for this.</P>
    <P>We have to obey the law &ndash; everybody should have a licence. When all of us were not paying our taxes it was higher for everyone else. But when everyone came into the tax net, that was when we started to succeed. I want everyone in the licence net.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Senators in welcoming the Minister. It is difficult to appreciate the enormous changes taking place in broadcasting in general and television in particular. I want to refer to the things we should keep despite the changes. Probably two of the greatest institutions in this country are RTÉ and the GAA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">

      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not considered talking about Fíanna Fáil here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we have heard in the discussions here both RTÉ and the GAA are going to come under <Col N="319" /> pressure from outside forces, from the larger digital stations. RTÉ will come under pressure because there will be other stations able to offer greater money for the rights to our major championship games in hurling and gaelic football. The GAA, which is embarking on some major developments, may be offered significant amounts of money from outside stations. Rather than looking at short-term gains for the GAA and maybe losses for RTÉ, we need to consider the long-term future of both RTÉ and the GAA. A station like Sky will not be at the Ulster championship at Clones or club championship finals or semi-finals. They will be there on all-Ireland hurling or football final day but they will not be there on a wet Sunday in the middle of the league. I join Senator Bonner in congratulating RTÉ and TG4 for the value they place on the GAA and for showing the games that they do because they are an integral part of both urban and rural Ireland. Despite short-term gains, the GAA should consider the long-term future of the sport in terms of encouraging viewers. They should continue their association with our own stations.</P>
    <P>The contribution of independent radio stations to rural society cannot be overestimated, and I speak as someone coming from an area served by one. We depend on the national broadcaster for national and international news but local stations, in the face of a declining rural population and eroding of community spirit, have expanded and become more professional in the past four or five years. They supply local news and entertainment and contribute to the development of the arts. They provide support, inform people of their rights and encourage locals to be involved with youth and community organisations.</P>
    <P>Obituaries are an aspect of this. My six year old niece tells her parents when they come home from work what obituaries were broadcast that day. Such is the extent of the involvement of local radio in the community that no one plans the day without listening to the obituaries. This may seem strange to someone from the city or other areas. About 80% of the population in Cavan and Monaghan listen to Shannonside Northern Sound at 8.10 a.m. to hear the obituaries. This has replaced the death column in the local paper, which was once the first page read. Just as the GAA and RTÉ are integral to our society, so too is local radio as it keeps communities together. There is a role and demand for all stations, especially local stations. They are as important, more important in some cases, as the national media.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. The debate was enlightening. What we need is a balance in terms of local, national and international contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh, Senator Mooney, and the other Members for agreeing to give me extra time. I thank Senators for their contributions during the past two days on the Second Stage, which have been useful. Senators devoted much energy to the debate.</P>
      <P>The other House spent a long time on this Bill, reflecting its concern over this social and economic issue. This House has expressed similar concern. Senator Coghlan stressed that all members of the community benefit from digital technology. The Government is introducing DTT so as to provide universal service. There is guaranteed access for our existing broadcasters because viewers are entitled to receive free at the point of reception the services in digital which they receive in analogue. Not all programmes on all channels will please everyone. Senators will agree that despite some possible flaws, broadcasting is better left to broadcasters than to Government.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan expressed concern regarding the transparency with which the multiplex and transmission companies are designated. I refute the implication that I would or could abuse my powers or obligations. Under section 5, I cannot designate the transmission company unless onerous conditions are satisfied. Under the same section the transmission company must ensure in so far as is practical that its services are available to all the community. Under section 8 similar conditions apply regarding the multiplex company.</P>
      <P>In selecting the multiplex operator I will be advised by the project management group, comprising my Department, the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Finance and Public Enterprise. In addition I have appointed a consortium of consultants led by AIB Corporate Finance to manage the selection process in which interested parties will apply to be designated by me as the multiplex company. The consultants will ensure that the process meets all international and European regulations. I will appoint a process auditor to verify the openness and fairness of the process. With the consultants I will supervise the sale of the network business by RTÉ. The process auditor will verify this also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister I am accountable to the Oireachtas for the exercise of these functions. While every effort has been made to ensure that the process is open and fair, and meets regulations, I cannot guarantee that there will not be challenges. It is the Government's policy that the legislative framework that establishes the DTT platform in Ireland must address issues that go beyond regarding broadcasting as another telecommunications service. For this reason, I will have <Col N="321" /> the primary role in the initial selection of the transmission and multiplex companies.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan is concerned at the &ldquo;ferocious&rdquo; powers of the Minister, including power to appoint the RTÉ Authority and decide the licence fee. It is the Government, not the Minister, that appoints the authority. A member may only be removed for specified reasons and after a resolution is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. I cannot appoint or dismiss members willy-nilly. While a strict interpretation of the law allows me, with the consent of the Minister of Finance, to increase by way of statutory instrument the licence fee, in practice this is always decided in Government. The Oireachtas can revoke any statutory instrument made by me. As the fee is a charge on the public, it is appropriate that the level is set by Government rather than an agency, as suggested by Senator Coghlan.</P>
    <P>Senators Coghlan and Bonner referred to the delay with the Bill which was published on 25 May 1999. The Government decision of July 1998 on the introduction of DTT envisaged that the transmission function would be separated from RTÉ. The entity thus created, in which RTÉ would have retained an equity stake, would have been mandated to build and operate the DTT infrastructure and promote the development of multimedia services and the information society. The decision envisaged that the process of selecting the investor in the DTT entity, which became known as Digico, would be progressed in parallel with the development of the legislation. This was reflected in the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, as published. As envisaged by the Government decision, Digico business would have consisted of two activities, transmission and multiplexing. It was likely that a bidder would place a value on the multiplexing business, that is, the retailing of a package of services to the viewer in much the same way as a cable television operator, on top of the value which the bidder might place on the transmission process.</P>
    <P>The advice of the consultants appointed to advise on the process was that in order to achieve the Government's objective, the transaction should be progressed on the basis of a predetermined value of the transmission business if RTÉ's share of the combined Digico business was to be calculated. The RTÉ Authority objected strongly to this approach and indicated that it was of the view that it should determine the value of the RTÉ transmission business.</P>
    <P>I was of the view that the concerns of RTÉ could not be lightly overridden. However, on the advice of the majority of the project management group, I decided that the proper way of achieving market value for the transmission business was to separate it from the multiplexing business. Accordingly, following extensive consultations with RTÉ, I brought proposals for an alternative approach to Cabinet which was accepted. As a result, RTÉ was instructed to sell its transmission <Col N="322" /> network as a going concern. The Government agreed in addition that I should select a DTT multiplex operator with the advice of the project management group. The separation of the activities required that formal amendments be developed to the Broadcasting Bill, as published, and this process, including, in particular, consultations with RTÉ, took a considerable amount of time.</P>
    <P>I want it to be understood that it was not just a question of a political delay, that these consultations were necessary. Further consultations took place as outlined. The Bill has passed through the Dáil and we are now in a position to deal with it in the Upper House. To try to make a political point that the Government has been tardy in bringing forward the legislation is not only unfair, but inaccurate. I am glad that it is the Government of which I am a member which has brought it forward. While it was promised time and again by the previous Administration, it was not forthcoming. The only document it produced was a position paper entitled, Clear Focus.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to local radio broadcasters. I recognise the importance and outstanding success of local radio as outlined time and again both in the Seanad and the Lower House. Its wonderful and outstanding success is acknowledged in a number of ways in the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the sound broadcasting contracts issued by the Independent Radio and Television Commission, section 60 expressly provides that the track record of an existing broadcaster will be taken into account where it applies for a new contract. This will ensure the performance of existing broadcasters will not be ignored when contracts are being awarded.</P>
    <P>I reject totally the suggestion that I am unaware of, or disregarding, the success of local broadcasting services. The Bill does not prohibit the carriage of local television services on the DTT platform. If such services are feasible, it will be a matter for commercial decision by the platform operator, as will the provision of interactive services subject to the terms of any licence issued by the ODTR. As the radio frequency manager, the ODTR will regulate the technical configuration of the DTT platform and those licensed to operate deflector systems.</P>
    <P>The number of regulatory agencies may seem a little daunting to the uninitiated. The Bill will provide a clearly defined regulatory structure, of which the ODTR will be the frequency manager. There is confusion in the minds of some about the division of powers regarding the role of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, the RTÉ Authority and the ODTR. It is important that people are aware of the different functions of the Independent Radio and Television Commission and the ODTR. The ODTR will be the frequency manager and technical regulator of all broadcasting platforms while the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, the new extended Independent Radio and Television <Col N="323" /> Commission, will regulate broadcasting from a broadcasting perspective. The RTÉ Authority will be responsible for national public services while the Broadcasting Complaints Commission will independently investigate complaints. To respond to Senator Ross, the Minister will not have a regulatory function, as is appropriate in any democratic state.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Mooney for his support for the principles underlying the Bill. While it would not be appropriate for me to join in or comment on the criticisms of RTÉ by Senator Mooney and other Senators, I expect they will be heard in Montrose. It is useful that a number of the Senators have taken the opportunity to refer to particular types of programmes which are the strength of RTÉ. Some of its weaknesses have also been outlined. Those who have tuned in to the debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas will be happy to learn of and, I hope, act on the proposals made by Senators and Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The nature of the relationship between the Minister and RTÉ is outlined clearly in the Broadcasting Authority Acts. The Houses of the Oireachtas have decided that the RTÉ Authority should act independently in pursuit of its public service remit and, for obvious democratic reasons, be free from interference from Government in its day-to-day programming.</P>
      <P>There is near universal support for the concept of public service broadcasting. This is reason I highlighted the great importance of taking the opportunity to underline the purpose of public service broadcasting and to bolster that philosophy and ethos. That is being done strongly in the Bill. I thank Senators for their contributions which highlighted the importance of public service broadcasting.</P>
      <P>The cultural and social significance of high quality broadcasting services in an age in which we run the risk of being smothered by information without context must be realised and affirmed. Like Senator Ryan, among many others, I am of the view that there should be plurality and diversity of choice in broadcasting services, not simply a choice between the same type of programming and services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the broadcasting sector, at least, must cater for the whole population, for minority as well as mainstream choices. Such services should be provided as a public service. The essential difference between public service broadcasting and commercial broadcasting was enunciated thoughtfully by Senator Quinn. Most of the new services which will be made possible through the introduction of digital television will be provided on a commercial basis. It is imperative, therefore, that the counterbalance of public service broadcasting is protected and nourished. Unless public service broadcasting is maintained and supported, <Col N="324" /> we run the risk in the new broadcasting environment of creating a two-tier society.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree with Senator Quinn's solution of significantly reducing RTÉ's revenues. Such a reduction would ensure public service broadcasting would be relegated to areas of so-called market failure rather than provide the varied and comprehensive range of services to which every citizen is entitled, regardless of his or her economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Ó Murchú for his encouragement and agree with his comments about TG4 and its potential to be a significant broadcaster in its own right. Many have referred to the fact that it has been a tremendous success. I reiterate the point that it is a wonderful example of what can be done within the broadcasting sector, especially by young people. It is tremendously professional and run efficiently. To underline the Government's commitment to the station, I have secured funding of £18.4 million for 2001, an increase of more than 23% on the year 2000. This is clear evidence of the Government's commitment to its ongoing development. On the basis of my discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, I am confident I will be in a position to secure a further significant increase in funding in the Estimates for 2002 to support the station's development plan. Senators can be assured of my continuing interest in and support for TG4.</P>
    <P>The issue of the licence fee was raised by a number of Senators. This is being actively considered by me. I will bring forward my views to Cabinet and a Government decision will then be taken. People will want value for money if such an increase is granted. We will also want to ensure it bolsters the ethos of public service broadcasting. I will take the remarks of a number of Senators, including Senator Manning, into account in making my decision.</P>
    <P>A point was made about the collection of the licence fee. According to An Post, the licence fee evasion rate for 2000 was 10.5%, while in 1999 it was 11.9%. The calculation is rather complicated and the evasion rate is estimated. For example, most wait until their licences are out of date before they purchase a new one. This could not be calculated as evasion as most will purchase a licence after a reminder. It is not the case that one third do not pay their licence fee. According to An Post, the evasion rate was about 10.5% for the year 2000. It is an issue, however, which needs to be examined and addressed.</P>
    <P>According to RTÉ and TG4, the latter's signal is available in more than 95% of the country on a free to air basis. This brings us back to the importance of universality, an issue we always discuss in terms of public service broadcasting as opposed to the commercial side. There are areas where there are reception difficulties for technical reasons. Senator O'Toole suggested that one way of resolving this is by satellite transmission. Such a move would present problems for domestic broadcasters. The Government chose digital <Col N="325" /> terrestrial television as the platform because it provides the alternative which gives the greatest degree of coverage to the population. Satellite equipment in the home is extremely expensive and does not necessarily guarantee blanket coverage.</P>
    <P>The Broadcasting Complaints Commission was referred to on a number of occasions. I am well aware of the need to strengthen it and the opportunity for citizens to register complaints. The provisions in the Bill are designed to strengthen the commission by providing a clear statutory basis for its structure, funding and remit. The contribution of full-time staff, appropriate accommodation and other resources will increase its capacity to investigate comprehensively and decide on complaints. The complaints process is addressed in the Bill which provides that a person will be able to complain directly to the commission and have his or her complaint investigated. That is a fundamental and significant change, one which can be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Many hoped we would have the opportunity to see programmes providing greater access to education. Senator Quill said that she would like to see channels devoted to it while others hoped there might be a channel devoted to the Houses of the Oireachtas. I am glad that their work can be seen on RTÉ at night. It might not have the highest TAM ratings, but there will always be an opportunity to improve on this.</P>
    <P>I hope I have covered most of the issues raised. Many contributors referred specifically to types of programming. I explained that it would not be appropriate for me to refer to programming, but I hope RTÉ will take the opportunity to reflect on what has been said both here and in the other House.</P>
    <P>The question of subtitling and the reference to special needs were raised by Senators Ryan and O'Toole, among others. I have referred specifically to these needs in the Bill and the fact that they should be addressed. We will return to the issue on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Bonner asked specifically about deflectors. That is a matter for the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, not my Department. Senator Rory Kiely was concerned about the licensing of radio stations and ensuring they adhere to a certain position. Broadcasting by what could be termed &ldquo;pirate&rdquo; radio stations is a matter for the ODTR, not for me or the Independent Radio and Television Commission. The ODTR has a specific remit and responsibility for the management of frequencies. Although Senator Bonner and others may have written to me or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it is a matter for the ODTR which comes under the aegis Department of Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and patience in allowing me extra time to reply to this debate. I look forward to Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the report of the Ombudsman on nursing home subventions, copies of which were laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 30 January 2001, be referred to the Joint Committee on Health and Children to consider and report to both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for facilitating me in make my contribution. As I am required, by schedule, to be elsewhere, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, will listen to the remainder of the debate.</P>
      <P>I welcome the report of the Ombudsman on the nursing home subvention scheme recently laid before the Dáil and Seanad. While it is critical of my Department, nonetheless I welcome its close examination of the scheme. I do not believe in shirking criticism, I believe in welcoming it, taking it on board and learning from it. We should apologise to those adversely affected by decisions taken regarding the operation of the scheme, decisions which, as the Ombudsman points out, disadvantaged people in their entitlement to nursing home subvention between the years 1993 and 1999.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister of State, apologised on behalf of the Executive last evening in the Dáil. However, we are only Ministers in the overall scheme of things. The scheme has been operated under more than one Administration and all political parties need to reflect on what happened in recent years. The Ombudsman points in that direction in highlighting the relationship between the Executive and the Legislature.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed that Deputy Gay Mitchell and others, during a recent debate on Private Members' time in the other House, tended to concentrate on officials within the Department to the exclusion of all others. While those involved in the administration of the scheme have answers to give, we all have lessons to learn, irrespective of which political party to which we belong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ombudsman makes an important point regarding the relationship between the Executive and the Legislature. He also raises issues about the relationship between the Department and the Minister of the day. Although Ministers presided over the scheme since 1993, the Ombudsman <Col N="327" /> points out that they would not have been aware of the legal advice available suggesting that the regulations were <i>ultra vires</i> the Act.</P>
    <P>The issue of whether relatives should contribute to the care of the elderly was hotly debated during that period. Parliamentary questions on the issue were tabled by many Deputies. One may get the impression from the Ombudsman's report that this is a surprise and that there was no issue about whether relatives should be means-tested or make a contribution, but Ministers are on public record as stating they believed that relatives should pay. Deputy Noonan, for example, when Minister for Health, made it clear to Deputy Harney in 1996 that he believed that sons and daughters who were in a position to contribute towards the cost of a parent's nursing home fees should do so and that the State recognised this contribution by way of tax relief. There were questions from Deputies about this aspect of the scheme in June and October that year. The Irish Nursing Homes Organisation also raised the issue successively with Ministers. There may have been an understanding in both Houses that regulations provided the basis for means-testing of relatives. Nonetheless, there were broader issues in funding the scheme etc. which needed to be honestly and openly examined.</P>
    <P>The issue to which the Ombudsman draws attention is that there was no legal authority to means-test relatives. He makes the point that Ministers were not made aware of this. It is important, in that context, that that issue be explored further when referred to the joint committee. The Ombudsman, in his conclusions, states that this is a complex issue and that the apportioning of blame is also complex. He suggests that it be assessed in the context of the complexity of how Government is operated and, in particular, the relationship between the Legislature and the Executive.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Government on health services for older people is as outlined in the report, The Years Ahead, first published in 1988 and reaffirmed in the review of The Years Ahead, published in 1997. The policy is to maintain older people in dignity and independence at home in accordance with their wishes, as expressed in many research studies, to restore to independence at home those older people who become ill or dependent, to encourage and support the care of older people in their community by family, neighbours and voluntary bodies, to provide a high quality of hospital and residential care for older people when they can no longer be maintained in dignity and independence at home.</P>
    <P>It is an inescapable fact that the anticipated change in demographics in the period 1996-2011 has, and will continue to have, significant implications for all service planners, service providers and all in government, whether at local or national level. The changing health and social needs of older people present a major challenge <Col N="328" /> to society. The longer older people remain in good health and disability free, the better will be their quality of life and the greater their contribution to society. Ageing is a normal dynamic process, it is not a disease. While ageing is inevitable and irreversible, the chronic disabling conditions that often accompany it can be prevented or delayed, not only by medical interventions, but by social, economic and environmental policies. These policies need to be informed by a wider, more positive view of old age.</P>
    <P>Since taking office in 1997, the Government has allocated significant resources to services for older people, particularly health services, in an attempt to deal with this change and the resulting issues which will emerge. Additional funding for the development of health services for older people has increased significantly from £10 million in 1997 with an additional £36 million being provided in the year 2000 and an additional £57 million being provided in 2001. This has resulted in approximately 880 posts being approved for services for older people between 1997 and 2001.</P>
    <P>Under the national development plan, £2 billion is being made available for investment in health services, that is, a trebling of investment compared to the previous seven year period. The purpose of this plan will be to create an infrastructure that will bring significant and tangible advances in delivering a more patient centred and accessible service. We are keen to have a balance between the community services side and hospitals. That is the reason we made it clear from the start that we wanted a 50-50 split between the spend on hospitals and the spend on community services, which is of particular importance to the elderly. We have made this clear to the health boards.</P>
    <P>Over £200 million will be available for the capital development of services for older people over the period of the plan. A broad range of facilities will either be provided, replaced or upgraded as a result, including assessment and rehabilitation facilities, ambulatory care facilities, community hospitals, community nursing units, convalescent and respite beds, day care centres and services for the elderly mentally infirm.</P>
    <P>With considerable investment in health board facilities and the area of community care, substantial additional resources have been made available for the nursing home subvention scheme. Members will be aware that the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, under which subvention regulations were made, has two principal objectives: to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered under the Act and to provide a new system of nursing home subvention in order that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care will have access to such care.</P>
    <P>In January this year, 385 private nursing homes were registered under the Act, with approximately 6,000 in receipt of a subvention. I intend to increase the rates of subvention from their cur<Col N="329" /> rent levels of £70, £95 and £120 per week, depending on the level of dependency, to £90, £120 and £150 per week with effect from 1 April. This year, the funding available for the scheme is £52 million.</P>
    <P>The report of the Ombudsman deals with the role of the Department of Health and Children in making regulations and overseeing the introduction of the scheme and examines the administration of the scheme by the health boards since its inception in 1993. However, more importantly for us as Members of the Oireachtas, it also considers the nature of the relationship between the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Executive and within the Executive and also the relationship between the political and administrative levels. The Ombudsman states, in relation to his findings, &ldquo;any attempt simply to apportion blame, without regard to the complexities of the framework within which Government in Ireland operates, runs the risk of the central message in this report being overlooked.&rdquo;  I will return to this issue.</P>
    <P>Two articles in the nursing home subvention regulations were the subject of critical comment: article 8.2, the &ldquo;pocket money&rdquo; provision, and articles 9.1 and 9.2, which allowed for the income of adult sons and-or daughters to be assessed when determining the level of subvention to be paid. My immediate priority is to ensure the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. I will outline the action taken to date.</P>
    <P>Article 8.2 of the Nursing Home Subvention Regulations, 1993, allows health boards to disregard a sum equivalent to one fifth of the old age non-contributory pension when assessing means and calculating the amount of subvention to be paid. An additional allocation of £4 million was made available in 1998 to six of the eight health boards where the regulations were applied incorrectly, to meet the costs of arrears payments in respect of the full implementation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, and subsequent regulations. The sum of £4 million was not provided solely for the purposes of article 8.2 arrears. Health boards were also incurring additional expenditure as a result of the easing of the family circumstances regulations in 1996. These regulations, signed in July 1996, increased the personal allowances applied by designated officers of the health board when assessing the circumstances of adult sons and daughters of an applicant for subvention. The funding was intended to address both problems and to meet funding shortfalls in the scheme generally.</P>
    <P>Following a meeting between officials of my Department and representatives of the Office of the Ombudsman in December 1999, my Department became aware of continuing delays in paying arrears. The Department took up the matter with the relevant boards and is continuing to pursue it. I am advised that the current position is <Col N="330" /> that where arrears were due to be paid, health boards have made retrospective payments in respect of persons currently resident in nursing homes. I understand some boards have also paid arrears in respect of former subvention recipients now deceased and former recipients who are no longer resident in nursing homes. My Department has instructed the relevant boards to take immediate steps to pay all outstanding arrears and the health boards have advised that, to date, approximately £900,000 has been paid out in respect of article 8.2 arrears. It is not possible at this stage to give a figure for the total cost of article 8.2 arrears payments as a number of boards have not completed the process of calculating the amounts due. My Department is, however, continuing to pursue this matter with the health boards concerned to ensure every effort will be made to pay all outstanding arrears as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>This allocation was not intended to be used solely for the payment of article 8.2 arrears. The Department has been informed by the health boards concerned that the funding provided was used to cover arrears payments under article 8.2; additional expenditure arising as a result of the easing of the family circumstances regulations in 1996; the payment of enhanced subventions; expenditure shortfalls arising from increasing demands under the scheme; and legal and other costs associated with the administration of the scheme. I understand a proportion of the allocation was used by three of the health boards to fund other services for older people, including the provision of aids and appliances, improved home help services and the opening of a unit for the elderly mentally infirm. While this money was not expended on the subvention scheme, I am assured that it was used by the relevant health boards for the benefit of older people.</P>
    <P>As the Ombudsman has outlined, articles 9.1 and 9.2 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, allowed health boards to assess the ability of the adult sons and-or daughters of older people who apply for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care. A review of the operation of the subvention scheme was conducted in 1995, following which an amendment was made to the schedule which provided that, in calculating the income of sons and daughters, health boards were to disregard income tax, rent, mortgage repayments, etc. This schedule increased the personal allowances applied by designated officers of the health board when assessing the circumstances of adult sons and daughters of an applicant for subvention. The subvention regulations were further amended from 1 January 1999 and the provision to assess the capacity of adult sons and-or daughters to contribute towards the cost of nursing home care of their parent was deleted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="331" /> This amendment was made because the provisions in question were not consistent with the assessment procedures adopted in the granting of medical cards by health boards or in the social assistant payment schemes administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, wherein there is no consideration of the financial circumstances of adult sons and-or daughters of applicants. Nonetheless, I am concerned that the issue of making payments to those adversely affected by this regulation remains. While the legal advice received is that there is no legal liability on the State to make retrospective payments, there is a moral obligation on the State to do so. I have decided that moneys should be paid to those adversely affected by this provision and my colleagues in Government agree. We have secured the funding required to make these payments as quickly as we can. We have established a group representing the Department and the health boards as well as the Eastern Regional Health Authority to ensure this process is initiated on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. I alert the House to the fact that this will take time. As there were over 35,000 applications for subvention since the introduction of the scheme, this will be a complex exercise going back through all applications involving difficult issues of traceability and it may take some time to complete. Payments will not start flowing until later in the year.</P>
    <P>An issue raised here in the recent past is that of inspection procedures for extended care facilities. The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, requires nursing homes to be registered with their local health board and regulations made under the Act require that there must be proper standards in private nursing homes, including adequate and suitable accommodation, staffing, kitchen and sanitary facilities, access to medical care and so forth. Nursing homes are required to renew their registration every three years and a health board may impose conditions in relation to registration. I have been concerned for some time about the fact that while there is provision under the nursing home legislation for monitoring standards in private nursing homes involving inspections, no similar arrangements are in place for health board facilities. I intend to rectify this. The social services inspectorate has the authority to monitor standards in children's residential centres and is operating effectively. I intend to expand the role of the inspectorate to cover extended care facilities for older people. Given the heavy demands on the inspectorate in relation to the monitoring of standards in the child care area, additional resources will be required to enable it to take on this additional function. I intend to bring proposals to this effect to Government as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for the elderly, Deputy Moffatt, is preparing guidance and training materials in relation to elder abuse, <Col N="332" /> including abuse in institutional settings. Following the publication of the report, Abuse, Neglect and Mistreatment of Older People: an Exploratory Study, by the National Council on Ageing and Older People, the Minister of State established a broad-based working group in 1999 to advise on the formulation of procedures and guidelines on elder abuse. This process will culminate in the presentation of a final report to the Minister of State who has been provided with significant resources to ensure work in this area is completed within the timeframe envisaged. The report will be completed following the testing of draft policies, procedures and guidelines in pilot projects and training programmes will be provided for staff members and ongoing evaluation will take place.</P>
    <P>An expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme is being undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance and is expected to be completed shortly. I intend to bring forward proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures will be necessary, arising from both the Ombudsman's report and the expenditure review, with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993. The expenditure review, in particular, may throw up a number of issues to be considered and will, in all likelihood, have a significant impact on what happens in the future.</P>
    <P>Chapter 8 of the report draws some far-reaching conclusions as to how Government operates under the Constitution. The report goes on to make a number of suggestions as to how the position might be improved: through better use of the Oireachtas committee system, a mechanism for monitoring secondary legislation by affirmative resolutions of the Oireachtas and a more effective system for dealing with the annual Estimates, particularly for expenditure required to meet entitlements under the State schemes introduced by the Oireachtas. These issues are broader constitutional issues, not just matters for consideration by my Department, nor are they issues that can be addressed by the Government alone. They have implications for all future Governments and will affect the way we as Members of the Oireachtas deal with matters in the future.</P>
    <P>The report raises significant issues not just for me as Minister for Health and Children or other members of the Government. It raises issues not only about how we deal with funding entitlements, but also about people's human rights, which is of concern to us all.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman's report highlights examples of inequity of treatment by health boards for subvention applicants. Any inequity of treatment concerns me greatly and it is my intention to put in place fair and proper systems to ensure that this accusation cannot be levelled again.</P>
    <P>The report makes uncomfortable reading for us all. I look forward to further discussion on it and to examination of its contents. In this regard the <Col N="333" /> Dáil this morning agreed, and it is our intention, to refer this report to the Joint Committee on Health and Children. We hope it will consider this matter in depth and report back to the Oireachtas within a suggested timeframe of six months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. I am glad this report is to be placed before the Joint Committee on Health and Children. The Minister referred to the fact that it was debated in the Dáil in Private Members' time over the past two evenings as a Fine Gael motion. We are very anxious to have a thorough debate on it here.</P>
      <P>This is a damning report. We must listen to what the Ombudsman has to say. He is an independent person. He certainly is to be congratulated for bringing before us the harsh facts of how vulnerable elderly people and their families have been treated. The report questions the Department of Health and Children in relation to its knowledge of these matters and particularly in regard to the failure of the Department to respond to the Ombudsman.</P>
      <P>The Minister has outlined the measures he has put in place to deal with the compensation payments due to parents and their children for nursing home care. The State, through the health boards, extracted moneys improperly from elderly people and their families.</P>
      <P>It seems extraordinary that elderly people who contributed all their lives to society and were due the utmost respect and dignity should be faced with untold distress. Their pride was affected as they had to turn to their children in order to have the necessary financial support to keep them in nursing homes. With today's social structure most young couples work and, much as people would like to, there is no longer a question of being able to keep elderly parents at home.</P>
      <P>I am aware of many such cases, although I do not intend going through them now. I have received many representations relating to the grief caused to elderly people and their families. There was family in-fighting in relation to who should care for whom, who was the most well off, whether people would contribute equally and whether the person who got the family farm should be the main supporter.</P>
      <P>Looking through media coverage, Fintan O'Toole's article of 3 February was extraordinarily strong, with the headline &ldquo;Elderly regarded as Enemies of the State.&rdquo;  He refers to the Ombudsman's report as a searing indictment of the Oireachtas and its inadequacies, ripping off vulnerable elderly people who could not look after themselves. He used the word &ldquo;subversion&rdquo;. The health boards undermined a law passed by the Oireachtas. The word &ldquo;sabotage&rdquo; is also used in the article. It stated that there was sabotage of decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report deals with the payment by health boards of subventions to patients in private nursing homes provided for in the Health (Nursing <Col N="334" /> Homes) Act, 1990. I was in the Seanad at the time that Bill was debated and we welcomed it most warmly in that it would deal once and for all with the area of nursing homes.</P>
    <P>The report is a case study in public administration. It examines the operation of the subvention schemes by health boards and is very specific. It deals with the role of the Department in making regulations under the 1990 Act and overseeing the introduction and operation of the scheme nationally. It also examines the relationship that exists between the Department and the Oireachtas, and the Department and health boards and the way in which the Department interacted with the Ombudsman. That point was raised by Senator Hayes on the Order of Business and I know he will deal with it in his contribution. Page after page of the report reveals frustration in the Office of the Ombudsman, which did not get an adequate response to many questions that were put.</P>
    <P>The wider and most fundamental issue is the relationship between the Executive and the Parliament and relationships within the Executive. It would take more than a quick debate this evening to explore that issue, which we should consider as Members of the Seanad. I hope we do not find the same problems within, for example, the Department of the Environment and Local Government as it relates to local authorities. We should also consider the relationship between the Executive and other agencies.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman states in the report that he received a steady flow of complaints &ndash; over 150 &ndash; since the scheme commenced in September 1993. That is quite a number, given that not everybody would have been aware of the Office of the Ombudsman. That office was very concerned about the number of complaints it received about health boards.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1993 there was inadequate provision of long-stay nursing home care. Radical improvement and reforms were proposed. We were aware at the time of escalating costs. What concerns me here is the corporate response of virtually the entire sector, the Department and most health boards. I do not think, as the Minister said, it is a harsh or undue criticism of civil servants, and I am aware that not all health boards were to blame.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman seemed to have tremendous difficulties in dealing with complaints. There were many delays. For instance, he states that it took more than five years to acknowledge and address the defects of which he was aware prior to September 1993. He focuses on the fundamental issue of good administration and good government and states that this was not due to maladministration. He refers to the more fundamental defects relating to the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Executive. He refers to the Executive, where Ministers acted individually or in concert, or collectively in conjunction with the Civil Service and the operating agents.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> That is one aspect of the debate. The second aspect is the pocket money issue and that adult children were supporting elderly parents in cases where they did not have to. The Minister said that successive Ministers for Health stated that perhaps children should give financial support to their parents for good nursing home care. That could have been done by way of a policy change. I am not sure why there was not more openness about the policy when the economy was in recession and we did not have the billions in the Exchequer that we now have. That policy should have changed by now in that it should not be necessary for children to support their elderly parents having regard to what should be done by the Department Health and Children and the moneys available to make provision for adequate subventions. The highest subvention rate is £120. While the Minister mentioned the increases in subventions will come into effect on 1 April, £120 has been the highest rate for many years, which is very little when one considers the weekly and annual costs of nursing home care.</P>
    <P>People are living longer. My mother is 96 years of age. While she does not need to be in a nursing home, if she were in one, imagine the length of time she could have been in one and the escalating costs of such care. I am not talking about ten years, but 30 years in cases where parents might move to a nursing home at the age of 60 years, depending on the state of their health and if they do not have children in a position to mind them. Such a period of care in a nursing home would require a massive financial investment which family members would not be able to afford.</P>
    <P>On the payment of subventions, patients and their families were affected. When the law was passed, I had hoped it would be translated into action on the ground, but that did not happen.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman is fair, he states that there were difficulties for seven years and adequate financial resources were not available. He refers to inflation being rife and that inventiveness might have been necessary during that period to overcome financial problems. He states, however, that the inventiveness went beyond the bounds of what was reasonable or acceptable. He implies that someone got a brilliant idea, went off at a gallop, but that it went beyond the bounds of what was reasonable or acceptable.</P>
    <P>We are aware that there are not enough public hospital beds. In the Limerick area many in need of care would prefer to be cared for in St. Camillus's Hospital, which offers excellent care, but it does not have enough beds. There is a long waiting list for admittance. Even if some had the necessary financial resources to cover the cost of nursing home care, they would opt for St. Camillus's, as they have been in the hospital for a week or two and wish to return. It is regrettable that sufficient funding is not available in the public system to provide an alternative for those who would willingly go to and be happy in that <Col N="336" /> hospital in the knowledge that they would receive tremendous care.</P>
    <P>The Act provides for a health board to subsidise the cost of care in a private nursing home. I wish to raise a major issue, on which I do not have much time to dwell, that is, one fifth of the old age pension is disregarded and not treated as means. That is the pocket money of pensioners. That provision was deliberately and systematically undermined by some health boards and the Department of Health and Children. That is evident, in black and white, in the report.</P>
    <P>I was surprised at the advice on one area given by the Attorney General's office, although I am sure the Attorney General's advice is the most expert in the country. The Minister has not made it clear whether he was advised there was no liability. That has not been cleared up. The Minister said that the arrears to the health boards will be paid. Is he doing that out of goodwill? There seems to be an ambiguity as to whether the Attorney General's advice on there being no legal entitlement is correct. I would like that clarified.</P>
    <P>While the Minister has left the Chamber, I would like to know the current position on the Mid-Western Health Board to which an additional allocation of just under £1 million was made in January 1998. The Ombudsman states that it is not clear how much of this was intended to cover payment of arrears to those who had not been given the benefit of the pocket money provisions in the subvention means test. Why is that not clear when this issue has been under the microscope for so long? The Mid-Western Health Board states that it has paid arrears only in those cases in which a subvention was still in payment on 1 September 1998 and where it could obtain adequate details of income. I understand the reason for the delay in obtaining adequate details of income, as it would have to check the paperwork. Arrears were not paid in respect of applicants who died prior to arrears being calculated. The total amount paid by way of arrears is not clear. Having regard to investigations taking place, I would have thought the Mid-Western Health Board would be clear about the amount is being paid, the amount that will be paid and to whom it will be paid. It was allocated just under £1 million. I am not sure if it will be allocated more to cover the moneys due not only to patients, but their families and those of deceased patients for whom this must be a very trying and distressful period. It brings back into focus the pressures, torment and distress suffered during the period in which they were unaware of their entitlement and had to look at their ageing parents suffer the indignity of having to ask their children to pay for their health care at a time when they were most vulnerable and, probably, very ill.</P>
    <P>When this report is placed before the Joint Committee on Health and Children, I hope we will receive answers not only to the questions <Col N="337" /> raised by the Ombudsman, but in the Dáil and here this afternoon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extraordinary report. It gives us an insight into mainly administrative procedures in different health boards and the major variation in their application to mainly vulnerable, elderly persons at an age when they could not defend themselves and were depending on their relations, who were often not equipped to take on the administrative apparatus of the health board in the area in which they lived, to do it for them.</P>
      <P>The report draws together the legal, medical, social, financial and administrative threads of our private nursing home system in one extraordinary erudite, easy to read, simply stated and well written document. I would go so far as to say that this report should be standard text on administrative and social work courses, as in years to come people will not believe what happened in the Ireland of the late 1990s.</P>
      <P>The report highlights the making of regulations containing provisions, likely to be invalid, <i>ultra vires</i> the Act, including at least one instance in which the likely invalidity was known in advance; the inclusion in a regulation of a provision, which was almost immediately negatived by advice issued by the Department; the unreasonable prolongation of discussions with the Ombudsman's office in relation to practices, which it appears were known from the outset to be invalid or incorrect; and the failure of some of the health boards to alter practice, even where the legal advice was that the practice was incorrect and where the Ombudsman had expressed the same opinion. One does not get anything more damning than that in the early pages of a report.</P>
      <P>The report also states that in the long run the exercise of non-existent authority, to quote the commentators, the surreptitious introduction of family assessment, the disregard for clear principles of law, the sustained proffering of incorrect advice, the reluctance to acknowledge mistakes, the tardiness in the Department's dealings with the Ombudsman's office can only undermine public confidence in Government and our democratic institutions. I call into question whether the present arrangements facilitate efficient, open and accountable government. From the point of view of the Houses of the Oireachtas to which this report is addressed, the issue is whether their intentions, as expressed in legislation, were honoured as befits their constitutional status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those two paragraphs sum up the report. While there are other considerations to be taken into account, the major consideration is that there was no control, monitoring or standard application of the rules across the health board system for those who needed the support of the State at a difficult time of their lives. That must be examined. Why did the Eastern Health Board not have prob<Col N="338" /> lems? It came out of this report with no stain on its behaviour.</P>
    <P>I am not here to defend the Eastern Health Board, of which I was honoured to be a member in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was the largest health board at the time and there were more administrators between those receiving its largesse and the top decision makers. Other health boards are smaller and there is a more intimate relationship between the administrators and those in receipt of moneys. What happened to this special relationship? How could administrators deal with such vulnerable people in a heartless manner while the Eastern Health Board interpreted the rules in a more charitable and humane manner?</P>
    <P>I do not wish to attack health boards and their officials. There was a breakdown somewhere along the line. A minuscule amount is involved in the context of the entire health Vote. Ultimately, the Ombudsman's report reveals there was a failure in the exercise of correct procedures; to recognise the correct relationship between the Legislature and Executive; to respect and act on legal advice; and to exercise the normal motives of humanity and charity in dealing with vulnerable people. It also displays that the poor law mentality is alive and well at certain levels of administration in our health system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to debate this important report. Senator Jackman referred to the debate on the nursing homes Bill in 1989 and 1990. There were contributions from all sides of the House because people were aware of the difficulties that existed. Nursing home standards were appalling. Both my parents suffered ill health and, fortunately, we were able to care for them at home for most of that time, but because of various practical problems both of them had to reside in nursing homes for relatively short periods, six to eight months. I recall doing the rounds of nursing homes and the smell of cabbage and the dark, dismal surroundings. I was depressed that my parents would have to reside in such conditions. Although circumstances have improved and regulations were introduced, nursing homes have staffing problems. This has implications for the care of old people who are left in bed far too long.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman referred to such human problems and the manner in which he laid out the report is excellent. When one reads the case studies, one realises this is a human problem and relates to elderly persons who cannot look after themselves and who need and deserve to be looked after. That is not charity, it is their right. That is the reason I feel strongly about this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was a little defensive. He put his hands up and said mistakes were made, that we must learn from them and that it was everybody's fault and nobody's fault. All of us should bear responsibility for what happened. Given that questions were being asked, the time it took for <Col N="339" /> this to come to light was extraordinary. If we do not learn from this, shame on us. Are all the health boards working together now? Are their actions being monitored? Will we be convinced that this cannot happen again?</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick referred to the Eastern Health Board, which came out of the report better than any other health board. I will illustrate how awful the rest were. I had an old maiden aunt who lived at home. She worked as a post office clerk and, therefore, she received a minuscule pension. She fell into ill health when she retired. She sold the small family home and invested the money thinking that she would be able to look after herself. However, her money ran out three years ago. Nursing homes in Dublin cost £450 per week, not £150 per week as some say. The onus was on the nursing home to obtain a subvention for her. She knew that she was running out of money and did not believe that she should have to ask the extended family, who were already looking after elderly relatives, for help. She was not fit to go cap in hand to the health board for help. The nursing home and I had to seek the subvention for her.</P>
    <P>Why did this lovely old person have to go through that? It was completely wrong. I thought elderly persons were in a better position because of the nursing home regulations and so on. What happened to her was wrong and one would swear one was asking for a king's ransom if one tried to obtain the maximum subvention. There were communication difficulties and niggardliness, but administrators responded well when one got through to the correct person who was trying to do his or her best. That is one example of how difficult it was for the nursing home, me and one or two relatives to look after this elderly woman. It was heartbreaking.</P>
    <P>When one reads the cases in the report one realises how much more awful the situation was for others. The report is damning. The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>However, more importantly for us as Members of the Oireachtas, it also considers the nature of the relationship between the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Executive and within the Executive and also the relationship between the political and administrative levels. As the Ombudsman states, in relation to his findings, &ldquo;any attempt simply to apportion blame, without regard to the complexities of the framework within which Government in Ireland operates, runs the risk of the central message in this report being overlooked.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The central message is that the most vulnerable in society must be looked after in an open, non-oppressive way. People must not be put in a position where they are of the view that they are mendicants in society when they have borne the brunt of all the bad times in our history. There are messages for politicians and administrators within <Col N="340" /> the system. The primary, fundamental message is that we must care for vulnerable persons, particularly the elderly who are unable to look after themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and I listened with great interest to his speech. I approach this with some degree of schizophrenia because for part of my life I was an ombudsman and in another incarnation I was secretary in the Department of Health. I have a rough notion of what happens on both sides of this counter. This is a model ombudsman's report. Any ombudsman anywhere would be proud to have produced it. I will discuss three aspects of it; the mechanics, the relationship between the different parts of Government and the Administration and the policy.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his response today. It is characteristic of him that he does not try to defend the indefensible and when in a hole he stops digging. Much of what he told us today goes a considerable way towards addressing some of the points I would have made had he not spoken. I am glad he takes the equitable view, and does not hide behind legal advice, in extending compensation to all concerned. The important thing about an ombudsman's report is that it takes the individual case, looks at how the administration handled it and then seeks to have it put right.</P>
      <P>It is important that the people who are disadvantaged in any degree by maladministration or poor administration are compensated to the extent that they can be. I do not think anybody can express compensation for the agony, grief, worry and annoyance they had. We also need to look at how the system works to see where it went wrong and what we need to do to improve it. A matter addressed by implication, rather than directly by the Ombudsman is the policies and the extent the activities of the various agencies show that the policies are either incomplete, imprecise, outdated or wrong.</P>
      <P>One thing we must recognise coming through in the report which is moderate and neutral in tone, is a certain degree of impatience. It can be seen that as far as the Ombudsman was concerned, dealing with the Department was like drawing teeth. That is not good enough. An ombudsman, who is a servant and officer of the Oireachtas, should not have to go through that sort of thing. There must be machinery which enables replies to be obtained more quickly and we must require Departments and their boards to take ombudsmen inquiries seriously. This must be done out of respect for the Ombudsman and more importantly out of respect for the people who have been disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ombudsman asks us not to forget the central message and I agree with Senator Keogh that the central message is how people are treated in society. People are entitled to be treated with dignity and not be required to become suppliants or <Col N="341" /> mendicants. One thing we take from it is that it is agreed that it is not a matter of looking for scapegoats. We must ensure that a system seen to be fallible is corrected and made to work better. I have some sympathy for Ministers in a case like this because the umbrella of ministerial responsibility tends to cover all and a Minister cannot be held to account for everything that goes on in a Department. The genesis of the office of ombudsman in Ireland was the Devlin Report which said policy, which is the Minister's business, could be separated from the Executive. It was because of that separation, which it was held would produce greater efficiency and managerial control, that the Ombudsman was seen to be necessary. The Ombudsman's function is to see that the machinery is working. We should look more often at ombudsmen's reports and I suggest we have a committee on the Ombudsman which would receive reports from him periodically on all Departments. The Ombudsman then could come to the committee in cases where he perceived obstruction or dalliance.</P>
    <P>One important note in the report relates to the danger of Departments and their agencies changing or attempting to change the law as laid down by the Oireachtas. That brings in the question of defining or narrowing things by secondary legislation or even by departmental circular. We must protect the public and the Oireachtas against that. The Ombudsman suggests the extension of the process of affirmative resolution which might actually have the effect of gumming up the works. In some other legislatures I was involved with they did have a person called the Examiner of Statutory Rules. His job was to examine these matters and report annually, pointing out where Departments had enacted rules which were rather <i>ultra vires</i> or which distorted the intent or were beyond their own powers. Now that we have an independent legal adviser for the Oireachtas it may be a role for that person.</P>
    <P>Another problem the Ombudsman underlines is that if through the law we give people statutory entitlements then those should be their entitlements. The implication should be that the Oireachtas as well as willing the end also wills the means and provides the money. The whole question of tracking money through Departments and health boards is difficult and complex but must be tackled. It seemed odd to me that some health boards even when they were given money by the Department to pay compensation, used the money for something else. It should not be a lottery. Entitlements should not depend on where one lives, or under which health board's regime one comes. We need consistency. These are issues the committee would look at but I would like it also to look at the policy implications of what the Ombudsman's report discloses. He says he is neutral on policy which is the classic position of ombudsmen. I am not sure that he is or that he should be. If you read the report carefully, it is quite clear that there are deficiencies in policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="342" /> The Department and others could be faulted for maintaining and continuing to develop policies which are clearly out of kilter with social and demographic movements. It is based on a late-Victorian concept of the family, on a society where the average life expectancy was probably about 60 years instead of in the 70s as is the case now. It ignores the extent to which elderly people, thank God, are living longer. Two cases are particularly pathetic. One concerns a person of 95 years and the other a person of 89 years. In both cases, the health boards were looking for subventions from the adult sons and daughters. What age do you imagine the sons and daughters were?</P>
    <P>We have an enormous problem of elderly people being cared for by those who are themselves elderly. We have maintained a care system through exploitation of the children of the elderly. In particular, we have exploited the female children of the elderly. One can see the number of elderly ladies who have dedicated their whole lives to looking after parents because no one else in the family would do it. Our policies as enunciated do not take sufficient account of social mobility, changing habits and social mores.</P>
    <P>In the economic sense, there is a very strong argument for making nursing home care for the elderly as freely available as possible and as free as possible. If this is not done, elderly people will simply become more infirm and ill and will need hospital care, and hospital beds will be used in a much more inefficient and expensive manner.</P>
    <P>Behind all this is the message of how this society values people who have made a contribution to it in many ways. These are people who have built this society by paying their taxes and they are entitled to be treated with dignity, care and compassion. Sadly, as shown in the Ombudsman's report, this is not so in every case, but we should find ways of making it so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad my colleagues have placed this matter in a human context and put on the record their own family experiences. My closest relative was an aunt who died six months ago in her one hundred and third year. I moved into her house for five years to keep an eye on her. We had a very happy relationship but, eventually, she started to fall and that was very dangerous. I would come home and find that she had been on the floor for an hour. She was a ruthlessly practical person and she said that she wanted to go into a home. The very phrase &ldquo; a home&rdquo; sends a shudder down any person who loves an elderly parent or aunt. We were very lucky to find the Alexandra Guild House, of which I cannot speak highly enough. It was initiated by the old girls of Alexandra College and run by a committee. It had a matron and properly trained staff who did their own baking. It was an intensely human situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were difficulties at first in obtaining a place for my aunt but I wrote to the home and <Col N="343" /> asked if this was because she was too old &ndash; some homes will not take in people on the basis that they are perceived to be too old. What happens to people in that case? I wrote and asked them to reconsider because my aunt was very upset. I offered to be of assistance to them at any time. My aunt had stayed there for periods when I was abroad. Two letters were written back, one to my aunt offering her a place and the other inviting me to meet the board. The home was in difficulty and was on the point of closing down and I was able to use the resources of the Oireachtas to help them.</P>
    <P>I wish to make the point that programme managers have been attacked from time to time. The programme manager for the Department of Health at the time was Anne Byrne, and she and the staff of the Department of Health were absolutely marvellous. The salvation mechanism for the home was triggered and a wonderful resource was saved, with the result that 30 elderly ladies were allowed to live out their lives in dignity in a really human environment.</P>
    <P>I have seen some of the other homes, which were dark, miserable and cramped. We should encourage better conditions. Homes like the Alexandra Guild House are better than State-run institutions because they have an ethos and motivation. It is in the economic interests of the State to support them.</P>
    <P>I wish to make one comment about the Minister's speech. Senator Keogh said that she admired the Minister for coming out with his hands up, but he did not. The hands up were of every other Fine Gael or Labour Minister for Health that he could find, and they were the ones named in the report.</P>
    <P>The report is very significant in a number of areas. Broadly speaking, two questions were considered: first, whether there was an entitlement to assess the means not just of the person seeking this care, but of their immediate family and, second, was the question of pocket money. We should be careful about our use of language. How demeaning it is to even say &ldquo;pocket money&rdquo;. These are people who have worked and raised families and are in their 70s, 80s and 90s. I would hate to be getting pocket money at that age. I am 55 years of age and it is a long time since I got pocket money. I would not be grateful to anybody for patronising me by offering me pocket money.</P>
    <P>What concerns me, and it should concern this House, is not alone those particular issues, which have been superbly addressed in the Ombudsman's report, but that clearly the unambiguously expressed wish of the Oireachtas was deliberately and knowingly frustrated by agents of the State. That worries me because that is an attack upon democracy. It was not done unknowingly, it was done in the light of repeated advice which had been sought by the health boards and the Department. They knew exactly what they <Col N="344" /> were doing. They were robbing the most vulnerable people in the State. That must not be allowed happen again.</P>
    <P>The report addresses this matter. It states that when the Oireachtas delegates to a Minister or to some other authority the power to make regulations, the delegation given is very specific &ndash; what is being delegated is the authority to fill in the details where the main lines have already been spelled out. Such regulations should not contain anything that is not clearly envisaged in the parent Act. In that sense, regulation-making, or setting a regulation as it is sometimes known, is an exercise in realising the intentions of the Oireachtas. It is not an exercise in realising the intentions of the Minister or other authorities to which the delegated powers have been given. Anything in a regulation which is not demonstrably in line with the intentions of the Oireachtas is likely to result in the regulation being deemed <i>ultra vires</i> and struck down in the event of a legal challenge in the High Court. The various agencies involved, therefore, were repeatedly advised. That worries me because it is an attack on democracy.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the specific complaints. An enormous number seems to have been generated in the past ten years because of alterations. The question of the equation of in-patient services and residential care in nursing homes was raised. Very clear legal guidance is available. I refer to the decision of Henchy, J. in 1976, in the matter of Maude McInerney, a ward of court. The judge held that there was a specific, clear and absolute equivalence. This has been known since 1976, yet since 1990 an increasing number of complaints have been generated. There were financial constraints which need to be considered.</P>
    <P>During discussions with the Ombudsman, the Department indicated that it would need to amend section 51 of the Health Act, 1970, which defines in-patient services, to exclude nursing home care from entitlement. Pending an amendment of the Act by the Oireachtas, the Department said it would look seriously at the possibility of amending section 51 by way of regulation. Ombudsman staff pointed out that any such attempt to restrict an existing entitlement by way of regulation would most likely be invalid <i>ultra vires </i>the Act. Nothing could be clearer. Senator Maurice Hayes, who was once an ombudsman, made an excellent contribution in paying tribute to the report. He used the phrase &ldquo;late Victorian versions of the family&rdquo;. There is something Dickensian about the atmosphere here, and I do not mean that in a complimentary or flattering light.</P>
    <P>In ideal circumstances, families would support their elderly relatives. My aunt decided it was not in her interest to stay with me &ndash; we do not have an extended family &ndash; but I visited her every day. I would have been happy to contribute, which is not true of everybody. A parent would be humiliated to hear an outside body saying that their son <Col N="345" /> or daughter ought to be paying for them. It would insult the parental role. The parent may already feel humiliated by the fact that their child is not paying. There is a moral responsibility to look after one's parents in such circumstances, but there is no legal responsibility whatever.</P>
    <P>Page 25 of the reports states:</P>
    <P>Despite numerous reminders, Mrs. T..'s son J.. failed to provide the information needed to ascertain his disposable income, and we were obliged to base our assessment on best local information. He runs a business. J.. was assessed as having a minimum disposable income of £32.41 per week. If, of course, J.. does provide the necessary information we would review the case again.</P>
    <P>It is none of their business. What is this best local information? Does it mean that they applied to the neighbours to find out how much money they had? That is simply appalling. Children ought to help to support their parents if they are capable of doing so, but we cannot have big brother poking his nose in. The Eastern Regional Health Authority, through the agency of the very effective advocate, Maureen Browne, supplied me with three examples to show that it behaved in a more decent and humane way in a number of instances, although it is not entirely immune.</P>
    <P>It is important to say what the conclusions of the report were. The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, does not make children legally responsible for parents' hospital or nursing home costs. There is nothing in the Act to suggest that any such liability was contemplated by the Oireachtas. Regulations cannot impose a liability on adult children which is not explicitly provided for in the 1990 Act. The definition of 'circumstances' as originally provided in the regulations is likely to have been invalid as it cannot be said that it was authorised by the Oireachtas in the 1990 Act. The practice of determining and assessing a level of contribution which an adult's son or daughter should be capable of making towards a parent's nursing home costs was invalid, even where such an adult son or daughter is willing to make some level of contribution. The approach to the regulations in regard to family assessment was fundamentally misconceived.</P>
    <P>The report's analysis is entirely neutral as to whether it is desirable that an adult son or daughter should be liable for a parent's hospital or nursing home costs. This is a question of public policy which should be dealt with by the Oireachtas. It is an open question, according to the report. I think it remains a moral obligation which many decent people would fulfil. It is obviously not legally enforceable.</P>
    <P>Regarding the issue of moneys allowed to be retained by elderly people, the report states that the Ombudsman does not accept that Article 8.2, in its original wording, was unclear in its meaning or its intended application. This article was amended with effect from 1 January 1999, osten<Col N="346" /> sibly to clarify whatever was allegedly unclear in the original version. The amended version, provided for by statutory instrument 498 of 1998, is as follows:</P>
    <P>A health board, in assessing the means of a person in respect of whom a subvention is being sought under these regulations, and in calculating the amount of subvention to be paid in accordance with the regulations, shall ensure that income equivalent to one-fifth of the weekly rate of the old age non-contributory pension payable at the time is disregarded for the purposes of such assessment. Such sum is to be retained by the person for his or her use.</P>
    <P>That is reasonable. I cannot find the figures, but I think the discretionary amount was about £2.50 per week. Such an amount for adults, many of whom raised families and worked for 40 or 50 years, would not buy a packet of cigarettes. In many city centre pubs it would not buy a pint of stout. They are allowed one seventh of a pint of stout, or one cigarette per day, as pocket money. Any parent who attempts to inflict £2.50 as pocket money on a teenager would have it rapidly flung back in their face. The elderly deserve better.</P>
    <P>I have made criticisms, but they should not be personalised. We should not persecute people in the Department of Health, with whom I have had good experience. We would not have a report on this sensitive issue without the co-operation of personnel in the Department. The report deals with a particular kind of nursing home, which seemed to prefer genteel people from a nice background. They were probably terrified they would have nonagenarian heroin addicts. The matter was extremely sensibly handled and I am grateful for that, but for the sake of elderly people, we should take on board the recommendations of this report. We should recognise people's humanity and needs rather than dealing with them by administrative regulation. If we are lucky, we may attain the status of old age. A civilised society treats its vulnerable people with sensitivity.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the journalists who, with the Ombudsman, exposed this matter. I first came across this in a <i>Sunday Independent </i>article. It was followed up by an article by Fintan O'Toole, who can be very good but sometimes irritates me. We owe them a debt for bringing this into the public light.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to an article in the <i>Irish Social Worker</i> by journalist Ann O'Loughlin in which she says there should be no doubt that elderly people in need of long-term care are among the most vulnerable to confront any social worker advising people about the subvention form. More recently, the daily grind of many social workers has included writing begging letters seeking extra money to meet the ever widening gap between private care costs and what elderly people can afford.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> I hope the debate raises the profile of this vulnerable group and ensures that we never again treat them in this niggardly way. We must never again allow a situation where agencies of the State treat the clearly expressed will of the Oireachtas with the degree of contempt that was expressed towards its legislation on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had the chance to read the Minister's address because only nine or ten copies were produced. We should ensure all Members addressing the House have a copy prior to their remarks. The Minister has a duty in that. I am not sure if the Minister came out with his hands up, or if he came out with every other Minister's hands up, and in what manner he responded to the report.</P>
      <P>This document makes pretty pathetic reading. We have waited 11 years since the passage of the nursing homes subvention legislation in 1990 to get a report and a true picture of the total inadequacy of the service provided, the demeaning and illegal way in which elderly people who were cared for within this service, and their families, have been treated, and the lack of accountability and transparency. It has required the intervention of the Ombudsman, who must be thanked for this report, to bring our attention to how dire the situation is.</P>
      <P>The opening words of the report deal with the payment by health boards of subsidies or subventions to patients in private nursing homes as provided for in the Public Hospitals (Amendment) Bill, 1990, and says that the majority of these patients are elderly people, by definition unable to care for themselves or to be cared for at home by their families.</P>
      <P>This is the vulnerable category of people we are talking about and it is sad that so many regulations and so much bureaucracy surrounded the operation of these nursing homes. It is a euphemism to call them homes, because people gained admission with great difficulty, they were allowed to remain on with difficulty, and their families had to make a substantial financial contribution, as the health boards were able to elicit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, a client in my constituency visited me concerning an 85 year old family member resident in private care in Beaumont nursing home. This patient was admitted to the home five and a half years ago with a subvention of £220. Costs have escalated since then, but the health board has refused to increase the subvention by one penny despite the pension of the senior citizen going toward their contribution. With inflation and the rising cost of living, the cost to the family has almost doubled over that five and a half year period. The reason given for the increase to the family was that that this patient owned her own home which is considered an asset. The family have had to let her home, earning £600 per month. That sum, in addition to the patient's pension, goes toward the cost of the nursing home <Col N="348" /> and the family contribute the rest. The total cost has now gone up by £370 per month.</P>
    <P>That is the type of story which informs this report. Under the State system a person is entitled to be dealt with by the health board, yet this entitlement has been treated as a privilege by health boards, and responsibility in terms of remuneration and costing has been passed over substantially to family members, who in many cases are unable to contribute. The health boards, including what is now the Eastern Regional Health Authority, are not ogres, so why are they doing this? </P>
    <P>The ERHA has circulated most Members with documentation claiming that they are not as bad as some other health boards of whom the Ombudsman was more critical, but there is no doubt that they were in breach of regulations. When it was brought to the board's attention that family members had complained at inclusion in assessment for the subvention, it then declined to enforce payment for that assessment. That is hardly a wonderful concession on the health board's part, as it did not have the entitlement to look for that money in the first place.</P>
    <P>The EHRA has sought to reduce their culpability by presenting Members with some response to the document, and I would like to see a response from the other regional authorities also. The health boards are not ogres and do not try to harm people or remove their dignity in an organised fashion, though that might be thought from the number of regulations. The response by the health board focuses on funding constraints and inadequacies. A short piece from that response, entitled &ldquo;The failure of responsiveness and accountability&rdquo;, says that in all its contacts with the Ombudsman's office from 1992 onwards, the Department made it clear that the health board's capacity to meet its obligations to people in need of nursing home type care was severely curtailed by the inadequate finances available.</P>
    <P>That is the nub of the problem. The health boards have tailored their finances to get the maximum number of bed-places in nursing homes and have tried to enforce additional costs on family members of patients, causing an enormous burden. A similar burden has been created by the practice of retaining much of the so-called pocket-money that individual elderly patients should be entitled to.</P>
    <P>The report has an effective acknowledgement by the Department of Health and Children that it is failing in its obligations to people in need of long-stay care. It recognised that the subvention scheme was a cheaper option than that of meeting people's statutory entitlement to long-term care. Notions of entitlement and legal propriety were not in evidence on either side of this dialogue. Entitlement and legal propriety were left out. This is the Department of Health and Children's reply to the Ombudsman: the State is currently unable to meet the demand for long-stay places. This is an indictment of the State's contribution <Col N="349" /> to dealing with the elderly. If the nursing home legislation became unworkable, the State would have to pick up the pieces by means of huge capital investment for the provision of new long-stay accommodation for elderly people. The capital cost alone would be well over £200 million.</P>
    <P>Since the Act commenced on 31 December 1996, 10,106 people have been approved for a subvention. Of this number 5,639 people are being paid subventions at a cost of £17,124,000. According to the Department's reply, the State could not support that many people in health board long-stay units, assuming those units existed for £17 million per year. That is the value that the State and the Department of Health and Children have put on the elderly. All it has contributed in subvention since 1992 is £17 million and it would have needed an extra capital cost of £220 million, presumably to provide the premises for the nursing homes, if it had not availed of the private subvention system. Is it not incredible that it says there is no way the State could have provided it? It is less than £2 million per year to cover subvention for the 10,000 people listed there. The capital cost would not all have been provided at the same time.</P>
    <P>Clearly this report is extremely damning. It is a failure most of all to provide funding to take care of the elderly and without the funding we get the Dickensian system that the Senators have been describing. The system has demeaned the people being care of and their families. It has not provided a service that is in any way adequate. We should not have to wait this long to deal with the suffering of so many vulnerable people. If the accountability mechanisms were in place, then we would not have a crisis showing up in a report such as this. There would be no need for the Ombudsman's report if accountability and the finances existed. Arising from this report we must decide how to deal with the growing number of elderly people. We must look beyond just the nursing homes response. We have to look at the family response within the community and what support mechanisms can be put in place to assist the family.</P>
    <P>In 99% of cases, the person will not end up in a nursing home unless the family is unable to take care of that person. Normally the family would make provision in the community and in the family home if the facilities were there and if the funding were available in a different, more supportive fashion. The carer's scheme has always been a penny pinching. It has always been very difficult to have that scheme extended to assist the family members in dealing with the elderly.</P>
    <P>We are airing our concerns on nursing homes but the response rests with the Department of Health and Children, the Government and the Minister for Finance. We must ensure we are not beset by concocted regulations with no standing in law simply because health boards tried to get as many bed places as possible with totally inadequate finance.</P>

      <P>I join with others in welcoming Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, to the House. We all agree that it is a very damning report. The health boards, both systematically and quite unlawfully it would appear, have taken money from the families of elderly people who had the basic need to be cared for in old age. We all hope that, when we reach that stage, the services will be there to look after us. For once, I agree with quite a lot that Senator Costello says. However, when this scheme was introduced £4 million was provided for the subvention and this year £53 million is expected to be spent on it. While there are many criticisms of the subvention scheme, it is important to note that efforts are being made. I welcome what the Minister has said on paying back the arrears, the pocket money and so on. I welcome the increase in the subvention in April 2001 because we all recognise that nursing home costs have increased considerably in the last couple of years but the subvention has not.</P>
      <P>Often a dictionary is needed to understand a report but, in this case, I commend the Ombudsman for such a straightforward report. I do not mean that in a condescending or patronising manner. Unfortunately it is quite damning and makes dreadful reading in parts but it is easily understandable. It is clear what we need to do to improve the system. There are individual cases in the report of elderly people, some suffering from Alzheimer's disease, who could be put out of the nursing home within a week because they cannot continue to pay. There are other cases where a person's spouse dies before they get paid back by the health board. It is very sad that the service has dropped to that level.</P>
      <P>I have criticisms of health boards, and my own one in particular, but we are all accountable. In my short time in politics, I have had many cases where individuals have been put through the wringer trying to provide statistics, data and income details to show that their parents should be entitled to subvention in a nursing home. The Ombudsman's report states that health boards were using local knowledge to determine if people had means other than they claimed. We all know neighbours who, we think, are millionaires and wonder how they made their money. Local knowledge is one thing but we need to take a more humanitarian view of these people.</P>
      <P>I like my colleagues have made numerous representations to health boards on behalf of individuals. However, if people are refused subvention and I have gone as far as I can go, all I can do is apologise. This report makes me aware that the regulations were flouted. We all have criticism of our own handling of cases. I take no credit for what I have done. I told people that they are not entitled to subvention and nothing further could be done. It may appear callous but that is what I believed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this report. We can improve the situation. The report highlights many damning <Col N="351" /> points. It highlights the relationship between the legislators, State agencies and the people who implement the laws. We discussed underage drinking this morning and it was stated that laws are not being enforced in that area. Right across society, laws are ignored and unenforced. It is a feature of our society that laws are made to be ignored. The fundamental issues regarding homes for the elderly are what are the laws, how are they implemented and how much accountability is there.</P>
    <P>The greatest scandal is the failure of the health boards to alter practice after getting legal advice that it was wrong. There was an attitude of &ldquo;get away with it if you can&rdquo;. The Minister allocated £4 million in 1998 to pay the health boards' arrears. Six out of the eight health boards diverted the funds, we are told, to other aspects of care of the elderly, but they ought to have used the money as it was intended.</P>
    <P>We are accountable to those who elected us. This is an age of openness, accountability and transparency, but health boards appear to be able to operate to suit themselves. I know from my own health board that despite promises or obligations, it can do what it wants. Health boards and other agencies empowered by the Oireachtas to provide services must be accountable. The problem is how to achieve this.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello talked of the lack of resources in the 1990s but the health service's resources have more than doubled in recent years. Speaking of my health board, of which I am somewhat critical, I wonder is there increased accountability. The public, particularly in Cavan and Monaghan, feels that the more resources there are, the less accountability, and that more staff are appointed to administer the funds. This must be addressed. It is like pouring water into the sea. The Department of Health and Children, we as legislators and the agencies we have empowered must be more accountable. Greater resources make it more difficult to keep account of money, but the administrative staff in health boards must be accountable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his speech addressed standards in residential homes. The number of people over 65 will increase from 400,000 now to more that 750,000 by 2020. Within that age group there will be people living beyond each age cohort. The number of citizens dependent on the State and in private nursing homes will double. This will make an impact on the Exchequer. It is proper that we debate what should happen in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no national inspectorate to examine standards in residential homes. Each health board designates people who also have responsibilities enforcing environmental legislation, looking after children's needs etc. We need a full-time professional inspectorate separate from the health boards under the Department of Health and Chil<Col N="352" /> dren. The same standards must apply everywhere. Random visits should be conducted by a team of professionals &ndash; a doctor, nurse, dietician, engineer and others. Every aspect of nursing homes should be inspected. They are not inspected twice a year as required by law because the health boards do not have the staff.</P>
    <P>We would not have this debate were it not for the Ombudsman's report, which I welcome. We need an ombudsman for senior citizens. In New Jersey, USA, the staff of the ombudsman for senior citizens visit nursing homes and talk to the residents. They discuss issues relevant to them and deal directly with the management. Here, we give the subvention and, apart from the occasional visit, do not participate. We only know what is happening from reports of inspections of nursing homes. The majority of homes are excellent but a minority are not. These reports should be readily available. They can now be obtained on request. If someone is considering placing a relative in a home, the report on that home should be accessible on a website. Reports should be on display in the nursing home and residents and relatives should receive copies of each report. We require transparency and honesty in this area, but that is not always the case.</P>
    <P>I understand a report received yesterday states that while Ireland has a mild winter compared to the rest of Europe, the numbers of senior citizen deaths are significantly higher than the European average. I understand research indicates that the critical factor is internal temperature within the home or, in this case, the nursing home. Is it reasonable to expect patients in a private nursing home to be in a room with a temperature of 11.9 degrees or 12.5 degrees instead of 18 degrees, the minimum permitted? Is it fair that following the inspection of a nursing home, which I will not name, in the North Eastern Health Board on 8 December, the report of the visiting doctor stated that the temperature in 50% of the bedrooms and day areas was below the minimum permitted? The nursing home in question was in breach of the Act from last May until 21 January this year. That is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>How does one enforce the regulations? They are not rigidly enforced because there is no proper inspectorate. I would condemn any regime, whether operated by a health board or privately, where, when issues such as significantly reduced temperatures are brought to the attention of the statutory and nursing home authorities, a minimum period of, say, two weeks is not given to put the matter right. If it is not put right, there should be an immediate prosecution and the health board should take over the running of the nursing home until it is put right. It is shameful and disgraceful that that has happened. It both shocks and concerns me. It is unacceptable to find, as I did at 4.30 p.m. on 17 December, a subvented patient in a private nursing home wearing two jumpers and day clothes in bed to keep warm. <Col N="353" /> That is an indication of how low standards can be in places.</P>
    <P>In many nursing homes standards are very high. It is incumbent on the Minister not just to ensure minimum standards, but best practice, to which every nursing home should aspire and which people have a right to expect. Unfortunately, the situation in the case mentioned is unhelpful. The regulations and rules are worth nothing when such practices are allowed to continue month after month.</P>
    <P>It is shameful the way our senior citizens are being treated. We are, effectively, walking away from the issue by ignoring the plight of our senior citizens. There must be a vigilant and positive interaction between the health boards and both private nursing homes and State-run geriatric institutions.</P>
    <P>The following questions must be asked about private nursing homes. What level of care is available? What physiotherapy and occupational therapy services are available? Who is looking after the chiropody service? Is there any investment in these services? There is a need for a root and branch reform of what is on offer to senior citizens not only in private nursing homes, but public nursing homes.</P>
    <P>If senior citizens are dying because of a lack of heat in their homes, why does the Minister not change the regulations applicable to the disabled person's grant? A sum of £14,000 is available to disabled persons, including those who suffer from arthritis. With such a sum one could build an extension to a three bedroomed house in which a senior citizen is living alone. Why can the Minister not provide a grant of between £2,000 and £3,000 to install central heating in such homes? The senior citizens concerned do not want a big extension. They want to have their shower and toilet located downstairs, but first they need to install central heating. While money is available, it is not being used in the right way.</P>
    <P>I am not solely blaming the Government. While we all have a part to play, we are not doing our best. The report is a wake-up call to the State and the nation. We must do a great deal more for our senior citizens, but we are not concentrating on the issue. Apart from young children, those most at risk and who have most to lose, most of all their lives, are our senior citizens. We need to take a hard look at the issue.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair for giving me latitude. I hope we will have a comprehensive debate on services for our senior citizens. This debate is confined to nursing home subventions. In a modern state in the new millennium, our services are disgraceful and unacceptable.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="354" /> The Ombudsman does not issue too many reports, but when he does we are obliged to look carefully at what he has to say. Each Member of the Oireachtas since 1993 must accept some responsibility for his findings. While there were mitigating circumstances in the late 1980s and early 1990s regarding funding for nursing home subvention, despite what has been said recently, great strides have been made, particularly in the past three years, in the provision of services for the elderly.</P>
    <P>We introduced a statutory instrument on 1 January 1999 which deals with two of the issues involved, that of pocket money and the assessment of family income, which has now been taken out of the reckoning. I accept that we must make moneys available to make up, retrospectively, for what happened. We expect the scheme, which initially cost £4 million per year, will cost £52 million this year. We have also put in place a capital programme under which £200 million will be spent over the course of the national development plan on services for the elderly.</P>
    <P>Our main aim is to treat the elderly in their homes where we would like them to remain in appropriate settings for as long as they can. That will require a great deal of expenditure on community care, a matter at which the Government has already looked. For every pound spent on hospital care one pound will be spent in the community under the national development plan.</P>
    <P>We are encountering difficulties in providing physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy services. While we have catered for those who look after elderly persons in their own homes, a great deal more remains to be done.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman questioned severely our analysis and how we look at primary legislation, whether it is scrutinised properly in the context of the regulations made thereunder. Even though provision is made for such regulations to be laid before both Houses within 21 days and everybody should have an opportunity to make their views known, this has not been happening in practice. I am glad that the report is being referred to the Joint Committee on Health and Children, where it will be teased out further.</P>
    <P>An assessment of the subventions payable is being conducted by Dr. O'Shea in Galway, the findings of which we expect to receive shortly. We also are looking at the matter of elder abuse, on which we will also receive a report. It is not true to say, therefore, that we are not making progress on care of the elderly. While we are providing a great deal of money, money will not solve all the problems. There are many issues about which we can learn.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators who participated in the debate. It is through debates such as this that we will learn more and take due cognisance of what an independent person such as the Ombudsman has to say about such matters as care of the elderly.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed the Minister is not present. That is not a reflection on the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, who I hope will relay my thoughts and concerns on the matter I raise. If he cannot reply fully, perhaps he will pass on my remarks so that they are communicated to the right offices.</P>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me raise the matter of the transport of prisoners. Over the past six to 12 months we have witnessed a range of incidents, one of which led to the well-being of a prison officer being put at risk. That occurred on 24 January last when a prisoner, being escorted by three prison officers from Cloverhill Prison to Cork Prison, placed a syringe to the neck of the prison officer to whom he was handcuffed and forced the other officers to unlock his handcuffs. One could probably ask where the syringe came from, but one could also ask whether the prisoner should have been restrained more securely, or isolated.</P>
      <P>There is also the practice of prisoners being escorted by taxi. One must ask if this is a suitable mode of transport for any prisoner with a violent reputation or charged with a serious offence, having regard to various factors. It would be appropriate for an elderly prisoner spending a day or two in prison for failing to pay his or her television licence or for non-payment of a fine. There must be a case for certain basic measures to be taken during the transportation of prisoners convicted of a violent offence or a drugs offence, where there is a possibility that he or she is likely to try to escape or inflict violence on a prison officer or, if they escape, on a member of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We saw earlier this month where a prison van was attacked. The prisoner in question had a history of offences. It behoves us to ensure prison officers run prisons and, where prisoners are escorted to and from court or from one prison to another, that the prison authorities are in charge. That does not appear to be the case at present. While I understand that the Minister, in conjunction with the authorities, has ordered a review, I hope it will not just be a rubber stamp job because it appears a root and branch review is needed, with some of the current practices dispensed with immediately. They allow for the possibility of escape with the potential risk that poses to the community. There is no point in gardaí or prison officers saying they thought a <Col N="356" /> prisoner would not try to escape because he had not tried before. People serving time for certain offences must be dealt with in a certain way. The public demands that.</P>
    <P>There have been other cases where prisoners have escaped. We are aware of what happened in the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum. We are also aware of a prisoner released for a driving lesson who decided not to return and of other similar cases of people on temporary release. While they are not related to the matter I raise, it behoves the Minister and the authorities to do something.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State relay to the Minister my belief that what has happened is not good enough? We are fortunate that prison officers were not seriously injured in this case. The shock and knock-on effects of a syringe attack are almost as bad as the potential consequences of such an attack. Will the Minister of State take on board what I said, respond as positively as possible and indicate when this review will be complete?</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Cosgrave for raising this issue on the Adjournment. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, regrets he cannot be present to address the issue. As the Senator is aware, there have been several escapes from escorts over recent months. Prisoners have escaped using a variety of means, including pulling syringes and demanding that cuffs be removed and, in one incident, armed intervention by associates. Such incidents cause understandable public concern and to safeguard both the prison staff and the general public, every precaution must be taken to prevent their recurrence.</P>
      <P>The circumstances of the most serious of these incidents are as follows. On 25 January 2001 a prisoner was escorted by prison staff from Cloverhill Prison to Cork Prison. The escort consisted of three prison officers, and the prisoner was handcuffed to one prison officer at all times. The prisoner produced a syringe which he had earlier hidden on his body. He placed the syringe to the neck of one of the escorting officers, forcing the other officers to unlock his handcuffs. He escaped, following a chase, by running into a housing estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second incident occurred on 2 February 2001 when a prisoner was escorted by prison staff from Waterford District Court to Cork Prison. Once again the prisoner was accompanied on the escort by three prison staff and he was handcuffed to one prison officer. The van transporting the prisoner was attacked by a group of men, at least one of whom is believed to have been in possession of a firearm. The staff were forced to unlock the prisoner's handcuffs and the prisoner made his escape in a car accompanied by the attackers. Fortunately, no staff or members of the public suffered injuries in either incident. The Senator <Col N="357" /> will be aware that the Garda swiftly recaptured both escapees and I compliment the force on its success in this respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister is very concerned at any escape from custody. As a matter of routine, security of escorts is reviewed locally after every escape or attempted escape. However, following the recent incidents, the Director General of the Prisons Service, at the request of the Minister, has set up an expert review group to examine the circumstances of each escape and to review escorting procedures and the equipment used in such escorts.</P>
    <P>The areas being examined include the use of handcuffs and batons, the situation in relation to keyholders, transport arrangements, staff training, the profiling of prisoners and searching procedures. This group, whose members include the head of operations of the Irish Prisons Service and two senior prison governors, has met on a number of occasions and has made significant progress in this regard. While, for obvious reasons, I cannot provide exact details, I am informed by the director general that this group has identified a number of areas where immediate improvement is possible and new instructions will shortly issue to all prison governors. In addition, this review group will continue to examine other issues which require longer-term actions and which may involve other agencies, including the Courts Service and the Garda.</P>
    <P>There will always be a need for prison escorts. Essential daily escorts include occasions where prisoners are brought to hospital, a court appearance or to another prison. The level of security on escorts is tailored to the profile of each individual prisoner. There are three basic types of escort; handcuffed escorts, armed escorts and low security escorts.</P>
    <P>I assure the Senator that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is making every effort to reduce the risk to staff and members of the public during each escort. For example, a new courthouse at Cloverhill Prison was recently opened which will allow the production of prisoners at court without the need for these prisoners to be transported on public highways. Similar plans are in place to introduce such an arrangement at Castlerea Prison. It would be impractical for all transport to be provided using prison vehicles. Private transport is regularly used, particularly by provincial prisons.</P>
    <P>It is the nature of prison escorts that, despite the most stringent precautions, there will always be an element of risk associated with transporting prisoners outside the secure confines of a closed prison. It is, however, estimated that less than one in every thousand escorts results in incidents which lead to the escape of a prisoner and the vast majority of escorts effected by prison officers are completed without incident.</P>
    <P>There have been occasions, usually unreported, where prison staff, by their vigilance or professionalism, have succeeded in preventing the <Col N="358" /> escape of prisoners, often when faced with considerable threat to their own safety.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise with the Minister the case of a young girl who has been waiting seven years for orthodontic treatment and to get a commitment as to when she will receive it.</P>
      <P>In December 1994 the young girl in question was referred as a category II patient and deemed eligible for orthodontic treatment. The parents were informed in 1999 that she had been overlooked for an appointment date and that all efforts would be made to correct the situation. No date for an appointment has been given. A great deal of work has been done trying to persuade the authorities to provide the service, but to no avail. The parents are unable to ascertain a date for an appointment and are frequently told, when they make contact with those in the service, that there is a shortage of specialists providing orthodontic treatment. This situation is unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>This young girl was identified at eight years of age as eligible for treatment. She is now 16 years old and has not received treatment. This is a matter of great distress and embarrassment to her. She is now in her teens and this issue will become even more embarrassing when she reaches the age where she wishes to socialise with friends. I am seeking a commitment from the Minister that this girl will be provided with a specific date for an appointment for treatment.</P>
      <P>In the wider context, will the Minister ensure adequate funding is put in place to ensure salaries of sufficient level are available to attract people to this position. We must provide an adequate service for children who require orthodontic treatment. Children are no longer considered eligible for such treatment on reaching 16 years of age. Surely, treatment should be provided at the earliest possible opportunity. With the coffers full of money and the European Union advising us to spend it wisely in areas of greatest need, this is one area which requires immediate funding.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Costello for raising this matter. Responsibility for providing services to this young girl rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and ordinarily the matter would be referred to the chief executive officer who would inform the Deputy of the outcome. However, given the special circumstances in this case, inquiries have been made with the ERHA and the Minister has been advised that the person was placed on a category II assessment waiting list in 1994. High priority cases, category I, are dealt with on a priority basis. However, when clients were being called for assessment in 1999 this young person's name was omitted due to an oversight. Once the matter was brought to the attention of the authority, it indicated that the person will be assessed as soon as possible to determine priority of need for treatment and she <Col N="359" /> will be placed on the treatment waiting list in the position that would have prevailed had the oversight not occurred.</P>
      <P>I very much regret the unnecessary delay which occurred in this instance and I hope the young person will be dealt with as quickly as possible. The ERHA also regrets the delay and informed me that it has no record of this matter being brought to its attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is very concerned at the long waiting lists for orthodontic treatment generally and has asked the health boards to bring forward proposals to make an immediate significant impact on those lists. An additional investment of <Col N="360" /> £5.3 million has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The ERHA has been allocated an additional £2.34 million for development of its orthodontic service this year. The additional funding will enable the authority to recruit additional orthodontic staff and provide additional services from private practitioners at approved rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister hopes that this and other initiatives which he is taking in this area will greatly improve the current level of orthodontic services.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.40 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 20 February 2001.</P>
