      <P>I have received notice from Senator Costello that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter.</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide adequate non-teaching staff and resources to fund secondary schools to enable them to carry out their work properly.</P>
      <P>I have received notice from Senator Glennon on the following matter.</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to intervene to ensure the retention at current levels of staffing at St. Patrick's senior school, Skerries, notwithstanding the temporary reduction in student numbers experienced in the current academic year and particularly in the light of the projected return to normal levels in the forthcoming academic year.</P>
      <P>I have received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter.</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to eliminate the use of padded cells in prisons.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>
      <P>I wish to remind Senators of the amendment to Standing Order 28 contained in the report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which the House agreed to on Tuesday. Three Adjournment matters can now be taken in the half-hour allowed for motions on the Adjournment. A Senator has five minutes to make his contribution on the motion raised and the Minister shall be entitled to not more than five minutes to reply.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re Iarnród Éireann Mini-CTC, to be taken without debate; No. 2, Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Bill, 2001 &ndash; Committee and <Col N="1222" /> remaining Stages; No. 3, statements on the Middle East, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 10 minutes, and of all other Senators not to exceed five minutes, to be taken from 12.30 p.m. to 1.30 p.m.; and No. 4, Valuation Bill, 2000 &ndash; Committee and remaining Stages to be taken at 2.30 p.m. Business will be interrupted from 1.30 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. On Tuesday I asked the Leader if he could find out from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when the reports into the Arms Trial papers will be completed, and if we can have a debate on them in the House. Does the Leader have that information today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable to us. Yesterday we discussed vaccination in this country. I praised work done in the past by doctors and queried if these discussions would affect our vaccination rates. I was glad that the Minister for Health and Children recently met with the Minister for Health from Northern Ireland and discussed preventative medicine. Will the Minister for Health and Children come to the House and discuss the promotion of preventative medicine on an all-island basis? We know that our measles immunisation rate is only 80% whereas it is 97% in Romania. These are very important topics, and we need to look on them on an all-island basis. It would be helpful if we were brought up to date by the Minister on the meeting with his counterpart from the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise the same point as Senator Henry. I agree with her proposal that we invite the Minister for Health and Children into the House. She is quite correct that we should deal with our health problems on an all-Ireland basis. We have not been very successful to date. Our heath system is in very bad shape and what has now been reported in the media about presentations from civil servants indicates that it is under-resourced, under-staffed, under-capitalised&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Our life expectancy is the worst in Europe. It is a very serious matter. It is not just this Government that has not dealt with problems in the health system. It is appropriate that we have a full debate with the Minister and that the terms of reference of it be broadened to include co-operation with Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of recent incidents, will the Leader allow a further debate on water safety? At this time of the year, young people take to the water and there are many risks facing them. It is something which could be debated by way of an awareness programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1223" /> I ask the Leader to use his influence with his senior colleague in Westmeath, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, to consider the ridiculous position in which Eircom finds itself in removing payphones in rural areas which have a social need. I know that they say the payphones are not economically viable. It is very cruel. To give an example, there is no phone within five miles of Ahakista, a little fishing hamlet in west Cork. The phone has been removed. Perhaps the Leader could intervene on that issue.</P>
    <P>It is disingenuous and unfair for Opposition Senators to criticise the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about crime rates etc.&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not dealing with that matter now. Have you a question for the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a very important Sex Offenders Bill through the House this week. The speakers were as scarce as teeth in a duck. It is disingenuous to complain about what the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is doing about overall crime figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters which I wish to raise. In the light of an on-going practice of Travellers/dealers/traders arriving in areas and demanding disturbance or goodbye money, will the Leader ask the relevant Ministers to look at these occurrences? In certain areas it costs the taxpayer money to have them moved from where they should not be. Some small businessmen are affected either by these demands or legal expenses and they are not able to recoup the costs even if they are awarded them.</P>
      <P>Has a date been set for a discussion on the Ombudsman's report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Government proposals, which I read in the newspapers, on altering the adoption law allowing access to original birth certificates to adoptees when they reach 18 years of age. Does the Leader know when this will be introduced in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator Cosgrave's comments. As somebody who initiated the provisions extending human rights legislation to members of the Traveller community, I certainly have a high regard for them. I understand many of the people to whom the Senator referred are from Cumbria in England and they come here and devastate the landscape. Some of them use blackmail on local communities and that is not tolerable. They leave sites in a completely unsanitary condition. The legislation needs to be considered. There are continental models which might be of assistance here. It should be possible for the Garda to charge these people at least for conduct likely to cause a breach of the peace because the aggressive behaviour on the part of some of them seems to lead to that. I say this not as somebody who is antagonistic towards genuine Travellers. These <Col N="1224" /> are wealthy traders who are holding the community to ransom and they should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I also support the calls for a debate on the health service, especially in light of the headlines in the newspapers where it appears that the Cabinet has been advised to raise health spending by £2 billion annually. This is a professional, disinterested, non-partisan voice from inside the Department of Health and Children which also states that there needs to be additional capital funding of £6 billion. That must give us all cause for concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Government decision to hold its Cabinet meeting next Monday in Muckross House. I assure it of a warm welcome from the trustees and the people of Muckross and Killarney. As the House may be aware, this year Killarney is celebrating the 250th anniversary of tourism. We in Killarney have been welcoming visitors for 250 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Senator was there much longer than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps on that account the Leader would use his good offices to urge the Government to get across the message while in Killarney, perhaps on the lawns of Muckross House looking out on the lakes and the mountains, that rural Ireland is open for business&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us hope it makes good decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will come to that in a minute. The Government should reaffirm its commitment to tourism, confirm that it is working strongly to have the 2004 World Cycling Championships centred in Killarney and perhaps make a decision to establish a State tourism intelligence unit in Killarney, the capital of tourism.</P>
      <P>The Leader will be aware that Members in the other House share my concern in regard to the number of small sewerage schemes which are waiting to be signed off, of which Rathmore, for instance, is a prime example. There is also the issue of the reopening of marts. I have in mind Kenmare, Cahirciveen and Milltown.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>

      <P>Now we know that St. Patrick never visited Killarney.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOFearghaillFF" hpid="Mr. Ó Fearghail Mr. Ó Fearghail">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ó Fearghail</NameTxt>
      <P>Having raised the issue of Traveller accommodation and the parallel issue of the convoys of traders who were traversing the country some months ago, I support the call by a number of Senators for a debate on this issue. I speak as a member of a local Traveller consultative committee when I say that the task of providing accommodation for local indigenous Travel<Col N="1225" /> lers is being made immeasurably more difficult by virtue of the havoc which is being wreaked in communities by these convoys of marauding traders traversing the country. I ask the Leader if the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will come to the House to debate this issue and advise us whether new legislation is required to deal with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked previously for a debate on the euro changeover and the Leader promised such a debate. I am asking again now because there is a sense of urgency about it. We are six months and one week away from the changeover to the euro and there are grave concerns about it. The Euro Changeover Board is doing a great job. Recently the Minister announced that coins would be front-loaded to the public beforehand. I mention this because there is a real fear around Europe that the system may break down within hours of the introduction of the euro currency on 1 January next unless sufficient steps are taken to deal with the matter. It would be useful to have a debate here and I urge the Leader to arrange for it in the next couple of weeks, if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the recent polls which show support nationally, particularly in the North, for the new executives and developments which have taken place politically. However, the recent figures which show a rise in the number of punishment beatings within communities are alarming and frightening and are worthy of comment. We must be made aware of the interference this causes to the lives of many young people in communities. It is important that we should debate this with and encourage the people working within the democratic system. Democracy needs to be strengthened and structures need to be put in place to deal with the future needs of the communities. We must encourage alternatives. It is sad to see the damage which is still being done to many people. The fact that the numbers are rising is not good. Such practices need to be discouraged and democracy needs to be encouraged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to ask the Minister for Public Enterprise or the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources the plans of Bord Gáis for the Corrib gas field off the Mayo coast. There are conflicting views and conflicting announcements coming from different sources. We would like to know the definitive position. What is Bord Gáis's plan for the Corrib gas field?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning inquired about the Arms Trial papers. I understand these will be published or announced within the next two weeks.</P>
      <P>Senators Henry, Costello and Norris called for a debate with the Minister for Health and Children on health issues. As I said on previous occasions, I have no difficulty in providing time for this and I will discuss it with the leaders of the groups after the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1226" /> Senator O'Donovan called for a debate on water safety and I will provide time for that. He spoke of his experience in his constituency of the removal of a telephone booth and I certainly will pass that on to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senators Cosgrave, Norris and Ó Fearghail called for a debate on transient Travellers and related difficulties. Senator Glynn and other Senators requested such a debate last week. They spoke of the difficulties arising where these people demand money to vacate premises and sites. I certainly will provide time for a debate over the next couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>I understand that it was the heads of the Adoption Bill which were referred to in the newspapers. I will make further inquiries in that regard on behalf of Senator Norris.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan welcomed the Government decision to meet in Killarney. I share his views on tourism. With the coverage he received throughout Europe and across the United States in recent days, I am sure former President Clinton let everybody throughout the world know that Ireland is open for tourism and that the fine weather has been bringing tourists in their thousands to our shores. The fine weather is encouraging for the domestic market in that Irish people may stay at home and enjoy it.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn called for a debate on the euro changeover. I certainly will allow time for this in the next two to three weeks. I understand that many companies are preparing their cash registers and associated equipment to be ready for the changeover by the end of October or early November.</P>
    <P>I will make inquiries with the Minister on the planned Corrib gas field on behalf of Senator Caffrey and will come back to him on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is in the name of Senator Ryan. Senator Costello explained to me that Senator Quinn and Senator Norris would move the amendments.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the title of the Bill. It seeks to delete &ldquo;(Railway&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;(Light Railway&rdquo;. The Bill is in two sections. Parts 1 and 2 deal with Luas light rail and metro and the later sections deal with heavy rail. To delete &ldquo;(Railway&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;(&ldquo;Light Railway&rdquo; would mean that the section which deals with heavy rail could not be taken because the title of the Bill would have been changed. I understand the reason for the amendment and with your indulgence I shall deal with it.</P>
      <P>When the Bill was published it was to deal with all rail. Following discussions at the transport forum, which is under the aegis of my Department, with all the managers, trades unions and all involved in the production of railways it was decided that the Railway Procurement Agency Bill was to deal with procuring material, public private partnerships and so on for all the infrastructure for Luas and metro in that part of the Bill. That was agreed and I have amendments to reflect that.</P>
      <P>To delete &ldquo;(Railway&rdquo; from the title of the Bill and substitute &ldquo;Light Railway&rdquo;, as suggested by the amendment, would mean that the later section which deals with heavy rail could not be implemented. That would not be correct. The agency will cover only light railway metro but the railway order procedure in Part 3 allows for the development of all railway infrastructure. Therefore it would mean that CIE could never apply if, say, Senator Glennon made an eloquent contribution for a service from Skerries to Gormanstown. A railway line to Navan is in the process of being proposed. This is all heavy rail and would be provided by CIE. While the amendment is tabled for a good reason it would limit the scope of CIE for heavy rail.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my gratitude to the Minister for inserting this definition. Following from it there are a number of amendments, including Government amendment No. 36. There is also the inclusion of light railway and metro in other sections of the Bill. My concern, which I raised with the Minister and I am glad she understood it so clearly, was the fact that there was no mention of &ldquo;metro&rdquo; in the Bill. Those of us who wish to advance the cause of a metro system were concerned that there was no mention of it in the Bill. My experience is that if something is not mentioned in the Bill and if there is no definition of it, it is easier to slow track the idea. I wanted to do everything possible to encourage the Minister in her valiant and determined efforts to ensure that there is a metro system here. Now we have it nailed into the Bill. I am extremely grateful to the Minister and her advisers for taking on board my request for this kind of amendment.</P>

Frequently I hear officials, Opposition and Government Members say it is not in the Bill or the Act, therefore it does not affect it. That metro was not mentioned was an aberration and could lead people to say that there was no mention of metro in the Bill.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(b)</i>to monitor and publish regular reports on the safety of such railway infrastructure;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment speaks for itself. It may well be that the Minister can tell us there was not a need for it but it seems to us that it is necessary to monitor and publish regular reports on the safety of such railway infrastructure. I assumed that was already included but the advice available to me is that unless it is stitched into the Bill it may not be included. Given the Minister's concern in <Col N="1230" /> regard to safety matters, it would be important that a regular report on safety be given. That is the reason for tabling the amendment. It may be that it is covered elsewhere but we could not find it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>An amendment such as this would strike one as being entirely correct. We are bringing forward an all encompassing Railway Safety Bill. This Bill is being brought forward by the independent group which is monitoring investment on the railways to ensure it is well used. This is a procurement agency whose purpose is to purchase infrastructure whether by public private partnerships, by public money or in any other way. I would have no difficulty with it but it will not be needed. I am publishing the Railway Safety Bill in the summer or autumn time. I hope to be back to introduce it here. It is a very substantial and very necessary Bill. It will contain items such as this and so this will be overtaken before this agency is operational. The agency will only be involved in procurement. The running and safety of the Luas will be the responsibility of the railway safety authority, which will be set up to monitor the running of all the railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's point and that is not the primary purpose of this agency. However, we frequently get the promise that something is not needed because something else will surpass it. I know it is the Minister's intention to bring forward the Bill in the autumn and the new railway safety authority will come into being before this agency is set up. On that basis, it may well be acceptable. However, it seems a shame that in the meantime there is not some way to report on it. If for some reason there were a delay in the appointment of the railway safety authority then perhaps this agency could take this on in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought about that too. We had hoped that this Bill would be through this House and that we would go into the Dáil with it. I aim to make the Railway Safety Bill the centrepiece of our legislative programme for the autumn. It is a hugely important Bill and will far surpass safety legislation in the UK or any other European country. We are going way beyond what others would deem necessary. It shows the faith in the future of railways evidenced by all parties in these Houses.</P>
      <P>In the unlikely event of this agency coming into being before the Railway Safety Bill starts its passage, then we could look at giving such powers to this agency, which would subsequently pass to the railway safety authority. However if the two were contemporaneous, it would not be necessary. We have increased the number of railway inspectors from one to three and they are responsible at present.</P>

      <P>I feel quite sure that the Minister's heart is also with this amendment, which relates to gender representation on these boards. It has been an accepted policy for quite some years to try to ensure that there is such representation. It is generally with a view to the representation of women that some special provision is required in relation to any board. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Henry and I have been friends for many years but I do not agree with this amendment. I agree with the appointment of the best people for the job. However, I have never agreed, and never will agree, with a quota system. To specify that three members of the board shall be women and three shall be men, is a type of quota system. The best person for the job should be appointed. I recall discussions on this matter at my own parliamentary party meeting when the then Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach, was introducing such a system for the boards of regional colleges or, perhaps, vocational education committees. I always felt that that approach was wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Henry is, of course, quite right in saying that there are not enough women at board level. There are not enough women in this House, in the Dáil, in business or other agencies but that will not be changed by simply specifying gender quotas. I believe that those who have responsibility for making appointments seek the best <Col N="1234" /> people, whether they are women or men. I regret that I am unable to accept the amendment proposed by Senator Henry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">

      <P>I must concur with the Minister. I refer to the experience in recent years in relation to educational boards. As the Minister has adverted to, a previous Minister for Education did set down such quotas and the positions on boards were not filled because those making the appointments could not find enough female candidates who met the criteria for membership of those boards. As a result, the boards were let drift and much valuable time was lost, in terms of the working of the boards.</P>
      <P>I fully agree that there are many very capable women out there and I have no doubt that they will be found if people are sufficiently interested in doing so, but a quota system will not address that.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(5)The First Schedule to the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, is hereby amended by the insertion therein of a reference to the Agency.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to accept this amendment. In dealing with various Bills in this House, we are constantly having to include a provision that a certain Act, agency or board is now subject to the Freedom of Information Act. Would it not be better to put it in right at the beginning that that Act will apply? No doubt, the agency will be very well run and that there will be no reason for not having the Freedom of Information Act applying to it. By bringing in this provision now, we could save a lot of time and bother later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe Senator Henry also raised this issue on the Aviation (Regulation) Bill. My own instinct also tends towards including such a provision at the beginning, thereby avoiding subsequent argument. However, the Department of Finance has the lead role in matters concerning freedom of information and, by and large, it is being dealt with very carefully, with the proper schedule of events, laws, institutions and agencies coming under that Department's remit. The Department of Finance will take this issue on board and it will be dealt with when they lay out their next trawl of who will come under the remit of the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
      <P>As the remit rests with the Department of Finance, I do not have the power to deal with it. The process has been very effective. From time to time, it can be rather startling for a Government Minister to read newspaper reports of documents and letters which have been accessed under the Freedom of Information Act. The law requires that the Minister of the day should not intervene in anything to do with that process and that is as it should be. Accordingly, until I open my Sunday newspaper, I have no idea what information it may contain from my Department. There is a very good appeals system in operation.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance has been very open with its own business, in the first instance, and has also moved swiftly to implement the arrangements in relation to other agencies. I have been told that they will take note of this matter also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I will have to ask the Minister for Finance why he does not encourage other Ministers to put in this provision when Bills are being introduced. The Freedom of Information Act has been very useful. Nothing is worse than rumour. It is much better that people should have the facts.</P>

That Department encourages a very open approach to freedom of information and has been very active in implementing the provisions of the Act, in terms of successive trawls of agencies being included.

      <P>As the House knows, the 1996 Act for the light railway, when the Luas was planned, exempted certain works to be carried out by the light railway, now going ahead as Luas. They were exempted from the planning Acts and it established instead an appeals system under an eminent person, Judge O'Leary, who was appointed by the previous Government. He was with me in the Seanad for a session. He is an excellent person and I asked him to continue, which he did until he asked to be released, after the planning for Luas was finished.</P>
      <P>Judge O'Leary set up an appeals mechanism whereby residents, community organisations and those with an interest in the light railway's construction made their case orally to him. He judged it by viewing every location and issued findings which are binding on me, subsequent Ministers and the Department. That is why section 38 is included.</P>

      <P>Section 39 sets out the information which must be contained in an environmental impact statement submitted by an applicant for a railway order. The section provides that an environmental impact statement should contain the information which it lists, such as the data and the measures. There is a summary in non-technical language of the information. An environmental impact statement shall in addition <Col N="1238" /> to and by way of explanation and simplification, or amplification, of the specified information referred to in section 1 contain further information on the following matters which it goes into in detail. The point made by Senators Ryan, Costello and O'Meara is in section 39.</P>

      <P>This relates to an earlier debate on the 1996 light railways Act. When Luas was being planned and put forward in legislation, we laid out how appeals would be dealt with under that Act. This is an extension of that whereby an eminent person would deal with appeals. Judge O'Leary, who I cannot praise enough, did so in that case and it has been suggested that it would be a person such as that. He or she would hear oral appeals made by a person, group or community, make a decision, refer that decision to the agency involved in the railways &ndash; in the case of Luas, it is to CIE, or the rail procurement office &ndash; and place an onus on the Minister to see that the decision he or she made is implemented. It is a very good system.  </P>

      <P>That is the embarrassment of having amendments tabled and not being here to argue and present them, but I am sure my colleagues sitting behind and in front of me would have done the business adequately. I am also aware Senator Tom Fitzgerald helped us out.</P>
      <P>While there are many questions I could ask, I will just ask one regarding section 38 which we opposed on the basis of a concern that all the works consisting of the construction, operation, maintenance, improvement or repair of a railway should be exempted for the purpose of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. Why is that broad exemption to apply, given that it would mean the matter would be authorised by the Minister and the planning process would not apply to such works, which is a significant departure? </P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>We had quite a debate on that section on which Senators Henry, Quinn and Caffrey asked questions. The Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, proved to be an exemplary Act in the setting up of an appeals system whereby the Minister of the day appointed an eminent person, in that case Judge Seán O'Leary, to implement the appeals process and deliberate <Col N="1246" /> on it. He set up his office in Dublin Castle, as far as I recall. Individuals, communities or organisations who felt they might be aggrieved by Luas passing through their area called to him and made oral submissions. The appeals process was held in public and the proceedings were reported daily in the newspapers at the time. Judge O'Leary listened to each case, inspected the matter and reported on it and his report on the process was presented to me. The Minister of the day is obliged to ensure the stipulations laid down by Judge O'Leary are put into operation. Such stipulations seek to ensure that the system provided under the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act for other rail developments is put into operation. That procedure was exemplary and it worked.</P>
      <P>As I said to Senator Henry, it is not as if we are talking about something we did not see in operation. When I took up this brief there was a controversy about whether part of the Luas line would go underground. When Judge O'Leary began his deliberations on the appeals process, I asked him to continue in office, which he did and he saw through lines A, B, and C and then asked to be released from bondage, as he called it, to return to mainstream judicial work. We saw that system working and we were very taken by it, as was the public. It had direct access to the person making the decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the work carried out by Judge O'Leary related to the construction of the light rail service. What about maintenance, improvement, refurbishment and upgrading works that will be carried out in the future which could continue <i>ad infinitum</i>? Substantial works might be required in five to 20 years' time that may have no bearing on the initial project or may have diverged considerably from it, which might require access to the planning laws or it might be suitable that the planning laws should apply to the carrying out of such works. That is my concern. I am satisfied with the work that has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Senator's point that while the works done now might suffice for ten to 15 years, substantial works may need to be carried out in the future. The agency, CIE or whoever would carry out those work would have to apply to the Minister who would then set up another process, such as that overseen by Judge O'Leary.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is very direct. I read the reports of many of the oral submissions and planning meetings Judge O'Leary held. Miriam, one of my officials here, worked with Judge O'Leary on that. He listened to say, Mrs. Browne, who told him the Luas line would be very near her back garden and he was courteous but very succinct. He went out to inspect Mrs. Browne's back <Col N="1247" /> garden and reported that either the line would be very near her back garden and something would have to be done or that nothing would have to be done. The writing in his reports was a model of succinct English but also reflected great justice done. I sent copies of his reports to everyone concerned. The onus is on the Minister of the day to ensure everything he stipulated is carried through. The carrying out of such works in the future would require another such process and the appointment of an office holder such as Judge O'Leary to oversee it, although I doubt if we would get someone as good as he was to do such a job. I am reminded by Senator Tom Fitzgerald that he was a Senator for a short period.</P>

If there is a need to make a change or an addition to the service, the agency that would carry out such work would have to apply to the Minister of the day who would have to set up such a system. If there was a need to amend, they would have to apply to the Minister of the day who, in turn, would have to set up such a system again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment the Minister, as I have done on many occasions since she became Minister for Public Enterprise, for initiating this important Bill in the Seanad. As she said, it was originally intended that it be more widely encompassing, but it is still a milestone in the spectacular programme she has for public transport, not only in Dublin but throughout the country. It is so essential and urgent. I concur with her fully regarding the efficiency with which the programme is progressing.</P>
      <P>I join with her in complimenting Judge O'Leary. Many years ago in Galway, I had the honour of participating with him on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; with John O'Donoghue, before the present incumbent began to present it. I recall, to my embarrassment at the time, the clarity with which he approached all the subjects raised. I am not at all surprised that he approached the tasks assigned to him by the Minister in such an efficient and effective manner. No doubt, he set a good example for the future.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been extremely accommodating, as always, in terms of accepting the views expressed by Senators. During Senator Costello's unavoidable absence, Senators Henry, Quinn and Caffrey played a spectacular role in convincing the Minister to accept some of their amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for explaining this legislation so thoroughly to us today. Initially I was disappointed that the Bill did not go far enough in addressing the heavy railway system. Nevertheless, it is specific legislation for a specific purpose. We all agree that it is worthwhile and necessary. The only section about which I have reservations is section 38, pertaining to exempted development. However, the planning process is cumbersome, slow and inefficient and one cannot think of enough negative terms to describe it. Anything subject to it is delayed, often interminably. In this instance, and judging by the sentiments of all the Senators present, the development of the transport system in the city does not need to be delayed any further. We are all conscious of the city's traffic problems. I thank the Minister for attending today.</P>

      <P>The Minister is always about two hours ahead of me coming to work. After all, she is a Minister. It was deplorable that the public transport system was allowed to get into its present state and I appreciate the work the Minister has been doing in this regard. There is a Russian delegation visiting this week and I was in Russia last week. It is not just the Moscow metro system that is marvellous; I was also in Rostov-on-Don. I found it easier to get around there without having Russian than in Dublin having English.</P>
      <P>It is dreadful that we have to work for things such as bus shelters. We should have maps showing where all the bus routes are, so one knows where one can inter-connect. Simple things like that would make such a difference to the public.</P>
      <P>This would be a major job, but I can suggest more minor things that could also be done. My bleating on about bus shelters has been taken to heart because we now have more, but there is still none for the number 10 bus near the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, and the run from the portico of the Department building to the bus stop is too far. We have to work on that. So many minor things can be done in conjunction with the major work of the Minister to make it possible for people to use public transport more often.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I also compliment the Minister. It is good to see the legislation focuses on the light rail and metro. We have been waiting for it <Col N="1249" /> for a long time. There have been many changes since the initial light rail proposals came into existence. It is almost a decade since money was originally produced by the EU; it was £400 million initially. In that time, successive Governments have not delivered the goods. I hope the actual work will take place very rapidly. We can see where streets are now being dug up. I still have reservations about exemptions regarding the planning laws. It is a question of precedence. We will see how it works. The original section has worked quite well, but for every person who has been contacted and is happy with Judge O'Leary, I know of others who are quite unhappy.</P>

Senator Fitzgerald used the word &ldquo;spectacular&rdquo; of those who are not on the Government side. I think the Minister's work is spectacular. Her ability to listen and take into account the views of those proposing amendments is admirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who are here today, Senators Liam Fitzgerald, Caffrey, Costello, Henry and Quinn, and the Senators who contributed to the Second Stage. Senator Ryan made some interesting comments on Second Stage. Senators Caffrey and Liam Fitzgerald were here for all Stages. Senators Caffrey and Quinn had very practical points of view.</P>
      <P>I want to thank the officials, Maurice Treacy and Miriam Delahunty. It is interesting that Miriam was the one who worked with Judge O'Leary, and perhaps she too is responsible for some of the excellent drafting of the Bill. Peter Fitzsimons, who is not in the House, was also involved with the Bill.</P>
      <P>I understand what Senator Henry was saying about bus shelters and problems on certain bus routes. All change takes a long time, which is a difficulty when making substantial changes to the public transport system. While going through change, until the time of completion, this is painful for commuters and customers. I remember John Prescott saying to me at a Council of Ministers meeting, &ldquo;Public transport is bloody awful, Mary.&rdquo; He meant the working out of it, as public transport is necessary, and so too is its funding. We are only beginning to wake up to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Russia was referred to. I was in St. Petersburg for two days about two months ago and it is not just the metro in Moscow that is exemplary. The <Col N="1250" /> buses come up with such regularity and there are nicely covered bus shelters, which all adds up to proper public transport. When I said that in the Dáil it evoked a huge piece in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> saying I am a socialist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I agree. Of course I do because whatever else they did they provided public transport. It is a fact that there was no other transport available as the cars were clapped out.</P>
      <P>We all fell in love with cars. Everyone wanted one, two and three cars if they could get them. Governments of different persuasions only woke up in the last decade to the problem of where all the cars and the people using them were going to go. Traffic jams made us think, but there is still a reluctance to put money into public transport.</P>
      <P>If we do not get trains, light rail, metro and buses up and running in sufficient quantities then life will not be worth living because of the congestion, fumes, environmental hazards and stress. All of these factors come from being behind the wheel, gritting one's teeth, gnawing on one's fingers and making 40 telephone calls as one waits in the queue not able to get through the lights. We also need to pay decent wages to those who run public transport. To travel by any type of train, be it light rail, heavy rail or petrol, is relaxing, safe and environmentally friendly. The change is taking a while but it is happening. I hope successive generations, Ministers, Senators and everybody including the public at large will have the benefit. I would bet even money they will say they are not benefiting. There is always a demand for perfection.</P>
      <P>When I started public life at local authority level so many years ago it seemed that if everyone could have a decent house, and then if everyone could have a proper education, the world would be right. Now that they have houses and education I feel that if they could get decent public transport maybe everything would be right then. I guess that I will go to the grave pondering what is the new area of life that has to be put right before everyone will feel they have a decent return for their money.</P>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Cathaoirleach and those who helped to conduct the putting through of what I think is a good Bill.</P>

    <Title>Middle East: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Seanad for giving me the opportunity to make a statement on the Middle East. The Government is acutely concerned by the crisis in Israeli-Palestinian relations. The resurgence of <Col N="1251" /> this conflict has already taken an appalling toll of life and put in jeopardy the peace process in which so much effort and hope have been invested. It poses a real threat to the stability of the entire Middle East region.</P>
      <P>The confrontation in the Palestinian territories and Israel is fraught with dangers. This outburst of violence occurred during that crucial and tense stage when the parties were moving closer to agreement than they had ever been. Tragically, the essential pillars of peace, trust and confidence, have been seriously undermined. Rage and frustration, stemming from the failure of each side to respond adequately to the problems of the other, have boiled over, and the world community has witnessed the awful consequences.</P>
      <P>We have made our position clear. We deplore all acts of violence and have called for a complete cessation of acts of hostility. I renew our call on both sides to exercise the utmost restraint and to do all in their power to prevent incidents and the escalation to which they give rise. Both sides need to move in the direction of an agreement on how to revive the peace process and to avert the dangers that this conflict could incite. The major objective is the achievement of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region, which must necessarily recognise both the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and Israel's right to live in peace and security.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the very impressive work of the Sharm el-Sheik fact-finding commission headed by Senator George Mitchell. Javier Solana, the High Representative of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, also played a major role in the commission's work on behalf of the EU. Their intention was to save the peace process. We know from our experience of building peace in Northern Ireland that there is no other way forward.</P>
      <P>The Government has welcomed the commission's report which was published on Monday. The report recommends that the Government of Israel and the Palestinian authority should reaffirm existing agreements and immediately cease violence, immediately resume security co-operation, establish a meaningful cooling off period and discourage incitement in all its forms. These recommendations are broadly similar to those made in the initiative undertaken recently by Egypt and Jordan. They are designed to bring a halt to the current violence and open a way towards the resumption of peace negotiations.</P>
      <P>The measures also call for a freeze on all settlement activity, the lifting of the closures of Palestinian towns, the transfer to the Palestinian authority of all tax revenues owed, permission for Palestinians to return to their jobs in Israel and for Israeli security forces and settlers to refrain from the destruction of homes, roads, trees and agricultural property. These measures are similar to those contained in the draft resolution tabled by Ireland and three other European countries, France, the United Kingdom and Norway, at the United Nations Security Council in March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1252" /> The Government is convinced that such measures offer the only possible path out of the current violence and towards a peaceful solution of this tragic conflict in which so many lives have been lost. I have called on both sides to move to adopt the measures recommended by the Mitchell report and to act urgently to halt further acts of violence and, in particular, to do all in their power to de-escalate the level of violence.</P>
    <P>In a live televised broadcast on Tuesday night, Prime Minister Sharon broadly welcomed the Mitchell report as a constructive and positive document and as a positive basis which may enable both sides to break the cycle of violence. It is noteworthy that it was after this broadcast that an aide to Prime Minister Sharon announced that the Government had ordered the Israeli military to cease all initiated actions against the Palestinians as a first step towards implementing the Mitchell commission's proposals for calming the violence.</P>
    <P>Press analysis has overwhelmingly assessed the Mitchell report as offering the best hope of a path away from the abyss, a lifeline of which everyone must grab a firm hold. The parties no doubt have hard things to say to each other but it would be best if these were said in the most propitious framework in the present circumstances. The important thing is that they speak to each other, work to overcome their mutual mistrust and do their best, with outside help, to restore an atmosphere conducive to negotiation. There must be a political process. A vacuum will simply allow the extremists on either side to exploit the fears of ordinary Palestinians and Israelis alike, reinforcing the vicious circle of violence.</P>
    <P>We are playing a part in the intensive diplomatic efforts being made to bring the crisis to an end, bilaterally with both sides, in the EU and as a member of the Security Council. In our bilateral contacts with Israel, we have encouraged them to join the Palestinian authority in seeking to rebuild trust and confidence, mutual respect, parity of esteem and a spirit of partnership. I outlined our experience on these islands in developing a win-win approach. I also reminded them of the concrete contribution Ireland has made to peace in the region through our participation in UN peacekeeping in Lebanon, where the safety of our troops is of ongoing concern.</P>
    <P>Stressing the need for maximum restraint on all sides, we assured them of our support for all efforts to restore calm and to find a way forward to a peaceful solution. We have strongly put forward our views. I met the Palestinian Minister for Planning and International Co-operation, Dr. Nabil Sha'ath, in Dublin on Tuesday. He was also received by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. He was encouraged that the US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, had endorsed the Mitchell report and he said that the Palestinian authority will honour its part of the report's recommendations. He asked that both Ireland and our EU partners do all we can in dialogue with the United States to persuade them to embrace the report's <Col N="1253" /> recommendations and engage in rebuilding the peace process. He said that the Palestinians should have recourse to the Fourth Geneva Convention. He wanted the parties to the convention, as he put it, to signal international displeasure at the violation of international law and requested that the EU member states convey their agreement to reconvening a conference on this issue in Geneva. I cannot report that he was optimistic about the prospects for early progress towards a resumption of meaningful negotiations with the Israeli Government. Nevertheless, he called for Europe to play a full supportive role in the search for peace.</P>
    <P>The EU General Affairs Council last week addressed the crisis. My EU colleagues and I had a thorough discussion with UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, about the difficulties posed by the current situation. The EU position is to impress on all parties the need to de-escalate the level of violence and adopt a package of concurrent, mutually supportive measures and not to insist on single measures which in isolation are incapable of being either accepted or implemented. Key points would be the implementation of existing agreements and an end to all further settlement activities. The EU position on Israel's settlement policy is clear. All settlement activities in Gaza, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and on the Golan Heights are illegal under international law and constitute a major obstacle to peace. This includes what is known as the natural growth of settlements, which is a violation of international law that cannot be allowed to continue unabated.</P>
    <P>Ireland is working actively as a member of the Security Council in the search for ways to overcome the breakdown in trust. Ireland and three other European countries, France, the United Kingdom and Norway, tabled a draft resolution in March. We had further discussions in the council this week and last week and these are to be taken further in the coming days. The use of lethal weapons and recourse to disproportionate and excessive retaliation have been widely condemned.</P>
    <P>The Israeli Government has been criticised, particularly by the leading newspapers in Israel, for its use of F16 jet fighters to bomb Palestinian targets on Friday, 18 May in retaliation against the suicide bombing in Netanya on the same day which we absolutely condemn. This is further evidence that these newspapers have taken issue, not with the principle of retaliation, but with the means, arguing that by Israel's use of the F16s, the Palestinian authority gained the upper hand in the public relations battle and that European and US Sunday newspapers gave more emphasis to the Israeli high-tech warfare machine than the deed of the suicide bomber.</P>
    <P>Another dimension is that at the same time the Palestinian Authority still faces enormous financial and institutional problems. The international donor meeting in Stockholm on 11 April was a concrete step towards a solution to the authority's <Col N="1254" /> budgetary crisis, particularly the commitments made by Arab countries. Following the Stockholm meeting, the European Commission and the authority have been discussing the basis for future assistance. This includes measures intended to enhance financial management and complete the process of institutional reform. Some of these measures, in particular those referring to institutional reform, constitute a clear confirmation of commitments announced in the past by the authority.</P>
    <P>The Palestinian Authority is also working on other welcome reforms related to financial management, such as the consolidation of revenues. The IMF is monitoring this process. On this basis the European Union is to make monthly payments of 10 million to the authority during the next six months.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that we will continue to work together with our partners and friends in Europe, Israel and the Arab world, to encourage a return to the only path which leads away from conflict and towards genuine peace, security and justice for all the peoples and countries of the Middle East. I will also make every effort to ensure that this House and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs is kept fully informed and notified of the Government's activities to this end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. He has given us a comprehensive overview of the current situation in the Middle East with particular reference to Israel and Palestine as well as a comprehensive view of the Government's policy and attitude. He will find that much of what I have to say reflects his views of the situation.</P>
      <P>I join with him in welcoming the report of the international commission, chaired by George Mitchell, whom we know well, on the origins of the current upsurge of violence between Israel and Palestine. I also welcome the fact that both sides to the conflict have broadly welcomed the findings of the Mitchell commission. Let us hope that forms the basis for peace or the start of negotiations.</P>
      <P>I welcomed the decision by Israel last year to withdraw its forces from Lebanon, which was a very positive step forward under the premiership of Mr. Barak. It is a great pity Syria cannot see its way to withdrawing its forces from Lebanon as it would be a huge step forward in creating a better sense of security for Israel if the Syrian Government found it no longer had a reason to keep so many divisions of its large army in Lebanon. Israel has issues with the &ldquo;security&rdquo; of its own continued existence and it will always feel it inimical to its security to have so many troops of another major power in the region, Syria, based in a neighbouring country. Of course Syria would gainsay much of what I am saying by referring to the Golan Heights, which it and the world sees as part of Syrian sovereign territory but which has been occupied since 1967 by Israel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1255" /> We must condemn the unreasoning violence and rhetoric of the recent upsurge. It all started when Ariel Sharon went to the Temple Mount, though that was preceded by the breakdown of the conference under then President Clinton; it had been hoped that that would bring about a solution last September.</P>
    <P>One cannot understand the totally disproportionate use of force by the Israeli army and the unjustified and wanton destruction of Palestinian property by that army. There is also the use of collective punishment against the civilian population in the West Bank and Gaza. The Palestinian legislative council, the effective Palestinian Government, cannot meet because of these assaults on the civilian population and because of the encirclement of the many scattered areas which constitute the Palestinian territory on the West Bank. Many of them are under siege, which means that legislators representing and living in these areas cannot go to plenary sessions of the Palestinian legislative council. That is a great barrier to creating an environment in which the Palestinian Government can even agree an approach to reopening the peace process.</P>
    <P>We must also be balanced and as neutral as possible and I will try to be but it is necessary for me to say harder things about the Israeli Government than the Palestinian Authority. I am expressing the facts as I believe them. However, the Palestinian Authority has not shown leadership in being determined to follow a policy of peaceful coexistence with Israel. Palestine must recognise Israel's special existence on its own security.</P>
    <P>If the history of the Jewish State and people has taught us anything, it is that the Jewish people have suffered appallingly at the hands of the rest of the world. They have suffered genocide, persecution and open hatred and discrimination over centuries. The Jewish State was born in 1948 and on almost every day it was attacked by its neighbours with a view to its total destruction. One has to see that within the Israeli psyche there is this overriding need for security but it is something the Palestinians do not or cannot seem to understand. If an environment for a peaceful solution to the problem is to be created they will have to understand that, as must the rest of the world. Many people still remember the Holocaust or are children of its victims; there are still survivors of the Holocaust in Israel. All of them know their own history and know that no matter where they were in the world they were discriminated against as a minority.</P>
    <P>The Government must encourage the efforts of the international commission and the joint EU effort, of which we are part. It must encourage in every possible way the restart of negotiations. When those negotiations recommence the same issues will confront the negotiators &ndash; the status of Jerusalem and the holy sites, the Jewish settlements, which are very important, and the refugee problem. These are often seen as intractable <Col N="1256" /> problems and they will remain to be confronted by both sides when they eventually sit down to work out a settlement, as they will have to do.</P>
    <P>The Jewish settlement issue is one of the most problematic. The many international actors involved in the Palestinian-Israeli problem since it commenced, including the UN, have long acknowledged that the continued expansion of these settlements by Israel has had damaging effects on confidence building between the two sides. The policy of building new settlements in the West Bank and Gaza completely undermines a two state solution to the problem which would recognise continuous borders that would be defensible. The policy of building settlements flies in the face of the first principle of the Oslo peace process, which was land for peace. We should not forget that. The House and the Government must utterly condemn the Jewish settlement policy and I was glad to hear what the Minister had to say on this issue today. It is illegal. In the Israeli State budget this year US$300 million was earmarked for further settlement programmes in 2001 and that must be condemned.</P>
    <P>The Israeli Government must also be called upon to control the activities of many people who have been settled in these areas. The settlers are often fanatical ultra-Orthodox Jews who have come from aboard. They have engaged in the most appalling provocative activity and propaganda. They have not been adverse to turning on the Israeli security forces, taking the law into their own hands and behaving in a lawless manner. We are not convinced that the Israeli Government, especially under Sharon, is in any mood to tackle these people.</P>
    <P>The Israelis use of force, ranging from bombings from helicopter gunships to extra-judicial killings of Palestinian figures, has been condemned by the international community. The closure of territories, the destruction of houses and private property and the collective punishments are seen by the Palestinians as forms of inadmissible violence. There are also allegations that Israel uses weapons containing depleted uranium and we know the concerns about people's health and the environment which that entails.</P>
    <P>Israel has also used F16 bombers recently in raids over the Palestinian territories. These F16 bombers were sold by the United States to Israel on the basis that they would be used only for defensive purposes, not for the offensive purposes in these cases, and that must be condemned by the international community, including Ireland.</P>
    <P>There has been great concern in the Palestinian territories regarding respect for human rights. There have been many reports of arbitrary arrests in the Palestinian territories and of detention without trial, torture and deaths while in custody, summary trials and executions. All these reports have been backed up by facts. These incidents have taken place in the Palestinian territories, <Col N="1257" /> perhaps with the consent of the Palestinian authority &ndash; we do not know. However, the EU has been forced to take up these matters strongly with the Palestinian authority and has not got satisfactory answers. Calls on the Palestinian authority by the EU rapporteur for a moratorium on the death penalty have also met deaf ears.</P>
    <P>As regards the observance of human rights by Israel in situations of war or conflict, a recent statement on behalf of the EU regretted the failure of the Israeli Government to co-operate with the special rapporteur of the EU on the human rights situation in the occupied territories. At the same time the EU has had to remind Israel that the Geneva Convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in times of war &ldquo;is fully applicable to the Palestinian occupied territories, including East Jerusalem, and constitutes binding international humanitarian law&rdquo;. It is somewhat shocking that a country such as Israel, which calls itself a modern democratic state, has had to receive that warning and reminder from the EU regarding its human rights practices and its role in upholding basic human rights, albeit in a conflict or war with its neighbour.</P>
    <P>I am sorry my time has run out. There is much more to discuss. I would like to talk about the economic effects which this has on Israel and particularly on the Palestinian territories. These territories are now bankrupt. Israel is a modern economy in which the average <i>per capita</i> income per annum is about $19,000 or $20,000, whereas it is less than $2,000 in the Palestinian territories. Therefore one can see the great difference which exists in the capacity of the protagonists to withstand this terrible conflict.</P>
    <P>I thank you, Chairman, for your indulgence in allowing me these few minutes to add those one or two additional thoughts. There was much more I hoped to say. We must take up with the Leader that we need a little more than ten minutes for contributions on issues as important as this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;because this is a matter of considerable urgency for Ireland and world politics. I have been speaking about the problems in the Middle East for many years. Unfortunately I have not seen movement which would provide a peaceful resolution of the problem and I am getting increasingly worried about what is happening there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ambassador Brendan Scannell in Tel Aviv has been a huge influence in the area and, luckily enough we appointed Ms Isolde Moylan-McNally as chargé d'affaires in Ramallah. She is probably living and working in one of the toughest post<Col N="1258" /> ings, but from seeing what she has done in other places, I suggest that her presence there is of considerable importance to the Minister, the Department and Ireland. That is recognised by the Palestinian Authority as well as by everybody else.</P>
    <P>Trust and confidence-building is needed in the Middle East. I might be wrong but I think that Mauritania and Israel are the only two countries which were created by vote of the United Nations. It is very difficult to see trust and confidence being engendered when at all times Israel, a country created by the United Nations, has not adhered to the wishes of the United Nations and the international community.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a member of the UN Security Council. I recognise that, because Ireland is only a temporary member, its influence must be more of a moral nature because the five permanent members possess a veto on decisions. While our moral influence must be put forward at all times, the unfortunate reality is that the problems in the Middle East will not be resolved because to date the United States has used its veto whenever there has been a tough resolution against Israel before the Security Council.</P>
    <P>The Israelis have every right to enjoy the protection of the world and to protect themselves. They are entitled to be a nation and we accept that, but they should not pursue that at the expense of the Palestinians, the indigenous population of the area. Long before the Ashkenazim arrived, the Sephardim were resident there. As Senator Connor stated, the Ashkenazim arrived in Palestine as a result of genocidal problems in Europe. There was an attempt to eliminate the Jews in Europe from the face of the earth and no doubt they needed protection. However, that protection should not have been provided at the expense of the Palestinians.</P>
    <P>There is no question or doubt that civil rights abuses are being committed on the Palestinians. It is difficult in an occupied territory for the leadership of the Palestinians to gather all their people together as an entity and expect that there will not be abuses of power in the area.</P>
    <P>Recently I attended a conference of the Islamic states in Tehran in support of the Palestinian Intifada at which I heard the most radical people in the world talking about support for the Palestinians. It frightened me very much because Hizbollah and Hamas and the leaders of every radical group in the Islamic community were talking about what they would do to support the Palestinians. The rhetoric was not so much in support of the Palestinians but rather in support of a huge Islamic coup in the Middle East. That is very frightening. If these people become involved, the Palestinians will not be the ones to gain, and we will all be the losers. It was very frightening to listen to the rhetoric of violence being cheered by up to 5,000 people. We must be cognisant of the fact that the Palestinians are victims, not alone of what is happening in Israel, but also of the support they <Col N="1259" /> receive from extreme radical groups around the world.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that at United Nations level, everything possible is done to bring about a peaceful resolution, to persuade the Government of Israel that it is in its interests to support Yasser Arafat and the PLO. Otherwise, the conflagration that could happen in the Middle East will affect all of us. It is a frightening prospect.</P>
    <P>I saw the American reaction to the conference in Tehran. They regarded it as a meeting of terrorists about terrorism. The rhetoric at that meeting was terrorist rhetoric. The Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon is nonsense. They withdrew from Lebanon because their people were being killed in south Lebanon. F16s and helicopters can be used in Lebanon without the need for Israeli soldiers on the ground.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to react to the Senator's remark. The Israelis were protecting themselves by withdrawing from Lebanon. The Syrians were invited into Lebanon but the Israelis were not.</P>
      <P>The state of Israel was created in 1948 by the United Nations. There is now huge discrimination against the minority in Israel. I will give an example in an Irish context. Five years ago, a farm was being divided in Ballingarry, County Tipperary. The farm had been owned by the same person who owned the mines in Ballingarry. People from the area showed me maps of where their ancestors had lived in the Ballingarry area in the 18th and 19th centuries. Palestinians were evicted out of their homes in 1948 and have been displaced ever since. Like the people in Ballingarry, the Palestinians do not forget where they came from. They know the placement of each vine in the vineyards in their home place. They have been eliminated from the face of the earth. People then urge them to remain calm in the face of the violence of the Israeli state. It is a nonsense to think that they would forget in one generation what has happened to them.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister and, through the Minister, the UN Security Council to make every effort to bring about a peaceful resolution. If peace is not achieved within the next year, there will be a conflagration. Radicalism throughout the world will be part of that. The Middle East is as close to Ireland as Norway, it is on our doorstep. A conflagration could happen overnight and we will all suffer. I thank the Minister for coming to the House today because this is a matter of extreme importance. The Middle East is very near to us, like friends and relations. I ask the Minister to continue his efforts for peace in the Middle East on behalf of the Israelis who are genuinely looking for peace and on behalf of the Palestinians who must have peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to see the Minister back in the House and back in action, although a little wounded and carrying the scars and the bandages. I hope it was not the vigorous exchange of views in this House on the afternoon of the Minister's accident that contributed to that rather unfortunate event. I am very glad he is still very much on form, as was evidenced by his speech.</P>
      <P>This is a question of competing rights. It is a very complex situation. Anyone who imagines or suggests it is possible to view this simply from one angle and to characterise one side as completely wrong and the other completely right makes no valuable contribution, simply muddies the water and only adds extra confusion to the whole issue.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest and care to Senator Lanigan's contribution. I am glad I saw certain movement in what he said. He has obviously been in a situation recently where he was exposed to violent rhetoric, and one can make excuses for that, but it is indeed very frightening and he is right to be concerned. We should all be concerned. Although I intend to be critical of Israel, I also intend to be critical of the Palestinians. Having been in Israel on many occasions, I have noticed recently an extraordinary escalation in the degree of incitement that is permitted on the official television channels of the Palestinian Authority. Regrettably, in the past week or so, this has included material directly calling for and endorsing the use of suicide bombing. I suppose this is a response of despair on the part of those people, but it is very unfortunate. I hope this incitement will be put to one side.</P>
      <P>There are, however, hopeful signs. We had a meeting yesterday with Dr. Nabil Sha'ath, a Palestinian Minister. I was extremely impressed &ndash; perhaps it was because the meeting was in private &ndash; that reasonably moderate views were expressed in a very urbane way. It seemed he is the kind of person with whom business can be done. I do not think I am breaching confidentiality when I say that it was clear from what he said that contacts are being continued between himself and his office at a high level in the Israeli Government. These contacts must be endorsed because people must continue to talk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He introduced his talk to us by drawing comparisons with the Irish relationship to our neighbouring island. I was amused by that because the Israelis used to do the same. They would talk about their freedom fighters and our freedom fighters. I indicated to Dr. Sha'ath that a slightly anti-British tinge was no longer the key to unlocking the Irish heart, as we now get on reasonably well with our larger neighbour. He indicated to us that talks were continuing at a fairly high level and we must encourage that. He did not ask if there were parallels with the Northern situation. I thought of the notion of parity of esteem which was developed here, giving equal respect to two traditions. Tragically, this has not happened within the state of Israel as far as the Arab citizens are concerned and certainly with <Col N="1261" /> regard to the treatment of the Palestinians. I think we ought to emphasise that. It is a long-term approach but in these complicated situations one has to take such an approach. I am glad Senator Mitchell and his colleagues have become involved. It is very encouraging that Foreign Minister Peres issued a perhaps slightly qualified endorsement but still an endorsement and a welcome for the Mitchell principles. They include the fact that there should be a reaffirmation of existing agreements and an immediate cessation of violence &ndash; I do not think anybody from the outside could withdraw from that &ndash; the immediate resumption of security co-operation, a meaningful cooling off period to be established and the discouragement of incitement in all its forms. That was the principal element endorsed by Foreign Minister Peres.</P>
    <P>However, the government of Mr. Sharon rapidly made it clear that it held back from certain other elements and, in particular, the call for a freeze on all settlement activity, the lifting of controls on Palestinian towns, the transfer to Palestinian authorities of all tax revenues owed and permission for Palestinians to return to jobs in Israel and so on. That is the difficult element on which we need to call on the Israeli Government to co-operate with the international community. As a friend of Israel I have no difficulty with that whatever. That is one of the keys.</P>
    <P>It is a tragedy that the opportunity presented to us at the Sharm-el-Sheik meeting last year was not grasped. It was interrupted by the visit of Mr. Sharon to the Temple Mount. How sad it is that the Palestinians at that time did not have the wisdom, the patience, the foresight and the political imagination to ride out that particular storm without endorsing intifada. If they had commanded the moral authority to live through what was seen by them undoubtedly as a calculated insult by Sharon they would have achieved a far greater moral authority and they could have accepted what was being offered to them.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan said he has seen no movement in all the period in which he has witnessed events in the Middle East. I do not know where he has been looking, because I have certainly seen movement. Fifteen years ago it was a criminal offence in Israel for Israeli citizens to have any kind of meetings, discussions or negotiations with members of the PLO and now a Government is sitting down with the PLO. What was on offer a year ago was virtually a return to 1967 boundaries, freezing of settlements and Barak even went so far as to say they would negotiate on the status of Jerusalem. That is everything. It was a tragedy that both sides were at fault. If they could just have reached out to each other in these last moments before the Israeli election I think the situation could have been transformed. It is a great pity that opportunity was not taken.</P>
    <P>May I say, because I visit that region a great deal and I am consistently critical of the Israeli situation and I write back to the Foreign Minister in Israel in highly critical terms on various aspects <Col N="1262" /> of the policy, I think I also understand certain things that are not understood very well over here and that are coded. I am perfectly certain the Minister is aware of them. For example, Mr. Arafat's government calls for an unqualified right of return for Palestinian refugees, whose plight is pitiable. There is no question about that, neither is there any question about the fact that that is coded language for the destruction of the state of Israel. Nobody is under any illusion that the territory of Israel could support the mass influx of 5 million or 6 million refugees, many of whom are the grandchildren of people who have lived there. They have no homes to go to. How could any state support that? The right of return is emotionally appealing, particularly as a parallel to the right of Jews to return, but it is coded language for the destruction of the state of Israel and we must be careful to understand this kind of thing.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I have communicated to my Israeli friends that I regard as unacceptable the use of assassination as a political weapon. They have been quite open in saying they have been doing this. The use of murder as an instrument of foreign policy is not acceptable in any democracy. The response, physically, in terms of force is disproportionate. The use of F16 fighters is disproportionate, as is the mass levelling of houses, but this is happening under Sharon. I remember his slogan as I was there during the election. His slogan was <i>ain shalom bli bitacon,</i> no peace without security, but it could be turned around, <i>ain bitacon bli shalom,</i> no security without peace. If you are as cynical as I am about the situation and about his background you might have said <i>ain shalom mi </i>Sharon, no peace with Sharon, because I think in his personality he is a serious obstacle to peace.</P>
    <P>I should like to say also, and I hope this gets back to my friends in Israel, Mr. Sharon came in promising peace. The Barak government was not able to deliver it. One almost got the impression that he would be able to prevent suicide bombing. We had just had the Netanya bomb. It is tragic that civilians are being killed there. Nobody can deliver that kind of security against suicide bombers and the Israelis have got to be made aware of this.</P>
    <P>There must be investigations into all deaths of unarmed people, whether they are five policemen in a security hut. That has got to be explored by the Israeli authorities. I also believe the European Union has a strong responsibility. At one level, at least, the European countries solved their problem after the Second World War at the expense of the Arabs and also intrinsically at the expense of the Jewish people who were uprooted and stuck into this strange country of which they had only a vague ancestral memory. Because we did that we are morally responsible. The European Union should be prepared to put substantial funds into the reconstruction of Palestine when this tragic situation is resolved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1263" /> I am glad that a first step has been taken. Yesterday's newspaper carried headlines indicating that the Israeli troops were being put on a kind of qualified ceasefire. They will not initiate action &ndash; that at least is good. We have to build on this incrementally and encourage the Palestinians if they can, if their situation is not totally out of control, to make some parallel judgment. We have to be very careful and advise our Israeli friends that the idea of ongoing needs of settlement is not satisfactory. There are dangerous echoes of <i>Lebensraum</i> in this notion of expanding settlements all the time.</P>
    <P>There are positive signs. The fact that both Mr. Peres, the Foreign Minister, and Benyamin Elizer&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <P>&mdash;are endorsing the Mitchell report, and even calling internally for a freeze on settlements, is almost splitting the government. It will be interesting to see if Mr. Peres and Mr. Benyamin Elizer are able to stay inside the present Israeli Government.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister for his attempts. We have to be as balanced as possible. It is important that we do not come out as friends of one side or the other. We have to be friends of both sides. Each of them, when they come into a foreign affairs meeting, may say, &ldquo;I will speak to you because I know you are friends of Israel or Palestine.&rdquo; We must be neutral and balanced.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister, Deputy Cowen, for his attendance for the duration of statements today and wish him well in his recovery from his injuries. There is not much to add to the Minister's statement. I warmly endorse it. It accurately summarises my own personal position on this matter and I commend the Minister and the Government on their efforts to contribute to the peace process in the Middle East and to resolve the difficulties between the Palestinians and the Israelis. It has been a balanced response by the Government. The Government's and the Seanad's record is good in terms of its contribution to the issues that have bedevilled the relationship between the Palestinians and the Israelis for such a long period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The genesis of the present downward spiral of violence began when Mr. Sharon visited the Temple Mount. It is difficult for us to appreciate the significance in the Muslim and Palestinian psyche of the Temple Mount and the fact that it is almost in certain respects an enclave surrounded by another tradition. To draw a comparison, it would be as if Knock were invaded by armed forces and we responded. This lets us know the depth of feeling among Palestinians. Obviously, there were more fundamental factors involved in the subsequent downward spiral of violence but that was <Col N="1264" /> the spark that lit the fuse. We had been hopeful about the Oslo accord and those of us who visited the Holy Land were encouraged by the statements we heard from Palestinian and Israeli leaders at that time. We have come a long way from that and the task facing the international community, as well as the Government, is to put the pieces back together. The Minister's statement today is part of that whole process.</P>
    <P>I commend Senator Mitchell on the report he produced and I am glad there is widespread acceptance of it in the international community. The point was made that there are not strict parallels with the Irish experience. However, I believe that there are lessons that could be learnt by the Israelis and Palestinians, and one of our tasks is to make them aware of how the resolution of conflict was achieved here with the involvement of Senator Mitchell, the Minister and others.</P>
    <P>The <i>sine qua non</i> is that progress can only be made when the violence stops. The cessation of violence is the basic building block on which confidence is restored. The Minister is correct in saying that the central difficulty is that confidence and trust has been totally eroded by what has happened in recent months. The other difficulty relates to the level of response. The firepower on the Israeli side is considerably greater than that on the Palestinian side. I do not defend suicide bombings or other atrocities that have emanated from the Palestinian side, but the Israeli level of response has been totally disproportionate, particularly in the use of F16s. This reiterates the point that the violence must be subdued before the other elements can come into effect.</P>
    <P>It is only necessary to visit the Gaza crossing to understand the depth of humiliation the Palestinians have experienced. People arrive there by bus in their thousands and walk through corrals, several hundred metres away from where those of us who are privileged to be able drive through may cross. They then get on buses to work, if they can find the work in Israel. Having seen that, I can understand how it could foster such a sense of frustration and grievance. That is also something that is relevant to our experience. That type of conduct creates an atmosphere that fosters terrorism. The Minister is correct in pointing out the central significance of the political process and that a vacuum will allow extremists to come to the fore. His statement is to be applauded.</P>
    <P>Many Senators spoke about the importance of the settlements. I endorse what Senator Lanigan said and those of us from rural areas understand it very well. How can a family be on land for several generations going back to biblical times and then be removed without compensation or notice? It is no surprise that terrorism emanates from that type of activity. Few Irish people are very far removed from the land and it is something that we understand very well. It is part of our national experience and psyche.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1265" /> The US is a key player and some encouraging noises have come from there. I hope the Minister will use his influence to ensure that the Mitchell report develops to the extent that it should. There is also the question of the Government and the EU supporting the Palestinian Authority, which is the central bulwark that is stopping everything descending into utter chaos. It has extremists on its own side pushing it in one direction and Israelis pushing it in the other direction. The Minister is aware of that, as are Senator Lanigan and the members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs from their meetings with Nabil Sha'ath and others recently. There needs to be budgetary and political support for the Palestinian Authority, because without them, I cannot see a resolution. I hope the Minister will continue his efforts at EU level and elsewhere to try to bring a resolution to these problems. On these occasions we remember our friend Youssef Allan and the contribution he made when he was here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>My sympathies in this conflict lie largely with the Palestinians. I have been to Bethlehem, Hebron and Jericho and have seen places where people had land confiscated after living there for a long time. I saw the appalling conditions under which people live. It is as if an Irish family, when sitting at home, heard a knock on the door and on going outside saw uniformed people with tanks and guns claiming to be from Tuatha de Danann and asking for the return of the land God gave them 2,000 years ago.</P>
      <P>In many conflicts throughout the world, if we dwell too much on the <i>de jure</i> situation we will get no resolution. It is better to look at the <i>de facto</i> situation and determine what can be done. As the Minister said, the Mitchell commission has come up with a number of resolutions, essentially recommending a halt to violence followed by discussions. This is not easy, but I believe it can be done. The European Union says that all settlement activity in Gaza and the West Bank, including east Jerusalem, is illegal under international law and constitutes a major obstacle to peace. I cannot see Israel giving up the Golan Heights until many years after this is resolved. It overlooks Jerusalem and is an ideal base to stop any potential invasion from Syria. I do not agree with putting many settlements there, but they are there and I cannot see them leaving for a long time. However, I hope they will pull out of the other ones.</P>
      <P>We must support all peace initiatives and should help the Palestinians financially as they do not get enough support. The Israelis get large handouts from the United States. I am sure the Minister will continue his good work to foster peace in the area.</P>

      <P>During Second Stage of the Bill, the Minister of State mentioned that he intended to have all Government properties in the State valued. He said this was the first time that had been done. It appears from my inquiries that State properties within the city boundary of Dublin have been valued for many years. For example, Leinster House, Dublin Castle and all Government buildings have been valued. The rateable value of these buildings is £355,000. Applying the poundage at £43.99 in the pound, Dublin Corporation would be entitled to a revenue income of £15,616, 450. Unfortunately, the corporation only gets £7 million of that in the rates subvention, leaving a shortage of £8 million.</P>
      <P>If the amendments which I had proposed had been in order, I would be asking that Government properties would be valued to that extent. Although the amendments were ruled out of order, I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the discrepancy in the income which would be available to a local authority if these buildings were rateable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt extensively with the question of rating State property during the Second Stage debate and in the other House. I have some sympathy with the argument. The first thing we need to do is to find out the actual value of all existing State property. There is no clear idea on that. I have seen figures which vary over an enormous range as to what the potential value of all State property might be. Historically, some State properties have had some valuation put on them, but we have no up-to-date assessment. As Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, I can inform Senators that the amount of property transactions in which we have been involved on behalf of the State, even in the past few years, is enormous, particularly in the capital city of Dublin but also throughout the country.</P>
      <P>It is certainly necessary, as a first step, that the State should know the value of its entire property portfolio. Under this legislation, we will proceed to have that information made available. Whatever decisions a future Government or the Houses of the Oireachtas may take remains to be seen, but at least such decisions will be based on accurate information rather than the present inaccurate guesstimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The way we changed the approach to valuation will be beneficial to the ratepayer. I have tried to bring the ratepayer, as the Senator's question bears out, centre stage in the process. The ratepayer will be directly involved with the Valuation Office in understanding how the rate is reached. He or she will be able to discuss it with the Valuation Office before the valuation is set. He or she will also know the valuations of the area and will not be operating in isolation over the valuation. The Valuation Office will notify the ratepayer before it goes into the public domain. Many procedures will benefit the ratepayer before a tribunal needs to be approached. All the facts will be known. It is important that the facts are clear by the time the valuation tribunal is invoked. However, the tribunal is independent and it is not for anyone to set down in law that such a valuation could not be raised. The Senator puts forward a possible scenario but it rarely happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Valuation Office determines a property's valuation, it should be the law that this is the upper limit. If a person appeals in the initial procedure or at the tribunal, then they will know they will lose out by an increased valuation. If the Valuation Office is competent, it ought to be able to determine at first instance the maximum valuation of a property.</P>
      <P>There are other areas in legislation where taxes are levied or evaluations fixed in which there is a maximum figure and the authority concerned will in the first instance affix the maximum figure. That protects the property owner or the householder from the risk of going to appeal to end up worse off, in other words, the appeals system increases the valuation or at least leaves it the same.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the Senator's point.

It is very rarely that the circumstances of which the Senator speaks occur.</P>

      <P>It would be wrong of me or of the House to set down in law something that would tie the hands of the Valuation Office &ndash; that once a rate was set that was the upper limit. It might <Col N="1271" /> open the door for everybody to say they had nothing to lose in this. There has to be reasonable judgment on both sides of the argument. That is the point of an independent tribunal, an independent body which will sit in fair judgment on the ratepayer's and the Valuation Office's point of view. It would be ludicrous for us to set down that only the upper limit could apply. It is something that rarely happens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill changes the valuation of ports. The ports association accepts that some rates will have to be paid but, nevertheless, it is of the view that the method of valuation will damage the competitiveness of Irish ports, which face considerable competition from Northern Ireland. The Bill will impose rates that are on average over four times those applicable in Northern Ireland and most ports will have no option but to increase charges, thus damaging their competitiveness compared to Northern Ireland. I was a member of the board of Dublin Port at one time and I understand its anxieties.</P>
      <P>The proposed method of valuation will substantially increase the cost base of ports and a 6% increase is estimated for Dublin Port and a 10% to 12% increase for the port of Cork. In all instances, the increase is likely to be passed on to the consumer, thus increasing port charges. If port charges are increased, then our ports <i>vis-à-vis</i> those in Northern Ireland will become less competitive.</P>
      <P>The ports association is asking the Minister of State to change the method of valuation of ports and most Members will have received correspondence from the association. I have tabled this amendment which is suitably worded to achieve that end and I ask the Minister of State to consider the Irish Ports Association's request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister of State has received the Irish Ports Association submission, so I will not take him through it as he has all that information. I am torn, to a certain extent, as to how best this can be solved. I do not like accountants generally &ndash; perhaps that should not go into the record and I am sure Senator Bonner and others will excuse me. It seems that, in general, businesses run by accountants very often go in the wrong direction and focus solely on money. However, I like accounting and the work accountants produce because they give us a true value of things. Therefore, in general, I am very much in favour of recognising the need for a true cost of Garda stations, post offices, social welfare offices or otherwise, even if they are State owned, and of ports as well. If we try to subsidise something to reduce costs, we do not get a true value of it. If we subsidise something in some way or other, we have to find a way to do it which still gives us those true costs.</P>
      <P>When it comes to the question of ports, I realise we are making a change which will work against the benefit of a trading economy. We are the only nation in Europe which does not have a land boundary now that the Channel Tunnel, or the chunnel, links Britain with the rest of the Continent. We, therefore, rely very much on our ports. Our ports already appear to be uncompetitive. I am sure they are not uncompetitive solely because of costs that are inherent in any valuation or rates they have to pay. Yesterday, I checked the cost of the handling of a laden box in Warrenpoint, which is £40, or £32 sterling, while it would cost £70 in Dublin. I am sure there are factors involved between Warrenpoint and Dublin other than just that. Warrenpoint is a port which has seen a viable opportunity to create business and compete actively and it is doing it very effectively.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State will find a solution to the quandary I have. I know they say it is not just a question of one or the other. The Minister of State has to be a juggler and keep both balls in the air and has to find a way of making sure we have true valuations, that rates are paid and that we allow fair competition and give those competing an opportunity to be on a level playing.</P>
      <P>Senator Joe Doyle has tabled an amendment which has provided an opportunity for a discussion. I would like to hear how the Minister intends to solve, or attempt to solve, this. It seems unrealistic to expect that an increase which will increase costs even in a short period of time is capable of being handled in a trading economy that wishes to be able to compete actively with a port only a few kilometres outside our Border and to which there is a fine road system. If we want to keep a healthy port system, attention needs to be given to this particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not go through any of the details which the Minister of State already has from the Irish <Col N="1273" /> ports people. However, something needs to be done. I would like to hear the Minister of State's views on Senator Doyle's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Joe Doyle and Senator Quinn have said. For years lorries and trucks from the South have gone to Larne, in particular, because of the decreased costs of going out from there. It must be very difficult for those living along the road to Larne, certainly in the upper half of the country. There are roads in County Louth that if one tried to cross, one would really need a four wheeled truck because there has been such heavy traffic on them. We see trucks coming back down again through Slane. An enormous amount of traffic from the Republic is already going through these ports and if the costs down here are increased &ndash; Senator Quinn gave a very good example of the difference in costs between Warrenpoint and one of the ports here &ndash; we will have even more of this traffic. That needs to be taken into account.</P>
      <P>I gather those in Belfast are most enthusiastic about this Bill because they believe they will be able to compete very successfully with Dublin in bringing in more of the goods which are coming into this jurisdiction. I hope the Minister of State will take into account the extra use of heavy duty vehicles on our roads when considering this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but that does not necessarily mean one does not invest, have debt to make a profit in the future and develop one's facility. That is what they have done in Waterford. My family has been involved in the port for four generations and still is, so I think I can speak with some authority and knowledge on what happens in ports.</P>
      <P>This Bill will not introduce any change regarding the valuation of ports. They are already liable for rates. All the new ports that changed from State to semi-State property have been subject to the payment of rates since 1999. The only change is in regard to the position of Dublin Port. Under the existing valuation legislation harbours are deemed to be rateable. Those include Greenore Port, which has been subject to the payment of rates for a long time and is privately operated, Rosslare Port operated by CIE, and Dublin Port which has been rateable for years. In addition, the harbours established as commercial bodies under the Harbours Act, 1996, are also deemed to be rateable. Those harbours have been valued and have been liable for rates since January 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consequently, this Bill is not introducing liability for the payment of rates in respect of harbours, it is only confirming the rateability and removing the anomaly whereby Dublin Port was <Col N="1274" /> liable for rates on only 21% of its rateable valuation. This Bill will ensure that all commercial ports are treated in a similar manner for rates purposes, which is only fair. The Government considered the issue of having some phasing arrangements for harbours but decided against it on the grounds of equity and the difficulty that might pose to other ratepayers.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Northern Ireland has a more favourable valuation in rates arrangements applying to harbours than exists here. This is also the case for many other firms due to the existence of industrial derating that exists in Northern Ireland. Domestic property is rateable in Northern Ireland, which is not the case here. The question at issue is how far do Senators wish me to go to replicate the Northern Ireland rating system. The more favourable elements of the Northern Ireland system or of the rating system elsewhere cannot be picked out in isolation. As regards providing a special valuation for harbours, as proposed in the amendment, a guiding principle in drawing up this Bill has been towards removing anomalies and having a uniform and equitable system applying across all properties liable for rates. With that aim in mind the Bill will remove the prescribed method of valuation that currently exists in the case of public utility undertakings assessed within a framework of a global valuation. In addition, the special arrangements for the valuation bill of Irish Rail are also being repealed. Consequently, I cannot countenance the introduction of a special valuation method for any sector, including harbours. If I did, other sectors would immediately press for special arrangements based on reliefs that were given to other companies or to counterpart sectors in Northern Ireland. Airports, including Aer Rianta, which to some degree are in competition with harbours, also are subject to rates.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific issue of rates in Northern Ireland and in the UK, one must consider the whole tax package. Corporation tax rates here are very favourable when compared with the UK and Northern Ireland. Having regard to the overall balance of a company's tax commitments to the State, one will not find a disadvantage between the operation of ports in Northern Ireland and the UK or ports here. One may find the position is reversed, that overall the position is more favourable here. I do not accept that the imposition of rates will make the ports here uncompetitive. That is a nonsensical argument. There is a cost factor involved. Senators Henry, Quinn and Doyle made a point about Larne. My answer to that point is simple, we must get out there and become competitive. We must compete and there is a range of factors as to why we may not be doing so. Some of those factors are not solvable overnight. Infrastructural problems are adding to costs, but we are dealing with them.</P>
    <P>I have seen major new ports created in the United States and other countries and the work being done there is incredible. There almost appears to be no one working in these new ports <Col N="1275" /> as they are mainly operated by technology. Houston is almost wiping out the port trade to New Orleans and the great Mississippi Basin, which was one of the biggest ports in the world. Houston is much further up river and vessels have to travel a much greater distance, but it is competitive as it has new modern mechanisms in place. If one is to compete, one must compete in the modern world. Senator Quinn knows that better than anyone, having regard to the competitive business in which he is engaged, and I congratulate him and his company on the success they make of it. The same applies to any of the businesses that operate here.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be unfair to the ports. I am under a fair amount of pressure in my constituency with regard to this matter, but fairness and equity must apply in regard to dealing with this issue. I want to ensure an equitable valuation base is created here for everybody. Ports are a legitimate commercial operation and should be subject to the payment of rates to local authorities.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 44, subsection (2), line 28, to delete &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current system of valuation was adjusted some years ago, based on 0.63% of rental value of each property. The impact of this change has resulted in major offices, banks, insurance companies and other major outlets getting a significant reduction in their rateable valuations. The <Col N="1276" /> impact of that on the finances of my local authority has been a negative one. The commercial rate of income has been reduced by almost £5 million per year. The revaluation of property should give some buoyancy to local authorities. The capping proposed in the Bill, based on the CPI, would be far more punitive than the 9% capping that is currently in place which we spoke about on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>This issue can be addressed by amendment of the section. This section sets out the powers to limit rateable incomes. If the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; was substituted for the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in subsection (2), the Minister for the Environment and Local Government would have discretion on whether this capping provision was applied. The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; as opposed to the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is used in the explanatory memorandum. I ask that we adhere in subsection (2) to the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I also wish to raise the issue of areas in local authorities that have been exempt from rates for the past ten years due to urban renewal. The first major tranche of urban remission in regard to properties in Dublin that will be liable for rates will be the Financial Services Centre phase one, which will become liable for rates in 2002. For the following number of years the balance of urban designated properties will become liable and the issue of how this will be capped is vital for Dublin Corporation. The Minister of State said on Second Stage that local authorities would not suffer from this measure and that such properties would be added to the rates base. Am I to understand from what he said that the designated areas will be eliminated from the capping process? I would appreciate if the Minister would clarify that.</P>

      <P>I understand the point Senator Joe Doyle has made. When I discussed the matter throughout the country at public fora, one of the major concerns of all ratepayers was that the Valuation Bill I was introducing should not be seen as a windfall opportunity for local authorities. That is one of the fundamental principles in this Bill, and I certainly will not renege on the commitment I made to include it. It is vital that one understands I am introducing modern valuation legislation to ensure the valuation base stands on firm, legitimate and legal ground. Because we will be able to concern ourselves with real money, rather than the fractions many Members are familiar with, we will move to real NAV. This implies that there will be a consequent drop of the pound in the pound on a valuation of any property. It would be uncompetitive and intolerable for any local authority to penalise the ratepayers because the system will suddenly increase their valuations owing to the existence of this new valuation base, and thus their commitments in terms of payments to the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point Senator Joe Doyle makes is legitimate in that there may be new properties which will add to the valuation base in any given area. That will be taken into account, particularly as <Col N="1277" /> the valuation base expands. We will be able to add properties to the rates base on the date that they come on stream. One will see the buoyancy will be reflected.</P>
    <P>I will ensure, within the first year, in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, that there will be no attempt, accidentally or otherwise, to penalise ratepayers. In a global sense, the rates should roughly be established on the basis of a sort of nominal CPI growth rate, maybe 1% or 2% more or less than that in any given year. I am committed to this. It was an issue in every part of the country I visited. The local authorities did not argue against it. They fully understood what I was trying to do and, in a sense, they were encouraging because they did not want to get involved in this false argument and see the Bill used for the wrong reasons.</P>
    <P>It was better to reveal my intentions from the beginning. Whatever the accompanying explanatory memorandum says, I can assure Senator Joe Doyle that it has been my intention from the beginning to do this, from the moment I first publicised my views. I have no intention of relenting and I do not think anybody is being penalised.</P>

      <P>The explanatory memorandum says that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, &ldquo;shall&rdquo; make an order regarding the exercising of the powers of a local authority. All I ask for in this amendment is that some discretion should be left regarding the capping. The Minister of State has just referred to there being a 2% or 3% allowance in either direction. The discretion should be afforded to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government with the substitution of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. That would surmount the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the Minister shall do it. The discretion will lie in the fixing of the figure. It will be something he will have to do. I will not introduce any doubt to the market or ratepayers at this stage. We would be behaving improperly and doing a gross disservice to ratepayers if we were to accept Senator Joe Doyle's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>This section relates to the correctness of the valuation list. Subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>The statement of the value of property as appearing on a valuation list shall be deemed to be a correct statement of that value until it has been altered in accordance with the provisions of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is fine. I understand what the valuation lists are. They describe the type of property. The old fashioned term, which I believe has been abandoned, used to be hereditament which describes whether a property is a shop, petrol pump or whatever. For every valuation list there is an accompanying map which is kept in the Valuation Office. One clearly has access to the description of one's property contained in the valuation list. Differences have been found between the description of a hereditament or property in the <Col N="1279" /> valuation list and what actually appears on an Ordnance Survey map because the Valuation Office usually uses the six inch Ordnance Survey maps as they were called in pre-metric days. It is important that property owners have access to the markings or delineations that appear on the relevant Ordnance Survey maps.</P>
    <P>Here I beg the indulgence of the Cathaoirleach. Some years ago I had the privilege of visiting the Valuation Office in Ely Place, Dublin &ndash; I believe the office has since moved &ndash; and was amazed by the excellent collection of maps held in the basement of the building. I am concerned, however, by the manner in which the maps were kept. These maps are wonderful archival material. Some of them date back to the 19th century, indeed, to the very beginning of records. I even discovered perfectly intact in the basement of the office the first valuation list map for the area I live in. I am concerned about the safety of these maps which are very much part of the national record. They could be kept in the National Archives, and maybe they are. However, in the absence of a public records office in this country the most appropriate place for them is the National Library.</P>
    <P>The Valuation Office did not appear to have proper facilities for keeping archives. Staff did their best to protect this valuable material but the maps were not kept in an environment with humidity levels suited to very old paper. This material amounts to a very important record. These maps are a wonderful source of information on how properties change for people carrying out social or local history studies. One sees when turning the leaves the manner in which they undergo very detailed revision every ten years.</P>
    <P>In a sense this does not come within the ambit of this Bill but the issue ought to be raised when valuations are being discussed. I appreciate that I should have made this point on Second Stage and am grateful to the Cathaoirleach for consistently protecting humble Senators like me in this regard.</P>

One of the important features of this new valuation of the country will be the use of more modern technology. This is one of the keys to completing it within the specified timeframe and will obviously have a dramatic impact.</P>
      <P>I agree with the important point the Senator made about the maps. I happy to inform him that all the old maps are now in the National Archives so their importance has been recognised and will be kept for posterity and future use.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 58, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) bed and breakfast establishment where more than 6 bedrooms are available for letting and where the owner/occupier is not present.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I make a clear distinction between the bed and breakfast establishments in my amendment and the more casual bed and breakfast businesses that exist in Ireland, especially in rural areas. On Report Stage in the other House the Minister accepted that apart-hotels would be considered for rateable valuation. I put it to the House that there is very little difference between apart-hotels and premises with six or more rooms for letting, in particular when the premises do not have an owner/occupier element. In essence, this is a commercial use for commercial purposes.</P>
      <P>In Dublin rates have been charged on these premises. However, in anticipation of this Bill being passed, rates on these premises are now in doubt and a number of High Court actions have been initiated. If the Bill is passed in its present form without any reference to the commercial establishments I mention in this amendment, there will be a rateable loss to Dublin Corporation of £400,000. It is unfair that apart-hotels are included for rates while these commercial premises outlined in this amendment are exempted. I call on the Minister to put these premises into Schedule 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Doyle. I have stayed in premises described in a guidebook as bed and breakfast accommodation only to find that they were exactly the sort of commercial establishments described by Senator Doyle. I have in mind one in Cork, in particular, which had 14 rooms and did not have an owner/occupier on the premises. It would be a great loss to the public purse to exempt these large commercial establishments and anything with six or more bedrooms is generating a very good income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator seems to forget that hotels and guesthouses registered with Bord Fáilte under the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1935 to 1998, are currently liable for rates. Only facilities registered with Bord Fáilte are allowed to call themselves a hotel or guesthouse. On Report Stage in the Dáil, I introduced amendments to put beyond doubt the question of the rateability of the apart-hotels to which Senator Doyle has referred. I understand that some apart-hotels are already paying rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In future any apart-hotel will be rateable where it constitutes a number or block of apartments adjoining or adjacent to a hotel where the letting of those apartments are controlled by the hotel <Col N="1281" /> and are available to customers in the same way as hotel bedrooms. Alternatively, it will also be rateable where it is a stand alone number or block of apartments, independent of a hotel, but letting apartments in the same fashion as hotel bedrooms would normally be let, used therefore for the trade of hotel keeping. Bed and breakfast and self-catering accommodation have not been liable to rates since the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978, took effect. They are, in effect, treated as domestic premises used to provide lodgings. I am aware of the cases brought before the courts with regard to that Act and I await their outcome.</P>
    <P>In preparing the Valuation Bill, the Government considered at some length the question of rating bed and breakfast and self-catering accommodation but decided not to rate such properties. While there might be some merit on equity grounds in proposing to rate bed and breakfasts and self-catering accommodation, it is also clear &ndash; and this is my fundamental problem &ndash; that there are currently significant practical difficulties in doing so. For the benefit of Senators I will elucidate some of them. There is no authoritative list of bed and breakfasts or self-catering accommodation, which is a serious problem, and there is no requirement on bed and breakfasts and self-catering accommodation to register with any official body, which I also see as a problem. I hope the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation will begin to look at those issues.</P>
    <P>A property can be converted from domestic to bed and breakfast use or self-catering and back again to domestic use without any reference to any official body or authority. In the case of bed and breakfasts or self-catering accommodation operated on a seasonal or intermittent basis, the valuation lists would have to be constantly updated to reflect their changing status.</P>
    <P>It was concluded that it was not feasible to value and rate bed and breakfasts and self-catering accommodation in the absence of a national licensing or registration system, which is my fundamental point. That should be in place. The Senator's point about applying rates to bed and breakfasts and self-catering accommodation above a certain size is grand as an ideal but in its practical application would be virtually impossible. The Senator referred to premises being resident or non-resident but people could move in one week and out the next week and working out how many rooms in a building were being used for bed and breakfast purposes or not would be interminable. We would chase our tails and burn up a lot of time in doing so when no authoritative list or, more importantly, registration system exists.</P>
    <P>We may all have a view on that &ndash; I certainly do, which I have expressed today &ndash; but I cannot use the Valuation Bill to solve that problem. I took this issue as far as I could and I have listened to both Houses carefully, reacting positively and moving as far as I could within the Valuation Bill on the issue of apart-hotels. I met with people <Col N="1282" /> from the industry and there are issues that must be resolved before I can go any further in the context of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not terribly anxious to support Senator Doyle until I heard the Minister of State's explanation. I said earlier I did not like accountants and I do not like bureaucracy either. Part of the problem seems, from what the Minister of State said, to be that there are not sufficient lists of bed and breakfasts. I would be opposed to having lists of bed and breakfasts. It is a wonderful entrepreneurial thing for people, particularly in the countryside, to take in guests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be a registration system for a whole range of reasons &ndash; health and safety and so on. A range of issues arises in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand that but I do not think that is the reason. It had not dawned on me that hotels are not on a level playing field with a number of competitors. This seems easy to identify according to what Senator Doyle said. A premises with six bedrooms where the owner is not resident seems to border on a hotel or an establishment close to a hotel. If those are competing with hotels it seems unfair that one pays rates and the other does not. I did not think rates would be charged to a domestic house, if someone lives there, but if someone is not living there but somewhere else and has a building with six bedrooms, then for the sake of a level playing field we should listen to Senator Doyle's point. It is a good one and the Minister of State should reconsider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Senator that I looked in great detail at Senator Doyle's specific point. I am not going to go into all the issues but I am not one to be bound by bureaucracy and the Senator knows that. I can make a common sense decision as well as anyone else. I assure Members it was not practical for a range of reasons to move in this direction in the specific context of the Valuation Bill. Clearly there are issues here which should be dealt with by other Departments which would then allow for a straightforward move towards resolving this, if it were the wish of a future Government. However, at present it is not within my remit or the capacity of this Bill to deal with those matters, in spite of my having a particular view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be possible in the future to bring in some form of classification to include the kinds of premises I have mentioned. Is the Minister of State sending out the wrong signal now by excluding them from the Schedule when Dublin Corporation is at present collecting rates from such premises? They are in commercial use and as there are no rates on domestic houses they are commercial businesses from which rates are collected. I find it difficult to see how the Minister <Col N="1283" /> of State makes a distinction about apart-hotels, which can be very similar to these large premises and which are commercial.</P>
      <P>I am not seeking that bed and breakfasts which probably involve a husband and wife renting three or four bedrooms should be included. As Senators have said, however, there may be far more than six bedrooms involved &ndash; perhaps 12 or 16. The Minister of State might explain the distinction between apart-hotels and the premises I am referring to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy for Senator Doyle's amendment. I identify with what he is saying and the Minister of State also has some sympathy for his point of view. However, there are huge practical difficulties involved and that is the problem confronted by the Minister of State. Many stately homes have a lot of bedrooms and in some cases renting those bedrooms is the only way the stately home can continue to survive. The owner moves into the gate lodge while the main house operates as a bed and breakfast. The same can happen with a large farm house. I see all sorts of practical difficulties and I do not know how this might operate in practice. That is <Col N="1284" /> not to say that Senator Doyle does not have a sensible argument or has not made that argument well; he has. There is a good deal of sympathy for him but I do not know how in the present circumstances this could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I can reassure Members with some important information that Senator Doyle alluded to. If the High Court finds in favour of the corporation in the case referred to by the Senator, the category of properties described by Senator Doyle will be rateable. There is no question about that. This Bill does not affect that decision. I must recognise that the High Court has already decided on two separate occasions that bed and breakfasts are domestic property and not rateable. The Senator can understand the legal minefield. I was not prepared to risk this Bill on that basis. I would have been foolhardy to do so.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not generally change the position. Senators have made arguments with which I have some sympathy. There are issues to be resolved but it is not within the remit of the Valuation Bill to resolve the wider issues. I accept that such issues have arisen and Senator Dardis has also made that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 62, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;17. &ndash; Any building or part of a building used exclusively as a shop or retail outlet to sell goods sold by a registered Charity so designated for the purposes of this Act by the Minister.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The origins of the amendment lie in an appeal from the Irish Charity Shops' Association to have retail outlets operated by the charities exempt. The matter was raised by Senators Doyle and Cox on Second Stage. I appeal strongly to the Minister of State to either accept the amendment or give me some assurance that the sentiment in the amendment can be accommodated or at least given serious consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1285" /> In the context of the debate we have just had regarding bed and breakfasts, it seems extremely odd that there would be an exemption in that area and not an exemption for the charity shops. One could put several of the categories in the Schedule into the same context, for instance, land developed for sport is a relevant property not rateable under Schedule 4. Therefore, there are several anomalies in this regard. It seems to me that properties which one might think could be included for rates purposes are not rateable and ones like this, which one would have thought would be excluded, are actually included.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the Government has done a great deal for the charities, particularly providing the measures in the recent budget whereby donations would be given favourable tax treatment, which is something for which I would have argued for a long time and which the charities would welcome. I also recognise that the Bill provides that organisations which use &ldquo;land, building or part exclusively for charitable purposes and otherwise than for private profit&rdquo; are not rateable, and that is as it should be. The amendment just seeks to extend that provision a little further.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate that there can be practical difficulties here as there were in the case of bed and breakfasts that, for instance, some of these outlets are selling new goods and in a certain sense are in competition with ordinary retail outlets but, given that the proceeds are being used for charitable purposes or would be dedicated to that purpose, I think they could be included. That is one of the reasons the amendment refers to &ldquo;a registered Charity so designated for the purposes of this Act by the Minister&rdquo;. In other words, I am leaving it open to the Minister to designate the particular charities which should be exempt. I would not want to reach the stage where, as in some parts of the United Kingdom, there would seem to be a series of these shops along the High Street and in towns. If that were to be the up-shot of acceptance of the amendment, that would not be desirable.</P>
    <P>I also accept the point that just because a property is valued does not necessarily mean it is rated, that there is a distinction between the valuation of the property and the levying of rates on the basis of that valuation. Of course there are still lands around the country which have a rateable valuation but which for many years rates have not been payable on them by virtue of the Supreme Court decision. I accept, therefore, that there are particular difficulties about this, but what I want from the Minister is an assurance that the genuine concerns which have been raised by the Charity Shops' Association can be taken into account and that something can be done on their behalf.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, when I read the Second Stage debate in the Dáil, I noted that there was absolutely no reference, as far as I could see, to this issue, although I could be open to correction about that. It was not until the Bill went before the Select Committee that it was referred to. <Col N="1286" /> Unfortunately, I could not find the Select Committee proceedings in the Library or on the Internet and therefore I was not able to check. I apologise to the Minister if I am harrowing ground which has already been well ploughed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the views expressed by Senator Dardis. I ran up against this situation yesterday where in a small town in Donegal the local Society of St. Vincent de Paul has acquired a property from Donegal County Council which had not been rated before. As soon as the council sold it to them, the officials obviously notified the Valuation Office to have it valued for rating. I thought there was a way out contained in the Bill, where it refers to charitable organisations using land, building or part exclusively for charitable purposes and otherwise than for private profit. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul does not carry out activities for private profit because most of the funds it generates are put back into the area and given to the poor and the needy.</P>
      <P>In this particular case, there were two parts to the property and they have both been rated separately. One part of the premises is a drop-in centre, which is also used as a day care centre, and any small fees charged for activities there are used up in the running of the place. Profit is not being generated but rates are still being charged. There is a private shop in the other half of the premises where second-hand clothing is donated to the St. Vincent de Paul and is either sold or distributed. Elderly people and poor families who cannot afford to buy school uniforms benefit. Other items are sold for as little as 50p or £1. The very small profit is reinvested and pays for other items on special occasions such as Christmas.</P>
      <P>It is very severe to hit this type of charitable organisation. Senator Dardis has told me that the Minister does not see a way out of this. There are cases where certain branches of the St. Vincent de Paul Society can acquire a substantial amount of funding, but this is used for community or charitable purposes.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment. Senator Dardis has pointed out that this is for registered charities only. We have to remember that there are some areas where these shops also sell new goods and they are sometimes in competition with local shops. I am thinking in particular of Rathmines where there are at least four charity shops. We know that it is very difficult nowadays to raise money for charity, and the charities are very grateful to the Government for the greater scope that has been given to them in various areas. The amendment is worthy of acceptance by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment. The major charity and NGO, Oxfam, runs shops in Dublin. It is one of the world's biggest non-governmental organisations which deals with humanitarian assistance in areas of distress and disaster. Amnesty International runs a shop in <Col N="1287" /> which products from various countries are sold. Any profit generated goes to assist prisoners of conscience around the world. This is a very worthy use of the money earned. The amount of money lost or foregone in any way by local authorities, through loss of rates, would be very small. This amendment was put down by a member of a Government party and I plead with the Minister to accept it. The amount of lost revenue is very small. This amendment would be very much appreciated by those who do charitable work. I rest my appeal to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice in support of Senator Dardis's amendment. If this goes to a vote, we could have a very interesting result. I presume the Minister, in his wisdom, will see fit to make some concession. If the charity uses a building for retail use, that is still for a charitable purpose. It would be worthwhile to specify the whole area of a shop and a retail outlet. Amnesty International, Oxfam and the St. Vincent de Paul Society are very active and have substantial retailing. The St. Vincent de Paul Society has 25 shops. All the new goods sold in the charity shops are donations from the big stores and are therefore provided free. The money earned is used for dealing with those in deprived circumstances. Amnesty International will only deal with prisoners of conscience outside the jurisdiction. Money from its charity shops is used for the benefit of these prisoners.</P>
      <P>The irony is that there is a large number of organisations that I would be reluctant to see exempted and which are exempted in the Bill. It would send out the wrong message not to exempt charitable organisations and it would be wrong for us to allow that loophole to remain.</P>

      <P>Many speakers spoke on Second Stage in favour of the essence of this amendment. It is ironic that in the last amendment we excluded a commercial property from rateable valuation and here where there is a charitable element, it is not excluded. I also support this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate why Senator Dardis put down the amendment and all the Senators who contributed from all sides of the House are<i> ad idem </i>on this issue. There was a lengthy discussion on Committee Stage in the Dáil and during Second Stage in this House. I took the time to meet the charitable organisations at some length in my office in the Department of Finance. I am not without sympathy with regard to the issue but it is important to point out that all the administrative offices used by a charitable organisation, as well as buildings used directly for charitable relief, are exempt from rates. A range of issues arise. Senators must accept that it is not open to me to value a property on the basis of what its profits are used for. That is not in any way to diminish the very important and huge con<Col N="1288" /> tribution the charitable organisations make through their profits. It would be impossible, if not ludicrous, to value properties on the basis of how the profits are used. It would clearly open up a whole can of worms as to how people are using profits or income and that would raise another issue altogether.</P>
      <P>The criteria for rating under the valuation code is based on occupation and the use to which the property is put. Charity shops are engaged in a commercial activity for profit despite the final use of the profits. Charity shops are in direct competition with other shops, including second-hand shops, which are equally subject to rates. It is true, as Senator Costello said, that charity shops are given donations of new goods.</P>
      <P>The small shopkeeper is struggling today against the likes of Senator Quinn's organisation and others. Equally a case could be made for small family run businesses. Given that it is hard for them to survive, surely we are not saying they should subsidise charity shops because we are going to exclude them for rates. That is not the intent of what Senators have said. This is not a valuation issue but rather a rating issue and there is a fundamental difference. Senator Dardis referred to this issue.</P>
      <P>Senators may not be aware that in practice some local authorities give relief and do not charge rates on charity shops. In Dublin, Senator Doyle will be aware that at least a 50% abatement is given as a minimum to charity shops. The courts could change this if another ratepayer appealed it but whether they would win is another issue. It is a rating issue.</P>
      <P>Senators Henry, Dardis, Bonner and others mentioned the point. In the discussions I have had with the various representatives of charitable organisations, they recognise what has happened in the past few years with regard to Government taxation policy through the Finance Acts in terms of making fundamental changes which are enormously beneficial to the charitable organisations. In a sense they see that broad thrusting legislation as more beneficial to them in terms of carrying out their business.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the Department of the Environment and Local Government will have to bring in new rating legislation. That is the body of legislation where the issue of waivers etc., will be dealt with, not in the context of the Valuation Bill. I have said this to colleagues in the Dáil and I say it in the Seanad. My view is that the charitable organisations will talk to the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Minister concerned regarding the rating legislation. There may be an outcome to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Bonner, Dardis and others raised the issue of drop-in centres. It is possible that they could be treated in the same way as a community centre. It is clear from the Bill that community centres are exempt. My view is that premises used as drop-in centres should not be rated and and should be treated in the same way as a community centre. That point may be of benefit to <Col N="1289" /> some aspects of work carried on by various organisations and should be borne in mind. The reality is that by and large the local authorities throughout the country do not charge rates on these organisations. That issue will be fundamental to the new rating legislation which will be brought forward. This has been accepted in good faith by the charitable organisations with whom we had a fruitful and positive meeting. Given that the thrust of it has been accepted by Deputies, I hope it will be accepted by Senators also. I think there is good faith on all sides of the House on the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply, following which I am somewhat reassured. Will he comment on the point raised by Senator Bonner, in regard to Schedule 4, section 16 <i>(a) </i>which reads:</P>
      <P>Any land, building or part of a building which is occupied by a body, being either&ndash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>(a)</i> a charitable organisation that uses the land, building or part exclusively for charitable purposes and otherwise than for private profit,</P>
      <P>In other words, could it be construed that the shop was within the ambit of that Schedule? I think the Minister's attitude is that it could not be. However, I would like some explanation as to why that is the case and why they could not be considered within the ambit of the Schedule. I share the Minister's view that it is preferable that charities should be able to derive benefits by way of direct donation through the tax system. That is a better and more effective way of financing them but it should not be to the exclusion of the other activities. I take the point that there can be a potential difficulty with regard to commercial operators trying to sell the same type of goods in the same area.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the rating legislation. That may well be a way to deal with this issue. Can he indicate the expected timescale for that legislation and when will it come before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>To respond to the Deputy's question the words &ldquo;otherwise than for private profit&rdquo; are the key words in section 16<i>(a) </i> of Schedule 4. It is clear this legislation will impact greatly on the rating legislation. It is my intention and that of the Valuation Office that once this legislation is passed we will begin to implement it immediately. The Department of the Environment and Local Government is aware of this and will be anxious to have the new rating legislation in place as quickly as possible, so that there will be a parallel new beginning in the valuation base being completed in local authorities and that they do not operate solely under this legislation but under the rating legislation. That legislation is already being drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1290" /> To emphasise the point, the use of shops is for retailing. The shop will be rated separately and the balance of the building would be exempt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that in the vast majority of cases where charity shops are operating they are the tenants of a landlord, in other words that they do not own the properties in question. If that is the case I would not dispute the fact that the landlord should be liable for rates. If he is deriving a profit from the presence of the shop it should follow that there should be a rate attaching to it. I do not know if there are any figures available as to the degree to which charities occupy these premises as tenants or as owner-occupiers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Senator knows the Valuation Bill is based on the occupier. The owner has nothing to do with it. The person who occupies the property is responsible for the rates. Senator Costello raised a similar point on Second State relating to landlords. The whole basis of rates is that the occupier pays.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Schedule 4 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to clarify two aspects of Schedule 4. I shall deal with each one separately because I do not want to pose too many questions and confuse the issue. The first concerns section 4 land developed for sport. Many organisations have developed their own clubhouses &ndash; an example would be GAA clubs. The downstairs area of GAA clubhouses is developed into changing rooms while in the upstairs area there is a clubhouse licence where intoxicating liquor and soft drinks are sold. At the end of the day the idea is to have social activity in the club and also to generate a few pounds for the running of the club.</P>
      <P>My understanding, and I am open to correction, is that a club that has such a premises and has no social centre for dancing but has no licensed premises would be deemed to be exempt from rates. However, one that is licensed to sell drink could be liable. Some community centres may have licences also. I would like clarification on that.</P>
      <P>A golf club where the land has been developed for sport will also have a clubhouse. All golf clubs that I am aware of are paying rates on their clubhouses because, not only do they have an intoxicating liquor licence but they also charge green fees. Is there a cut-off point where a clubhouse without a licence is entitled to partial exemption?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most clubs are developing agricultural sheds for storing machinery on the course. They may also erect sheds for storing buggies which may be available for hire and that may generate some small profit. Community centres are not rateable and yet there is a distinction between licensed <Col N="1291" /> and non-licensed premises. This needs clarification.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Bonner has raised a very interesting question. However, this simply covers land developed for sport. There is now a huge emphasis on sport. Within the GAA, FAI, IRFU and golf, sport and business are interlinked. All the facilities where sport takes place on a large scale also host business activity. Some of the clubs have much larger dedicated sports centres and gymnasia which are entirely profit making. I would like to see clarification on that.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 18 of the Schedule refers to any turf bog or turf bank used exclusively for the purpose of cutting turf. Approximately one-seventh of the country is under bog. It may not be as extensive as it was, but there is turf cutting for private gain. Why did the Minister not insert the caveat &ldquo;for private profit&rdquo; in this case given that it is there for areas designated as charitable? It is almost as if farming land, horticulture, forestry, farm buildings, turf bogs and anything to do with the country is exempted. We can talk about a Supreme Court decision until the cows come home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Agricultural land and land developed for horticulture, forestry or sport are not rateable. There are other areas of land that ought to be described here in case anybody were to take legal action. There are large areas of land designated as natural heritage areas and areas of special conservation. What category do they come under? They cannot be included in any of these four descriptions that refer to land in Schedule 4. How is the land where the Burren is situated treated in valuation legislation? How is it described? In the old valuation lists everything was fairly well described. In my part of the world there are some of the last remaining raised bogs which contain an interesting record of what happened in Ireland since the early Stone Age. It is important to know how these lands are described.</P>

      <P>It is relevant to the specific references in the Schedule. It has always been the rule in the House that we could raise issues like this. I am not in any criticising your chairmanship of course. I am merely asking how these kinds of lands are to be categorised. Someone may take the matter to court one day and we could be found to have enacted bad law here. The Minister may refer me to paragraph 16(i), which states, &ldquo;where the principal activity of which is the conservation or the natural or built endowments of the State&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>These may not be the natural endowments of the State. These lands may be in private hands. I do not know if all the lands in the Burren are part of the endowments of the State. The raised bogs in Mayo, Roscommon Galway and Sligo are not. The Minister might have a better explanation that that.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that offices of Members of the Oireachtas are to be exempted. As someone with a constituency office in my own house, it is something I feel strongly about. It is interesting to see the schedule of buildings described here. The National Museum and the National Library are here but Leinster House is not scheduled here as property falling within paragraph 11.</P>

      <P>One can never anticipate in the late of the evening how interested Senators can become in a range of issues. I am not at all dismissing those issues, which are all important, and I welcome the interest in the Bill.</P>
      <P>On the questions raised in relation to sporting facilities, I dealt at length with this matter during Committee Stage in the Dáil and, indeed, I moved considerably to get the consensus which we eventually achieved. The issue was raised in relation to clubs, of which there is a great number all over the country. Many of them are very small, having only very basic facilities and depending almost entirely on voluntary effort. Members of the other House were of the same view as has been expressed in this House, that imposing rates on such organisations is somewhat unfair. I tried to find a balance between that and catering for the bigger clubs which are backed by commercial sponsorship and can generate an income.</P>
      <P>The cut-off line at which I made the distinction, which I think is fair and generally acceptable, is that if a club has a licence and operates a full bar facility within the premises, it pays rates. If they do not have an income of that nature, they do not pay rates. It is that simple. That basis was accepted and welcomed and I believe it will have certain benefits. It is a directly targeted measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1293" /> I emphasise again that, irrespective of size, no rates are payable on the actual playing surfaces owned by a club. For example, although Druid's Glen is a huge commercial development, no rates are payable on the actual golf course, only on the buildings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen some in that category, including possibly my own, since I no longer have the opportunity of playing very often.</P>
      <P>On the question of the Burren, it is valued as land and is included in the valuation lists but is not rated. There are various farming activities in the Burren. Commercial bogs are rateable on the basis of turbary rights, a phrase with which I was not previously familiar. However, turf bog or bank used in connection with domestic property is exempt.</P>
      <P>On the wider issues to which Senator Connor referred, the definitions which are contained in the legislation have not presented a difficulty in the past. Everybody understands the valuation base, its purpose and the kind of properties which are included. The definitions are broad enough to encompass all that we want to encompass. From my discussions with people in the Valuation Office, I believe they have a very clear position and that the provisions of the Bill will work well. There will always be arguments for including or excluding various things. Having tried to strike a balance between all the competing forces, we will, I hope, have a decent body of legislation that is seen as workable and fair.</P>

      <P>I apologise if my next point was already dealt with on Committee Stage in my absence. Over the past four or five years, I have come across a lot of problems in relation to small local community museums and heritage centres. I note that there is a reference to museums in the Bill, which I will quote to the county manager on occasion, where there is such a premises which should be exempted. Heritage centres are basically a community development initiative. A number of towns in County Donegal have been designated as heritage towns and each of them has built a heritage centre. Essentially, the heritage centre consists of a small facility to provide a cup of tea for visitors. People employed there are normally paid through the summer scheme and the few pounds realised on the coffee shop goes towards the upkeep of the place. They <Col N="1294" /> charge entry fees, as do other centres, including national parks. The idea was to help&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is a very important issue. Every time I wrote to the Valuation Office, I was referred back to the 1852 Act. If the issue is not addressed, will we have to rely on a county manager to determine, in the goodness of his heart, whether a centre should be treated as exempt by virtue of not making a door charge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is very clear in Schedule 4, paragraph 11. Any gallery, museum, library or national monument which is normally open to the general public and which is not established for the purpose of making a profit will be exempt. Where rateable premises involve only a very small income, the rates applied will be almost insignificant. The mere fact of being rated should not be taken as implying that there will be a massive rates bill. It will be very small in many cases and the valuation which is set must reflect the level of commercial activity. There is a great deal of realism involved.</P>

      <P>The Bill which we have just passed is one of the most complex and technical Bills to come before this House in a long time. I thank the offices of the House for their assistance with the Bill. I compliment the Minister of State on the wide consultation process which he has evidently carried out. I feel sure that he understands the anxieties expressed by Senators who are also members of local authorities that revaluation would have an effect on the incomes of local authorities and I thank him for bringing the Bill before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for the manner in which he has responded to this debate and I wish the legislation well. I also thank the Department officials. In considering valuation issues, much can be learned from the Griffith valuation in the 19th century, when the whole country was dealt with manually in a very short period. It was a remarkable achievement by the standards of the time, or even by today's standards. I wonder if modern digitised mapping technology will compare favourably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Bill will improve the position. I still feel that charity shops have a case and perhaps the Minister of State might use his good offices in the context of the next Finance Bill to convince <Col N="1295" /> his colleague, the Minister for Finance, of the merit of some of the arguments made in the course of this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I also thank the Minister for such a complex and far-reaching Bill. There were difficulties when small premises were rated with high valuations while neighbouring properties were left at the same rate for years. People felt injured by the amount of rates they paid compared to their neighbours. This Bill will address this by dealing with local situations. There were cases where I felt the Valuation Office believed it was Senator Quinn's supermarket it was valuing in west Donegal. I hope the Bill ensures that everybody is on the same level.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis is still unsure about charity shops as I am unsure about heritage centres. I hope the Minister's officials will clarify that. County managers do not consider the size but the valuation without considering that they make no profit and so their value should be reduced.</P>

      <P>I support the compliments paid to the Minister on this legislation. The revaluation is long overdue. I am concerned about how the phasing process might impinge on local authorities in the Dublin area. There, two contiguous areas might be phased in five years apart. The Minister stated that he will take each local authority as a unit, but five years could make a great difference if there is business activity in adjacent areas with more trading in one. It would affect how people compete against each other. In Dublin, he should be careful how the work is conducted. I am disappointed that bed and breakfasts and Government buildings are not included in the rateable valuation process. The legislation is worthwhile and we will see benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion on the Adjournment is to ensure that there is adequate funding, not for teaching staff &ndash; there were enough industrial disputes on that this year &ndash; but for administrative staff such as secretaries, caretakers, classroom assistants and supervision staff, which is becom<Col N="1296" /> ing more important. There is a discrepancy between the vocational, secondary and primary sectors. In the vocational sector, full-time, permanent and pensionable caretakers and secretaries are available to community schools and colleges. There is a deficit in resources for secondary schools, which was not a problem while nuns, priests and brothers were here in abundance, but is a problem now. A system is needed to ensure egalitarian resources across the board in education.</P>
      <P>Some schools employ staff under community employment schemes which accounts for approximately 5,500 people. These schemes are used to make up the deficit by employing people part-time at 20 hours a week. Now that the CE schemes are being abolished under the Partnership for Prosperity and Fairness &ndash; the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is negotiating to eliminate it &ndash; some will get full-time jobs but many will be left unemployed, leaving schools in difficulty.</P>
      <P>We do not want a response just from the CE sector; we want a package of proposals that deal with the need to resource education. All schools in all educational sectors must have the resources they need. The stand alone voluntary schools, which is how secondary schools are regarded, are deprived of needed resources. This must be addressed comprehensively, not left to the vagaries of a replacement model or adjustment to CE schemes that will not provide a comprehensive solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am here on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science. The Minister is aware of the demand for increased funding by voluntary secondary schools. The funding arrangements for different school types at second level evolved in a manner reflecting different traditions and structures in the voluntary secondary, comprehensive, community and VEC sectors. This evolution generated funding anomalies and structures lacking uniformity and cohesion. At the core of funding arrangements at second level is capitation as its principal determinant. For voluntary secondary schools in the free education scheme, which are privately managed institutions, the Department of Education and Science meets the cost of teachers' salaries, excluding the first £400, and allowances. It makes an annual <i>per capita</i> grant for a school's recurrent costs.</P>
      <P>These schools may also be eligible for assistance under a range of other grants under the scheme, including those for the employment of secretaries, caretakers and curricular support. Voluntary secondary schools with 200 or more pupils in the free education scheme receive financial assistance for caretaking and secretarial services under the PESP scheme. There are also a number of secondary schools in the 1978 scheme for the employment of school secretaries under which the Department of Education and Science meets the full cost of salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> The financial allocations for vocational schools and community colleges are made to the vocational education committees as part of a block grant, which also covers the VEC overheads and other activities apart from the second level programme. The Department does not earmark allocations for individual schools or for the various activities of vocational education committees. Secretarial, caretaking and other maintenance staffing support is also allocated to vocational education committees on a scheme basis. The deployment of such staff is a matter for vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>The annual budgets for community and comprehensive colleges take into account factors that vary from school to school. All schools in this sector have been provided with secretarial and maintenance support services. Budgets for vocational education committees and community and comprehensive schools are increased on a <i>pro rata</i> basis with increases in the <i>per capita</i> grant.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already made it clear he considers that the report of the steering group on the funding of second level schools represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements and is a valuable document in both its analysis and clarity of approach. The recommendations made in the steering group's report for the future funding arrangements of second level schools are under continuing review. At the core of the recommendations are the principles of equity of treatment, transparency of funding structures and adequacy of funding levels. Although his priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding, the Minister is conscious of the traditional anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level and is committed to bring greater equity and cohesion to this particular aspect of the funding of schools.</P>
    <P>In this connection, the Minister has already shown his commitment by the establishment of the school services support fund which is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. This funding initiative represents a new approach by the Department that supports the school development planning process. This process can only be enhanced if each school is given some flexibility in the deployment of its resources. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking services, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interest of their pupils and for the operation of their schools. A school with 500 pupils will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £4 million to voluntary secondary schools each year. In addition, since 1997, notwithstanding many competing demands on budgetary resources, the funding allocated to secondary schools has been increased substantially.</P>
    <P>The standard <i>per capita</i> grant was increased to £184 from £177 in 1999. It was further increased <Col N="1298" /> by £8 from September last to £192 and will be significantly increased by £10 for the next school year. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools, thereby bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000.</P>
    <P>Secondary schools have also benefited from increases in the grant scheme for school books for needy pupils in post-primary schools to £4.5 million for the year 2000. This represents an increase of almost 20% on the amount provided in 1996; as part of the national reading initiative, grants amounting to £2.6 million were channelled to second level schools in 1999. The level of grant amounted to £7.70 per pupil with a minimum payment of £1,540 per school; a library grant amounting to £2.4 million was paid to schools in 1998. All schools received £2,500, increased to £5,320 for disadvantaged schools; under the IT 2000 initiative, schools were paid grants of £4 per pupil with a minimum of £1,200 per school in 2000 and £2,000 per school plus £5 per pupil in 1999 towards the funding of computerised administration. In addition, since 1998 grants amounting to about £4.6 million have been paid to secondary schools towards ICT infrastructural development; under the science initiative, a <i>per capita</i> grant of £10 was introduced in 1999. In addition, grants of £10,500 per school at a total cost of approximately £7 million were paid in 2000 towards the cost of science equipment and an increase in the grant made for secretarial services under the PESP scheme from £25 per pupil to £30 per pupil, thereby increasing the maximum annual grant from £8,750 to £10,500 per eligible school.</P>
    <P>While funding arrangements at second level have evolved in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner and reflect the different traditions and structures of the voluntary secondary, community and comprehensive and VEC sectors, the Minister's approach to date has clearly shown his commitment and determination to improve funding at second level and he intends to build further on progress to date. I thank the Senator again for raising this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, and thank him for taking the time to deal with this issue. The issue I wish to raise relates to the staffing levels at St. Patrick's senior school in Skerries. I do not think anybody envies the Minister's task in ensuring adequate staffing levels at all our educational establishments. I readily acknowledge the necessity for a code of rules to try to provide a semblance of order to this thorny question which must cause great headaches at this time of year. I would, however, submit that the real test of any code of rules is the capacity of that code of rules to deal with anomalous, or extraordinary, situations that arise. It is <Col N="1299" /> from that angle I wish to approach the issue at hand.</P>
      <P>The town of Skerries is situated in the local authority area of Fingal which, by common consent, appears to be the fastest growing local authority area in Ireland, and possibly in western Europe. It is an area that is suffering significantly from lack of infrastructure. It was traditionally a commuter/market gardening area of relatively low population but it is now very much at the centre of the population explosion that is taking place within the 20 mile radius of the city of Dublin. There are other infrastructural problems in the area of which this is only one, but it is an issue which, with imagination, can be tackled successfully.</P>
      <P>St. Patrick's senior school is a very long established school; it was established in the first decade of the last century. It currently has 355 pupils and 13 teachers and thereby hangs the tale. As a consequence of the Department's code of rules, unfortunately the 355 pupils enrolled as of 1 September 2000 ensured a drop in the number of teachers from 13 to 12 for the forthcoming academic year commencing 1 September 2001, even though the role prior to 1 September 2001 was in excess of the quota required of 360. On 1 September next, it will also be in excess of the quota required of 360. What we are seeing is a statistical glitch that flies in the face of all the developmental trends in the area. Unless the Minister of State has some particularly good news for me this evening, it will mean the removal of a teacher from the school.</P>
      <P>This is a source of major concern not only to the teachers and management of the school, but also to the parents. St. Patrick's has enjoyed very active participation on the part of its parents' association in all its activities. In this day of withdrawal from voluntarism generally, any voluntary activity or any group involved in activity such as this must be encouraged in every possible way. If the situation which appears to be facing us comes to pass, not only will the teaching staff be considerably discommoded, a teacher will have to look for another job in another area against her wishes. A class of ten and 11 year olds will be broken up. From the personal experience of one of my own children some years ago, that can be a very traumatic experience for a child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unfortunate part of all of this is that next year, this precise process will be repeated and the teacher will be discommoded again, if possible, to bring her back to teach in St. Patrick's. The pupils, at a particularly delicate stage of their development, will be significantly discommoded and subject to upset as their classes will be restructured yet again. I am sure the Minister of State would accept the difficulty I have, as a public representative in the area, in explaining the necessity for this and the rigidity of the Department's code of rules, especially at a time of plenty when several Members of this and the other <Col N="1300" /> House regularly use the phrase &ldquo;awash with money&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>While acknowledging the necessity for rules, I urge flexibility in their application to deal with anomalies such as this. I urge that teachers, parents and the pupils are supported in the positive efforts they are making to maintain in the town a worthwhile educational establishment, which the school has been for a long time.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for his attention to this issue. It is timely, given the year we have had, also to thank teachers and parents active in parents' associations for their input to education. I wish them a good holiday. I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Senator has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House the current position of the Department of Education and Science regarding the staffing of St. Patrick's senior school. The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled on 30 September of the previous year. The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year, following discussions with the managerial authorities of primary schools and the INTO.</P>
      <P>I am happy to inform the Senator that the Minister for Education and Science has allocated a further 350 new posts to primary schools for the coming school year. These posts, together with those arising from the demographic dividend, will mean significant improvements in the staffing schedule and the overall pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools.</P>
      <P>The improvements in the next school year will include additional staffing following the introduction of the new administrative principal arrangements; a reduction in the appointment and retention figures for the second, third, fourth and fifth mainstream class teachers; and the allocation of further posts to tackle educational disadvantage within the terms of the new programme, Giving Children an Even Break.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to St. Patrick's senior national school is that the enrolment of the school on 30 September 1999 was 369 pupils which warrants a staffing for the current school year of a principal and 13 mainstream class teachers. The school also has the services of a learning support teacher and a shared resource teacher. The enrolment on 30 September 2000 declined to 355 pupils which will warrant a staffing of principal and 12 mainstream class teachers in the 2001-02 school year. An enrolment of 360 pupils on 30 September 2000 was required to retain the post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only criterion by which a school may possibly gain an additional teaching post, apart from the numbers as determined by reference to the enrolment on 30 September of the previous year, is developing school status. The developing school criteria for the 2001-02 school year are outlined in the circular letter 12/2001, a copy of <Col N="1301" /> which the board of management of the school has received. To satisfy the criteria as outlined in the circular letter, the enrolment of St. Patrick's school on 30 September 2001 would have to increase by at least 30 pupils over the number enrolled on 30 September 2000. Accordingly, the school would require an enrolment of at least 385 pupils on 30 September 2001.</P>
    <P>If the board of management of the school is confident that the overall enrolment of the school on 30 September 2001 will be in excess of 385 pupils, it should apply to the primary payments branch of the Department of Education and Science for the allocation of a teaching post under the developing school status.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Padded Cells in Prisons.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State noticed the recent report of the Irish Penal Reform Trust on an investigation of the use of padded cells in our prisons. These padded cells are strip cells and should be eliminated from prisons because if such facilities are not in place they cannot be used. It is not the staff in the prisons who want such facilities to be in place.</P>
      <P>The survey by the Irish Penal Reform Trust shows that more than 80% of those who were put in padded cells were put there for psychiatric reasons. As a doctor, I have not heard of a recommendation that patients should be put in padded cells, such as those that are in our prisons, for the improvement of their mental health.</P>
      <P>It has been said there are padded cells in hospitals but they are different and few in number compared to the dark, stark, frequently unpadded apartments into which these people have to be put. Frequently the walls are made of cement which means that such patients can injure themselves. There are still slopping out buckets in some of them, so there the dreadful situation can arise where a patient who is ill may smear the place with his or her faeces.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about the psychiatric services in the prisons and the lack of them. On the last occasion the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was here, he agreed there was a serious deficit in psychiatric treatment for people who would come within the prison system. While the opening of Clover Hill Prison has made a big difference in that remand prisoners go there fairly rapidly, we must have a system whereby these people either go straight to the Central Mental Hospital or, if they are not considered dangerous, to psychiatric institutions. Having these padded cells only serves as a holding situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper on Mental Health recommended in chapter seven that there should be mental health courts, but unfortunately that chapter was omitted from the composition of the Mental Health Bill, which will come before the Seanad next week, and it is difficult to understand why. Separating before the courts and in custody people who are mentally ill and dealing with them differently has been found to be very successful <Col N="1302" /> in other jurisdictions. We should try to progress like that rather than leaving the situation the way it is. If the Department of Health and Children will not deal with these people, as it obviously is not, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will have to make a better effort to try to ensure they get treatment rather than incarceration.</P>
    <P>Dr. Valerie Bresnihan, the chairperson of the Irish Penal Reform Trust, visited three prisons and was shown the records for a year of those who had been put in these cells. If one was in the best of health, one would find the incarceration there very difficult. The adverse effect it must have on people who are mentally ill is dreadful.</P>
    <P>Ireland has signed but not implemented the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 5 of which, I am sure the Minister of State is aware, states that no one should be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. It is difficult not to feel that such a manner of dealing with these people is not a cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of people. Because we have not ratified the treaty, it means we can delay in doing anything about it. We should ratify the treaty at once, but while we are doing that the very least we can do is shut these cells so that we cannot be used.</P>
    <P>The patients are in solitary confinement. Recently I was approached by a man who works abroad who told me the following sad story. One of his daughters who is here became mentally ill and was arrested for a breach of the peace and brought before a court in the Dublin area by the gardaí. He could not say enough in support of the gardaí or the court. There were problems in finding his daughter's identification, so she was brought to Mountjoy Women's Prison where for three days she was kept in solitary confinement in a padded cell, got no treatment and wore only an unshredable nightdress because some of these patients have to be kept naked in case they make an attempt on their life. This position is totally unsuitable. When the man heard of the plight of his daughter and came back to Ireland the girl was transferred with the co-operation of the prison staff, the gardaí and the courts to a mental institution and all charges were dropped. This is the type of thing that is happening and I do not think anyone wants it. Our prisons would be better without these facilities for the sake of the prisons' staff and the prisoners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to reply on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Under rule 78 of the 1947 Rules for the Government of Prisons, the governor may have a refractory or violent prisoner detained in a cladded-padded cell for his or her protection. Similarly, the prison doctor may authorise the detention of an offender in the cladded-padded cell for medical observation or for the offender's own protection if he or she has suicidal tendencies. Obviously, while undesirable, it is a matter of practical necessity to put some prisoners in a <Col N="1303" /> place of safety within the prison system when they prove difficult to manage among the general prison population.</P>
      <P>Padded cells are sometimes used in such instances as they provide a secure, safe place where prisoners can remain under special observation, with minimal opportunity to cause damage to themselves or to other prisoners. Prisoners may be confined to such cells as may be approved by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, but only on the authority of the governor or other officer in charge, and for as short a period as necessary. The guidelines in place for the use of padded cells require all such placements to be reported to prison service headquarters and the early involvement of the prison doctor where accommodation in one is deemed necessary. On many occasions, placement in a padded cell is at the prisoner's own request.</P>
      <P>Senators will be aware that the Irish Penal Reform Trust recently published a document, Out of Mind, Out of Sight, which called for the elimination of the use of padded cells within the prison system. I would like to make a few observations on that report. Apparently, the finding in the report that 78% of prisoners placed in padded cells are suffering from mental illness is based exclusively on the comments and observations in prison registers regarding the use of such cells. Most of these entries, which are brief and situation-related, are made by prison officers who would not have a professional qualification in assessing or diagnosing mental illness. The classification by the trust's report of such cases as exhibiting &ldquo;mental illness&rdquo; is unscientific. The decision whether a prisoner is in need of treatment for a psychiatric disorder is a matter for the medical personnel in our penal institutions. Such a decision can be taken only following medical assessment and diagnosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" /> I am informed that the Irish Penal Reform Trust report does not differentiate between strip cell usage and padded cell usage. Padded cells are used for the protection of the prisoner as opposed to disciplinary or good order purposes. The Irish Penal Reform Trust report does not make this clear and instead gives the impression that &ldquo;punishment&rdquo; is the rationale for such use.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform, however, accepts that there are indications that an increasing number of vulnerable and mentally disordered people are being committed to prison. In this regard, there is a risk that prison may be used as a refuge of last resort by the courts for some mentally disordered people who may be charged with offences of a public order nature that are by-products of their illness. It would obviously be beneficial if such minor offenders could be given medical treatment, either on an outpatient basis in the community or, <i>in extremis</i>, in a hospital, until their conditions stabilise. In this regard, there are reviews under way of both prisoners' medical care arrangements and on the future service role of the Central Mental Hospital. The Minister is awaiting the outcome of these reviews.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have held that if a prisoner is psychiatrically assessed and in need of psychiatric treatment, that treatment ought to be provided in a psychiatric hospital. That policy conforms generally to the policy in other European jurisdictions and to that advocated by the relevant organs of the Council of Europe. However, all the recommendations contained in the Irish Penal Reform Trust report will be carefully considered. The Director General of the Prisons Service, in this context, met a deputation from the trust last week to discuss at some length its report and recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 29 May 2001.</P>
