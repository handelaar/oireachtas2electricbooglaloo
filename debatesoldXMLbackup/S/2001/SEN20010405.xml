      <P>I have received notice from Senator Ó Fearghail that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to proceed with the purchase of a site for Scoil Dhiarmada, Castledermot, County Kildare.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Ó Fearghail as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, the Housing (Gaeltacht) (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash;  Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and of all other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes. I also propose to take Second Stage of the Teaching Council Bill, 2000, which is currently before the Dáil. It is expected to conclude 30 minutes after the end of the Order of Business in the Dáil. With the agreement of the Whips, I propose that the contributions of spokespersons shall not exceed 20 minutes and those of all other Senators shall not exceed 15 minutes. Copies of the Teaching Council Bill, 2000, will be available in the Bills Office when it is concluded in the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>What is happening with the Teaching Council Bill on today's Order of Business is not the fault of the Leader, but it is not a very satisfactory way of doing business. We are literally waiting for the Dáil to complete a Bill which has been before the Lower House for a long time and which has been in gestation for decades. We do not know if there will be amendments to the legislation, nor at what time the Order of Business will conclude in the Dáil. If there are changes, we will have to await the printing of the Bill as amended by the Dáil. While I <Col N="206" /> realise that Senators on both sides of the House have put much work into their proposed contributions for the debate on the legislation, Fine Gael would have no problem if Second Stage was deferred until next week.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Whips could discuss that matter later. It is certainly not a good way to do business, although I intend no criticism whatsoever of the Leader in this matter.</P>
      <P>Many long serving Members of this House will remember the long campaign waged by the former Senator, Pól Ó Foighil, on the official status of the Irish language. It is a substantial and important matter. He argued then that since Irish was the first official language, he was entitled to have all documentation, including Bills, provided in Irish. He fought that campaign with much support from all sides of the House but he got nowhere. Yesterday, however, the former Senator was vindicated by one of the most important Supreme Court judgments of recent times. The court was extremely critical of the State's failure to provide Irish language versions of laws and other important legal material. The Supreme Court described the behaviour of the Government in this matter as an offence to the letter and spirit of the Constitution &ndash; something that former Senator Ó Foighil and others were saying over a long period. The judgment has important practical consequences because it means that since most laws passed here in recent years do not exist in an Irish version, virtually every single law is now open to challenge in the courts because it is not constitutionally sound.</P>
      <P>That is the implication of yesterday's Supreme Court judgment which, in many ways, is a recipe for chaos in the courts and the legal system generally. It calls for the most urgent and immediate clarification and response from the Government. I would like the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come into this House today and explain to us what the Government proposes to do in this matter and if it shares the view of the Supreme Court that a constitutional bomb has been dropped on these Houses by the Supreme Court yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the point made. It is grossly unfair on the staff of the House to try to cope with today's situation where the Leader, who I accept had no choice in the matter, has had to order business which is not even on the Order Paper and which is currently in the other House. The Teaching Council Bill, which is a significant Bill, has been 20 years in gestation with three interdepartmental committees dealing with it over that period. There is no urgency in terms of it having to be passed today and it is grossly unfair to ask people on either side of the House to make a focused contribution on legislation which they have in their hands. That is wrong and <Col N="207" /> it is not fair either to the legislation or to the way the House should do its business. The idea of bringing the Teaching Council Bill, which is important legislation, into the House and trying to get it passed some time this afternoon is just not on. I appeal to the Leader to order this business for next week when we can deal with the Bill efficiently. For political reasons I am sure the Minister would like to have the Bill through the House before the teacher conferences but that is something that can be dealt with next week. It is not fair in terms of the legislation to deal with it this week. I do not like the idea of ordering business which is not on the Order Paper. I realise it has to be done in exceptional circumstances and it is not in breach of Standing Orders but it is not good practice or something that should be encouraged.</P>
      <P>For the past two days I have raised with the Leader the stand-off between the American and the Chinese governments. That stand-off is getting worse each day. The new kid on the block and the lion of Asia are facing up to each other and the situation is getting more and more difficult. This looks like a scene from Dr. Strangelove where people are playing mind games with each other and it is causing instability around the world, economically and in other ways. For the third time I ask that the Minister for Foreign Affairs would do us the honour of coming into the House to explain the position of the Irish Government, as a member of the Security Council, on this issue. This is a question of international security. It is important and we should not tolerate this kind of gamesmanship between two of the great super powers.</P>

      <P>Glacaim le Riar na hOibre mar atá sé leagtha amach ag Ceannaire an Tí. Senator Manning said precisely what I wished to say on the question of the obligation of the State to provide all legislation and other important legal documents in the first language. It was an inevitable decision. The Constitution is unequivocal on the issue of what is our first language and it is something that the State should now deal with because Senator Manning is right in that it will precipitate an enormous number of legal problems if it is not sorted out quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not waste time repeating what has been said about the unsatisfactory nature of the introduction of the Teaching Council Bill here. I know this is a subsidiary House but we seem to be able <Col N="208" /> to do our business better. There are 11 Seanad Bills currently before the Dáil, one of which dates back to 1998. We are not in a position, quite correctly, to bully the Dáil into dealing with those but I wish the reverse was also the case and that we were allowed to order our own business in our time because we deal with legislation expeditiously in this House. We do not cause unnecessary delays. We do not hold up the process of legislation and, as Senator O'Toole said, this is an important Bill. Finally, does the Leader yet know when the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Bill will be taken?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the call for the rescheduling of the debate on the Teaching Council Bill for all the reasons that have been very well articulated already and which I do not propose to repeat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reiterate the call I made yesterday for a debate on the economy. The ESRI report published today issues some fairly cautious warnings which might well be debated in this House.</P>
      <P>On item No. 29 in the name of Senator O'Toole, Senator Norris and myself, will the Leader provide time for a debate on the rights of small shareholders? This motion is not meant to be contentious. In fact, it congratulates the Tánaiste and the Government for taking measures which resulted last week in the Smurfit organisation revealing some outrageous salaries and it would also give us an opportunity to examine transparency in those areas and to put a stop to directors of public companies, particularly Smurfit's and Eircom, enriching themselves at the expense of small shareholders when the share price is going down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader provide time for a comprehensive debate after Easter to review the foot and mouth disease crisis to allow us have a full discussion on what is happening in regard to the controls and restrictions that have been put in place? Will the Leader convey the appreciation of this House to the Minister for the reliefs allowed yesterday in regard to both AI and in the movement of animals, although I suppose most people would be interested in the racing at both Cork and Leopardstown? Will the Leader provide time for a comprehensive debate after 19 April because there is a danger that complacency is setting in. We are moving forward and, hopefully, we will continue to move in that direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself a little fractious this morning and in disagreement with Senator Manning. I cannot regard this as one of the most important decisions to come from the Supreme Court. There have been decisions on matters of life, death and social survival. I love the Irish language. Occasionally I make attempts to speak it. I am not at all antagonistic to it but it is time we <Col N="209" /> brought the Constitution into line with the perceived reality. Let us have a change in the Constitution and recognise what is the fact on the ground. If we divert huge amounts of money in this area, nobody will read them and the young people will be completely disillusioned.</P>

      <P>Senator Norris, if you would bear with me for a moment. Senator Manning asked that the Minister would come into the House and clarify the situation in relation to the implications of this judgment for the State. The points you are making would be more relevant to that debate when it takes place than they are to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much, a Chathaoirligh. I am very glad for your paternal advice which now allows me to agree with Senator Manning once again. I support the call for the Minister to come into the House and then I shall place a contrary point of view on the record.</P>
      <P>I want to now disagree with Senator O'Toole. The Chinese situation is being resolved as we speak. It was on the news as I came in. There is no need for the Minister to come in here to explain everything because the Chinese now know everything that is on that plane.</P>

      <P>Senator Norris, please bear with me for a moment. I issued a memo last week to all Senators. I would hope that the Senator read it. If he did, he certainly has not taken the points that I made in the memo to heart. I ask him to read it again&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider introducing mandatory sentencing for the crime of rape? I notice in the March list of the Central Criminal Court that of the 38 cases, 26 were for rape. In the October list, there were 42 out of 53 cases, and in the June list 29 out of 33 cases. These are alarming figures and something drastic will have to be done. Sentences are a matter of pot-luck depending on the judge. One offender <Col N="210" /> might receive a slap on the wrist, whereas another might be sentenced to five or ten years in prison. I do not know how this is to be dealt with, but I feel there is a great need for a surgeon in such cases, especially for repeat offenders. It is a drastic solution, but castration seems to be the only way of dealing with this crisis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but this particular crime is getting out of hand and something will have to be done about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not feeling as fractious as Senator Norris, but I join Senator Manning in congratulating former Senator Pól Ó Foighil on his historic win in the Supreme Court yesterday. The Constitution very explicitly lays down the precedence that is accorded to the Irish language when it comes to translations of legal material. Likewise, I support Senator Manning in calling upon the Minister to come before the House.</P>
      <P>We all read the upsetting news this morning that 230,000 State servants have difficulty in cashing their pay-cheques. The banks made a unilateral decision that they would no longer cash cheques. We voiced our concern in the House and agreed on both sides that pensioners and those who never had a bank account are victims of this decision. Something must be done and I ask the Leader of the House to use his good offices to arrange an urgent meeting between the Department of Finance and the banks to resolve the problem. For the good of the elderly and so many others, this must not be allowed to continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning has raised a very important point on the Irish language. It is not just a matter of its status, but it impinges upon the rights of people. It would be bordering on racism to suggest that some people should be deprived of those rights. Not only should we invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House, but it would also be helpful to invite the Minister responsible for the Irish language, particularly in the context of the new language Bill which is now being prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the elderly. We have always had great respect for the old and appreciated the great contribution they have made to society and the development of the State. I was particularly shocked yesterday and today to see an advertisement depicting two elderly ladies in a most questionable manner crossing a road, one of whom was very incapacitated. One could not justify this under any circumstances. There is an outcry in Britain over it and I would like to think it would never happen here. <Col N="211" /> That is why I am calling on a debate for the elderly and their position in society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>This may seem like a parochial matter, but during the debate yesterday on the Waste Management (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2001, several Senators &ndash; Senators Quill, Ryan and I &ndash; talked about the need for waste minimisation within the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Supreme Court judgment will have an even greater effect on the amount of paper produced in these Houses. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government did seem anxious that waste minimisation should be practised in the Oireachtas. I ask the Leader to allow a one-hour debate in which Senators could produce their suggestions and receive a response from the Minister so that we could set an example in this field.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>For some time now, I have called for a debate in this House on the banking services available to the public. Today we see that workers and State employees are not in a position to cash cheques in the banks. Banks are making enormous profits, hundreds of millions of pounds per year, and the situation that has developed is inappropriate. They are treating the Government and the public with contempt in this matter. We have a responsibility to look to the post offices and the credit unions so the State employees and those without bank accounts are given an opportunity to continue their business. In the past, banks desired that people use cheques rather than cash, but now that this has been achieved, they want to create a situation in which people open accounts so as to cream off more money. It is time that we had some response from the Government. I ask that we have a full debate on the banking service as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Teaching Council Bill, 2000, I respect the stand of the Government. Should the Bill come to this House this afternoon, the Leader should ensure that adequate time is made available, not only at Second Stage but also at Committee Stage, because this work has been in preparation for many years and it is very important for the teaching profession. I ask the Leader to be conscious of this given the approach of Easter. It is important that the Bill is not rushed through.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Finneran in relation to the banking system. I too was very concerned when I heard on the news that the banks seem to be treating us all electronically and that the human element is vanishing. The banks needed us long before we needed them and it is high time that the Department of Finance discussed the policy on this issue. A full debate would be very appropriate in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the position of the Irish language and the Houses of the Oireachtas should be giving a lead in this regard. I make no apology for saying so.</P>
      <P>On at least two previous occasions, I have called for a debate on school bullying and I ask that the Leader request the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House to debate the subject. Bullying is causing mayhem and making life miserable for many young people in our schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Callanan's request for a discussion with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development on changes being made by the Government in their approach to the foot and mouth problem. First it should address the dispensing of information to the public to keep them aware of what is taking place and how the Government is making changes to adjust to the situation on a daily basis. There is a need for a continuous flow of information to the public and farmers are finding it difficult to know what is taking place. It is important that they are continually updated.</P>
      <P>I support the requests for discussions on the banking service. Since the DIRT inquiries, the response and services the banks are offering to the public contain an element of contempt. The new regulatory authority that has responsibility for the services being given should be examined. This issue should be debated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOFearghaillFF" hpid="Mr. Ó Fearghail Mr. Ó Fearghail">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ó Fearghail</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House allow time, perhaps after Easter, for debate on the welfare of the Traveller community, particularly the positive work that is being done locally and nationally by the Traveller consultative committees? We should also discuss the large convoys of Traveller traders that are traversing the country and illegally occupying public and private lands. Perhaps the Leader will ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come before the House to indicate whether existing legislation is adequate or whether changes would be required to allow us to deal with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Finneran's call for a debate on the banking system. On the last occasion we debated this matter I referred to the new regulatory body that was being established and since then I received a letter from the banker's association which tried to enlighten me on its stance. However, the letter made no reference to the other matters I raised. One of those matters, about which I was particularly incensed, was the difficulty with cashing cheques. I have a cheque on my desk but due to my need to attend county council meetings on Mondays and be present in the Seanad on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, I have found it difficult to get to the bank. <Col N="213" /> Now, however, according to newspaper reports this morning, I will not be able to cash it.</P>
      <P>I wish to request a further debate on Northern Ireland, particularly in view of the fact that the marching season is already upon us. I was alarmed by the announcement this week that the British Government has issued a new type of rubber bullet to the British Army and police in Northern Ireland and to the police in Britain. I do not believe the British authorities have learned anything from the past because rubber bullets have caused mayhem when used to break up organised parades and gatherings. Rubber bullets are one of the first things which should be decommissioned and I request a debate on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Ryan, Ormonde and others referred to the arrangements for taking the Teaching Council Bill. I assure them that a full debate will take place on Wednesday next on Committee and Remaining Stages of the Bill. I know it is not the will of the House to do so and it seldom happens that we are obliged to deal with legislation in this way. However, the House will have to deal with an enormous amount of business next week and I do not want to have to arrange to sit on Good Friday. I thank the Leader of the Opposition and the leaders of the other groups for their co-operation in relation to matters pertaining to the smooth running of the House. I request their further co-operation in allowing Second Stage of the Teaching Council Bill to be taken at 1.30 p.m. As already stated and as suggested by Senator Ormonde, I will allow time for a full debate on the remaining Stages of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Ryan, Norris, Coghlan, Ó Murchú, Henry and Glynn expressed their views on yesterday's Supreme Court decision in favour of former Senator Pól Ó Foighil. When he was a Member of the House, Mr. Ó Foighil put his point across forcefully on many occasions. He always believed he was right and it is to his eternal credit that he persisted with his arguments. As Senator Manning stated, Mr. Ó Foighil was rewarded yesterday when the Supreme Court's judgment was handed down. I am pleased with the outcome and I congratulate Mr. Ó Foighil on the determination he showed in bringing this matter to a successful conclusion. I will ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister with responsibility for the Irish language to come before the House to indicate the implications the judgment will have for future legislation. I will arrange to have the debate at the earliest opportunity so that Members may discover the approach the Government intends to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will communicate Senator O'Toole's views on the events involving the USA and China to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Senator Ryan <Col N="214" /> inquired about the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Bill, which, I understand, will be introduced in the House immediately after the Easter recess.</P>
    <P>Senators Ross, Finneran, Ormonde, Chambers and Bonner requested a debate on the economy, the banking system and the proposed changes thereto and the plight of the 230,000 who cannot cash cheques. This matter must be addressed and I will make time available for a full debate on it in the second week after the Easter recess.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross referred to No. 13, motion No. 27, on the Order Paper which relates to the interests of small shareholders. The only way this can be debated before the Easter recess would be if the Independent group uses its Private Members' time next week to do so. Perhaps the Leader of that group might give consideration to the Senator's request to have the matter debated before Easter.</P>
    <P>Senators Callanan and Chambers requested that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development come before the House to provide an update on the foot and mouth outbreak. I stated on the Order of Business last week that it was my intention that the House should review the situation. Following the Order of Business I will be seeking the approval of the leaders and the Whips to hold such a review at the conclusion of business on Thursday of next week, with the Minister or Minister of State present to provide an update on foot and mouth disease before the Easter recess.</P>
    <P>Senator Bohan made an extremely forceful call for mandatory sentencing in rape cases. I support that call and I will pass on the Senator's strong views to the Minister after the Order of Business. I will make time available for a debate on this matter when we return from the Easter recess.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Murchú requested a debate on treatment of the elderly. In my opinion the elderly are cherished because they helped to make this country great. The elderly deserve our support and everything that is due to them. I will make time available for a debate on this matter. I will also make time available for a debate on school bullying, as requested by Senator Glynn.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Fearghail requested a debate on the Traveller community and, in particular, the large convoys of traders which traverse the country on a regular basis.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Ms Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá áthas orm inniu an díospóireacht a oscailt sa Seanad ar an mBille seo. Is í príomhaidhm an Bhille ná leasú agus leathnú a dhéanamh ar Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) chun iad a dhéanamh níos oiriúnaí don lá atá inniu ann. Tá sé seo thar a bheith tábhachtach don Ghaeltacht, go háirithe sa chomhthéacs nár reachtaíodh aon Acht ó 1979 go dáta. Cuirtear san áireamh sa Bhille úr chomh maith, cinntí a rinneadh le tamall anuas maidir le cúnamh atá ar fáil faoi na hAchtanna.</P>
      <P>Tá aitheantas faoi leith tugtha ag an Rialtas don Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht agus ceann de na príomhchúraimí atá ag an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán ná labhairt na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht a chosaint, a chaomhnú agus a chur chun cinn &ndash; is í an Ghaeilge an acmhainn is luachmhaire atá ag muintir na Gaeltachta agus is sa Ghaeltacht amháin a labhartar í mar ghnáth-theanga phobail. Is í cur chun cinn na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus ar fud na tír i gcoitinne, ceann de na príomh-aidhmeanna atá agam féin agus ag mo Roinn don mhílaois úr.</P>
      <P>Ceann de na bealaí is fearr atá ann leis an nGaeilge a choiméad beo sa Ghaeltacht ná, na scéimeanna Gaeilge bainteach leis an teaghlach atá á reáchtáil ag mo Roinn le tamall maith anois &ndash; scéimeanna cosúil le scéim na hfoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge, scéim labhairt na Gaeilge agus an scéim atá mar ábhar insan mBille seo, is í sin an scéim tithíochta sa Ghaeltacht. Tá tithíocht mar cheann de na riachtanais is bunúsaí atá ann, agus tá sé tábhachtach go dtabharfar gach cúnamh tithíochta do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, agus is féidir libh a bheith cinnte de go leanfar leis an gcúnamh sin.</P>
      <P>Faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) 1929-1979, íocann an Roinn deontais chun tithe úra a thógáil sa Ghaeltacht agus chun feabhsúcháin a dhéanamh ar thithe cónaithe atá ann cheana féin. Chun caílíocht a bhaint amach ní mór d'iarratasóirí gnáthchónaí a bheith orthu sa Ghaeltacht agus an Ghaeilge a bheith mar ghnáth-theanga labhartha acu féin agus ag a dteaghlaigh.</P>
      <P>Caitheadh £1.94 milliún faoin scéim i 2000 &ndash; meadú 25% ar 1999. Sa bhliain 2000 fuarthas 1,486 iarratas faoin scéim (méadú 10% ar líon na n-iarratas i 1999) agus críochnaíodh 121 teach úr maraon le 769 cás eile a bhain le hoibreacha feabhsúcháin le cabhair deontais ó mo Roinn.</P>
      <P>Is é an coinníoll is tábhachtaí faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) ná, go mbeadh an Ghaeilge á labhairt mar ghnáth-theanga theaghlaigh ag líon tí an iarratasóra sula gceadaítear deontas. Uaireanta bíonn deacrachtaí ag teaghlaigh an coinníoll áirithe sin a chomhlíonadh, mar shampla, má tá duine ón nGaeltacht pósta le duine taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht gan Ghaeilge. Déileáiltear go tuisceanach agus go solúbtha le hiarratasóirí den tsórt seo. Is minic a thugtar tréimhse áirithe (trí mhí nó sé mhí de ghnáth) do na teaghlaigh sin, chun deis a thabhairt dóibh an Ghaeilge a chur i réim mar ghnáththeanga labhartha. Bíonn an Roinn sásta an t-iarratas a athmheas ina dhiaidh sin agus cúinsí uilig an teaghlaigh a chur san áireamh sula ndéantar cinneadh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is chun teacht i gcabhair ar theaghlaigh mar seo, atá ag tógáil tigh úir sa Ghaeltacht, a <Col N="217" /> bunaíodh scéim spreagtha na Gaeilge i 1980. I gcás nach bhfuil iarratasóir cáilithe faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) ó thaobh riail na Gaeilge, is féidir iarratas a dhéanamh faoi scéim na Roinne Comhshaoil agus Rialtais Áitiúil. Má éirionn leo an Ghaeilge a chur i réim mar ghnáth-theanga theaghlaigh ina dhiaidh sin, bíonn deis acu iarratas a dhéanamh ar chúnamh faoi scéim spreagtha na Gaeilge. Is fiú £800 an deontas sin laistigh de dhá bhliain, agus leis an gnáthdeontas ón Roinn Comhshaoil agus Rialtais Áitiúil is féidir le hiarratasóir iomlán de £3,800 a fháil, i gcomparáid leis an gnáthdheontas Gaeltachta de £4,000.</P>
    <P>Tá méadú substaintiúil déanta ar na deontais fheabhsúcháin agus sláintíochta faoi na hAchtanna le héifeacht ó 24 Deireadh Fómhair 2000 agus méadaíodh an deontas i leith méadú speisialta do chuairteoirí, agus an deontas chun díon tuí a athnuachan, i 1999. Bhí sé thar am na deontais seo a mhéadú, agus deontais réalaíocha a chur ar fáil, agus tá mé thar a bheith sásta go bhfuil sé sin déanta anois.</P>
    <P>Bhí díospóireacht an-bhríomhar agus eolach ar an mBille seo ag gach céim nuair a bhí sé ag gluaiseacht tríd an Dáil agus tá áthas orm a rá gur cuireadh fáilte mhór roimhe ar gach taobh den Teach sin. Léiríonn sé seo gur Bille maith atá ann agus fosta go bhfuil an-suim ag Baill an Oireachtais i gcur chun cinn na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta. Ba mhaith liom anois léargas a thabhairt ar na príomhfhorálacha atá ann ina n-ord cróineolaíoch.</P>
    <P>Mar is ionduil sa reachtaíocht, &lsquo;sé Alt 1 an fhoráil míniúcháin. Tá mínithe le fáil anseo ar an Príomh-Acht, sin é, Acht na dTithe (Gaeltacht), 1929 agus mínithe ar na hiar-Achtanna idir é sin agus 1979. Tá tuilleadh ábhar tís (housekeeping matters) ar siúl in Alt 2 chun an léiriú ar an bPríomh-Acht a leasú trí shainmhínithe éagsúla.</P>
    <P>Fóralann Alt 3 gurb í an Ghaeltacht, [chun críocha na nAchtanna ná,] na limistéir oifigiúla Gaeltachta a shonraítear faoin Acht Airí agus Rúnaithe (Leasú), 1956. Mar thoradh ar an leasú seo, beidh sainmhíniú oifigiúil amháin i bhfeidhm don Ghaeltacht, rud atá ag teastáil do na Ranna Stáit agus na comhlachtai Stáit a bhíonn ag plé leis an nGaeltacht ar bhonn rialta.</P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh, bhí na hAchtanna i bhfeidhm, i bhfad sular leagadh síos na limistéir oifigiúla Gaeltachta i 1956. Nuair a déanadh é sin, leanadh, chun críocha Achtanna na dTithe, le haitheantas do na seanlimistéir a leagadh síos i 1929. Aon deontas úr a tugadh isteach áfach tar éis 1956, bhí sé teoranta do na limistéir oifigiúla agus ó thaobh na Gaeilge de, ba rud ciallmhar é sin. Beidh na deontais uilig faoi na hAchtanna teoranta do na limistéir oifigiúla anois &ndash; is beag cás a bhí i gceist lasmuigh de na limistéir sin ar aon chuma.</P>
    <P>Tá tábhacht faoi leith ag baint le hAlt 4 agus sé sin nach mbeidh gá d'iarratasóirí ar dheontais do thithe úra a bheith ina gconaí sa Ghaeltacht fad a bhíonn an teach á thogáil. Tugann an leasú <Col N="218" /> áirithe atá i gceist anseo deis do theaghlaigh le Gaeilge, iadsan atá ag iarraidh filleadh go dtí an Ghaeltacht, teach a thogáil dóibh féin sa Ghaeltacht, roimh theacht abhaile dóibh. Roimhe seo bhíodh ar iarratasóirí a bheith ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht ag am an iarratais, agus nuair a bhí an teach á thógáil. Leigheasann an leasú seo an fhadhb a chothaigh sé sin d'iarratasóirí áirithe. D'fhéadfaí a rá go bhfuil an leasú seo tráthúil anois os rud é go bhfuil go leor teaghlaigh le Gaeilge ag filleadh ar an nGaeltacht de thoradh an borradh eacnamaíochta atá againn faoi láthair. Ar ndóigh ní bheidh sé i gceist aon deontas a íoc go dtí go mbeidh gnáthchónaí ar pé iarratasóirí a bheidh i gceist sa teach úr sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Baineann Alt 4 fosta leis an deontas le haghaidh díon tuí a dheisiú nó a athsholáthar. Tá an deontas seo le fáil sa Ghaeltacht ó 1990 ach ní raibh aon soláthar chuige ins na hAchtanna go dtí seo. Measaim féin go bhfuil an teach ceann tuí mar íomhá thábhachtach de thraidisiún agus radharc tíre na hÉireann. Is nasc láidir é lenár stair agus cabhraíonn sé le tionscail na turasóireachta. Tá áthas orm a rá gur mhéadaigh an Roinn an deontas áirithe seo dhá uair ó 1990, i 1996 agus arís i 1999.</P>
    <P>Níl i gceist ag Alt 5 ach cead a thabhairt don Aire na mionathruithe a bhíonn ag teastáil ó am go ham ar leagan amach an fhoirm iarratais a chur i gcrích gan ionstraim reachtúla a dhéanamh. Leagann Alt 6 amach nach mbeidh deontas ceadaithe i leith na n-oibreacha céanna atá ag fáil cúnaimh as airgead poiblí nó as airgead ó institiúid an Chomhphobail Eorpach. Cé go raibh coinníoll cosúil leis seo ins na hAchtanna cheana ní raibh na Comhphobail Eorpacha luaite sa choinníoll áirithe sin. Níos tábhachtaí fós, is deontas i leith an tí féin a bhí luaite cheana in ionad deontas i leith oibreacha áirithe. Tugann an leasú seo deis don Aire deontas feabhsúcháin a íoc i leith tí má tá cás tuillteaneach ann, fiú go mbíonn deontas i leith oibreacha eile sa teach céanna i gceist chomh maith, mar shampla ón mbord sláinte nó ón gcomhairle contae. Cabhraíonn an leasú seo le daoine i ndrochthithe atá ag fáil cúnamh tithíochta sosialach ó na heagrais éagsula, sa mhéid go mbeidh siad ábalta tairbhe deontais faoi na hAchtanna Gaeltachta a fháil chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Athleagann Alt 6 amach fosta riail na seacht mbliana, sé sin an treimhse feithimh idir deontais feabhsúchain. Beidh eisceacht ann i gcás cúlchoire nó fearas dóite breosla sholadaigh a fheistiú, eisceacht atá ann cheana féin ó Acht 1979, chomh maith le heisceacht i leith oibreacha riachtanacha chun téarmaí Acht Seirbhisí Dóiteáin, 1981, a chomhlíonadh, atá á chur isteach anois don chéad uair. Tugann an eisceacht bhreise seo deis do theaglaigh Ghaeltachta atá ag coinneáil foghlaimeoirí Gaeilge deontas feabhsúcháin a fháil i leith oibreacha bainteach le sábháilteacht dóiteáin sa teach gan fanacht tréimhse seacht mbliana ó fuair siad deontas feabhsúchain cheana. Tugann Alt 6 fosta discréid <Col N="219" /> don Aire deontas a dhiúltú i gcás tithe a fuair deontas ó fhoinsí eile, mar shampla, ón Roinn Comhshaoil agus Rialtais Áitiúil nó faoi chlár cosúil le Leader, sa treimhse seacht mbliana roimhe sin.</P>
    <P>Baineann Alt 7 leis an gcumhacht chun rialacháin a dhéanamh faoi na hAchtanna i leith oibreacha déanta le cúnamh deontas ar bith faoi na hAchtanna. Roimhe seo bhí an chumhacht sin teoranta d'obair a bhain le tógáil, feabhsúcháin nó méadú.</P>
    <P>Mar thoradh ar Alt 8 agus le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais, beidh an tAire in ann rialacháin a dhéanamh chun deontais faoi na hAchtanna a mhéadu, i leith oibreacha ar oileáin Ghaeltachta amach ón gcósta. Faoi Acht na dTithe (Gaeltacht) (leasú), 1979, tugadh cead don Aire deontais faoi na hAchtanna a mhéadú 50% i gcás oileáin Gaeltachta. Tugann an leasú áirithe seo solúbthacht don Aire chun na deontais sin a mhéadú suas go 200%. Tá an méadú sin i bhfeidhm cheana féin i gcás deontais do thithe úra agus deontais feabhsúcháin.</P>
    <P>Tugann Alt 9 an chumhacht don Aire, le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais, deontais tógála nó feabhsúcháin úra a cheadú faoi na hAchtanna. Is deontais iad seo nach bhfuil clúdaithe cheana féin faoi na hAchtanna agus d'fhéadfadh a leithéid a bheith i gceist má tá gá leo sa Ghaeltacht amach anseo. I gcás Alt 10 féadfaidh an tAire deontais a ghnóthú ar ais má fuarthas iad trí chalaois, trí mhífhaisnéis no trí ró-íocaíocht. Ba chóir go mbeadh an chumhacht seo ag an Aire cheana ach ní mar sin atá, agus tá leigheas á chur ar an easnamh sin anois.</P>
    <P>Tugann Alt 11 an chumhacht don Aire chun na riaráistí i gcás iasachtaí tithíochta atá ag seasamh amach a ghnóthu ar ais, a díscríobh nó a laghdú de réir mar is cuí, le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais. Leagann Alt 12 amach go mbeidh na freagrachtaí uilig bainteach le iasachtaí faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) le n-aistriú ó Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí go dti mo Roinn. Chinn an Rialtas go ndéanfaí é seo nuair a bhí scéim nó Bille á ceadú acu. Is í an Roinn a bheidh freagrach as seo amach as na hiasachtaí atá ag seasamh amach.</P>
    <P>Deanann Alt 13 aisghairm ar na hAchtacháin a luaitear sa sceideal don Bhille, sé sin aisghairm forálacha a mbaineann le deontas seallaí saoire, iasachtaí faoi na hAchtanna, forálacha a bhain le limistéir Ghaeltachta faoi Acht 1929 agus forálacha a bhain le seandeontais nach bhfuil feidhm leo a thuilleadh. Is mian liom a chur in iúl go bhfuil an deontas do thógáil dara teach curtha ar ceal chomh maith, sin é, an deontas a bhí ar fáil do dhaoine sa Ghaeltacht a raibh tithe maithe acu sa Ghaeltacht cheana féin agus a bhí ag iarraidh an dara teach a thógáil. Níl an aisghairm seo luaite go sonrach sa sceideal, mar gheall ar an ionadaíocht iomlán déanta ag Alt 4 den Bhille seo ar alt 3(7) den PhríomhAcht a chuireann <Col N="220" /> deireadh leis an bhforáil a bhí ann don dara teach.</P>
    <P>Mar eolas, bhí an deontas do thógáil dara teach agus sealla saoire ar fionraí le blianta agus déanadh cinneadh iad a aisghairm go foirmeálta agus an t-airgead a bhí i gceist a dhíriú ar dhaoine a bhí ag tógáil tithe don chéad uair sa Ghaeltacht. Is fearr ar fad cúnamh tithíochta breise a chur ar fáil i bhfoirm deontais méadaithe, rud atá déanta agam sa Ghaeltacht le dhá bhliain anuas.</P>
    <P>Tá tábhacht na n-iasachtaí a bhí ar fáil faoi na hAchtanna titithe go mór le blianta agus ní bhíonn ach líon an-bheag iarrataisí i gceist. Tógadh an cinneadh na hiasachtaí a chur ar ceal mar nach slí éifeachtach iad a thuilleadh le teacht i gcabhair ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta, go háirithe ag cur san áireamh a laghad éilimh atá orthu, gur suim bheag airgid atá i gceist i gcomparáid le méid agus costas na hoibre riaracháin a bhaineann leo, na deacrachtaí móra atá ann le riaráistí agus cúinsí eile. Níl san alt deireanach, Alt 14, ach leagan amach gearrtheideal, comhlua agus forléiriú an Bhille.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom iarradh ar an Seanad tacaíocht a thabhairt don mBille seo, atá an-tábhachtach do muintir na Gaeltachta, go mórmhór mar go bhfuil sé i bhfad níos oiriúnaí ag an am seo do shaol na Gaeltachta. De bharr sin, molaim an Bille seo don Teach.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Coughlan, to the House and I wish her well in her portfolio. I welcome this worthy Bill which will be well received in Gaeltacht areas. There are a number of points I would like to raise, however, and I hope the Minister of State will address them when she sums up.</P>
      <P>The Gaeltacht areas are probably the country's most scenic places. Those of us who are members of local authorities have encountered the difficulties people in Gaeltacht areas experience in securing planning permission. Planners and county managers must adhere to county development plans, but people experience great difficulty in those areas in relation to sewerage services, scenic routes and protected views. I do not know what can be done in many of these areas to enable housing to be built. I am aware from my time in the local authority that the process of seeking planning permission is a nightmare for people in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were three thriving schools in the Tourmakeady Gaeltacht 20 years ago. They eventually amalgamated and there are currently six pupils and one teacher. This teacher has one pupil in each class and it is difficult to operate such a system. However, people who want to move back to the area where they were born have great difficulty securing planning permission. Every other <Col N="221" /> Gaeltacht has the same problem, but I am not sure if a relaxation of the planning laws in these areas is possible. As I have said on many occasions to the county manager, there may be protected views and so on, but nobody will be there to see them except day trippers in the future. If tourists come, there will be no facilities for them. There will be no post office, shops or pubs. Nothing will survive because there will be nobody there. The only people who will visit the area will be occasional day trippers from Europe or America. This is a problem for Gaeltacht areas and, in fairness to county managers, they appreciate the difficulty.</P>
    <P>I welcome the 25% increase in 1999 and the 10% increase in 2000. The Minister of State said that overall £1.94 million was provided in 1999, which was a substantial increase. Is the amount capped at £1.94 million or is it related to the number of applications? Is it open ended or what is the position? The Minister of State said a person who is not living in the area can receive a grant to build a house if he or she plans to move to the area. She also said that the grant for a person wishing to build a holiday home will be abolished. I agree with her that this should be abolished, but what is the position if a person who is living in a house in Dublin wishes to build a house in a Gaeltacht area before he or she moves there? Will he or she qualify for the grant? Will there be flexibility in the Department to allow people to build a second home in a Gaeltacht area before they sell their first home?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said an improvement grant of £3,800 is available. Some people live in poor conditions in houses in Gaeltacht areas. Local authorities can provide an essential repairs grant, but this can only be used to extend the life of the house until the person living in it passes on or moves. I am aware of cases where sons or daughters of people living in such houses were willing to contribute towards the cost of repairs, but the local authority would not accept it because it would have increased the amount spent on the house above the limit allowed under the Act. Can a person qualify for the essential repairs grant in addition to the improvement grant proposed in the Bill? If so, will it mean that houses survive long after the people currently living in them? This is an important point and perhaps the Minister of State could expand on it in her reply.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and any increased amounts the Department will give towards the provision of housing in Gaeltacht areas. The Minister of State recognises the difficulties involved in securing planning permission in these areas and any assistance that can be provided by the Government or local authorities would be greatly appreciated.</P>

We are <Col N="222" /> the proud bearers of the same surname and I am always pleased to see Coghlans advancing, even if we have some political differences.

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive overview of the Bill. The legislation is well motivated and I accept her comments in that regard. It is most important to do everything possible to keep the Irish language alive and the heart of this is in the Gaeltacht areas. They are the nurseries or seed beds and they must be nurtured, protected and enhanced. Everything possible should be done to advance them. As the Minister of State said, housing is the most basic need and nothing will succeed if people in Gaeltacht areas are not properly housed. For this reason, I welcome the Bill's provisions.</P>
      <P>If one wishes to avail of the grants, Irish must be one's everyday language. This is fundamental; there would be little point in having it otherwise. Many of us are well intentioned in this regard but we do not have everyday practice. However, if people in the Gaeltacht wish to be assisted, Irish must be their everyday language. By providing for their housing needs, the Bill will assist the further advancement of the language.</P>
      <P>I understand there is a degree of flexibility in the examination that will be required and conducted by the appropriate officials. This approach is most important. If I understood the Minister of State correctly, £800 in addition to the State grant of £3,000 will be available, giving a total grant of £3,800. She also mentioned a sum of £4,000 and perhaps she could clarify this in her reply. The Minister of State also said it would become applicable from 24 October next. As the Bill will be passed presently, perhaps that date could be brought forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew I had missed something.</P>
      <P>The Gaeltachts are some of our most scenic areas and we have a duty, whether we live there or not, to keep them as attractive as possible and to ensure that nothing is done to mar the beauty of the countryside. I am thinking particularly of Chorca Dhuibhne and Uíbh Ráthach in south Kerry. They are within sight of the sea, hugely scenic, very important to national tourism and we have a duty to ensure that, architecturally, the best possible is done there. There is no reason the dwellings there should not be as good, if not better. than anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 provides for a grant for renewal or repair of thatched roofs and states that applicants for new house grants need not reside in the Gaeltacht when the house is being built. I commend <Col N="223" /> the provision but there is something else that might be considered. Often when passing through these areas, through valleys, there is the odd lone house on a hillside and sadly, in places, peculiar colourings have crept in, which jar with the landscape. There are the greens, the greys or the turf-brown look of a hillside and then this garishly painted house. Perhaps the Minister of State might provide in this Bill for another grant for improving such houses by stone facing them. Such houses would blend much better with the backdrop of the landscape. I put that forward for serious consideration.</P>
    <P>I accept the thrust of the Bill in regard to providing for more relevance to today's needs in terms of the purposes of other grants. I also accept the deletion of the determination of the second house and holiday chalet grants. We have reached saturation point regarding such buildings and I would not like to see more of them in the Gaeltacht areas. Senator Bonner might take a different view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be out of turn with anyone in Kerry. I do everything to advance local economy throughout the county, but we have enough holiday homes in the Gaeltachts and I accept what the Minister of State has said and what is stated in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
      <P>Section 6 (4) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, in his or her discretion, refuse to make any grant under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts in respect of a dwelling-house in respect of which a grant out of public moneys or out of moneys provided by an institution of the European Communities has been made within 7 years preceding the date of application for such a grant.</P>
      <P>It excepts works related to installing a back boiler, solid fuel burning appliances and works required to comply with section 18(4) of the Fire Services Act, 1981. That is perfectly in order as that is further improvement to the house and it is something that would not have been done under the earlier grants. I agree with the Minister of State that there should not be a seven year rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is room for a little expansion under that provision because there are other essential works. Perhaps stone facing could come in under that provision, but there might be other works beyond that where the basic structure of the house would be improved. Given the age of some of the dwellings, if there were other works not covered by previous grants, I urge that because the Gaeltachts are so important, such things could be provided for by a suitable amendment to the section. <Col N="224" /> It would be preferable if the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands brought forward that amendment as it has more expertise on price available to it. I encourage the Minister of State to have a look at that between now and Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 8 states:</P>
    <P>(1) The Minister may, by regulations made with the consent of the Minster for Finance, provide for an increase by such amount not exceeding 200 per cent as he or she may from time to time determine, of any grants payable under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts in respect of dwelling-houses situated on islands, including such grants in respect of works that were begun before the passing of this Act but after 3 December 1988.</P>
    <P>I want to hear a little on that. I am sorry if I missed it already. That provision of up to 200% is very interesting and it is welcome.</P>
    <P>Section 9 allows the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make regulations to introduce new grant schemes in certain defined circumstances and I very much welcome that. Section 10 provides for the recovery of payments procured through fraud, misrepresentation and overpayment, but hopefully there would not be any of that. Those who reside in the Gaeltacht are among the most honest and upright citizens in the land and I would not expect any shenanigans like that. They would be unknown to us in Kerry and I am sure in the other areas also.</P>
    <P>I apologise for not being here to listen to the Minister of State's speech from the outset. I wish her well with the Bill and plead with her for a suitable amendment to encompass what I have put forward.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an Aire Stáit toisc go bhfuil sí ag tacú leis an dea-scéal inniu. Aontaíonn gach duine sa Teach gur dea-scéal atá sa Bhille seo agus bhí an scéal amhlaidh sa Dáil freisin.</P>
      <P>I was impressed with Senator Coghlan's comments on the Gaeltacht. As someone who lives in Kerry he has put his finger on the importance of the Gaeltacht which would encourage all of us who are endeavouring to improve the lot of the Gaeltacht people. Ba bhreá liom tréaslú leis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ar maidin bhí díospóireacht againn ar an nGaeilge i gcomhthéacs eile ar fad. Ba léir go raibh an-tacaíocht ag teacht ó gach aon taobh den teach don teanga &ndash; níl aon chomhlint mar gheall uirthi. Is dul chun cinn é sin a chruthaíonn go bhfuil dea-thoil ag fás suas sa tír don teanga. Ní mór dúinn tógáil ar an dea-thoil. Bhí an Ghaeilge ina cnámh spáirne le blianta agus ba dheacair daoine a aontú ar aon pholasaí. Ní hamhlaidh an scéal anois go háirithe i measc an aosa óig. Bíonn siad leithscéalach munar féidir leo í a labhairt toisc nár fhoghlaim siad níos fearr ar scoil é. Ach <Col N="225" /> tá bród le feiceáil ó thaobh na Gaeilge anois i measc an phobail i gcoitinne.</P>
    <P>Ceann de na cúiseanna ná ó chuamar isteach san Aontas Eorpach tá sé tugtha faoi deara againn go bhfuil teangacha náisiúnta ag tíortha eile agus nach mbaineann an díospóireacht seo leis an tír seo amháin.</P>
    <P>Is í an teanga an tslí is fearr chun féiniúlacht náisiúnta a thaispeáint agus éinne a thaisteal san Eoraip theastaigh uatha a thaispeáint gur Éireannaigh a bhí iontu. An tslí is fearr a bhí acu chun sin a dhéanamh ná an Ghaeilge a labhairt. Tá an Eoraip tar éis cabhrú linne trí aird a thabhairt ar an seod seo atá againn. Tá teanga againn ar chóir dúinn a bheith an-bhróidúil aisti.</P>
    <P>Cruthaíonn na deontais fhlaithiúla atá sa Bhille seo go bhfuil an Rialtas dáiríre faoin nGaeilge. Ceaptar go minic nach bhfuil á tabhairt ach tacaíocht bhéil ach cruthaíonn an Bille seo nach bhfuil sé sin amhlaidh.</P>
    <P>Táimid ag súil leis go mbeidh an mBille Teanga ar an mbonn céanna agus nuair a luaigh an tAire Stáit an Bille sin sa Seanad an lá deiridh ba léir go raibh i gceist Bille a chothódh an teanga, a chabhródh lei agus a chosnódh cearta lucht a labhartha.</P>
    <P>Tá gach cabhair tuillte ag an nGaeltacht. Ní carthanacht atá inti. B'iad muintir na Gaeltachta a sheas an fód ar son na Gaeilge. Seod ann féin is ea an Ghaeltacht. Chuaigh scoláirí, gnáthdhaoine agus ábhair mhúinteoirí go dtí an Ghaeltacht chun feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge agus murach an Ghaeltacht a bheith ann ní fhéadfadh siad é sin a dhéanamh. Ar an gcaoi chéanna, téann foghlaimeoirí Fraincise chun na Fraince chun snas a chur ar a gcuid Fraincise.</P>
    <P>Chuaigh mé féin ann freisin chun blas a fháil. Tá saibhreas ar leith sa Ghaeltacht. Teanga chlaisiceach í an Ghaeilge ar bhealach &ndash; feictear é sin sna modhanna cainte. Tá an oidhreacht laistigh den teanga agus ní meán cumarsáide amháin atá inti.</P>
    <P>Is léir ó shaothair na mórscríbhneoirí a tháinig ón nGaeltacht agus ó na hoileáin go raibh teanga faoi leith i gceist chun tuairimí agus fealsúnacht a chur in iúil. Ní gnáth-theanga cumarsáide í. Is í an Ghaeltacht tobar na teanga ar ndóigh &ndash; is ansin a chaomhnaítear an teanga.</P>
    <P>An meath a tháinig ar an nGaeltacht, níor bhain sé le cúrsaí staire nó le cúrsaí teanga ach le cúrsaí eacnamaíochta. Bhí ar dhaoine crochadh leo ar fud na tíre chun poist a fháil thar lear.</P>
    <P>Sa Bhille seo tá seans á thabhairt do na daoine sin teacht ar ais go dtí an Ghaeltacht agus deontas a fháil más teaghlach Gaeilge iad. Cabhróidh sé go mór freisin nach gá don teaghlach a bheith lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht nuair atá an t-iarratas á chur isteach. Tá an-chuid daoine ar mhaith leo gnáthshaol a chaitheamh trí Ghaeilge agus neartóidh sé seo an Ghaeltacht ar ndóigh.</P>
    <P>Abair go bhfuil teaghlach Gaelach i dtír thar lear atá ag labhairt na Gaeilge, an n-inseoidh an tAire Stáit dom an mbeidh clann mar sin i <Col N="226" /> dteideal deontas a fháil chun teach a thógáil sa Ghaeltacht? Tá an-chuid daoine ag caint faoi theacht abhaile agus chabhródh an deontas leo go mór.</P>
    <P>Thabharfadh sé an-dóchas dúinne dá dtiocfadh daoine ar ais chun na tíre a lean leis an nGaeilge fad a bhí siad thar lear agus go dtabharfadh siad an sprid atá acu leo.</P>
    <P>Tá Gaeltacht im' aigne &ndash; Gaeltacht bheag i gCúige Mumhan a bhí faoi bhrú. Tháinig an-chuid daoine gan Ghaeilge chun cónaí ann toisc áilleacht na háite agus timpeall fiche bliain ó shin chuir sé díomá orm gur chuir siad iachall ar an Eaglais, ar na scoileanna agus ar an údarás áítiúil seirbhís a chur ar fáil dóibh trí Bhéarla. Is cuimhin liom an chéad uair a ndeachaigh an gnáthphobal isteach sa séipéal agus go ndúirt an sagart leo go mbeidh seirbhísí eaglasta Béarla ann as sin amach. An raibh sé sin féaráilte don phobal a bhí ann ar feadh na mblianta go raibh orthu fulaingt dá bharr?</P>
    <P>Níl a fhios agam an freagra atá ar chás mar sin ach an freagra atá sa Bhille seo ná cabhair a chur ar fáil do na daoine atá ann agus do dhaoine atá báúil leis an teanga le go meallfaí isteach sa Ghaeltacht iad. Sin cumhacht táchachtach amháin atá sa Bhille seo.</P>
    <P>Ní haon mhaitheas a bheith ag súil go mbeidh muintir na Gaeltachta in ann leanúint ar aghaidh muna bhfuil an tacaíocht ann dóibh. Tá áthas orm go bhfuil gradam faoi leith á thabhairt do na hoileáin Ghaeltachta mar bhí deacrachtaí dá gcuid féin ag muintir na n-oileán nach raibh ag aon dream eile. Labhair mé go poiblí le déanaí faoi Pheig Sayers agus bhí Peig ar na daoine a d'fhan ar oileán chomh fada is a d'fhéad siad go dtí go m'éigean dóibh teacht isteach ar an mórthír.</P>
    <P>Fuair mé litir ó Inis Meáin seachtain ó shin a dúirt nach bhfuil aon mheánscoil ar an oileán sin agus go mbíonn ar na daltaí tar éis scolaíocht Ghaeilge a fháil ar an oileán dul isteach ar an mórthír mar a mbeidh an scolaíocht trí Bhéarla. Is cuma cén costas a bhainfeadh leis agus ní mór dúinn an tacaíocht seo a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta chun a léiriú go bhfuilimid dáiríre.</P>
    <P>Bhí Seanadóir amháin anseo ar maidin ag caitheamh anuas ar chaiteachas ar an nGaeilge. Féach an t-airgead atá á chaitheamh againn ar chodanna eile dár n-oidhreacht &ndash; an ailtireacht mar shampla &ndash; agus ní déarfadh éinne nár chóir na milliún punt a chaitheamh ar Charraig Chaisil nó áit ar bith eile. Ach níl aon oidhreacht níos doimhne nó níos saibhre ná an Ghaeilge mar tá an Ghaeilge beo.</P>
    <P>Oidhreacht bheo atá i gceist agus gach a bhaineann lenár gcine tá sé le fail sa Ghaeilge agus ní déarfadh éinne nach bhfuil sé sin fíor. Más rud go bhfuil orainn eisceacht a dhéanamh mar shampla an iarratas seo ó Inis Meáin agus má éiríonn leis an Aire Stáit a chur ina luí ar an Aire Oideachais nó ar aon Aire eile agus a fhógairt go luath go bhfuil sí in ann gníomh a dhéanamh ar son na mná seo ar chainteoirí Gaeilge an chlann uilig níl <Col N="227" /> aon amhras ach go mbeadh clú agus cáil tuilllte aici i stair na hÉireann amach anseo. Rud an-tábhachtach go deo é seo mar thaispeánfadh sé go bhfuil an Stát sásta an rud ceart a dhéanamh. Níl ag teastáil ach cabhair.</P>
    <P>Maidir le turasóireacht chultúrtha, is léir gur cheann de mhórthionscail na tire í faoin am seo. An talamhaíocht agus an turasóireacht na cinn is mó. An suirbhé is mó a rinneadh ar an turasóireacht le cúpla bliain anuas agus a chosnaigh leathmhilliún punt &ndash; it showed that visiting national monuments was the most popular pursuit of tourists coming into this country, which is fine. After that, however, traditional culture featured twice among the top six pursuits.</P>
    <P>It is the repository of culture and heritage in many ways. Cultural tourism can certainly be geared and focused. Bhí áthas orm nuair a bhí mé ag freastal ar Ghaeltacht Chiarraí i bhfad ó shin na Gearmáinigh agus na Fraincigh ag teacht isteach agus a dteangacha féin á labhairt acu. Ní hé nach bhfuil fáilte roimh na Sasanaigh freisin, tá ar ndóigh, ach más féidir linn a thaispeáint nach gcaithfidh gach siopa athrú go Béarla chun freastal ar thurasóirí, is amhlaidh is fearr é. Ní dhéanann said é sin sa Fhrainc nó in aon tír eile do Bhéarlóirí. Caithfimid a bheith cúramach go bhfuil polasaí i bhfeidhm againn chun cabhrú le turasóirí a thagann chun na Gaeltachta toisc gur áit ann féin í le hatmasféar dá cuid féin. Caithfimid freisin a thaispeáint gur féidir le muintir na Gaeltachta leanúint ar aghaidh le Gaeilge agus seirbhís a thabhairt ag an am céanna. Ní chóir cur isteach ar na turasóirí mar is cabhair an-mhór don Ghaeltacht iad.</P>
    <P>Bille an-dearfach é seo i leith na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta de agus is cruthú é go mbeidh rudaí eile ag tarlú amach anseo a léireoidh go bhfuil ré nua i bhfeidhm ó thaobh na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta de agus go mbeidh an Rialtas lánsásta tacaíocht a chur ar fail. Beidh a fhios ag an Aire agus an Roinn agus ag an Rialtas go mbeidh tacaíocht acu ó mhuintir na hÉireann le haon iarracht mar sin. Léiríonn gach suirbhé go bhfuil trí cheathrú de mhuintir na tire báúil leis an nGaeilge. Is iontach an dul chun cinn é sin agus ba chóir go gcabhródh sé sin leis an Aire agus leis an Rialtas a bheith misniúil ar son na Gaeilge. Tréaslaím leo mar tugann sé dóchas dúinn go léir Bille den saghas seo a fheiceáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáiltím chomh maith roimis an mBille seo agus roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach seo. An rud is tábhachtaí chun tacaíocht a thabhairt don teanga ná go mbeadh tuiscint againn ar conas mar atá sna Gaeltachtaí. An locht is mó atá agamsa ar pholasaithe teanga Rialtais i ndiaidh Rialtais ó bunaíodh an Stát ná go bhfuilid dírithe níos mó ar na Galltachtaí ná ar na Gaeltachtaí. Arís agus arís eile tagaimse ar chabhair atá le fail don Ghaoluinn agus a bhaineann leis an nGaoluinn sna Galltachtaí agus nach bhfuil ar fáil sna Gaeltachtaí. Dúirt mé leis an Aire Stáit <Col N="228" /> ar a céad chuairt anseo chomh tábhachtach is atá sé díriú ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus gach cabhair is féidir a thabhairt dóibh. Is tobar ár n-oidhreachta í an Ghaeltacht agus foinse na teanga.</P>
      <P>Tá bóithre, poirt agus aerophoirt thar a bheith tábhachtach agus rudaí mar IT ar ndóigh. Ach chun go mbeadh bunús ceart againn sna Gaeltachta an cineál triantán cúnaimh atá ag teastáil ná tithíocht, fostaíocht agus scolaíocht trí Ghaoluinn, nó cúnamh do na cúrsaí sin ar a laghad.</P>
      <P>Cúpla bliain ó shin scríobh Frank McDonald alt san <i>Irish Times</i> tar éis dó turas a thabhairt ar Chonamara, más cuimhin liom. Bungalow blitz sna Gaeltachtaí an ceannteideal a bhí aige agus bhí sé ag fáil locht ar an méid a chonaic sé, fiú amháin an dath a bhí ar na tithe. Agus cuireann an tig bán isteach orm féin, níor chóir go dtabharfaí cead dath bán a chur ar theach.</P>
      <P>Is cuimhin liomsa agus mé ag dul ar scoil sa Daingean daoine ag teacht isteach ó na Gaeltachtaí. Is beag a bhí ag na daoine sin an uair sin &ndash; ní raibh obair ná airgead acu &ndash; agus is i mbotháin a bhí cónaí ar a lán acu. Tá an tuiscint sin ag gach duine againn a chónaigh timpeall ar na Gaeltachtaí agus b'fhearr na bungaló a fheiceáil lá ar bith thar na botháin. Is ceart agus is cóir go ndéarfaí é sin agus go mbeimis sásta leis sin.</P>
      <P>Anois ní mór dúinn a bheith níos cúramaí faoin gcineál tithíochta atá á tógáil sa Ghaeltacht. Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé sa Ghaeltacht ach ba chóir go mbeadh tacaíocht ailtireachta ar fáil do dhuine ar bith a bhí ag smaoineamh ar theach nua a thógáil le go bhféadfaí teacht ar an dearadh ab oiriúnaí don timpeallacht. Bhí mé ar imeall an Bhurren ag an deireadh seachtaine agus is fuirist a fheiscint na tithe a tógadh le cúnamh ailtire agus iadsan nár tógadh. Ba mhaith an rud é an cúnamh sin a bheith ar fáil sna Gaeltachtaí.</P>
      <P>Tá sé tábhachtach freisin go mbeadh na rialacha pleanála curtha in oiriúint do ghnó na nGaeltachtaí, le go dtuigfeadh na húdaráis áitiúla na deacrachtaí agus na cúraimí ar leith atá i gceist. Agus má tá gá le córas ann féin do na Gaeltachtaí, is mar sin ar chóir dó a bheith.</P>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an alt maidir leis na hoileáin Ghaeltachta. Is cuimhin liom nuair a bhog muintir an Bhlascaoid go dtí an mórthír i 1953 &ndash; bhí cuid acu ar scoil liom &ndash; go raibh an-deacrachtaí acu. Chuir an-chuid daoine i gcoinne an ionaid oidhreachta ar an mBlascaod Mór cúpla bliain ó shin agus níorbh mhuintir na háite a bhformhór. Ní raibh tuiscint ag na daoine sin ar na Gaeltachtaí. Agus dúradh ag an am muna bhfuiltear chun díriú isteach ar chúrsaí turasóireachta agus ionaid oidhreachta agus mar sin de a thógáil, agus an t-infrastruchtúr a fhorbairt, nach fada eile a bheas daoine ina gcónaí amuigh ar an leithinis sin. Níl aon fhostaíocht ann dóibh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Muna bhfuil tithíocht den scoth ag muintir na Gaeltachta agus fáil acu ar oideachas den chéad, dara agus triú leibhéal sa Ghaeltacht &ndash; if we are not prepared to invest that type of money, the <Col N="229" /> whole thing is a scam. Sin an rud is tábhachtaí. Is breá go mbeadh tuiscint mar sin ag an Rialtas &ndash; caithfear an tacaíocht sin a thabhairt ionas gur féidir le daoine saol iomlán a chaitheamh trí Ghaoluinn, le tithíocht, oideachas agus fostaíocht.</P>
    <P>Is fuirist an dul chun cinn sin a dhéanamh i láthair na huaire mar go bhfuil an t-airgead againn chuige agus an teicneolaíocht chuige freisin. Is féidir teleworking agus cottage industries a bhunú ar an dteicneolaíocht nua.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh sé mar aidhm ag an Aire Stáit díospóireacht a thosú ar an gceist seo le taispeáint gur féidir a lán a dhéanamh anois go mór mór ó thaobh added value intleachtúil ó na hoileáin mar shampla. Dá mbeadh broadband IT ar fáil acu d'fhéadfaí obair ar bith a dhéanamh orthu agus a bheith i dteagmháil leis an domhan ar fad.</P>
    <P>An uair dheiridh a labhair mé anseo dúirt mé go raibh sé tábhachtach go mbeadh rogha ag aos óg na Gaeltachta maidir le pop, roc, teilifís shaitilíte. Chonaic mé seachtain ó shin go bhfuil bainistíocht Sky TV tar éis dul chun cainte le TG4 chun TG4 a chur ar fáil trí shaitilít. Is maith ann an dul chun cinn sin mar ní féidir linn aon ghearradh siar a dhéanamh ar na roghanna atá ar fáil d'aos óg na Gaeltachta. Má tá rud ar fáil i lár na cathrach caithfidh sé a bheith ar fáil i lár na Gaeltachta freisin.</P>
    <P>Ní gá aon sceoin a bheith orainn. Má tá rogha ag na daoine óga, ní chuirfidh SKY TV isteach nó amach orthu. Sin an taithí atá againn ó na háiteanna sin.</P>
    <P>Is cruthaíoch an moladh é go mbeidh deontais ar fáil as seo amach ní amháin ag muintir na Gaeltachta ach ag daoine atá ag iarraidh teacht isteach sna Gaeltachtaí. Thabharfadh sé sin instealladh daonra don Ghaeltacht &ndash; daoine nua a bhfuil bá acu leis an teanga. Ní chuirfeadh sé amach ormsa &ndash; and I would be a strong supporter of human rights in many forms &ndash; dá mbeadh sé mar bye-law do dhaoine a bhí ar tí teach a thógáil, go mbeadh Gaeilge ar a dtoil acu. Chaomhnódh sé sin ár n-oidhreacht.</P>
    <P>On another issue altogether dúirt mé cheana go bhfuilim sásta a bheith liobrálach faoin gcineál cáilíochtaí atá ag múinteoirí atá ag múineadh sa tír seo. Ach ar an dtaobh eile chaithfeadh múinteoir a bheadh ag múineadh sa Ghaeltacht Gaoluinn a bheith ar a toil nó ar a thoil aici nó aige. An rud céanna atá idir láimhe anseo againn. Má táimid chun an Ghaeltacht a chaomhnú &ndash; and I do not mean keeping people in a zoo situation &ndash;  is ceart agus is cóir go mbeadh rialacha agus reachtaíocht againn chun gach seans a thabhairt do na Gaeltachtaí forbairt ina slí féin.</P>
    <P>Is maith freisin go bhfuiltear ag tarraingt siar freisin ón dara teach agus ón chalet saoire. Ní raibh na Gaeltachtaí go ró-olc maidir le tithe samhraidh go dtí seo ach tá Acla agus áiteanna eile scriosta acu. Ní raibh aon todhchaí don Ghaeltacht sna tithe saoire.</P>
    <P>Ní gá falla a thógáil chun daoine a choimeád amach ach ní chóir dúinn tacú le daoine a thioc<Col N="230" /> fadh ar feadh cúpla seachtain in aghaidh na bliana.</P>
    <P>Nílim ró-thógtha leis an díon tuí ach nílim ag cur ina choinne ach oiread.</P>
    <P>Fáiltím roimis an mBille seo mar go dtugann sé tacaíocht don Ghaeltacht, go gcuirfidh sé feabhas ar infrastruchtúr na háite le tithíocht fheabhsaithe agus is maith go bhfuil sé dírithe ar na daoine seo. Tá píosa in Alt 10 agus Alt 11 maidir le haisíoc deontais. Nach féidir le hAire é sin a dhéanamh gan é a chur isteacht sa Bhille? Tuigim. Tá overpayments bunaithe ar errors in fact níos mó ná errors in law. Cheap mé go raibh sé á athrá anseo.</P>
    <P>Fáiltím roimis an mBille agus tá súil agam go dtabharfaidh sé instealladh nua don Ghaeltacht. Tá jab an-mhaith á dhéanamh ag an Aire Stáit agus comhairle mhaith á cur orthu.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach. Seo é an tríú Bille Tithíochta &ndash; bhí ceann ann i 1929 agus ceann eile i 1979. Ach tá athruithe millteanacha tagtha ar shaol na Gaeltachta ón am sin i leith. I 1929 b'í an Ghaeilge an t-aon teanga a bhí ag muintir na Gaeltachta ach anois tá siad chomh líofa céanna sa Bhéarla. Cuid de na daoine atá ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht, níl Gaeilge ar bith acu.</P>
      <P>B'fhéidir go gcuirfidh mé isteach ar dhaoine nuair a deirim gur mealladh tionsclaíocht isteach sa Ghaeltacht i gceantair mar Ghaoth Dóbhair ach mheall sé freisin daoine nach raibh aon Ghaeilge acu isteach sa cheantar. Bíonn Donncha Ó Baoill ón údarás ag caint faoi chúrsaí pleanála agus tuigim an rud atá i gceist aige.</P>
      <P>Tá níos mó Gaeilge lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht anois ná mar atá lastigh de &ndash; in áiteanna mar Bhéal Feirste, Iúir Chinn Trá, Doire Cholmcille agus Dún Lóiche i gContae Aontroma. Sna fiche sé contae tá Gaeilge á labhairt i nDún Laoghaire agus in a lán áiteanna eile, agus tá gaelscoil mór i bPort Laoise agus in a lán áiteanna eile.</P>
      <P>Caithfimid aire a thabhairt don Ghaeltacht agus í a choinneáil daingean nó titfidh an tóin as an rud ar fad. Caithfimid an Ghaeilge a spreagadh. Bhuaileamar le toscaireacht ó Ghael Uladh le déanaí, coiste atá ag déanamh sárobair chun an Ghaeilge a chothú i measc na scoileanna sa Ghaeltacht agus taobh amuigh de. Ach tháinig scéim na gcúntóirí teanga isteach mar ní raibh an Ghaeilge láidir go leor sna scoileanna náisiúnta fiú amháin sa Ghaeltacht. Sin athrú mór.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá lá an bhata mhóir imithe. Rud sóisialta, pléisiúrtha agus faiseanta é anois a bheith in ann Gaeilge a labhairt. Ní cheart daoine a bheith faoi bhrú chun Gaeilge a fhoghlaim. Bhí a lán teaghlaigh ina gcónaí sa bhaile ina rugadh mé nach raibh Gaeilge acu ach bhí múinteoirí breátha againn agus chuir siad brú orainn Gaeilge a labhairt agus a fhoghlaim. Bhí brú orm ón mbaile freisin. Bhí orm dul go Rann na Feirste go dtí an coláiste Gaeilge agus nuair a amharcaim siar air anois, deirim gurb in an rud ceart ag an am ach níor chreid mé ann ag an am. Tá an Ghaeilge is binne sa tír le cloisteáil i Rann na Feirste agus tá <Col N="231" /> lúcháir orm anois gur cuireadh go dtí an coláiste sin mé.</P>
    <P>Mar gheall ar an mbrú agus an bata mór níor labhair mé Gaeilge go ceann tríocha cúig bliana ina dhiaidh sin. Ní raibh seans agam mar bhí mé ag obair ag rudaí nach raibh Gaeilge ag teastáil dóibh agus ní raibh mé ag casadh le daoine ón nGaeltacht. Ach tá lúcháir orm anois go bhfuil Gaeilge agam agus cé nach bhfuil gach focal teicniúil agam is féidir liom Gaeilge a labhairt le duine ar bith a labhrann Gaeilge liom.</P>
    <P>Déanann an Bille seo leathnú agus leasú ar Acht na dTithe (Gaeltacht) chun é a dhéanamh níos feiliúnaí don lá inniu. Ní raibh athrú ar bith sa reachtaíocht ó 1979 go dtí seo agus dá bhrí sin tá an Bille iontach tábhachtach don Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Fáiltím roimh na hathruithe ach tá rudaí nach bhfuilim sásta leo agus luafaidh mé iad ar deireadh.</P>
    <P>Cuirfidh an Bille seo go mór le héifeacht na scéime tithíochta sa Ghaeltacht agus bainfidh bunadh na Gaeltachta tairbhe níos fearr as dá bharr. Léiríonn an Bille go bhfuil an Rialtas lándáiríre faoi chur chun cinn na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta. Nuair a d'fhoilsigh an tAire Stáit Ó Cuív an Bille seo, d'fhógair sé méaduithe substaintiúla i méid na ndeontas tithíochta i leith obair fheabhsúcháin agus eile. Ní raibh méadú ar na deontais seo le fada an lá agus bhí sé in am iad a mhéadú.</P>
    <P>Tá méadú 200% ar dheontais do na hoileáin &ndash; méadú 50% a bhí ann roimhe seo. Rud iontach tábhachtach é sin do na hoileáin mar tá míbhuntáistí móra ag baint le teach a thógáil ar oileán.</P>
    <P>Rinneadh méadú ar an ndeontas do theach úr ar na hoileáin agus ar an ndeontas do fheabhsúcháin riachtanacha &ndash; suas le £12,000 sa dá chás. Sin ardú £8,500. Tá na gnáthdheontais imithe ó £3,500 go £4,000 agus tá ardú chomh maith ar na deontais fá choinne séarachas, seomraí folctha agus soláthar uisce ar na hoileáin agus ar an mórthír.</P>
    <P>Níl aon dabht ann ach go mbeidh an dul chun cinn ann ó thaobh tithíochta na Gaeltachta agus go mbeidh caighdeán maireachtála níos fearr ag na daoine ann.</P>
    <P>An t-athrú is mó sa Bhille seo ná nach mbeidh gnáthchónaí sa Ghaeltacht mar choinníoll feasta d'iarrthóirí ar dheontas do theach nua. Cabhraíonn sé seo le teaghlaigh le Gaeilge atá ar imirce agus ag iarraidh filleadh abhaile. Cabhróidh sé chomh maith le daoine atá ag obair. Tharla rudaí cosúil le tionscalaíocht a mhealladh isteach sa Ghaeltacht agus tá eastát tionscalaíochta mór i nGaoth Dóbhair. Ba mhaith an rud é sin ach mheall sé daoine fosta isteach sa Ghaeltacht nach raibh aon Ghaeilge acu. Nílim ag iarraidh cur isteach ar Dhonncha Ó Baoill ón údarás. Cabhróidh sé freisin le daoine atá ag obair i rith na seachtaine cosúil le daoine i mo Dháilcheantar féin atá ag obair i mBaile Átha Cliath nó i nGaillimh ar feadh na seachtaine agus ar mhaith leo gnáthchónaí a bheith orthu ina gceantar féin. Ní íocfar <Col N="232" /> an deontas go dtí go mbeidh siad ina gcónaí sa teach.</P>
    <P>D'ardaigh an Teachta Mac Fhionnlaoich ceist mar gheall air seo agus aontaím leis seo nach bhfuil an cheist seo réitithe go fóill. Is iomaí duine a bhí i dteagmháil liomsa faoi, daoine óga nach raibh sásta teach a cheannach san áit a bhfuil siad ag obair mar go bhfuil siad ag filleadh abhaile ag an deireadh seachtaine ar an mbus. Ba mhaith leo cónaí sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Beidh cabhair acu leis an mBille seo teach a thógáil sa bhaile ach má phósann siad sa chathair seans nach mbeidh Gaeilge ar bith ag an duine a phósann siad. Dúirt an Teachta Ó Cuív go mbeadh seans ag an duine sin an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim thar sé mhí nó mar sin agus go bhféadfadh siad ansin cur isteach ar scéim spreagtha na Gaeilge. Ach féach chomh deacair atá sé ar dhaltaí scoile an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim le linn trí bliana déag ag dul ar scoil. Ní chreidim gur féidir Gaeilge a fhoghlaim laistigh de shé mhí.</P>
    <P>Tá mé an-bhuíoch den Aire Stáit agus den Aire Stáit Ó Cuív as ucht déileáil leis an deacracht seo cé nach bhfuil sé ach leathréitithe fós.</P>
    <P>Is scéim iontach tábhachtach é seo &ndash; anuraidh tháinig méadú de 31% ar lion na n-iarratais a bhí ann ó 1998 agus i mbliana tá ardú eile de 10% ann. Bhí 1,300 ann anuraidh agus tá ardú ar sin anois. Chímid an tábhacht atá leis an athrú seo mar nuair a tugadh an deontas isteach don teas lárnach bhí méadú mór ar na hiarratais.</P>
    <P>De réir Acht Airí agus Rúnaí 1956 is ea a leagtar amach teorainneacha na Gaeltachta. In alt 4 deir sé go mbeidh fáil ar dheontas chun díon tuí a dheisiú. Cé go raibh sé ansin ní raibh an reachtaíocht ann le déileáil leis. B'fhéidir go soiléireodh an tAire Stáit an fhoráil seo.</P>
    <P>In alt 6 luaitear an riail seacht mbliana idir iarratais ar dheontais. Déarfaidh daoine áirithe go bhfuil sé sin ceart go leor ach leis na hathruithe a tharla le blianta anuas agus an teas lárnach á chur ar an liosta &ndash; is dóigh liom gur luaigh an tAire Stáit go mbeadh eisceacht ann do chúl choire &ndash; ach ba cheart go ndéanfaí eisceacht go háirithe do sheandaoine a fuair deontas laistigh de na seacht bliana deiridh do chóras teasa.</P>
    <P>Bhí mé ag amharc ar na rudaí a dúradh nuair a bhí an Bille seo sa Dáil. Luadh breacGhaeltachtaí agus an é nach mbeidh an deontas ar fáil ag daoine atá ina gcónaí sa limistéar sin? </P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Léigh mé amach liosta na mbreacGhaeltachtaí agus ní raibh iarratas ar bith uathu i dTír Chonaill leis na blianta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>Sin an dóigh a bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag dul mar níl sí á foghlaim acu ar scoil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Má tá deontas faighte ag duine do dhoirse nó d'fhuinneoga taobh istigh de na seacht mbliana an féidir cur isteach ar dheontas eile d'obair eile cosúil le facia boards nó rud mar sin muna bhfuair tú ach £900 ach an t-uasmhéid a bhí ann ná £2,300. Ón méid a dúirt an Teachta Ó Cuív liom thuig mé go mbeadh duine ar bith in ann £2,400 <Col N="233" /> a fháil anois fá choinne an teas lárnach. An fíor sin do dhaoine nach bhfuair ach suim bheag do fheabhsúcháin eile?</P>
    <P>Ba cheart an deontas feabhsúcháin a thabhairt do achan duine atá ina chónaí sa Ghaeltacht. Nílim ag iarraidh an deontas £4,000 a thabhairt do dhaoine nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu ach ba cheart an deontas eile a thabhairt do dhaoine nach bhfuil ag teacht isteach ach atá ina gcónaí ann. Níl deontas ar bith ag an Roinn Comhshaoil fá choinne feabhsúcháin. Discrimination atá ann i gcoinne daoine atá ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Ar a laghad tá gá ní amháin le scéim do dhaoine atá ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a fheabhsú ach do dhaoine atá ag tosú ar Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim. Ba chóir go mbeadh trí nó ceithre chéim ann agus ní dhá cheann amháin.</P>
    <P>Bhí deacracht ag duine i mo Dháilcheantar féin arbh as an mBreatain Bheag di. Cheap mise go bhfaigheadh sí an deontas mar gur teanga Cheilteach í sin ach ní bhfuair sí an deontas mar ní raibh Gaeilge na hÉireann aici.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam nach gcaillfear aon chuid den Ghaeltacht nuair a gheofar torthaí an scrúdaithe atá ar bun ag Coimisiún na Gaeltachta mar scriosfadh sé sin an Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Luadh na breacGhaeltachtaí agus go raibh Ardraha mar chuid de. Ba cheart d'áiteacha ar nós Ardraha, na Gleanntaí, an Fhachain agus Ros Beag a bheith sa Ghaeltacht. Tosnaíonn Gaeltacht Thír Chonaill i nGleann Cholmcille, tá bearna ann agus ansin tagaimid go dtí Gaeltacht na Rosann, Gaoth Dóbhair agus Cloch an Fhaola. Ba cheart go mbeadh an áit go léir ceangailte suas. Tá Gaeilge chomh maith ag daoine sna ceantair sin is atá acu i gceartlár na Gaeltachta i nGaoth Dóbhair. Fágfaidh mé go dtí an chéad uair eile mo chuid tuairimí faoi cad is teaghlach sa Ghaeltacht. Ní aontaím ar chor ar bith leis an méid atá sa Bhille.</P>
    <P>Guím gach rath ar an Aire Stáit agus táim an-bhuíoch den méid a rinne an tAire Stáit O Cuív as an oiread sin rudaí a thabhairt ar ais fad a bhí sé ina Aire Stáit, cosúil le scéim na mbóithre áise. An tseachtain seo d'fhógair an tAire Stáit arduithe sna híocaíochtaí leis na mná tí. Tá a lán rudaí eile a ba mhaith linn a fheiceáil sa Ghaeltacht agus beidh mé ag feitheamh ar na deontais eile a bheas á fhógairt ag an Aire Stáit.</P>

      <P>Measaim go bhfuil fiche nóiméad agam. Níl a fhios agam cén chuid den Ghaeltacht ina labhartar an Ghaeilge is binne ach tá mé cinnte go labhrann daoine i ngach Gaeltacht Gaeilge níos binne ná mo chuid féin. Nuair a éistim leis an Teachta Mac Fhionnlaoich nó an Seanadóir Ó Cnáimhsí tuigim an difear idir an cainteoir dúchais agus an duine a fhoghlaimíonn a chuid Gaoluinne níos déanaí.</P>
      <P>Tá sé luaite cheana féin gur féidir a bhrath go bhfuil dearcadh níos dearfaí ag daoine lasmuigh de na Gaeltachtaí i leith na Gaeilge ná mar atá ag daoine laistigh de na Gaeltachtaí. Tá sé suimiúil go bhfuil trí chinn de bhialanna in aice an Tí seo inar féidir gach gnó a dhéanamh iontu trí Ghaoluinn, ceann i gceannáras na Comhdhála, ceann i Sráid Dawson agus an triú ceann i dTeach an Ardmhéara.</P>
      <P>Bheadh an t-ádh leat i nGaeltacht Chorca Dhuibhne do chuid gnó a dhéanamh go rialta as Gaoluinn i gcuid mhór de na tithe tábhairne agus bialanna ann. Ní ar muintir na Gaeltachta atá an milleán ach ar an mborradh mór atá tagtha ar thionscal na turasóireachta. Tá sé ag tarraingt daoine isteach sa Ghaeltacht ag lorg oibre.</P>
      <P>Áit bhreá í an Ghaeltacht chun do shaol a chaitheamh inti má tá jab agat. Ach an chuid is mó de na daoine a théann isteach iontu níl Gaoluinn acu agus bíonn siad ag déanamh a gcuid gnó trí Bhéarla le muintir na háite. Cuid de ghnáthdheabhéasa na tíre seo é nach mbrúdh daoine Gaeilge ar dhaoine eile ach tá sé ag éirí níos deacra teacht ar bhialann nó teach tábhairne sa Ghaeltacht ina ndéanfar freastal ort trí Ghaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní theastaíonn ó éinne dul isteach in áit ar bith agus iachall a chur ar dhaoine Gaoluinn a labhairt nuair nach mian leo í labhairt, ach sin mar a bhraithim go minic sa Ghaeltacht anois. A mhalairt de scéal le muintir na Gaeltachta sna fíorGhaeltachtaí. Cé go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó Béarla á labhairt sna Gaeltachtaí tá an Ghaeilge i bhfad níos láidre mar tá i bhfad níos mó daoine óga ina gcónaí sna Gaeltachtaí anois ná mar a bhí fiche bliain ó shin. Agus cé gur meascán de Bhéarla agus Gaeilge a labhartar sa Ghaeltacht toisc go mbíonn daoine ann gan Ghaeilge, tá daoine óga ann a bhfuil Gaoluinn den scoth acu agus a labhrann í. N'fheadar ainneoin sin an bhfuil an <Col N="235" /> meas céanna ag muintir na Gaeltachta ar an dteanga agus atá ag pobal na galltachta?</P>
    <P>Tá catch-up le déanamh ag muintir na Gaeltachta leis an athrú meoin atá tar éis tarlú sa ghalltacht maidir leis an teanga agus a tábhacht. Tá catch-up le déanamh freisin maidir leis an sean-íomhá den bhochtanas trí Ghaeilge a bhíodh ag muintir na Gaeltachta go forleathan. Tá a lán daoine ann anois a bhfuil caighdeán ard maireachtála acu sna Gaeltachtaí le seirbhísí agus saol cultúrtha agus cabhraíonn na rudaí seo uilig le borradh na teanga, cé go gcuidíonn siad freisin le leathnú an Bhéarla. Téann an dá rud le chéile.</P>
    <P>Ní fhéadfaí an Ghaeltacht a fhorbairt gan níos mó Béarla a ligint isteach ann. É sin ráite, caithfear a rá go bhfuil sé in am dúinn tabhairt faoin fhírinne agus féachaint cá bhfuil na Gaeltachtaí. Is bréag é a bheith ag ligint orainn féin go bhfuil áiteanna ar imeall chathair na Gaillimhe &ndash; na suburbs móra &ndash; go bhfuil siad sa Ghaeltacht. Níl a fhios fiú ag 90% de na daoine atá ina gcónaí iontu go bhfuil siad in ainm is a bheith ina gcónaí i nGaeltacht. An t-aon uair a fhaigheann siad é sin amach ná nuair a bhíonn toghchán ar siúl agus go dtugtar páipéar vótála sa bhreis dóibh. Ní bhíonn a fhios acu cé dóibh a bhfuil siad ag vótáil mar níl a fhios acu go bhfuil siad sna Gaeltachtaí oifigiúla.</P>
    <P>Bheadh sé níos macánta limistéar Gaeltachta nua a shainmhíniú agus ní bheinn ró-dhian faoi. Nílim ag lorg linguistic purity mar ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé ann a thuilleadh, an saghas ruda a bhí á lorg nuair a leagadh amach na limistéir beagnach 50 bliain ó shin. Ach bímis réasúnta macánta. Ní fiú baile an Daingin a chur isteach sa Ghaeltacht mar ní Gaeltacht í. Tá níos mó deathola i leith na Gaeilge i mbaile an Daingin anois ná mar a bhí 25 bliain ó shin. An chéad uair a chuaigh mé ann, dá labharfá Gaeilge sna siopaí agus fiú in oifig an phoist, chaithfí amach thú agus ní labharfaí leat. Ach tá níos mó spending power ag muintir na Gaeltachta anois agus tá athrú meoin ann. Ach ní Gaeltacht í baile an Daingin agus ní forbairt Ghaeltachta a tharlaíonn má tharlaíonn forbairt sa Daingean. Cabhraíonn sé leis an nGaeltacht ach ní forbairt Ghaeltachta í.</P>
    <P>An chéad rud a gcuirim fáilte roimhe ná na deontais agus an méadú atá tagtha orthu. Ach tá sé ráite go minic nach gcabhróidh deontais den méid seo leis an ngéarchéim tithíochta sa Ghaeltacht a mhaolú. I nGaeltacht Chorca Dhuibhne mar shampla ní bhfaighfí láthair tí ar níos lú ná £40,000. Daoine a bhfuil ceangail acu leis an áit agus ar féidir leo láthair tí a fháil óna muintir tá an t-ádh leo agus daoine eile a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeltacht nó a bhfuil Gaoluinn acu, an deacracht is mó a bheas acu ná láthair tí a fháil.</P>
    <P>Sin ceist níos forleithne ná ceist na ndeontas. Ní féidir deontais a chur ar fáil a chabhródh le daoine sa mhéid sin. Caithfear rud éigin a dhéanamh faoin éileamh ar thithe, faoi chúrsaí pleanála chun cabhrú leis na daoine atá sásta cur futhu sa <Col N="236" /> Ghaeltacht teach a chur ar fáil dóibh féin. Daoine cosúil liomsa atá ag cur isteach orthu, daoine a bhfuil tithe samhraidh acu sa Ghaeltacht is mó is cúis leis an éileamh sin, dar liom.</P>
    <P>Caithfear cabhrú le daoine teach a chur ar fáil dóibh féin, ó fhoinsí príobháideacha nó poiblí nó daoine saibhre amháin a bheidh ag tógáil tithe sa Ghaeltacht. Áilleacht na Gaeltachta is cúis le cuid mhaith den éileamh seo.</P>
    <P>Tá cúpla ceist agam i dtaobh an Bhille cé go bhfáiltím roimhe don chuid is mó. Cad é an difear idir alt 4 agus alt 9? Luann alt 4 na deontais is féidir a thabhairt do dhuine a shásóidh an tAire gurb í an Ghaeilge an ghnáththeanga sa teach. Ach in alt 9 deirtear ainneoin aon ní eile gur féidir leis an Aire scéimeanna a dhéanamh le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais chun deontais nó cúnamh airgid a sholáthar faoi chóir an chostas a ghabhannn le teach a thógáil sa Ghaeltacht agus gur deimhin leis an Aire nach rachaidh áitiú an tí chónaithe sin chun aimhleas úsáid na Gaoluinne sa limistéar Gaeltachta. Níl aon choinníoll ann go mbeadh na daoine siúd ag tógáil clanna trí Ghaoluinn. Ní thuigim an difríocht eatarthu agus is féidir é a phlé níos mó arís. Tá difríocht fhealsúnachta ann, braithim, ach b'fhéidir nach bhfuil an ceart agam.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an tAire Stáit alt 10 faoi dheontais a ghnóthú nó a thógaint ar ais má bhíonn fraud nó misrepresentation ann. Is suimiúil nár luadh a leithéid go dtí seo. Cad a tharlaíodh go dtí seo dá mbeadh fraud nó misrepresentation ann? Ar fágadh na deontais leis na daoine ainneoin gurb eol don Stát go raibh mífhaisnéis nó calaois i gceist? Ní raibh aon slí ag an Stát airgead a thógail ar ais nuair ab eol dóibh gur chaolaois nó mífhaisnéis a fuarthas an t-airgead an chéad lá riamh.</P>
    <P>Tá sainmhíniú tugtha ar theaghlach agus ní bheadh aon deacracht agam leis. Léifidh mé i mBéarla é: A family means all persons usually residing in the dwellinghouse with the occupier, whether related or not related by blood or marriage to the occupier. An fáth a luaim é sin ná go bhfuil sainmhíniú curtha ar fáil ag an gCúirt Uachtarach ar chlann agus is é a deir siad ná a family based on marriage. Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé bunreachtúil aon sainmhíniú eile a chur isteach sa Bhille seo a rachadh i gcoinne an tsainmhínithe sin.</P>

      <P>D'fhéadfaí focal eile a chur isteach ann &ndash; people who live in the house &ndash; ach an focal sin &lsquo;family' tá sainmhíniú ar leith leis. Is dóigh liom go bhfuil sainmhíniú na Cúirte Uachtaraí beagáinín as data toisc go bhfuil an-chuid living arrangements eile ann. Ach sin ceist ghearr agus sin atá le déanamh againn chun an Bille a chíoradh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>É sin ráite, nílim éadóchasach faoi na Gaeltachtaí ach ní bheidh siad mar a bhí siad tráth as seo amach. Ní mhairfidh an aonteangachas a thuilleadh iontu ach ní bheidh an sense of death <Col N="237" /> a bhíodh iontu, iontu ach oiread. Nuair a chuaigh mé don chéad uair go dtí Gaeltacht Chiarraí i 1971, b'áit aoibhinn chiúin í, lán de dhaoine breátha agus gan acu ach Gaoluinn. Ach seandaoine breátha ba mhó a bhí ann, a raibh an saol oibre beagnach críochnaithe acu agus go raibh a lán ama acu chun bheith ina suí ag caint le cuairteoirí. Ach ní raibh aon todhchaí ann don áit. Áit aoibhinn fholamh a bheadh inti dá leanfaí ar aghaidh mar a bhí agus gan ach tithe samhraidh á dtógáil inti. Ní bheadh aon phobal fágtha dá leanfaí leis an saol mar a bhí.</P>
    <P>Mar sin nuair a thosnaíonn daoine ag gearán liomsa faoi na hathruithe atá tagtha ar na Gaeltachtaí agus faoin easpa daoine atá ar fáil chun Gaoluinn a mhúineadh dóibh nó chomh deacair is atá sé comhrá a bheith agat le duine trí Ghaoluinn an t-athrú is mó ná go bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta ag obair anois go lánaimseartha, cuid mhaith acu, agus tá siad cúramach nó gnóthach agus mar sin tá an saol athraithe. Níl an t-am acu le bheith ag suí timpeall ag caint le cuairteoirí. Tá meascán de Ghaoluinn agus Béarla á labhairt ann mar tá cuid mhaith daoine sna Gaeltachtaí pósta le daoine ón ngalltacht. Ach is féidir a rá anois go mbeidh pobal sna Gaeltachtaí i gcónaí, nach dtitfidh an tóin as na pobail, go bhfuil saol sóisialta agus cultúrtha ann agus an rud is mó atá le déanamh ná cabhrú leis an bhforbairt sin, leo siúd atá sásta gan aon bhrú leanúint leo mar theaghlaigh lánGhaeilge.</P>
    <P>Ceann de na rudaí gur féidir a dhéanamh agus tá sé beartaithe sa Bhille seo ná daoine nua le Gaeilge a mhealladh isteach chun cónaí sa Ghaeltacht trí scéim dheontais. An dara rud ná má údarás áitiúil ag tabhairt faoi scéim tithíochta poiblí sa Ghaeltacht, mar atá ag tarlú i gcúpla áit, caithfear teacht ar bhealach éigin le cinntiú gur daoine atá sásta clanna a thógáil le Gaeilge a fhaigheann na tithe sin. Muna ndéantar é sin agus más daoine gan Ghaeilge a fhaigheann na tithe buailfear an Ghaeilge go trom sna Gaeltachtaí.</P>
    <P>Pléadh an ghné seo nuair a bhí an Bille Pleanála ag dul tríd an Oireachtas. Caithfear language test de shaghas éigin a chur i bhfeidhm ar gach forbairt sna Gaeltachtaí. Ní chóir aon fhorbairt a chur ar ceal mar tá siad go léir tuillte ag muintir na Gaeltachta ach caithfear fine-tuning a dhéanamh orthu, is cuma an tithíocht, tionsclaíocht nó turasóireacht atá i gceist. Caithfear gach tionchar diúltach ar an nGaeilge a mhaolú a mhéid agus is féidir. Ní féidir an Ghaeltacht a chosaint ar gach aon ní agus is féidir cuid mhaith a dhéanamh má aithnítear na deacrachtaí atá ann.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom fós go bhfuil lucht pleanála na n-údarás áitiúil sách ar an eolas faoi thábhacht cheist na teangan sna Gaeltachtaí. Cloisim ar Raidió na Gaeltachta go bhfuil sé ina raic i níos mó ná Gaeltacht amháin faoi chúrsaí tógáil tithe. Ba chóir do na pleanálaithe tuiscint a bheith acu faoi language sensitivity.</P>
    <P>Tá gá le scéim nó comórtas maidir le húsáid na Gaoluinne sa saol tráchtáil sna Gaeltachtaí. Tá Gaeilge á húsáid go forleathan ag pobal Chorca <Col N="238" /> Dhuibhne, ag an Aifreann, ag cruinnithe poiblí agus mar sin de, ach bíonn ar na daoine seo tiontú ar an mBéarla nuair a théann siad isteach i siopa nó i dteach tábhairne toisc nach bhfuil aon spreagadh ann do lucht tráchtála an teanga a úsáid, cé gur Gaeilgeoirí formhór a gcuid custaiméirí.</P>
    <P>Seo iad na rudaí atá ag teastáil: tithíocht ar féidir leis na daoine íoc as, plean forbartha teanga agus cúrsaí pleanála a dhíriú ar fhorbairt na teanga. Is trua nach bhfuil an ghné sin níos sofheicthe sa Bhille Pleanála mar tá sé an-tábhachtach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Ms Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Gabhaim mo fhíor-bhuíochas le gach duine a bhí páirteach sa díospóireacht seo agus táim buíoch de na Seanadóirí as a gcuid tacaíochta do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Shíl mé nach mbeadh ach méid beag le rá inniu agus tá mé an-bhróidiúil as an méid tacaíochta atá le fáil sa Seanad do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus go mór mór don teanga.</P>
      <P>Aontaím go bhfuil fadhbanna ag muintir na Gaeltachta le cead pleanála. Mar bhall de chomhairle contae, is eol dom an brú a bhí orainn maidir le cúrsaí pleanála agus na deacrachtaí atá ag muintir na Gaeltachta, mar a luaigh an Seanadóir Ó Riain. Tá daoine ag tógáil tithe samhraidh ann, tá praghas na súiomh ag dul in airde.</P>
      <P>Tá sé sin taobh amuigh de mo chuid cumhachtaí féín, is baolach, agus bhí an Roinn ag caint leis na comhairlí contae éagsúla mar gheall ar an tionchar a fhéadfadh a bheith ag plean forbartha ar chúrsaí teanga sa Ghaeltacht. Luaigh siad a dheacra is atá sé do mhuintir na Gaeltachta suíomh a fháil. De ghnáth sna Gaeltachtaí, is áit in aice na farraige atá i gceist de ghnáth, SAC freisin, b'fhéidir, agus cothaíonn sé sin an-chuid deacrachtaí. Tá socruithe déanta i bplean forbartha Thír Chonaill le go mbeidh sé níos fusa ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta cead pleanála a fháil ina gceantar féin.</P>
      <P>Cé nach bhfuilim in ann aon ní a dhéanamh faoi chúrsaí pleanála beidh mé i dteagmháil leis an Aire Comhshaoil fá dtaobh de, agus ar deireadh is ceist do na comhairlí contae é, don chuid is mó.</P>
      <P>Teastaíonn uainn go mbeadh Gaeilgeoirí ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht agus chuige sin caithfear cabhrú leo na deacrachtaí pleanála a shárú.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir leis an méid a dúirt an Seanadóir de Búrca, daoine a bhfuil cónaí orthu lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht tig leo cur isteach ar dheontas do theach úr agus íocfar é nuair a thagann siad chun cónaí sa Ghaeltacht. Maidir leis an top-up, tá deontais eile le fáil ón gcomhairle contae - TPGs agus ERGs - agus an deacracht atá agam ná go bhfuil an deontas ó mo Roinnse cosúil leis an ERG agus mar sin ní thig liomsa airgead a thabhairt an dara huair don obair chéanna. Táim ábalta airgead a thabhairt chun cabhrú le TPGs d'obair taobh amuigh den méid a cheadaíonn an chomhairle contae ach ní don obair chéanna. Ach <Col N="239" /> tá a fhios agam go bhfuil deacrachtaí ag na ERG sa Ghaeltacht agus lasmuigh de.</P>
    <P>Deontas £4,000 atá ann do theach úr. An rud a dúirt mise ná muna mbíonn Gaeilge ag duine atá ag lorg deontas do theach úr tá siad ábalta deontas de £3,000 a fháil ón Roinn Comhshaoil. Agus dá mbeidís ábalta Gaeilge a fhoghlaim nó feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge bheidís ábalta cur isteach ar dheontas breise ó mo Roinnse taobh istigh de dhá bliain agus £800 a fháil. Sin an £3,800 a luadh.</P>
    <P>Maidir le &lsquo;capping', an rud a dúirt mé san óráid, £1.9 milliún a bhí ann anuraidh do na scéimeanna tithíochta. I mbliana is £2.1 milliún atá i gceist. Níl aon &lsquo;capping' i gceist ar chor ar bith.</P>
    <P>D'ardaigh an Seanadóir Ó Cochláin ceist faoi na hoileáin agus cuirfear an t-eolas go léir chuige. Tá méadú an-mhór ag teacht ar na deontais do mhuintir na n-oileán.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Seanadóir Ó Cnaimhsí agus Seanadóirí eile riail na seacht mbliana. Roimhe seo bhí riail deich mbliana a bhí ann. An deacracht atá agam, taobh amuigh de rudaí speisialta mar dheontais do mhná tí, tá sé deacair an dara deontas a thabhairt do dhaoine nuair a shíl an Roinn gur athchóiríodh an teach go hiomlán an chéad uair. Tá costas an-mhór ag baint le hathchóiriú. Tá an ceart ag an Seanadóir gur féidir &lsquo;top-up' a dhéanamh de réir mar a thuig sé ón iar-Aire Stáit sa chás nach bhfuarthas ach £900, sa chás a luaigh an Seanadóir go £1,400 anois.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>Suas go dtí £1,400, an ea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sea. £1,400.</P>
      <P>Rud eile a luaigh achan duine agus feicim go bhfuil difear mór idir an dá thaobh den Teach seo faoi, ná na scéimeanna atá ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht amháin. Na scéimeanna feabhsúcháin do thithe is mó a déantar gearán futhu. Táimid ag iarraidh cabhrú le muintir na Gaeltachta agus leis an teanga agus ní féidir na scéimanna a chur ar fáil do dhaoine gan Gaeilge. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil sé deacair Gaeilge a fhoghlaim ach go bhfuil daoine ag teacht chun na Gaeltachta ó thíortha thar lear ach is é sprid an Bhille seo ná go gcuirfí an chabhair ar fáil dóibhsiúd a bhfuil Gaeilge acu. Luaigh an Seanadóir Ó Cnáimhsí an deacracht atá ag daltaí Gaeilge a fhoghlaim tar éis trí bliana déag scoile ach sin ceist eile don Roinn Oideachais. Tá mo Roinn solúbtha agus tabharfar gach cúnamh do dhaoine atá ag iarraidh an teanga a fhoghlaim.</P>
      <P>Maidir le daoine a rugadh thar lear agus atá gan Ghaeilge go hiomlán, tá a fhios againn go bhfuil dreamanna mar Oideas Gael ag múineadh Gaeilge do dhaoine iasachta a thagann chun na tíre chuige sin. Mar sin ní féidir liom deontas tí a thabhairt do theaghlach nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beidh an chumhacht agam sa Bhille seo rialacha nua a dhéanamh ach ní féidir liom níos mó a rá anois. Caithfear aithbhreathnú a dhéanamh ar an riail sin. Fáiltím roimh na daoine atá ag fille<Col N="240" /> adh ar an dtír seo agus ní bhaineann sé sin le cuspóirí an Bhille seo.</P>
    <P>D'ardaigh an Seanadóir Ó Cochláin ceist faoi dheontas do &lsquo;stone-faced work'. Faoin scéim mar atá sé glactar le hiarratais ar dheontais don chineál sin oibre. Cuidíonn sé sin go mór le stádas an tí. Bíonn costas mór leis an saghas sin oibre, áfach.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an teas lárnach, roimhe seo ní raibh na scéimeanna seo le fáil ar chor ar bith. Scéim úr é seo ag an Roinn. Nuair a bhí na scéimeanna feabhsúcháin ghinearálta ann bhí gach duine ag cur isteach orthu agus ní raibh cothrom na Féinne á fháil ag muintir na Gaeltachta. Molann an Seanadóir go mba chóir scéim a cheapadh chun teas lárnach a chur isteach do sheandaoine. Bheadh achan duine ag cur iarratas isteach agus ní oibreodh sé. Dá n-athróinn an riail seacht mbliana chaithfinn cead a thabhairt do gach duine cur isteach ar dheontas &ndash; níl a fhios agam an féidir liom rud éigin speisialta a dhéanamh do na seandaoine. Tá an deontas faoin scéim Housing Aid for the Elderly le fáil ach déanfaidh mé aithbhreathnú air más féidir liom. Deir an Roinn liom go mbeadh orm an scéim a chur ar fáil do gach duine.</P>
    <P>D'ardaigh an Seanadóir Ó Murchú ceist mar gheall ar dhaoine ag filleadh go hÉirinn agus leis an scéim seo beidh siad ábalta iarratas a chur isteach ar dheontas do theach úr.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam go maith go bhfuil an teanga faoi bhrú agus go gcaithfear rudaí speisialta a dhéanamh chun í a choimeád beo. Aontaím leis an méid a bhí le rá ag gach duine faoin ngá le hinfrastruchtúr &ndash; tithe, oideachas trí Ghaeilge, an cultúr traidisiúnta. Ba mhaith liom go mbeimis ábalta a rá laistigh de dheich mbliana go bhfuil an teanga beo sa Ghaeltacht agus go bhfuil cothrom na Féinne á fháil ag muintir na Gaeltacht ó thaobh infrastruchtúr de.</P>
    <P>Beimid ábalta dul tríd an Bhille seo céim ar chéim ar ball agus rachaidh mé tríd na moltaí a bhí ag gach Seanadóir. Tá súil agam go gcuideoidh an Bille seo le gach duine sa Ghaeltacht agus tá na moltaí an-tábhachtach sa mhéid sin chun go mbeidh an Bille chomh maith agus is féidir.</P>

    <Title>Teaching Council Bill, 2000: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy to be in a position to introduce the Teaching Council Bill which is <Col N="241" /> extremely important for teachers, pupils and their parents, and for the country as a whole. Its general aim is to provide for the establishment of standards, policies and procedures for the education and training of teachers, which will include a professional code of conduct. In particular, the Bill will provide for the establishment of a Teaching Council. It will allow the 45,000 teachers in the education system a large degree of self-regulation and professional autonomy. It will enhance the status and morale of the teaching profession and underpin the excellent quality of education already provided. For students and their parents, the Bill will provide the assurance that the teachers who work with their children meet the highest standards of professional qualification and competence through a professional code of conduct. It will also provide parents with a clear and transparent course of action in the event of a teacher failing to meet these standards. It will copperfasten the high standard of education provided, which has been so important to the State's recent economic and social development, and which continues to be important for the future of the nation as a whole.</P>
      <P>Work on the establishment of a teaching council in Northern Ireland is ongoing and what we do here today will ensure that teachers in Ireland, both North and South, will be in a position to move forward together. The establishment of teaching councils in both parts of Ireland will ensure that the high standards of teaching, North and South, of which we are so justly proud, will continue, and will be seen to continue, in the future.</P>
      <P>This Bill will enhance further the status of teaching as a profession. The council will play a central role in ensuring that the high standards of our teachers and of education will not be just maintained, but strengthened. The establishment of the council will allow teachers themselves to undertake the functions necessary to ensure that quality remains the trademark of the teaching profession.</P>
      <P>Already, we have similar professional bodies such as the Medical Council and the Nursing Board. It is timely now that the State should formally recognise that teachers have their own professional role in a Teaching Council. This will confirm their status, entitle them to self-regulation and empower them with greater responsibility for educational standards and quality.</P>
      <P>This Bill represents the culmination of a process of consultation and deliberation which began two and a half years ago with the establishment of a steering committee, in which teachers were centrally involved. It advised the Minister on the establishment of a council. Its report was published in October 1998 and the drafting of this legislation was based on its conclusions and recommendations which were agreed by all involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of a Teaching Council was advocated in a range of official reports, including <Col N="242" /> the 1991 OECD review of Irish education and the 1992 Green Paper, Education for a Changing World. Teachers themselves, as well as the other partners in education, sought the establishment of such a council. They believe, as I do, that a council will have a major role in recognising the contribution of teachers as professionals possessing the knowledge and expertise, not only to shape the future of their profession, but also to contribute effectively to the future direction of education policy.</P>
    <P>The council will be an independent, statutory agency, which will exercise the powers and perform the functions through which teachers can achieve a large degree of professional autonomy and self-regulation. It will have a statutory role in the regulation of the teaching profession and the professional affairs of teachers, and an advisory role in relation to other matters.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of this Bill outlines the functions of the council, which are: to promote teaching as a profession; establish, review and maintain codes of professional conduct for teachers; establish and maintain a register of teachers; establish and promote standards in programmes of teacher education and training regulation; promote the continuing education and training and professional development of teachers; conduct inquiries into and, where appropriate, impose sanctions regarding teachers' fitness to teach. The council will also conduct or commission research, represent the teaching profession on educational issues and provide advice to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for a broad representation of interests on the 37 member council. As is the norm in the case of professional bodies, the majority of members will be drawn from the teaching profession and will be elected by practising teachers. It is important that it should also have access to expertise from areas outside, but interested in, the teaching profession. The steering committee, representing the partners in education, recommended the composition as outlined in this Bill. It is on the basis of their recommendation that the Bill provides for the teacher training colleges, parents' associations and management bodies to have representation.</P>
    <P>I have also provided for five persons representative of outside interests to be appointed to the council. Of these five, one each will be nominated by ICTU and IBEC. I am also considering including a representative from a post-primary student council as one of my nominees. I am confident that the broad based composition of the Teaching Council will be an important factor in ensuring widespread support for its work and overall success in promoting best practice within the teaching profession.</P>
    <P>Teachers have much to gain from the Teaching Council. Working through and in consultation with the council, they will play a key part in the self-regulation and development of their profession. Within the framework provided by the council, teachers will be able to address issues of <Col N="243" /> professional autonomy in the context of teaching. Their professional status and recognition will be enhanced greatly by many elements of the Bill, in particular by the professional code of conduct provided for in section 6. The council will be responsible for the drafting of this code and I envisage that it will encompass a statement of professionalism agreed by all teachers. Being part of a recognised, collective professional identity with statutory authority will enhance the status and identity of teachers.</P>
    <P>The Teaching Council will be the voice of teachers by promoting the profession through a celebration of achievements and by raising public awareness of the way teachers work and of the environment in which they work. An improved and widely promoted image of the profession will benefit the teachers of today and encourage new entrants for the future. The Teaching Council will play an important part also in ensuring that the in-career professional development of teachers remains relevant to their short-term and long-term needs. The council will advise the Minister in relation to standards for entry into programmes of teacher education and training and teacher supply. Its particular role in this regard will be to ensure that the professional needs of the teaching profession are recognised when policy decisions are taken in key areas. With the new professional image provided by the Teaching Council, teachers will be better placed to input into policy development.</P>
    <P>In common with most self-regulated professions, the Teaching Council will establish and maintain a register of its members as provided for in section 31 of this Bill. The register of teachers will be the main regulatory instrument of the council and will stand as a verifiable expression of the standard of teaching, knowledge, skill and competence that teachers aspire to have and maintain. Section 31 also provides for the Teaching Council to decide on the information to be held on the register and on what type of information will be made available to the public. The register will include specified details for each registered teacher, including the findings of any disciplinary proceedings and the period for which such information will remain on the register.</P>
    <P>The council will publish the register and make it available for inspection. Each teacher must have attained a satisfactory level of professional qualification and training to be entitled to register, and only those who achieve such standards will be able to work and be paid as teachers in State funded positions. The register will effectively act as a statement of the standards required of teachers. Following the initial period of registration, teachers will renew their registration annually.</P>
    <P>For parents, the Teaching Council will provide an assurance that the teachers who work with their children have been recognised as meeting the highest standards of professional qualification <Col N="244" /> and competence. Where parents have concerns regarding their children's teacher, there will now be a clear and transparent course of action available to them, with procedures to safeguard the rights and duties of all parties with appropriate remedies, where such are found to be needed. If the setting and maintaining of standards by the Teaching Council on behalf of the teaching profession is to have any meaning, the council must have power to act in the event of a teacher failing, for whatever reason, to reach these standards. Thus, a procedure for dealing with complaints against a teacher is set out in section 42 of the Teaching Council Bill, whereby the council may establish committees to assist, advise or perform any function it may wish to delegate.</P>
    <P>Two committees will deal with complaints received by the council, the investigating committee and the disciplinary committee. These committees will be empowered to investigate and adjudicate on complaints where it is alleged that teachers have failed to meet acceptable standards of practice. The members of the committees will be drawn from the membership of the Teaching Council as laid down in sections 27 and 28 and will operate under procedures drawn up by the council to protect the rights of all concerned. In particular, any teacher against whom a complaint is made will have his or her rights to due process fully observed and a teacher's right of recourse to the courts will not be impinged.</P>
    <P>Section 44 of the Bill provides the Teaching Council with a range of remedies in the event of a teacher being found unsatisfactory following the procedures which I have just outlined. For example, a teacher may be retained on the register, subject to conditions which are intended to assist the teacher to overcome the difficulties encountered. Other options include referral of the teacher to the teacher welfare service or to a relevant professional development course or suspension of the teacher from the register for a period of time. In a very serious case, a teacher may be permanently removed from the register, which would obviously be a very serious matter. In recognition of the consequences of deregistration, any such decision by the council will require the assent of the High Court, as provided for in section 44.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Teaching Council addresses the difficult but important task of disciplining a member will be watched with interest by all of us interested in education. The relevant provisions in the Bill adequately meet the needs of these cases. The provisions are a fine balance between respecting the rights of teachers to fair consideration and due process and the rights of students and parents to have confidence in the system of redress open to them in the event of a complaint against a teacher.</P>
    <P>The Teaching Council will give members of the profession a significant measure of control over professional issues relating to all aspects of the teaching career, including recruitment and sup<Col N="245" /> ply, initial preparation, induction, probation, career development and professional conduct and competence. For the first time there will be a unified framework in place for the recognition of teachers and the accreditation of programmes of teacher education and training. Previously at first level, the Department's inspectors have had a role in this area; at second level, the task has fallen to the Secondary Teachers Registration Council.</P>
    <P>In the changing and increasingly complex academic and professional world a unified approach is needed. Increasingly universities and colleges are designing more courses targeted at those who want to teach in our schools. The demand for recognition from teachers qualified outside Ireland is ever increasing. Ireland is now part of a wider Europe and we have a responsibility to be mindful of our European Union and wider international obligations in regard to the recognition of qualifications. The Teaching Council will be the designated authority for the purpose of ensuring that these commitments are fulfilled.</P>
    <P>The Teaching Council Bill provides us with a timely opportunity to regularise review and accreditation procedures for teachers, whether qualified in Ireland or abroad. The Bill will repeal the Registration Council (Constitution and Procedures) Rules, 1926, under which the Registration Council operated. The functions of the Registration Council will pass to the new Teaching Council which will be responsible for determining the education, training and qualifications required for the purposes of satisfying the requirements of registration. The role of the Teaching Council regarding the professional education of teachers will not end when the teacher begins to teach as it will play an important part in the probation and induction of teachers and in the professional education of teachers throughout their careers.</P>
    <P>I know Senators are conscious of the importance of fostering and developing good North-South contacts in all areas, including education. The House will also be aware that there have been fruitful contacts between Ministers and Departments North and South in recent years and that this interaction has been formalised through the North-South Ministerial Council established within the framework of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>The North-South Ministerial Council has already met twice in education sector format and has established a number of joint working groups to progress co-operation on matters of mutual concern. These joint working groups will consider issues such as special needs provision, tackling disadvantage, educational exchange activity and the situation of teachers in the island as a whole. Much work has taken place on the establishment of a teaching council in Northern Ireland. Section 7 of the Teaching Council Bill specifically provides for co-operation with that council so that <Col N="246" /> an all island approach can be taken where that is mutually beneficial.</P>
    <P>We have much in common with our colleagues in Northern Ireland in the high standards of education provided to our students. I am pleased that the Bill gives statutory expression to this spirit of co-operation. There is much scope for co-operation in the areas within the remit of the Teaching Council and I know that both councils will approach this matter with the enthusiasm that has been the hallmark of previous endeavours in this field. I am aware that there has been ongoing contact between officials on both sides of the Border as proposals for both councils have developed. We look forward to continuing close contacts in the future.</P>
    <P>The initial stage in establishing the Teaching Council will be critical from the financial point of view. Until the first council is in place, it will not be possible to levy fees and, therefore, provide the necessary finance to fund the initial phase of establishment. In the interim, the start up costs will be provided from central funds. There are a number of reasons for this including that the Teaching Council will assume responsibility for a range of functions currently being performed by my Department. In particular, the work now being done by the registration council will be transferred to the Teaching Council. The Teaching Council will provide a range of advisory services and expertise to my Department and it will provide a significant contribution towards continually monitoring the quality of education. In recognition of these services, it is appropriate that the Government, through my Department, signals its support for the work of the Teaching Council by financing its activities through this critical early period of development. Section 21 provides for this funding.</P>
    <P>The steering committee, which was representative of all the partners in education, recommended the payment of a membership fee by all new applicants for registration. It also recommended that the fee should be waived for the first year of registration in the case of existing teachers who qualify for registration with the council. Section 23 allows the council to set and charge fees. During the course of the debate in the other House, I introduced an amendment to ensure that members of the council are indemnified against any legal action taken as a result of actions or decisions of the Teaching Council.</P>
    <P>The high quality of the teaching profession has been a theme in my remarks. The profession has traditionally attracted personnel of a consistently high calibre and I am sure that the provisions of the Bill will go a long way towards ensuring this continues. The Teaching Council will be central to the development of the teaching profession in the future. Through the council, teaching will mature as a profession and reach a new stage in its development. The development to this point of the proposals for the Teaching Council has taken place in close co-operation with those for <Col N="247" /> whom it will be most immediately relevant, teachers themselves. I look forward to continuing to work closely with teachers and the other partners in education as together we move to establish a Teaching Council.</P>
    <P>This debate marks another significant step towards the establishment of the council. There was a useful debate in the other House and I look forward to this continuing in the House and to hearing the contributions of Senators. I assure the House that I will constructively respond to the points raised. This important Bill deserves our support and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and this debate, but it is unfortunate that there has been such a long delay in introducing the Bill. An undertaking was given that the Teaching Council would be established at the beginning of 2000. The timetable set out in the report of the steering committee indicated that it is was intended to publish the Bill in November 1998 so it is almost two and a half years overdue. There has been consultation with the education partners, including teachers, parents and managers, in preparation for the Bill and the end product is a fair representation of the issues and concerns that were raised during that process.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to promote teaching as a profession, to promote the professional development of teachers, to maintain and improve the quality of teaching, to provide for the establishment of standards, policies and procedures for the education and training of teachers and other matters relating to teachers and the teaching profession, to promote the registration and regulation of teachers and to enhance professional standards and competence and, for these purposes, to establish a council. The establishment of such a council is long overdue but it is welcome.</P>
      <P>The concept of the Teaching Council is all embracing, but I hope it is not aspirational on the part of the Government. I hope the Minister and the Government are fully committed to the Bill because it took over two and a half years to introduce it. There is no specific financial commitment in the legislation towards the council and I am concerned by the Minister's comments about the levelling of fees. I ask him to elaborate on this aspect in his reply in terms of what fees will be levied and on whom and where the money will be generated. I assumed the money would come from the Central Fund and the Department of Education and Science because the council will provide a service to the Department, the teaching profession and pupils. I ask the Minister to explain the lack of financial commitment in the Bill and the reference to the levelling of fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultation process was excellent, but it will come to nought if teachers are frustrated because their remuneration and working conditions are inadequate. There are clear indica<Col N="248" /> tions of that in the recent actions of the ASTI and it is imperative that it does not continue. The current situation must be resolved to the satisfaction of the teaching profession and I appeal to the Minister to bear this in mind. Each side playing semantics or trying to secure a political win is not in the best interests of the teaching profession or education in the long term. The central issue that should be considered is education in its finest sense and its impact on future generations and, in turn, the economy in terms of the type of nation Ireland becomes. This matter should not be viewed in terms of trying to secure a political win by either side. It is much more important than that and this should be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>Proper facilities and proper remuneration for teachers are basic elements and it is important that focus is not lost in that regard. If that happened, the country will lose. Successive Ministers have spoken about our fine education system and it has been held up as a flagship in terms of the country's current prosperity. It has been claimed that if the population was not as educated, the economy would not be as successful. The availability of young educated people meant Ireland was in a position to develop its flourishing economy.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a start in the right direction. Fine Gael believes that every child has a legal right to the best possible education and there should be an educational plan overseen by an ombudsman for children with the authority to see that the resources and facilities, to meet their educational requirements, are provided. To achieve this the educational system must be radically overhauled. We have deluded ourselves for years that we have a wonderful system in terms of world standards. It is a good system for those who are bright, articulate, who have a supportive home background and who have parents in a position to assist them. Such children are in a position to avail of this one-chance system and can be successful. However, there are thousands of other children and young people whose future is quite dim because there is no involvement, deep frustration and personal under achievement due to the lack of facilities and, at primary level, the lack of resource and remedial teachers. There have been huge advances in recent years in terms of the number of such teachers, but there are still many children who require this facility. I urge the Minister to make children who have learning difficulties a priority and to continue to put in resource teachers and remedial teachers where they are required.</P>
    <P>A system that is starved of resources, seriously lacking in facilities and driven by a profession that is acutely disappointed, under remunerated and unable to achieve the heights of its potential is one that is not working satisfactorily. This Bill is only one element of what is required. Its range and remit are unclear in many respects and ill defined in others. If the system is to perform to <Col N="249" /> the highest standards, in the interests of all pupils, it must be driven by a profession that has standards, that rewards performance. That has to be paid for. The Minister recognises that and should take account of it in assessing his Estimates for the coming year. There is deep unrest in teaching, there is annoyance and profound frustration reflected in the recent ASTI dispute and in the industrial action that was taken. It is not just about pay, it is about professional requirements and facilities to allow people to reach their capacity and achieve their professional potential.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not state clearly what responsibilities are to be removed from the Department of Education and Science and transferred to the Teaching Council, nor does it state what impact the Teaching Council will have on teacher training. It does not define clearly what the implications will be of complaints to the council where dismissals or allegations are made. It does not allow for the appointment of principals to the council from second level schools, even though these very people are ultimately responsible for the induction, probation and monitoring of teachers into the profession at that level. I want to see a teaching profession, in all categories, that is highly motivated, driven, well resourced and financed, and able to build on its professional call to provide every child with an educational plan to reach his or her ultimate level of achievement. Currently, there are a number of children who are not so doing because of hiccups along the way but I have seen cases where resource teachers and remedial teachers have been brought in resulting in outstanding success in bringing children back into the regular stream. That is something I ask the Minister to give priority to.</P>
    <P>As a former teacher, I have regular contact with teachers, unions and various relevant organisations. It is very hard to see great surpluses emanating from the Department of Finance, while some educational establishments are so under resourced with such poor facilities in the 21st century. It is amazing but that is how it is. The Department of Education and Science knows about it and should begin to focus on securing the necessary finance to radically overhaul these areas. A profession that is highly motivated will automatically attract people, but that will only happen if proper facilities are put in place. It is important that the Teaching Council establishes clear standards and is in a position to negotiate on behalf of teachers to secure what they require. Teachers will repay that with high performance, motivation, standards and aspirations.</P>
    <P>Our former spokesperson on education, Deputy Enda Kenny, was strongly in favour of sabbaticals for teachers. That is very important because year by year there is increasing pressure on teachers. Everybody seems to be so knowledgeable about everything. Parents are highly concerned about the future of their children and the education they get, but equally there is a sense that more responsibility is being handed <Col N="250" /> over to teachers in that children are allowed to express themselves more vociferously and frankly than traditionally which puts certain stresses and strains on teachers. Leave of absence and sabbaticals are important to allow teachers to recharge their batteries so that they can return renewed and reinvigorated. In Canada they have a system whereby every six or seven years teachers may take a sabbatical on full pay, to which they have contributed. They can take educational courses and can be credited incrementally. They can then decide if they wish to return to the profession of teaching.</P>
    <P>Teachers should be invited to this House on an ongoing basis to find out exactly how the political system works, how legislation goes through the House, how laws are enacted and what impact they have. They could then go back to their schools in a position to teach that. Everything is interdependent and interrelated.</P>
    <P>Many principals are appointed for the duration of their working life. Like county managers or secretaries general of Departments, these jobs are very pressurised and hugely demanding. Larger schools make major demands of the individual and the possibility of the principal's term running for seven years, perhaps renewable for three if desired, should be examined. The principal might then step aside, while maintaining their principal's allowance, staying within the profession but no longer having the same onerous responsibilities. Serious consideration should be given to such a system. Many primary and secondary teachers arrived, some time ago, at an understanding that teaching is not what they want, but career breaks and other options which are currently available are not sufficiently broad or flexible to cater to them. The Teaching Council, as distinct from the teachers' unions, should ensure that this profession can stand on any platform and attract bright, young, intelligent and articulate people who will want to give of their expertise to produce students who will be a credit to their country.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that we have almost 2,000 untrained teachers in the primary system. This is totally unsatisfactory. I know of one principal who closed his school and refused to have classes taken in his school by an untrained teacher. Until he got a fully trained teacher to do substitute work he did not open the school. He felt there was a need for certain standards and he was not prepared to tolerate anything less than the highest standards in his school. There is also a need for consistency, in that you cannot have teachers jumping in and out too often. There are cases where that is happening and it has to do with the pressure and the stress factor. It is not good for the pupils and the issue must be addressed by the Teaching Council.  </P>
    <P>The fact that there are 2,000 untrained teachers in the primary schools system is also having an effect on the secondary schools system. The situation is most unsatisfactory and must be addressed. <Col N="251" /> I appeal to the Minister to look at this matter very seriously. Sabbaticals, leave of absence and opportunities to do other courses can help, as can the training and appointment of more teachers. However, the basic issue should be addressed, in view of the potentially detrimental effect on the teaching profession.</P>
    <P>In the case of certain specific second level subjects, notably physics and science, it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure teachers. Consequently, the number of schools providing a range of science subjects is decreasing. That is not a good development and it needs to be watched closely. In our present vibrant economy, the monetary attractions are far more lucrative in industry and other sectors. The Department of Education and Science has to address the fundamental issue of competing in that situation.</P>
    <P>I agree with much of the Minister's speech. He referred to the complaints procedure and the committees which the Teaching Council could establish to assist and advise the council or to perform any function of the council. He particularly mentioned the investigating committee and the disciplinary committee and how they would operate, including adjudicating on complaints where it is alleged that teachers have failed to meet acceptable standards of practice. My experience in Clare County Council's review of its county development plan indicates that clear definition is very important when functions are being handed over to another body. It is essential to provide a clear definition of what constitutes acceptable standards of practice so that the committees will have specific guidelines within which to operate. Otherwise, the term could be open to varying subjective interpretations. I urge the Minister to consider that matter carefully.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's confirmation that the rights of all concerned will be protected and that due process will be observed. The new Teaching Council should not bring any additional pressures on teachers but should be a supportive influence. Teachers are already under great pressure. Parents are becoming increasingly more demanding and have higher expectations for their children. A balanced approach is needed in the interaction between parents' councils, teachers and children.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to Ireland's international obligations as a member of the European Union, including access for qualified teachers from other EU countries. That is a commendable development, provided, of course, such teachers comply with our standards. The Ceard Teastas Gaeilge has always, in my view, been a discriminatory factor in the vocational education sector and should be abolished. It does nothing to enhance the Irish language. Indeed, it can be seen as a negative, obstructive and exclusive feature.</P>
    <P>In relation to funding, the Minister said that, until the first council is in place, it will not be possible to levy fees and therefore the necessary <Col N="252" /> finance is being provided to fund the initial phase of establishment. I ask the Minister to elaborate on the provision for levying fees and the question of who is to pay. I thought the Minister would be so pleased with the establishment of this council that he would also provide adequate funding for its operation.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom fíor caoin fáilte a chur roimh an Aire go dtí an tSeanad agus fáilte do chur roimh an mBille seo. I also thank Senator Ormonde for giving me her allocated time this afternoon, which facilitates me in other commitments.</P>
      <P>I greatly welcome this Bill. It has been a long time in gestation, having been mooted in 1991. It is almost three years since a steering committee was set up. Clearly, nothing is being rushed upon us. However, there is a fortuitous aspect to the timing of this Bill to enable the Teaching Council to be established. I have no desire to revisit the issue of the ASTI's industrial action, except to put a few comments on record. In common with other Senators, I recognised that teachers had a legitimate right to an increase in salary. Such an increase was well earned, well deserved and, indeed, overdue.</P>
      <P>While I had absolutely no doubts in that regard, I had the most profound concerns about the manner in which that claim was pursued, as a result of which we are left with a very sour after-taste. It is not in the best interest of children, teachers or parents that such sourness would be allowed to fester. Nor is it in the best interest of education, or of the community, that the respect in which teachers have been traditionally held would be eroded on any long-term basis. For that reason, among others, I am very pleased that the Teaching Council is now in the process of being established. It will give a new forum and a new focus to all engaged in education. Perhaps, after all, the timing is both ripe and right.</P>
      <P>This Bill will support teachers and parents. It will garner once again the type of confidence which our educational system always enjoyed. Teachers will now have an independent, statutory Teaching Council which will put them on a par, as a professional body, with doctors, who have access to a medical council; nurses, who have access to their professional body, and other professions who already enjoy a similar facility. That should give great grounds for optimism to teachers and to all of us who value education and its practitioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the remit of the council will be to protect and promote the status of teachers in society, to enhance the status of the teaching profession and to promote the professional development of teachers. All that is timely and most welcome. Teachers will now be in a position to regulate their own affairs and to take responsibility for the development and maintenance of standards and qualities in education. The council will provide a long overdue forum for addressing a number of <Col N="253" /> grievances, defects and deficiencies which have become apparent in recent years.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Bill is good for teachers is a key reason for welcoming it. It is also very good for parents. They did not have a forum to raise or pursue an issue. If they had a grievance, they did not have a forum through which to advance that grievance in an open and transparent way. That mechanism will be in place in the context of the teaching council. The Bill is, therefore, encouragement to parents to engage more constructively in the education of children and the enhancement of education in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Part of the irritation felt by some students and parents stems from the fact that there are bad teachers in the system. We had better be honest and admit that openly. To seek to deny it is about as valid as seeking to deny that smuggling does not bedevil the food and agriculture industries. There are bad teachers and, prior to this, it was very difficult and almost impossible to find a mechanism whereby the issue of such teachers could be addressed. Simply put, the mechanism did not exist. There is a mechanism in the context of the Bill which will be fair and which will act without prejudice to teachers, pupils, students, parents, the community or the Government, which is the paymaster. The system is in place in the context of the Bill. I welcome the establishment of the investigating committee and disciplinary committee.</P>
    <P>Having read in detail sections 42, 43 and 44, the balance is right and due process will always be present to protect the teacher and a system will exist to protect pupils. The damage done to young people and their prospects by bad teachers is very difficult to quantify. I do not relish having to say this because I was a teacher and a member of the ASTI for almost 25 years. In fairness to everyone and to the priorities we must have within the system of education, there is a grave need to put this system in place to enable us, without prejudice to either party, to deal with this issue. That will happen and I welcome a system which will enable it to happen. For that reason also I support the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters I wish to mention. There are a number of issues in respect of education which we sought to have debated in the House in recent months but we thought it was better judgment to seek to delay any discussion on education until certain events were sorted out. One of the issues on which I requested a debate was the Cromien report on the Department of Education and Science. We are now putting in place a system which will enhance the professional development of teachers and their status as persons in the community. To enable us make a reality of that, we need to introduce other changes without delay parallel with the introduction of this teaching council.</P>
    <P>I especially want debated in the House the recommendations of the Cromien report on the Department. It is frustrating for teachers and <Col N="254" /> principals who are innovative and creative thinkers, who see the need for change and who want to progress it to find themselves in their efforts to do so hitting a stone wall. As someone said to me recently, taking from a poem by Brendan Kennelly, it is like water encountering a rock. If there are rocks within An Roinn Oideachais agus Eolaíochta, they will have to be removed. If we are to underpin a modern and progressive system of education in Ireland which responds speedily to all changes which need to be introduced, we must have a Department of Education and Science which is responsive, efficient and quick to embrace change where it is proved to be constructive.</P>
    <P>When Easter has passed and the Minister has an opportunity, perhaps he will return to the House to enable us debate the report in a calm and rational way and to ensure any legitimate changes advocated in the context of the report are enacted sooner rather than later. There is much in education which is static and does not welcome change because it is afraid of it. There are many practitioners in education who want to bring about change and we must seek to ensure that any roadblocks in their way are removed.</P>
    <P>The issue of teacher education merits a full debate but I will touch on it briefly here. Teacher education and pre-service and in-service professional development are central to the objectives of the Bill. I listened to someone talking recently about the world of tomorrow, and teachers are nothing if they do not prepare young people to have control over their lives in the world of tomorrow. This person referred specifically to the world of work. This very advanced thinker told his audience that 20% of the jobs which will be on offer 20 years from now have not yet been invented. How do we educate people to make their way purposefully in that type of rapidly changing world and how can the system of education and teachers anticipate its demands? It raises the question of how we educate the next generation.</P>
    <P>We know for certain that, as well as passing on a body of knowledge &ndash; and it is the obligation of every professional to pass on a body of knowledge and a value system &ndash; we must seek to put in place a generation of young people who are learners, who can learn new skills and who are open to being and have the capacity to be lifelong learners. If they are to embrace the challenges of the world of tomorrow, they must not be people whose education finishes at the door of the school or the university. They must be people who have the capacity to be lifelong learners. When brain power is the intellectual capital of the world of the 21st century, we must instil into all teaching practices the skills of learning, critical evaluation and examining situations critically as they arise. People tell me they want young people who can work in a team, make decisions, think critically on the implications of an issue and, having done that, make decisions. This places a huge burden <Col N="255" /> on teachers to prepare for this type of world. How can they prepare for it if it is not central to their teacher education?</P>
    <P>We must examine teacher education to see how innovative and progressive it is and how aware are those who offer education to teachers of all these factors in a rapidly changing and already vastly changed world. There are those who say &ndash; they may be right &ndash; that our system of teacher education has not kept pace with all the changes and that teachers who should be the agents of constructive change very often are not. That should be debated as a stand-alone issue at another time. However, we have to take it on board in the context of the Teaching Council because if we are to develop this kind of professionalism, central to that must be a system of pre-career and in-service training for teachers. New insights are emerging all the time as to how learning happens. We have insights now that were not available to me when, many moons ago, I undertook to do teacher education and teacher training, and these insights have to be incorporated into teacher education and training.</P>
    <P>The teachers of tomorrow will have to deal with the challenges that exist in society. Children come into the classroom who are the victims of drugs, drink and domestic violence. They are victims of the turmoil in society. Teachers have to deal with them and they need to be well prepared and to have all the expertise they possibly can at their fingertips to enable them to deal effectively and constructively with those children because they have the same right to a standard of education as any other child. In many cases they have demands above and beyond other children given that demands that are not met in the home often have to be compensated for by teachers. That requires a particularly good investment in teacher education.</P>
    <P>I listened recently to somebody talking about education in tomorrow's world. He made a strong case for allocating about 10% of the budget for primary education, where the foundations are laid, to the professional development of teachers and he said that this should be an ongoing feature of the system. He saw this as a basis for changing all education. I agree with that. We have made extremely poor provision here for in-service education of teachers. If there is a change in the curriculum, teachers can avail of in-service days, but in-service training ought to be an ongoing in-built feature of education.</P>
    <P>The composition of the council is fair. However, since the steering committee was set up, school principals have organised themselves in a much more systematic way than they did in the past. Principals are a force for school management. We are dependent on them to ensure that certain standards are put in place and maintained and monitored within schools. We are dependent on them to drive the constructive changes that we need in education today and encourage teachers <Col N="256" /> to constantly update and upgrade their skills. We are dependent on them to ensure that all the objectives of this Teaching Council Bill are met. I ask the Minister to have another look at the possibility of including a representative of the principals on this 37-member council.</P>
    <P>Let me tell one story before I finish. A friend of mine in Cork has a daughter who teaches French in a second level school in a city, not Cork. She got her class and started to teach them. They were doing the pass course. After a few months she realised that a number of them had the ability and the capacity to take the honours course. She decided she would offer them the honours course and spoke to the principal about it. The principal's response was that they had never done the honours course in the school, that nobody had ever been interested in taking honours French and that it would be of no benefit to them later. If that is the attitude of even one principal, it is detrimental to what the Minister and all of us here want the system of education to deliver to all students, irrespective of where they live. If there was no other reason, this is reason enough for engaging principals on this council because they are very well positioned to drive change and to be the agents of change. I ask the Minister to consider that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not take the 20 minutes allocated to me because I speak as a non-professional in this area. Having listened to two or three professionals, I know this will not be easy. However, I have some experience in education, apart from being a parent of five children, as a result of having been asked to act as chairman of the steering committee of the leaving certificate applied under the auspices of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. I learned a great deal about education in my four or five years in that capacity. I learned particularly about the gaps that occur in education, about the huge regard in which individuals involved in education are held and about what they were able to achieve at various levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To a certain extent I speak without authority. Others were able to speak with far more authority, being closer to the issue. However, I speak with some experience of what the leaving certificate applied aimed to achieve and what it actually achieved. The most important thing I learned is that education can be measured in different ways. The traditional leaving certificate measures in a very limited way, that is, it measures one's ability on the basis of a three-hour test after two years of training. It is usually a written test only and there is a certain amount of oral examination in languages. I realised that it did not necessarily identify skills, talents, abilities and, even less, the seven different intelligences that Howard Gardner talks of or the nine different intelligences that Charles Handy speaks of. These include intelligences such as the ability to communicate in spoken rather than in written terms. <Col N="257" /> The identification of that by Ministers and by the Department of Education and Science, and their ability to do something about it, excited me in prospect and I know it will go from success to success in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It is a significant step forward in recognising the deepening professionalism in teaching. I take this opportunity to call for a fundamental revamping of our whole system of education. The time has come for all the partners in education to sit down together and take a long hard look at the systems and structures we use and have used for many years to run education here. Our existing way of running education has outlived its usefulness. It is becoming more dysfunctional with each year that passes. We have to find a way of getting around that. When the current disputes on teachers' pay have been resolved, as they eventually will be, the tendency will be for everybody concerned with education to heave a sigh of relief and to cod themselves into thinking that they have put things right. However, they will be wrong in thinking that way because only the symptoms will have been addressed and the disease itself will have been left untouched.</P>
    <P>I first became aware that there was something radically wrong with the system of education when I became involved in the leaving certificate applied during the five years from 1993 to 1998. During that time I got a ringside view of how our system worked. While I admired many of the people involved, I was appalled at how the system worked. It was a system that, from top to bottom, was chronically starved of resources. The educational infrastructure was gravely damaged by the cutbacks of the 1980s. I am talking about the period from 1993 to 1998. The brunt of those cutbacks in the 1980s fell on the infrastructure of the educational system because the strength of the teachers' unions managed to preserve the salary element of spending.</P>
    <P>Second, I saw a system that was reeling under the impact of successive waves of unplanned and under-resourced change that had occurred in those years. The Department of Education and Science seemed to be prolific when it came to dreaming up changes but the task of implementing the changes was left to schools. There seemed to be a serious lack of understanding between the Department and schools about the practical implementation of changes the Department had suggested.</P>
    <P>Third, I saw a system that suffered from a hostile and adversarial regime of industrial relations. From my years in business I have learned that it takes two sides to create an industrial dispute. A sector with bad industrial relations is usually one with a long history of failed relationships. Each new dispute is a raking over of old coals which have been kept alive over the years by successive confrontations. That occurs in industry, business and education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> Fourth, I saw no recognition anywhere in the education system of a need for radical change. Part of this inertia was born out of a conviction that we have one of the best education systems in the world. We hear this mantra all the time but believing it leads one to think that all that is needed is to tinker around the edges of the old system instead of questioning whether the methodology is correct in the first place. We have been tinkering around the edges a great deal and the result is an education system that is slowly being run into the ground.</P>
    <P>By way of example, I will take four straws in the wind. First, we have a serious literacy problem which until recently we refused to believe existed. Second, we have a totally unacceptable level of completion in secondary education. We aim at a 90% completion rate for the leaving certificate, yet we end up with only 80% or 81%. While our aim is that only one in ten students will never complete second level schooling, all we are achieving is that two in ten never complete it. Third, we have a third level system which is flagrantly discriminatory in the social and economic backgrounds of its student intake. We see that happening repeatedly, yet we are not getting to grips with it. Fourth, at all levels we have curricula and teaching methods which, despite the many changes in recent years &ndash; I have touched on some of them already &ndash; are still not geared to today's realities. They seem to be falling further behind as each year passes.</P>
    <P>I could cite further examples. During the current ASTI dispute we heard much about how teachers have lost status in the eyes of the community over the past 20 years, and I agree, but that loss of status is part of a wider loss for the educational system as a whole. Education has never been so important, yet in spite of that, its status has not reached or maintained the level at which it should be. Both at national level in terms of its impact on our economic development, which we recognise, and at an individual, personal level in terms of being the way for people to better themselves and realise their ambitions, education has not maintained that status. Never have we needed a first class educational system more than we do now because we have to grasp the opportunities that are there.</P>
    <P>There is a mismatch between that national requirement and expectation on the one hand and the system we have to fulfil that need and deliver that expectation on the other hand. We have not yet found the solution to that mismatch. Over the past few years I have noticed a growth in the recognition by those who run the country of the key place that education has played in our economic success and the role it will play in helping us to maintain that success. I have not noticed, however, a corresponding awareness of the need for change in that area. Nor have I noticed concern that the system that got us where we are today is no longer capable of performing that role in future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="259" /> The only ray of light I have seen in recent times was the internal report commissioned by the Department of Education and Science, which was leaked to the newspapers. That was the first hint of awareness that something was chronically wrong with the way we run the education system. That report could have been a flag for the various partners in education to rally round in demanding change. Unfortunately, however, it appears to have become buried in the heat of more immediate battles that have occurred in recent weeks. When those battles are over and forgotten, the systematic problems will continue to exist unless we do something about them. If we fail to address those problems promptly and fail to recognise the need to rebuild our education system from the ground upwards, we will surely be sowing the seeds of future disaster. That is the message we need to listen to and do something about. The wave we are riding on now depends crucially on having the right education system. The evidence points to serious shortcomings in the current system.</P>
    <P>Last year I met a Japanese businessman whom I admired a great deal. I asked him how he had achieved such success and after thinking it over for a while, he replied: &ldquo;Whether you believe you can, or whether you believe you can't, you're right.&rdquo;  It is a lovely quote. He went on to say: &ldquo;If you go into a football game or a golf match and say &lsquo;We haven't a chance against that lot', you won't succeed, but if you go in there determined to succeed, determined that you can actually win, you can succeed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill not just for what it sets out to do, but also because it gives us the opportunity to make those changes that are challenging us in the education system at the moment. It is up to us to make sure we accept this opportunity to grapple with those changes and achieve the success that the country deserves.</P>

      <P>Tá fáilte roimh an mBille seo atá os cómhair an tSeanaid inniú. I congratulate the Minister on introducing this legislation. As others have stated, it has arisen as a result of a process of consultation and deliberation which began two or three years ago. The idea of a teaching council first came about as a result of an OECD report, which reviewed Irish education, and the 1992 Green Paper on Education. The partners in education, including teachers, parents and students, have for many years been advocating the establishment of a teaching council. The council will have a major role in recognising the contribution of teachers as professionals who possess the knowledge and expertise, not only to shape the future of their profession but also to contribute effectively to the future direction of education policy. The council will be on a par with the Medical Council which has been very successful, as well as with a similar council for the nursing profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="260" /> The Bill is being introduced at a time of deep unrest within the teaching profession regarding the pay and conditions of work. As I have said many times in this House, I support the teachers in their claim for an increase in salary and a review of their conditions. Hopefully the result of the ballot will be favourable to allow that process to start immediately so that teachers will be put on a par with equivalents in the public service and in the private sector.</P>
    <P>The council will also help professionally trained people achieve their full professional potential. It is important that teachers, pupils, parents and the country as a whole will reflect their views through the Teaching Council. That will enhance the status and morale of teachers and will give a quality of education which we have questioned heretofore. It will ensure high standards of teachers, professional qualifications and competence.</P>
    <P>A professional council charged with maintaining and delivering standards is a natural part of the maturing of any profession. It will enable them to regulate their own affairs and empower them with greater responsibility for the standards and quality of education. The council will be an independent statutory agency. It will be the voice of teachers on educational matters and it will perform the functions through which teachers can achieve a large degree of self-autonomy and self-regulation.</P>
    <P>This council will have the responsibility to draw up a professional code of conduct, in other words, a statement of professionalism agreed by all teachers. It will also give teachers a sense of their own identity and a place in society. The new concept of enhancing and promoting the profession of teaching, raising public awareness of the way teachers work and the environment in which they work, the changing and increasingly complex nature of society, community and school settings and the changing pattern of life will mean that the council will have to recognise that the role of teachers will have to adapt to meet those changes. If they are to continue to provide a first class education for their students, teachers must also recognise and acknowledge that the teacher's authority in the classroom today has been undermined and that the respect for the status of the teacher has declined. The Teaching Council will have to give special attention to this problem to ensure that the high standards and quality of service will be maintained and that quality remains the hallmark of the teaching profession.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the function regarding promoting teaching as a profession and compiling a register of teachers in relation to their background of educational qualifications, the way the register will be established, their fitness to teach, the probation period and the reviewing and accrediting of teacher training programmes.</P>
    <P>I foresee difficulties in assessing and accrediting teacher training programmes. How <Col N="261" /> will that work in practice? What procedures will take place to do that? Take the example of a young graduate with a BA, science or commerce degree and a higher diploma in education. It is difficult to assess teacher training in this area for second level teaching. The only means of assessment is through the higher diploma and I question whether that is an adequate way to proceed. With changes in society new programmes have been introduced and different forms of learning are taking place but there will be discipline problems. How can a young teacher with no experience walk into a classroom with discipline problems? How will he or she handle classroom situations? Will the Teaching Council examine that aspect? It is sometimes said that a good teacher can fail before they start. These questions are pertinent to that aspect of teacher training.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that recognition will be given to qualifications of teachers trained outside Ireland. We all know of cases where teachers from another jurisdiction had to sit qualifying examinations and the process of written and oral Irish examinations in order to teach. In the past that would have taken many years to process. The establishment of the council will ensure that the teachers of Ireland, North and South, will be more in touch now and that there will be better co-operation as a result of the work of the joint working groups and the Ministerial Council since the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his sensitivity in the selection of membership. The fact that the council will have 37 members, mainly represented by teachers, will create confidence in the teaching profession as a whole and will play a key role in the development of the profession.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the council will advise him on the standards for entry into programmes of teacher training and teacher supply. That will be a very onerous task. How will that procedure work in practice? Will it affect the points system at entry to university? I understand the points system is dictated by supply and demand. It is difficult to know if a teacher will work well at second level before they are actually employed in the system; I made that point earlier. That might be easier in the teacher training colleges at primary level. While I welcome the teacher involvement in assessment of courses and having an input into policy, I am a little apprehensive about how it will work.</P>
    <P>Over the years the teaching profession has served the State and the people well. We had and have outstanding teachers who cared and continue to care for their pupils beyond the call of duty. Pupils have received an education that has helped them to deal with life experiences but some teachers have become frustrated with the system and the way school management works. They are frustrated by the lack of promotional opportunities within the school and the way posts are allocated. As we all know, there are personality clashes between principals and members of <Col N="262" /> the staff for no reason other than they have a different stand on issues and, very often, management is not good at handling those situations.</P>
    <P>We all know of good teachers who, for whatever reason, have spent their whole lives teaching but who would not merit a post of responsibility. That is very demoralising. Some teachers suffer from burn-out, which is happening more frequently because of a breakdown of discipline in our schools. The lack of special needs teachers is making the teachers' work more demanding. The teacher today is not only an educator but a social worker, counsellor, parent, administrator, fund raiser and disciplinarian. I am speaking from experience of working within the system.</P>
    <P>Under the functions outlined in section 7 of the Bill, there is a role for the Teaching Council to examine the fitness of a teacher to operate within the school context, taking into account that teachers are employed as teachers, not as administrators, social workers, fund-raisers or those who deal with the community at large. Otherwise, we have to redefine the role of teachers employed by the Department of Education and how their roles have changed in conjunction with changes in society.</P>
    <P>One must look closely at why it is becoming more difficult for a teacher to carry out his or her duties. While it may be said that this has to do with the management structure within the school, this is not always the case, depending on the personalities of the senior administrative staff. Will the council look at the role of principals and their lengths of service, which can now be reviewed every seven years? Not only should we look at how we can enhance the profession of teachers, but at how demanding their jobs have become and acknowledge that good teachers can be destroyed by the kinds of administrations in their schools.</P>
    <P>There should also be more opportunities for teachers to take career breaks. Young people starting out on a career today are not expected to stay in the same school and staff-room for the rest of their lives. All the research on career changes and patterns indicates that one's professional style changes every seven years, whether in teaching, medicine or law. With time, changes inevitably occur. I say to the Teaching Council that opportunities will come, given that the majority of its members are teachers, relating to the development of the profession in such a way that young people who want to remain in it can do so by moving out into other areas of education, not necessarily moving up the ranks in their own schools. I would love to see this developing as many teachers leave the profession because they cannot cope in their particular school because of personality clashes or they have reached their peaks in the particular kinds of work they are doing.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the Teaching Council, an opportunity exists to address the problem <Col N="263" /> of fitness to teach. This cannot be assessed until one actually teaches. A register of qualifications and strengths is not sufficient because a young graduate has no teaching experience. How can it be ascertained whether a graduate will be a good teacher? For example, one could have a fantastic science teacher who would be deplorable at an interview because their subject matter does not require linguistic expertise and eloquence. A graduate with a BA in English would fare much better because he would be better at putting his thoughts together and articulating his point of view. Our approach to assessing what makes a good teacher is not necessarily the best way forward, and the Teaching Council should examine this.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken of setting up committees. Section 24 of the Bill provides that the council &ldquo;may&rdquo; establish committees to assist in its work. Then it says that it &ldquo;will&rdquo; establish committees. I am confused by the terms &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;will&rdquo;. I can understand the need for the executive committee, which is necessary to deal with the day-to-day activities of the council. The other two committees are the discipline committee and the investigative committee, but I have grave concerns about the latter. While I welcome the decision that the majority of its members will be teachers, this will require very sensitive handling in terms of assessing complaints, knowing that only the Lord himself could cope with some of the classroom situations with which teachers are confronted.</P>
    <P>Teachers will be the key people in handling complaints &ndash; I do not know how this will work. We will have to be broad-minded in our thinking on social and familial changes and the role of parents in assessing results, discipline and the function of the teacher. The Minister will realise that this is a huge task. I am being a devil's advocate. The Teacher's Council is a wonderful idea, but I am raising some issues on which the Minister, in his reply, will have to reassure me.</P>
    <P>Too often, teachers are blamed for every social ill that arises because there is a lack of understanding of the stresses that teachers endure in carrying out their duties. Although this may be a school management problem concerning a failure to devise a code of discipline, an investigative committee needs to have expertise in handling such a sensitive area. The members need to be clear on procedures and set them out in advance.</P>
    <P>What role will the union have when an investigation takes place? I see in the explanatory memorandum that a distinction has been drawn between the role of the unions and the role of the council. However, there should be an overlap here when handling complaints. The work of the two bodies should complement each other &ndash; and this is great in theory &ndash; but I have seen how the unions get involved when complaints are lodged and this often causes conflict. From my being in the teaching profession and dealing with staff-<Col N="264" /> room problems, I know the council will work well in theory, but how it will work on the ground is a different matter.</P>
    <P>I like the idea of compiling a register of teachers and the manner in which this will take place. Teachers will be delighted with this aspect of the council, for which I thank the Minister. It will greatly enhance the role of teachers and improve their status and morale. I would be delighted if the Teaching Council could make teachers leaders in the community, as they once were.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him and the Minister, Deputy Woods, for bringing forward this important and relevant legislation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Teaching Council Bill, 2000, which will address, in a practical way, a number of key issues <i>vis-à-vis </i>the work in which teachers engage. As the Minister indicated, the Bill was introduced following widespread consultation with the partners in education &ndash; teachers, parents and managers. A crucial element of the legislation is the fact that the council will be a completely independent statutory agency and its key focus will be to oversee teacher education programmes and ensure public satisfaction with the level and quality of the educational services provided.</P>
      <P>In recent months there has been a great deal of public debate on serious educational issues which arose as a result of the ASTI's industrial action. Thankfully, the Bill draws our attention back to an examination of first principles and asks what are the best teacher qualifications, what are the best ongoing evaluation processes for teachers and how the obligations of teachers can be integrated with the needs of the public. The proposed Teaching Council will give a significant degree of professional independence and self-regulation to teachers. At a time when they are probably at their lowest ebb in terms of morale, the council will provide teachers with a much needed boost.</P>
      <P>We live in a world that is changing rapidly. The expectations of parents and students and the demands they are placing on teachers are increasingly complex in nature. Consequently, the demands teachers place on themselves to meet the higher expectations of parents and students are leading to the creation of tension between the two groups. I hope the council will deal with the tensions that exist. I have no doubt it will do so because it will bring together those who will be in a position to identify people's needs and, perhaps, reach agreement on the best way to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A vital aspect of the Bill is that it will not impinge on the normal negotiating structures of the teacher trade unions in terms of the way they deal with conditions of employment, salaries, the day to day operation of schools etc. The Teaching Council, which will be broad-based but at the same time focused in outlook, will, I hope, concentrate on the evaluation, integration and con<Col N="265" /> stant upgrading and updating of professional qualifications within the various teaching professions.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers indicated their perceptions of what will be the functions of the Teaching Council. In my opinion the review and accreditation of programmes for teacher education and training, the arrangements for registration and induction, the process of evaluation of teachers on probation and a transparent system to equate teacher qualifications with those in other jurisdictions are probably the key elements of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope the council, when established, will move quickly to address the issue of teacher qualifications. It is long past time that a reasonable standard format for the education and training of teachers working at all levels of the education system should have been introduced. It is not appropriate that remarkably different practices continue to obtain in respect of the education and practical training of primary and secondary school teachers. The demands of a generation of students raised in a multimedia age are different from the demands of a generation who listened to the radio for entertainment and attended the cinema once a week.</P>
    <P>There is now a demand for an enormous variety in the content of educational programmes and for the imparting of a broad range of interpersonal skills by teachers in both the technical and technological areas. I hope the Teaching Council will delineate a standard form of core teaching for teachers at all levels of the education system which will incorporate different modules for teachers who work in particular areas and who have specific needs. Such an arrangement would be of major benefit in conferring on all teachers the necessary core knowledge they require in ensuring that they have ample practical experience in the classroom before they are confirmed as fully approved professionals.</P>
    <P>The Teaching Council will have its work cut out, particularly if it is to properly review and accredit the wide range of programmes required to meet modern teachers' educational and training requirements. It is important that best practices from other jurisdictions are evaluated and, if feasible, taken on board to enhance the modern Irish teacher's classroom armoury. The council will have a major role to play in ensuring that best practice is observed in terms of class content, delivery and follow-up action.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Teaching Council will give Ireland a great opportunity to assess, integrate and experiment with new content and new teaching materials and approaches to allow teachers to impart their key message, which forms the core of any good education system. It will be an immense power for good in the education system in the 21st century. I hope it will take its place beside the introduction of free second level education and the establishment of the colleges <Col N="266" /> of technology as one of the most important developments in education.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on the wide remit given to the council. I look forward to its establishment and to its doing great work in helping supply a new and better education service for a new and modern nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. It is widely appreciated that this is an important Bill and that the Teaching Council will play a valuable role in terms of emphasising the professionalism of the teaching profession. In my opinion the council will come to be seen as being at the forefront of developments in teaching.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I attended an OECD meeting of Ministers from 41 nations at which was discussed education, the profession of teaching, the changes that are taking place and the challenges to be faced. It is extraordinary that many of the difficulties we are experiencing here are also being experienced in other countries, precisely because things are changing. Senators Quinn and Quill stated that changes are occurring at a rapid rate and will continue to do so. However, the figure to which Senator Quill referred, namely, that 20% of the jobs that will be on offer 20 years from now have not yet been invented, is an underestimate. The pace of change is so rapid that the figure will be well above 20%. However, Senator Quill also pointed out that we must prepare people involved in education to meet the changes to which I refer. Some of us will not be involved in bringing about those changes and we will be obliged to watch from the sidelines as the younger generation strives to deal with their effects. It is clear that students graduating from our colleges &ndash; in saying this, I accept there are a number of problems with which we must deal &ndash; compare very favourably, in terms of their performance, with their counterparts in other countries, particularly those in the developed world.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the comments made by Senator Taylor-Quinn, a former teacher. I was also a teacher for a relatively short period before becoming involved in research, but I eventually fell into bad company and became a politician.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulties could arise in the early stages and my Department will cover that.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn mentioned teachers' frustration not only about money but also about their position in society. That is changing. This Bill will help in that regard because it will emphasise and continue to promote the status of teachers and their professional position.</P>
      <P>The Senator also mentioned in-service training. There has been a substantial increase in in-service training and in the uptake among teachers, which is greater than people realise. We are working to complete 26 education centres which will be built and paid for by my Department but run by the teachers. They are deeply involved in and enthusiastic about this development. They will choose what courses should be run in them. I have opened a number of them throughout the country and it has been an experience. That is where one sees their professionalism and their views on training and their future prospects. They have plenty of innovative ideas and they are looking for ways to express them.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn referred to Canada and sabbaticals. She started to say that teachers should contribute towards that &ndash; she is right &ndash; but then she changed her mind fairly quickly when she realised it would be better not to elaborate on it.  </P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking to the Canadian Minister yesterday at the OECD conference who told me this is a system in Canada. Teachers contribute approximately 20% of the cost. It is an interesting and responsible way of doing it. That will be a matter for discussion with the teaching council in terms of future development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator also mentioned the number of untrained teachers who are substitutes in the system. A parliamentary question on that subject was tabled recently. Many of these substitutes are not untrained but they were teachers before the new degrees were introduced. They are generally older teachers but many of them were good teachers. A breakdown of the numbers was given <Col N="268" /> in the parliamentary question but I do not have that information with me. The question of full recognition for teachers has gone through different phases and developments and we have been expanding that recognition. I know a parliamentary question was tabled recently about the numbers and there were categories within those numbers. A few of those categories referred to teachers who were good teachers in their own right. While they might have had a degree, they did not have the proper qualifications. We are doing conversion courses but they take approximately 18 months and some people may not be able to avail of the opportunity. We will reconsider that in the context of this legislation because it is an important issue.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to a seven year contract for principals. I do not know how well that proposal would be received. We have a difficulty at primary level in that more than 50% of schools are two teacher schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That could be considered in relation to the larger schools in the future. I began to wonder if Senator Taylor-Quinn was talking to some of the Ministers at the OECD conference, particularly when she mentioned the vibrant economy and the well paid jobs in comparison to teachers who often find the outside world more financially attractive. That is one of the issues we are now trying to face. The PPF recognised that for the first time. Benchmarking might not have been the happiest title but it was an important development because it recognised that elements in the private sector were moving ahead quickly, particularly in terms of jobs for graduates.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will also take the Leas-Chathaoirleach's advice. While Senator Ormonde welcomed the Bill, she also spoke about the need to acknowledge the difficult role of teachers and to address issues in teacher training. We are awaiting the reports of two expert groups which are considering any necessary changes to teacher training in the context of new teaching methods, new curricula and a changed society. These reports will enable us to redesign pre-service training to ensure that all new teachers will receive a comprehensive and high quality period of preparation. The Bill now provides that the council will undertake the role of teacher training review into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="269" /> Senator Ormonde was concerned about the role of the council in relation to complaints procedures. The Bill gives the council responsibility to examine and investigate breaches of discipline by teachers. This will be carried out by the investigation and disciplinary committees with recourse to the High Court, as I mentioned in my speech. I reassure the Senator that in any such process the teachers will be fully entitled to call on their own trade unions to represent them during that process if they wish to do that. These would be the exceptional cases.</P>
    <P>Senator Quill, who reminded us that she was a teacher for 25 years, felt teachers had a legitimate right to an increase. She also expressed concern about the methods used. We have methods and systems for dealing with such issues. The Labour Court has clearly indicated what is possible and has said what Senator Quill, other Senators and I have said. I want teachers to be appropriately and well paid for the job they do, which is important. I hope they use the existing mechanisms at this stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Quill called for a debate on the Cromien report after Easter. I would be happy to have such a debate. I asked Mr. Cromien to carry out the investigation and he has done a good job. We will follow through on that. The point made on teacher education was 20% of jobs in 20 years.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn is concerned at the rapid pace of change but he does not fully appreciate the extent of the differentiation taking place within the teaching body. There many different kinds of courses. There is a separate new national qualifications authority to deal with the different courses and ensure that standards are maintained. That is the right way to proceed. It is coming because there are so many different kinds of courses being introduced. Teachers can only handle a certain amount of change at a time no matter how it is introduced because they are doing a good job where they are. We cannot throw that out because of change. We have got to build on that, train people and accommodate change. There is a lot of change coming and I would like things to move faster. We hope that this professional body will indicate ways ahead and give teachers an opportunity to participate in that. We are moving to a better situation.</P>
    <P>The Senator also mentioned disadvantage and the problems of people getting to third level. We are working on those. Probably for the first time we are putting a lot of money into those problems, but they will not be solved overnight. They are deep problems that often go back to childhood. He indicated that himself in talking about the problem of literacy. We are starting at nine months old in the most recent programme. It is a big problem that we are giving attention to. In simple terms, we have had 10% of children leaving primary school from the 1970s to today with learning difficulties. We are breaking that down <Col N="270" /> into its parts and putting investment into it. Disability also needs more attention.</P>
    <P>Senator Kett emphasised the importance of professional standards, best practice and new teaching approaches. That is all part of the Teaching Council's work.</P>
    <P>The Senators understand what we are trying to do. They realise the importance of the council. I thank them for that and the comments made here, as well as for taking the Bill this afternoon. I am anxious to get this body up and running. Several people said that this has been in train since 1991. That is so, but let us get on and do it now. I am like that &ndash; I do not sit around, I do something. I thank the Senators for their co-operation.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's being in the House to address this issue and the time given to me to raise an issue of concern to the residents in Castledermot. Scoil Dhiarmada was established at its current site in 1952. It has a record of excellence in the service it delivers to its catchment area. Over the decades, it served the primary education needs of its small village and rural hinterland in a part of Kildare where the population trends were static or downward. Recently, Castledermot emerged as a commuter town for workers in nearby Carlow. The County Kildare development plan, which seeks to control the county's spiralling population, has as its core strategy a commitment to redirect two thirds of the population growth towards the centre and the south of the county.</P>
      <P>This has major implications for Castledermot, the largest population centre in the county's southernmost tip. Its population grew steadily in the 1970s, peaking in 1981 with 805 persons, but by 1996 it had fallen back to 733. The 1999 county development plan sets a target population for the town in 2006 of 2,150 people, a 200% increase. Reaching this target requires the building of 500 additional housing units with a consequential impact on Scoil Dhiarmada. In addition to the growth of the town, significant once off housing was built in the rural hinterland with some housing clusters in surrounding hamlets.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="271" /> It is, therefore, obvious that with the population growth, action is required on the accommodation at the school. There is no possibility of extending the existing school as it is located on a postage stamp site adjacent to a national secondary with heavy traffic. The existing building is inadequate in many respects and its classrooms, although well maintained, are too small to meet current standards. Its play area is inadequate and because of the proximity of the road requires close supervision. Credit is due to the principal, Mr. Brendan Dunne, and his six teaching staff for running an excellent school for 211 pupils in such adverse circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science accepts the need to provide a new school on a green field site and that it should have up to 16 classrooms. A suitable site is on offer at Woodlands, Castledermot. I urge the Minister, whose presence I appreciate, to proceed immediately with the acquisition of the site or any other suitable site.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Senator gives me the opportunity to outline to the House my Department's position on the provision of accommodation at Castledermot national school. The <Col N="272" /> school has a principal, six assistant teachers and a shared remedial teacher. The enrolment at 30 September 2000 was 211. Its present facilities consist of seven classrooms with limited ancillary accommodation on a 1.25 acre site.</P>
      <P>Its long-term needs were assessed and my Department is satisfied that additional accommodation is required to cater for a projected enrolment increase. However, because of the number of building projects being dealt with by my Department and the anticipated level of funding, it is not possible to provide a timescale for the provision of permanent accommodation. The matter will be kept under review.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, my Department is prepared to consider an application for provision of temporary accommodation to cater for the increased enrolment. Due to the number of applications for grant aid for capital works, delays in processing individual projects are inevitable.</P>
      <P>I assure the Senator that the project will proceed as quickly as possible, taking into account existing commitments and priorities. My Department is committed to the provision of improved accommodation at Castledermot and I thank him again for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position to the House.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 3.40 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 10 April 2001.</P>
