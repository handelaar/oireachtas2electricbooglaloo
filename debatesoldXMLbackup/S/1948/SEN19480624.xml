    <Title>Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Bill, 1948. (Certified Money Bill)&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Col N="113" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Minister for Defence (Dr. O'Higgins) Thomas Francis (Jnr.) O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Dr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Fortunately, this is a very short and a very simple Bill.  Originally, a Bill was passed to give pensions to members of the Irish Volunteers, the Citizen Army, Cumann na mBan, Fianna Éireann and other bodies; and in that Bill it was laid down that there would be a reduction of their pension, of approximately 20 per cent., for every £100 they drew out of public funds by way of pay, wages, pension, or any other form of allowance out of public funds.  At a later date, it was decided to extend the same Bill to cover the Connaught Rangers and the same scale of abatement applied.</P>
      <P>Two years ago, a Bill was introduced and passed into law to alter the scales of abatement of pension, so that so much would not be subtracted from the pension.  When that was being done, there was a mistake or omission and that particular amending Bill did not extend to the Connaught Rangers. Therefore, the Connaught Rangers pensioners are still suffering under the heavy disability of the original scale of abatement.  This Bill is to alter that and equate them with other pensioners.  It will be retrospective in effect, as it will apply from the same date as the Act of 1945 applied to the others.  It is not a very expensive Bill.  The retrospective cost is, I think, £162 and the new imposition on the taxpayer will be something around £50 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I may be permitted to refer to the question of abatement generally, as I am concerned not so much with what is in the Bill in relation to the Connaught Rangers as with what I feel should be done regarding abatement generally. To make a comparison, if a person is employed by a quarry owner and is a pensioner&mdash;whether under the Connaught Rangers Act or any of the other Acts that provide for pensions of one kind or another subject to abatement&mdash;he gets his full pay from the quarry owner and his full pension as provided in the Schedules to those various Acts.  If, however, he happens to be working for the county council, he suffers an abatement.  I cannot see the principle on which abatement is provided for in relation to the pension <Col N="114" /> because the recipient is employed by the State or by a local authority, in other words, paid out of public funds, where it does not affect the other workers, his colleagues, working for an employer.</P>
      <P>The Connaught Rangers Act, 1936, awarded a pension to the men who joined the mutiny in June and July, 1920, and who were sentenced to death or to a period of jail not less than 12 months.  For a private soldier, the rate of pension was 2/7½ per day or 18/4½ a week&mdash;that is, those who had more than 12 months' service with the British Forces at the time.  If they had less than 12 months, they were entitled to a gratuity, which finished their claims.  This Section 18 was inserted for the purpose of reducing the pension which was then payable under an Act, if they were in receipt of wage or salary out of public funds.  Where the salary or remuneration did not exceed £100, the cut was 5 per cent.; it then proceeded up to 30 per cent. in the case of a person with £250 pension&mdash;I imagine they were very few with a pension of £250&mdash;and if they had £150 the abatement was equal to 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>This Bill makes an alteration, to this extent, that a person with £5 a week pension&mdash;if there are any; I do not suppose there are&mdash;will suffer an abatement of 10 per cent., equal to 1/10½ per day.  The old rate of abatement was 40 per cent., or 7/4 a day.  In other words, this means that the man who was getting 11/- pension heretofore will now get 16/6, but there will be very few of that category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a number of people including the Connaught Rangers affected by this Bill and, of course, a number of other people entitled to pensions who are affected by this abatement.  I would like the Minister to consider the position generally, to see whether legislation could not be introduced for the purpose of abolishing this abatement altogether.  I do not think it will cost very much.  I think it was mentioned by the Minister in the Dáil that the total cost would be about £28,000 a year.  That is a sum which will become gradually less.  These men are all getting older; very few of them are under 60 years of age and none of them <Col N="115" /> is under 50.  The sum involved will grow less by about £1,000 each year and in 28 years from now there will be none of these pensions.  The Minister might consider whether it is not opportune to get rid of these abatements altogether, so that a man who is employed by the county council or by the State should enjoy the same rate of remuneration, plus his pension, as if he were employed by Córas Iompair Éireann, by the Electricity Supply Board or any other private employer.</P>
    <P>There is really no logical basis for these deductions and I gather from what the Minister said in the Dáil that he himself is not too keen on the present arrangement.  I would, therefore, urge that he might take a very early opportunity of reviewing the situation generally, to see whether these anomalies could not be removed completely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Bill and, speaking for people on this side of the House, I think I am right in saying that everybody is wholeheartedly in sympathy with the motive behind this measure.  We all appreciate the contribution made by the Connaught Rangers towards the achievement of such freedom as we have already gained in this part of the country.  We believe that anything that could be done for those people should be done.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the statement made by Senator Duffy, I think it is only right to say that, as the years go by, the numbers are becoming less&mdash;and the same thing applies to the Old I.R.A. The idea behind this measure is to level things up and put them on the same basis of pension as the Old I.R.A.  The numbers are becoming smaller every day and anyone who has kept tab on it must be aware of the fact that practically every day of the week one prominent Old I.R.A. man is passing out. It is only the prominent ones who are mentioned in the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be several men who were not so prominent, either at that time or now, who were equally good, or perhaps better, men.  Anything that can be done for these men&mdash;including all branches mentioned by the Minister <Col N="116" /> as well as the Connaught Rangers&mdash; should be done.  I would like the Minister to look into the matter, in the spirit in which I am sure he will look into it, that is, that the value of the £ has become far less than it was at the time those pensions were granted. These men, diminishing in numbers, are reaching the evening of their lives and while a certain value may have been put on their pensions at the time they were granted, that value has decreased very considerably, and the Minister should look into the position and see if anything could be done to increase the rate of pensions all round, whether by the method set out in the Bill or in some other way, so as to enable these men who made sacrifices in the past to live in at least reasonable comfort for the few years left to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill and I should like to say I appreciate very much the Minister's gesture in making the Bill retrospective.  I felt that possibly an injustice might be done to these men by reason of the fact that they were forgotten, that they would have to pay for that now.  It is a very fine gesture on the Minister's part.  I support also Senator Duffy's plea. Unfortunately, the great majority of the people who fought in the Old I.R.A. and in the 1916 period were men of no property and many of them had subsequently to depend on the Government for employment.  Many of them, as a result, found themselves in Government employment.  I spoke on this matter in this House before when the previous pensions Bill was being debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have in this House men who suffered a serious deduction from their pensions while members of the Seanad. Their salary was not affected and I make that point now, as I made it then. I feel that it is rather niggardly to give men pensions and then to deduct from these pensions the salary or wage they get because they had to depend on the Government or local bodies for employment. I have had experience of men sweeping the streets with lowly wages who suffered a 20 per cent. cut. This Bill and the previous Bill will obviate that, but I should like the Minister <Col N="117" /> to take cognisance of what Senator Duffy has said with regard to considering the question of these abatements, with a view to their abolition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the Bill.  The Minister said that, when the Bill to give the same facilities to those in receipt of Old I.R.A. pensions and various other pensions for services renered in the fight for freedom was introduced, the Connaught Rangers were omitted.  I do not think that is entirely correct.  My reading of the situation is that the Bill making the provision referred to, the first Bill, introduced in respect of services rendered by the Connaught Rangers, was a separate Bill and therefore a proposal to give the facilities we are now giving to the Connaught Rangers would necessitate the introduction of a separate Bill as this is, a Bill to amend the original Connaught Rangers Bill.  I draw the Minister's attention to that fact, lest any misunderstanding should arise out of the Minister's statement that the Connaught Rangers were omitted or forgotten, when the previous Bill giving concessions was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusOFarrell" hpid="Mr. S. O'Farrell Mr. S. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the abatement of pensions is a bad principle. No man or woman should get a pension unless he or she has earned it, and, if he or she has earned it, it is nobody's right to deduct anything from that pension.  Senator Duffy pointed out that, if a pensioner gets employment with a private employer, no deduction is made, and public bodies should be under the same obligation to allow a man to retain the pension which, presumably, he has earned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter which has not been raised yet on which I should like to comment.  Senator Quirke referred to the now almost unknown heroes of our time, but a great many now living have forgotten all about the Connaught Rangers and their mutiny. The Connaught Rangers, in my opinion, did a braver thing than anybody in this country when they mutinied.  They took a risk far greater than the majority of people in this country ever faced or had to face.  No doubt, they would have faced it if they had had to do so, but the circumstances were different.  These <Col N="118" /> plain soldiers of a British regiment risked their lives, thousands of miles away from their own homes, not knowing whether they would ever be heard of again and not caring if anyone would pity them or raise a voice in support of their dependents.</P>
    <P>Ninety men were put on trial and 61 were sentenced.  I assume that these 61 men all got pensions, but there were 29 suspected and arrested men, who for one reason or another, were not imprisoned, except for a short period. They were a month or two in jail on dry bread and black tea.  They were confined for 23 hours a day and finally kicked out of the regiment with ignominy, receiving neither pensions nor anything else, except a ticket to their own homes.  They came back to Ireland and a few of them are still living, but they were nobody's children when they returned.  The Sailors' and Soldiers' Trust and other organisations set up to look after the welfare of ex-British soldiers would not touch them with a forty-foot pole and nobody raised a hand for them since.  They were deprived of their rights when they came back and they got employment neither with public bodies nor with anybody else.  Because they happened not to be imprisoned, they were forgotten and debarred.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is too late now for anybody to make a plea for them.  We cannot pension or compensate the few who remain, but if I do nothing more than put on record that this country owes as great a debt to the men who did not get pensions as it does to the men who did, I shall have done something. The same thing applies here in our country.  I know people who have risen to great prominence for no other reason than that they were in jail, while people who were not in jail did far more for the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When I referred to this Bill in relation to the Bill of 1945 as being an omission, I had no intention, good, bad or indifferent, of misrepresenting the situation or misleading the House.  The fact of the matter is that the two Bills originally were separate.  One of them was amended three years ago and the other was not amended.  It would be unfair if I made <Col N="119" /> the suggestion that there was any deliberate intention of not doing justice to the Connaught Rangers.  I thought the fairest way to put it, the way which was accepted by Deputy Traynor in the Dáil, was that it was an omission.  I believe that is the fact and the omission is being rectified by agreement between all parties.</P>
      <P>With regard to representations made from all sides on the question of doing away with this system of deductions from pensions, so far as any of these representations are made to me as an individual, Senators are pushing an open door; but I am slowly learning to differentiate between myself as an individual and myself as the political head of a Department, and, in the latter capacity, I am learning that it is wise to be cautious and not to commit myself too far, but I can assure the Seanad that the representations made all round are very welcome and will receive very full consideration.  I will see that they are conveyed further.</P>
      <P>There is a point about this whole matter of reducing pensions.  It has a history in itself.  The original Military Service Pensions Bill was introduced very shortly after the establishment of the State and those who had given service would, in the ordinary course of events, be queueing up in great numbers for public employment of one kind or another.  This system of deductions from pensions was adopted in order to reduce the length of the queue.  It has ling since ceased to have any function in that direction.  It has fully served its usefulness in that direction and I would agree with those Senators who have spoken that there is a very sound case for reconsideration of the whole question and I will see that the views of Senators are conveyed to the Government generally.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Agreed to take remaining stages today.</P>
      <P>Bill passed through Committee, without recommendation; received for final consideration; and ordered to be returned to the Dáil.</P>

      <Col N="120" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the Finance Bill for the year 1948.  Its main purpose is to give effect to the Financial Resolutions already passed by the Dáil following the Budget.  In the Finance Bill in any year, it is customary to take advantage of the situation to tidy up any outstanding matters which may require attention and in this Bill there are three matters to which I should refer. Senators will find, as an attachment to the first section, an agreement with regard to income-tax.  It was made by my predecessor in office and it has been operated, so to speak, and we are confirming it.  It is a matter of extreme difficulty to explain, and, if any explanation is called for, Senators might advise me as to what their difficulties are, so that I can get them considered in case any point would require elucidation on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Sections 11 and 12 raise two other matters.  Section 11 is a clause exempting from stamp duty certain documents which otherwise would be subject to stamp duty.  Where the Minister on behalf of the State takes over property, it is thought proper that the stamp duty ordinarily leviable on these documents should be remitted because it only means a transfer of money from one pocket to another.  The duty will be paid; it will be taken out of the Contingency Fund, and eventually repaid. Section 12 deals with a small matter.  It has been usual to have customs bonds in respect of traffic which may eventually be shipped as stores or transported out of the country by sea. The bonds on these which are ordinarily taken are free from stamp duty and it is proposed to enlarge this provision so as to cover a similar type of goods transported by air.  The exemption so far has been in relation to traffic by sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rest of the Bill follows the usual lines and Senators will be aware of the effect of the various sections.  The first section is the ordinary income-tax section, and, so far as this year is concerned, it includes the 6d. which was <Col N="121" /> foreshadowed by my predecessor.  Last autumn, he gave notice that this 6d. would come on this year and I am accepting his view that 6d. should be added to the rate levied during the year.  Sections 3 and 4 provide for increased duties on what is described as hydro-carbon oil.  The first section, in fact, deals with petrol, the second with diesel oil.  An increased charge of 5d. a gallon is being made in respect of these but the two sections between them are expected to yield something short of £1,000,000 in this year&mdash; £910,000.  The two sections represent the only major tax which the Budget referred to and which is being imposed this year.</P>
    <P>Section 5 reduces the duty on wine. These duties were doubled in the autumn of last year and the effects of the doubling was to lose revenue.  It is not a very usual situation, but it is one in which I find myself, that by reducing rates of duty I hope to get an increase in revenue of about £250,000 this year. Sections 6, 7 and 8 are sections confirming resolutions already made under a particular Act.  These Orders had the effect of reducing the new taxes levied last autumn on beer, both customs and excise, and on tobacco. The effect of these three sections is to reduce the taxation imposed last year by £6,000,000.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is a formal section which enables a licensing provision to be attached to imports of sugar confectionery. There is a power to exempt which is taken in respect of most articles.  We are only applying the general law now to sugar confectionery. What is here being done by Section 9 has already been done by an Emergency Powers Order which is being repealed and being replaced by what is contained in Section 9.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is the entertainment duty section and it provides that the scales for entertainment duty in force prior to the autumn Budget are re-introduced as from the 15th April, 1948, and the provisions of the old orders regarding the patent theatres are being continued. It was found, however, after the Budget of last year that considerable evasion was being practised in <Col N="122" /> order to get rid of the tax that was being then levied.  The old situation was that, if there was a show which was mainly or wholly personal, then there was remission of tax.  That loophole was availed of by those who desired to evade the very heavy increase that was made last autumn.  The situation was that where there was usually a two hours' performance of a cinema type, the house was opened two hours earlier than that again and for two hours and five minutes people were brought in to play a piano or an accordion or in various ways really to fill up two hours of time.  After that, the cinema, which was the real matter to which people were being invited to attend, started but, as there were two hours and five minutes of what was called personal performance, the tax was evaded.  In order to stop that type of evasion hereafter, Section 10 contains a provision that, except in the case of the patent theatres&mdash;and their situation is the same as before&mdash;except in their case, in order to get remission of duty the performance has to be not any longer wholly or mainly personal, but has to be wholly personal.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 12 I have already spoken of.  Section 13 enables certain moneys to be transferred from the Road Fund to the Exchequer.  This year it is proposed that the Exchequer would get about £300,000 for the purpose of meeting the general charges that fall on the Central Fund.  This tax was introduced last year.  It brought in £200,000 from the Road Fund to the Exchequer.  I am simply taking the same tax.  I get £300,000 this year because of the longer period over which the tax operates.</P>
    <P>Section 14 is the section which effects the restoration of the old rate of interest on Post Office Saving Bank deposits. The rate of interest was 2½ per cent. for amounts within a permitted limit of £2,000.  These rates were reduced at one time, bringing about a very definite tendency against saving in the country.  Savings, which had run to a very high rate for many years, ceased and, instead of that, there was such an encashment that there was a dissaving to a considerable extent in the first year in which the new interest <Col N="123" /> rates operated.  We believe we can get savings back to the normal point by bringing the interest rate back to the old point.  It is more than ever necessary in these days to have these savings so that there will not be so much free money around for spending in such a way that the costs of commodities might be put up.</P>
    <P>Section 15 is a very small matter but it has been decided to make the change this year.  The winding-up date of a fund called the Transition Development Fund has been fixed as at the 31st December of this year.  It is much more convenient for accounting purposes that the winding-up date of any fund of this type should coincide with the end of the financial year.  That change is effected by Section 15.</P>
    <P>Section 16 has a certain number of repeals.  They are all attached to the entertainment duty clause, excepting one, and it is rendered necessary by what has been achieved this year in connection with the raising of the interest rate on the deposits in the Post Office Saving Bank.</P>
    <P>Certain Orders have been referred to in Section 17.  These are the Orders which reduced the duties on beer and tobacco, and which give the licensing power.  These will now be replaced by the sections in the Finance Bill to which I have already referred.  The other sections are the usual formal sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is so closely related to the Budget and, as the Minister has pointed out, makes provision for his Budget proposals that, when one comes to discuss the Bill, one must refer to the provisions of the Budget.  When the Minister was introducing the Budget in the other House he said that there were various economies, both large and small, which had already been decided on and which would relieve the Budget to the extent of £2,509,000, and that the adjustments in subsidies would reduce the bill by £3,015,000.  He said, &ldquo;I am also taking account of further reductions in expenditure, totalling £1,000,000, which I am closely pursuing and confidently expecting that I will be able to capture&rdquo;. In that statement, the Minister <Col N="124" /> proclaims that by the adjustment in subsidies he has relieved taxation. Really what has been accomplished is to transfer the responsibility of meeting this £3,000,000 odd from the Central Fund to the consumer.</P>
      <P>The first great economy for which the Minister claims credit was in connection with hand-won turf production, to the extent of £1,200,000.  This economy was brought about by a decision of the Government to curtail the production of hand-won turf.  The reasons advanced for that decision were that we had already a considerable supply of turf and fuel on hands, that we had sufficient to cater for the City of Dublin, in particular, for a period of from six to 12 months, and some people went so far as to say two years.  In announcing the Order bringing to an end the production of hand-won turf, the Minister for Industry and Commerce laid blame at the door of the former Minister for having allowed such a supply of turf to accumulate. But if we cast our minds back to the period this time last year we find that on the 17th April, Deputy Morrissey, now Minister for Industry and Commerce, made the following statement in the Dáil:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister, in so far as he can, side by side with the maximum effort to produce the greatest amount of turf, side by side I think, is just taking the ordinary precautions to build up over this summer.  I know it is not the most suitable time for cutting timber.  I know that timber cut from now on to October will not be the best for burning but it is vital, in my opinion, that a big reserve of timber should be built up in the large centres of population.  Otherwise I am afraid that the situation next winter will be infinitely worse&mdash;and that is, God knows, bad enough&mdash; infinitely worse than it was in the winter just past.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the advice tendered to Mr. Lemass by the now Minister for Industry and Commerce this time last year. We had a discussion on the Finance Bill on the 17th June last year and Senator Baxter, who has a very wide knowledge of the difficulties of producing turf, also tendered the same advice. <Col N="125" /> Senator Baxter asked the Minister whether there was a full realisation of the importance of building up at least a year's supply of turf in advance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>A year's supply.  There is a great difference between that and three or four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator can convince me that there is three or four years' supply in the country, I will be very well satisfied and I hope this three or four years' supply of turf will present itself when the necessity or occasion demands it or when people may be looking for it this time next year.  When this scheme was withdrawn, the Government announced that they were making ample provision to find employment for those who would be unemployed as a result of its withdrawal.  What contribution have they made?  Let us examine the position in the counties which contributed the greatest share to fuel production&mdash; Galway, Mayo, Donegal and Kerry. The Galway County Council last year paid £116,000 for hand-produced turf. That was apart from the amount of turf produced by private individuals and family labour.  In order to find employment for the people engaged on hand-won turf, the Government have informed the Galway County Council, as they have informed the County Councils of Mayo and Donegal, that they are prepared now to make a grant of £20,000 to find employment for those who were originally engaged in hand-won turf production, on condition that the council would put up £6,000 in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the general election, many appeals were made to the people.  The most important and most widespread appeal made by all the Parties who are now forming the inter-Party Government was they would end unemployment. The only contribution, if it can be considered a contribution, that has been made so far is a very small grant of £20,000 to each of these county councils to provide employment for those who were originally engaged by the county councils on turf production. There is no provision in this Finance Bill to enable the county councils or any other organisation, as a result of Government action, to employ those <Col N="126" /> who were unemployed at the period of the election when so much regard for their welfare was expressed by all the other Parties.  We have seen in the latest returns&mdash;I am sure this proposal to drop hand-won turf has contributed to it&mdash;that there are 20,000 more people unemployed now than there were this time last year.  Apart from those who were engaged in actual turf production, there was another section of our people who performed very useful work during the emergency in hauling turf from the production areas to the cities of Dublin, Cork and elsewhere.  Many of these men put their life savings into the purchase of a lorry.  Many who did so served in the emergency services during the war.  All those lorries were purchased by these people mainly on the hire-purchase scheme and consequent on the action of the Government they suddenly find that their ways and means of employment and livelihood have been taken from them and that they are unable to pay the balance of the instalments due on those lorries.</P>
    <P>The people who advanced the money also find that as a result of Government action they are unable to collect the instalments due on the lorries and that if they collect the lorries they will be unable to dispose of them.  But they are an organised body; they are a body with some influence in the country, because it seems that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, by an Order, has saved these people the serious losses with which they were faced by permitting these lorries to be exported.  These were the lorries that were imported and bought for the purpose of carrying our produce from the country to the towns and cities.  This Order by the Minister will save those people who advanced the money for the purchase of the lorries a loss of about £1,500,000, but there is very little consideration given to the workers who were engaged in haulage and who earned their livelihood by it.  A sum of £20,000 spent in County Galway or Mayo providing work for these people who are engaged in turf production will not go far. When it is realised that the provision at the same time last year was £116,000 it will be seen how small is the amount of employment that can be given by <Col N="127" /> this sum of money to the people who were engaged in turf production.  Before I pass from the question of turf production there is just one question I would like to address to the Minister. We have heard various statements in connection with the dropping of the hand-won turf scheme, and I would like to get from the Minister the Government's attitude to this whole question of turf production.  Does the Government propose to give effect to the plans outlined in the White Paper on turf production issued in 1946 and, if so, what steps are being taken to implement these proposals?</P>
    <P>If the Minister replies to these questions he may satisfy a great many people who are interested in the future of turf production in this country and in the Government's policy in regard to it.  Now the Minister claims that he is saving by the adjustment of subsidies, a sum of £3,015,000.  But what position is being created by these adjustments?  In these £3,000,000 we find that there is £195,000 of subsidies withdrawn from those given heretofore on oatenmeal and margarine and as a result these commodities have risen in price, oatenmeal to 3/- per stone and margarine to 2/- per lb.  Can the Minister convince this House and convince me that by these adjustments, as he called them, which were accompanied by a rise in the prices of oatenmeal and margarine, the workers of this country are better off than they were before he introduced his Budget? Side by side with these adjustments there has been the withdrawal of £55,000 given in subsidy on farmers' butter.  What is the position as a result of the withdrawal of this subsidy? I have been up and down the country and I have seen farmers' wives coming into the markets and not being able to sell their butter.  In some cases they were willing to sell it at 1/8, 1/10 and 2/- a lb.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be very bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen farmers' butter advertised in the windows of grocery shops in this city and in the large towns throughout the country at <Col N="128" /> 3/- per lb., off the ration.  While we claim the credit for saving by adjustments, £3,000,000, we are depriving the farmer who is producing the butter of the price he had been getting, namely, 2/11 a lb., before the withdrawal of the subsidy.  Despite all our interest in the control of prices and despite all our appeals for a reduction in the cost of living we are allowing butter to be bought at 1/8 and 2/- a lb. and retailed here in the city and exported at anything from 3/- a lb. upwards.  Last year there was a motion in the other House on this question of butter production and on this question of farmers' butter, and it was held by the farmer Deputies that the price given by the then Minister, 2/11 per lb., was not sufficient to induce the farmer to produce more butter in the summer months so that the ration of butter might be increased for our people here at home.  Now we find that by saving this £15,000 the price of farmers' butter has increased for those who are in a position to buy it and it is denied by being off the ration, to these people not in a position to buy it at the high price.  At the same time it is being exported, I do not know at the moment, at what price.  The Minister also pointed out that he proposed to save £300,000 on the withdrawal of the subsidy on sugar and tea for manufacturing and catering purposes.</P>
      <P>I do not find any great fault in the proposal to have an increase in the price for catering establishments but I am sure the Minister and the House will agree that if you increase the price of raw materials for any article then you are contributing to an increase in the price of the finished article.  There are many articles of food in this country in which sugar is an important item in production, particularly jams.  Jams are used widely throughout the country particularly in large families where the present ration of butter is not sufficient. This action by the Minister in trying to save this money is going a long way towards increasing the cost of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that is all to the good.  The Minister for Social Welfare has also made a contribution to the reduction in the cost of living.  Provision had been made for the payment of £150,000 to public health authorities to recoup them for the money spent by them on vouchers for those in receipt of home assistance and other county assistance.  This payment has been withdrawn by the Minister for Social Welfare who promises that where the scheme is continued, 50 per cent. of its cost will be recouped from the central fund.  By this action he is placing on the local authorities of this country the responsibility of providing £75,000 for the maintenance of these social services to those in receipt of home assistance and other county assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Galway this will necessitate an additional 3d. in the £ on the rates.  Although every effort is being made to reduce the cost of living, so far as the ratepayers are concerned they will have to meet this increase. The Minister proposes to save £900,000 on cash supplementary allowances, unemployment insurance, widows' and orphans' pensions.  He will not get it all this year but he will get something like £500,000, but in order that the present benefits may be maintained it will mean an increase in the contributions payable by those who pay for national health, unemployment benefit and the other schemes mentioned.  It will involve increases in the contributions of from 3d. to 5d. per week on both workers and employers.  While 5d. per week may be considered a small amount it is, nevertheless, an increase in the weekly outlay of the worker and it will also mean an advance in the costs of production, because where an employer and a worker are compelled to contribute to any scheme the expense of it must be passed on to the consumer. There was something like £45,000 put into the widows' and orphans' fund anuually.  These moneys are being taken out of the fund that was provided <Col N="130" /> for social services by the previous Government.  Side by side with this the Minister claims credit for being generous enough to give £600,000 for increases in old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions and all the various other pensions.  He is taking £900,000 and £450,000 and giving back £600,000.  It is very easy, therefore, to see how the people will benefit by this manipulation of funds.</P>
    <P>We are told the old age pensions are to be increased but we must remember that last year provision was made to expend £2,500,000 on increased pensions for the old and the widows and orphans and so on.  The Minister is going to give £600,000 to increasing pensions this year.  If it is going to be brought into force in the near future that sum will only enable very small increases to be made, but if it is not going to be brought in till the end of the year then the Government may be able to give the increases that were decided on last year but they will only be able to give them for about three months.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that last year, taking the Budget and the Supplementary Budget, provision was made for £15,000,000 for food subsidies.  The largest item &mdash; £9,000,000 &mdash; was in respect of wheat and flour.  He is now proposing to bring about a change in the system with regard to these subsidies, so that he will save about £250,000 by extending the payment over a number of years.  Have we any guarantee that we are going to get wheat at the price that the Minister expects?  We all hope, if the Minister is so confident, that he will succeed. Other items of retrenchment in the Budget total £298,000.  These are in respect of the Board of Works, the Department of Education, the Turf Board and the Tourist Board.</P>
    <P>I assume the Minister does not propose to dismiss any of the staffs employed by these various organisations or to reduce the wages of any of their employees.  That being so, I must take it that the only way in which the saving can be brought about is by leaving in abeyance the works which these various boards had intended to go ahead with, such, for example, as <Col N="131" /> the building of schools by the Board of Works.  Of the total sum of £298,000 there is a sum of £28,000 in respect of the Department of Education.  Year after year, on the Finance Bill, we have heard in this House, from Senators who now sit on the opposite side, criticism, and in most cases just criticism, of the condition of our schools throughout the country.  We have seen reports from the county medical officers of health to the same effect.  We have also heard statements made about the condition of many of our public buildings and of the necessity for carrying out many schemes which the Board of Works had proposed to go ahead with.  I put it to the members of the House who support the present Government that, by supporting it and supporting this Bill, they are going to curtail the carrying out of the works which were in hands as well as the building of schools which they had agreed last year was so essential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister, when he is replying, explain where this £28,000 is going to be saved?  Is it on the building of vocational schools which we have been told so often are so essential to the development of our people.  I quite accept it that it would be foolish to stop work on a building that you had on hands.  What we want is an assurance that the plans and the programme that had been prepared are going to be put into effect and not left in abeyance in order that the Minister may be able to come to the House and tell us that, by doing so, the paltry sum of £28,000 has been saved.  Credit is also claimed in the Budget for a saving of £176,000 in the case of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I do not know whether that has any relation to the recent proposal to increase <Col N="132" /> the cost of postage.  I now find, from a slight examination of the matter, that the proposal to provide rural call offices is also being put in abeyance. I remember that, some months ago, when we were discussing a proposal here from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs every member of the House, no matter what side he sat on, put before the Minister the urgency of having a system of telephone call offices in every part of rural Ireland. Every Senator pointed to the necessity for that and the great benefit that such call offices would confer on the people in rural Ireland.  Now, we find that there is going to be a saving of £76,000 by putting that programme in abeyance.</P>
      <P>There is also the small sum of £10,000 which is being withdrawn from the scheme that made provision for farm workers to go to the Midlands.  As the members of the House know, complaints had been received that during the harvest months particularly, farmers in the Midlands and in other counties found it difficult to save their crops because of the scarcity of labour. The last Government introduced a scheme under which workers could be taken free of charge to employers to do work which was so essential in the national interest.  Now there is the proposal to save £10,000 on that scheme.  I have met people who availed of the scheme and were very appreciative of it.  In fact, some said they would be prepared to contribute themselves to the expense of taking workers from the various areas in order that the saving of their crops would be assured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tells us that under the Budget he is making a saving in the region of £6,000,000.  He is making that saving by a scheme of adjustments and, in most cases, on subsidies on food.  I am sure that the majority of Senators will agree that he is really only transferring the burden from one shoulder to another.  The burden will now have to be carried by those least able to bear it.  In my opinion, the Minister, by the action that he has taken by the withdrawal of subsidies, is going to increase the cost of living, and is going to encourage demands for <Col N="133" /> increases in wages.  Are we going to have a further rise in prices to be followed by further demands for wage increases?</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that in the Budget he is making little, if any, change in taxation.  He hopes that the increase in the income-tax rate will bring him, in this year, a sum of £670,000, and that the tax on petrol and oil will yield him £910,000.  I submit that this latter tax is going to contribute to an increase in the cost of living. It was pointed out in the Dáil that transport is essential to the life of the nation.  Petrol forms part of the raw material for transport, and so we may take it that following the tax on petrol and oil the cost of travelling as well as the cost of the delivery of goods throughout the country is going to go up.</P>
    <P>The Minister also claims credit, under the heading of savings, for the £85,000 which had been set aside for the mineral exploration of the country. It is not very long since the then Minister for Industry and Commerce was before this House with a Bill under which provision was made for an organisation to engage on this work.  I have looked over the debates that took place in this House on that Bill, and I find that every member of this House and of the other House agreed that we should take steps to discover what are the resources of the country and how they could be best developed, and that it would be well worth while spending not only £85,000 but a much larger sum for that purpose.</P>

      <P>I am sure Senator Duffy and the members of the Labour Party, in particular, must feel very proud that at the present time they <Col N="134" /> are supporting a Government which has brought about retrenchments of the kind that I have referred to.  I am sure that my colleague from Galway, Senator Burke, must feel very comfortable sitting here supporting a Government whose proposals have put so many people in his county on the unemployed list, people who were engaged at one time in production and in whom he was interested in seeing that they were properly paid for their services.  I am sure Senator Duffy is very proud to be associated with a Government which, for the small sums mentioned, brings about retrenchment resulting in so much unemployment at the present time.</P>
      <P>Senator Duffy interrupted me when I was referring to the proposal to abandon the £85,000 grant for the development of our mineral resources. I cannot understand the mentality of any person who is a representative of Labour and who is closely associated with Labour organisations, and who would agree that it is not the right national policy to develop our resources to the fullest and find employment for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a small sum. We made great progress during the war, when there were research councils set up here which did valuable work and contributed much to maintain the supplies of our people during those years.  Particularly we who were associated with the national movement in the past accepted as our gospel the gospel of Arthur Griffith, that it was the duty of our people to develop our own resources.  They did not go out to fight for political freedom alone. Political freedom was only a means to an end.  It was the gospel that we would develop to the fullest the resources of our country and find employment for our people, so as to put Ireland in its proper place.  I am surprised at the attitude of people like Senator Duffy who get so annoyed when reference is made to their association <Col N="135" /> with the withdrawal of these paltry sums provided by the last Government.</P>
      <P>We have heard very much in recent months about the cancellation, the dropping or selling out, of our air service. The Minister and his colleagues have spoken of the necessity to save dollars and find employment for our people at home, but what do we find? Having curtailed the turf production, they turn to the expenditure on development of our resources and then come to the air services.  We find the planes purchased by the previous Government, for dollars, being sold.  If it ended at that, if that was all it meant, if when those people go out of office it would be possible for those who come after them to undo the damage, it might not be so bad.  In many cases, however, it will be impossible to repair the damage.  Young men were taken from this country and sent out for training, coming back as trained personnel to establish for this country a transatlantic air service.  The planes were bought, but those men got their orders for dismissal and have had to find employment in foreign countries. The Tricolour that was painted on those planes has been removed and the flag of another country has taken its place.</P>
      <P>While we talk about getting dollars, exporting to America our manufactured goods in order to get dollars, or giving service to the American people to get dollars, this was one of the best ways, not only of getting dollars but of putting the name of Ireland before the people of America, as was so essential. The Minister and his colleagues say that the service was too costly and that the only reason Fianna Fáil proposed to have this service was that it would increase our prestige.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>If so, that is all the more reason why the service should be maintained.  I am sure that Senator Duffy, in his very brief statement on this Bill sometime before we conclude, will give us the reasons.</P>

      <P>We have seen these young men, who were trained at the expense of this country, now being forced to find employment with some other Government.  Not only that; young people here who may be airminded and who would get opportunities of training if we maintained this service, are compelled now to join other forces in some foreign country, to get the training being denied them by the present Government here at home.</P>
      <P>When we examine the supposed economy, we come down to the very hard fact that it is not really economy at all.  It is not economy to dismiss men and put them on the unemployed list.  You are economising if you are getting work done more efficiently than it was done in the past, but you are not economising when you find there are 20,000 more people unemployed today than there were this time 12 months ago.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister once more, as I asked him on another occasion, to give a definite statement of policy.  In relation to unemployment, is it the same policy as was put forward by him so many years ago, that it was not the duty of a Government to provide employment for its people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Government propose to implement the turf scheme outlined in the White Paper of 1946? It is extraordinary to see announcements in the Press from the Department of Industry and Commerce, that there is now available for those who wish to make application for it sufficient sugar for home-made jam-making and that there is sufficient for the manufacturers and caterers throughout the country&mdash;at an increased price.  Is there that store of sugar here in this country, that we can afford to give it to any person who goes to his merchant and just asks for a certain quantity of sugar for jam-making? Under the Order, he will get <Col N="137" /> it on payment of 7½d. per 1b.  If the Minister was fair to the people, would he not have increased the ration to the people as a whole?  I know that the Minister's reply to that will be that that would entail a further subsidy from him and that he would lose the £300,000 which he is saving here.</P>
      <P>I think it most unfair that one section of the people should be denied what they are justly entitled to, that is, a fair share of what is going.  If we have sufficient sugar to give increased allowances to catering establishments or manufacturers, before doing that, I suggest that the present ration should be increased, regardless of the saving of a paltry sum of £300,000.  The Minister has already informed me that it is not correct to say that the price of sugar to manufacturers has been increased. Then the increase is only to catering establishments, but, whatever it may be, he estimates to save £300,000 and, by doing so, he is depriving the people of what they could very well do with.  The same applies to tea and I would make a special plea to the Minister for an increase in the ration of tea to old people.  If we have sufficient tea to increase the ration to hotels and catering establishments, we should be in a position to give an increased allowance to that section of the people who would appreciate it most, the old people.  Last year and on other occasions many of us made a special appeal to the Minister for Finance&mdash; not very effectively but we did at least join our voices with those of other people&mdash;on behalf of a section of the people who have not got what I consider is a fair or just deal up to this, State pensioners, such as teachers. The time has come now, seeing that we have saved so many million pounds in a very short time, to give them the increase which every other section of the community has got.</P>

      <P>As the Minister and the last speaker pointed out, the Bill before us contains little, if anything, <Col N="138" /> that is not necessary to implement the Budget and there is nothing easier to criticise than a Budget.  There never was a Budget that satisfied everybody. Perhaps I should have said that there never was a Budget which wholly satisfied anyone, even its author.  But I have a great deal of sympathy with the last speaker.  He was one of the most loyal members supporting the last Government and one of the most effective speakers for his Party under normal conditions.  But I never saw him speaking under more difficult conditions, and whereas normally it is most easy to criticise a Budget, it is extremely difficult to criticise a Budget which is largely based on plans, or on a certain amount of misplanning, of the Government which one previously supported.  I do not propose to follow him in detail.  He told us a number of things which I did not know before, and I doubt if I know them correctly yet, because I think he was inaccurate in several respects; but as I have not got data and have no staff behind me, I can only say that I was puzzled by several of his remarks.  Possibly the Minister will be able to deal with them.</P>
      <P>A very large proportion of the people I meet in business and elsewhere are, unlike the Senator, not much interested in Party politics and as far as I can judge the general opinion of these people is that the Minister for Finance faced up to a very difficult situation with courage and imagination, and that, taken as a whole, the Budget received very general approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Optimists&mdash;there were quite a few of them&mdash;hoped that the new Government would repeal all the taxes imposed by their predecessors in the autumn including the extra 6d. on income-tax.  Pessimists, seeing the figures published in the newspapers, thought that a large number of new taxes would be inevitable. The majority, who are neither optimists nor pessimists, were relieved to learn that the only new tax was 5d. on petrol.  I do not like this increase any more than I imagine the Minister does.  I am glad that he has been able to make a substantial concession to agriculture, and I hope that in next year's Budget he will find it possible to reduce this tax.  In view of the extensive use of petrol in the distribution of <Col N="139" /> goods I consider that 2/9 a gallon is too high a price.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill provides an opportunity for this House to consider general financial policy.  The annual Budget in every country must be taken as a whole and the Government must stand or fall on it.  Only minor changes can be made in a Finance Bill, and it has always seemed to me that when discussing the Finance Bill the Seanad should deal with general principles rather than with less important details in the hope that the views expressed may influence the Ministers and bear fruit in the following year.</P>
    <P>I propose to deal with one aspect of general financial policy which the Minister has indicated that he has under consideration and which he may possibly deal with next year.  I refer to the important though decidedly controversial question of the taxation of trading profits.  There has been a good deal of somewhat wild talk on the question of profiteering during the past few years.  Some of it has been justified by the facts and much of it has not. Many people believe that the Minister accused trade and industry generally of gross profiteering and that he threatened to reimpose the excess corporation profits tax invented by his predecessors and to make it retrospective in effect if certain things did not happen during 1948.  Anyone who read his speech in reply to the debate in the Dáil will know that in fact he said nothing of the kind.  He made it perfectly clear that he recognised that the standard set by the old excess corporation profits tax was a fictitious one&mdash; that it did not prevent excessive profits in certain cases and that it was an unfair handicap to new enterprises. He made it equally clear that if he decided to introduce a profits tax next year it would not be an excess profits tax but a tax devised to cut deeper into excessive profits.</P>
    <P>I would ask members of the House to read the paragraph in the Minister's speech which deals with this matter. The reference is Dáil Reports, Vol. 110, No. 15, col. 2121, and I would ask them to give this as much publicity as possible. I would also ask the Minister to repeat the statement which he then <Col N="140" /> made and hope, if he does so, that the newspapers will report it.  None of the leading newspapers published in Dublin reported that portion of his speech and, in my opinion, a great deal of harm was done by this omission.  A wrong impression has been created which may act as a deterrent on plans for new development.</P>
    <P>A company which did not take excessive profits before the war and therefore had a low standard would hesitate before risking heavy expenditure on new development if it believed that the Government was even considering the reimposition of the excess corporation profits tax in anything like its old form. On more than one occasion I have given my considered opinion that the old excess corporation profits tax was a bad tax&mdash;unfair and inequitable in operation, hastily devised in the entirely false hope that it would keep prices down.  It never was a genuine tax on profiteering&mdash;it encouraged rather than prevented high profits and high costs of production.  As the Minister has made it perfectly clear that he does not propose to reintroduce this tax I need not take up the time of the House in giving further reasons why I consider that this tax should never again be reimposed.</P>
    <P>The Minister was by no means so clear in his speech as to the means by which he considers that profits should be used in order to reduce prices.  I take it that what he really desires is that associations representing industrialists and traders should consult with him and endeavour to co-operate in his efforts to reduce prices.  I hope that they will do so fully, frankly and as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is of the opinion that companies which have built up reserves should not distribute them but should hold them in order to meet the situation which will be created by falling prices or, alternatively, should use them to purchase new machinery which will reduce production costs&mdash;then I entirely agree with him.  If, on the other hand, he thinks&mdash;as some people say he does&mdash;that traders who were allowed to make huge profits during the emergency should now use those profits to sell at or below cost in order <Col N="141" /> to make trading difficult or impossible for other traders&mdash;mostly smaller concerns&mdash;who did not make excessive profits, then I profoundly disagree with him.</P>
    <P>That profiteering took place during the emergency is well known and will not be disputed by anyone.  This has resulted in the creation of a general impression that everyone in trade and industry made excessive profits which of course was not the case.  To my own certain knowledge there were both manufacturers and traders who kept their prices as low as they believed to be possible without undue risk to their business and who did all they could to resist rising prices.  Some people say that such companies were foolish and that they should have made hay while the sun shone.  Personally I was brought up to believe that it was morally wrong to make abnormal profits in time of war or of scarcity, and I would strongly object to any suggestion that the profiteers should use their profits in a manner calculated to put the non-profiteers out of trade. People who were allowed to make excessive profits and still have them have an enormous advantage over those who did not make them.  How and to what extent they should use that advantage in competition with others is not easy to decide.  The circumstances can only be judged fairly by an examination of the accounts in each case.  While strongly condemning the taking of excessive profits we should try to encourage those who work on reasonable profit margins and give good value to the public.  It must be remembered that our economy is based on private enterprise and that private enterprise cannot be run without profit.</P>
    <P>State-owned companies can be run at a loss if the public is willing to foot the bill.  Substantial profits may be made by keeping prices low and having a large turnover, or they may&mdash;if there is no effective competition&mdash;be made by selling at high prices and being content with a small trade.  Generally speaking, the first method benefits the community as a whole and the second only benefits a few individuals.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed as to the necessity for a reduction in the cost of living. <Col N="142" /> I believe that prices of most commodities will fall, but I do not believe that they will ever reach pre-war level.  Supplies of many raw materials have improved and prices in many cases show a downward tendency.  In several trades there is now a buyers' instead of a sellers' market.  Unfortunately, up to the present, the reductions which have occurred in commodity prices have been to some extent offset by rising expenses and costs of production. Most manufacturers and traders are worried by the increase in costs of production or of distribution over which they have no control.  Their prices or their profits are controlled in all essential goods and if there is a sudden fall in prices with a resultant fall in turnover value they may easily show a loss instead of a profit.  I do not believe that the average manufacturer or trader in essential goods can possibly make high profits this year. Those who deal in luxuries or other uncontrolled goods or the favoured few who benefit largely from the tourist trade may possibly do so however, and if they do, they should in my opinion bear their fair share of taxation.</P>
    <P>To secure a reduction in the cost of living there must not only be substantially increased production, but there must also be a reduction in the costs of production and distribution.  The Minister, notwithstanding Senator Hawkins, has set an excellent example by his policy of economy and by his endeavour to reduce taxation by cutting out what he believes to be nonessential expenditure.  The ideal thing would be a slow but steady fall in prices and a progressive increase in the real value of money.  A sudden fall would cause serious dislocation of trade and consequent unemployment. The profits made by manufacturers and traders are only a part, usually a relatively small part, of the total price which the public has to pay for its goods.  There is in my opinion a grave danger that over-emphasis on the evil of profiteering may defeat its own object and may lead the public generally to believe that if profiteering were stopped there would at once be a substantial fall in prices and that nothing else is necessary.</P>
    <P>For this reason I would ask the Minister <Col N="143" /> to tackle the question of the taxation of business profits as soon as possible and to endeavour to devise a basis of taxation which will be fair and equitable&mdash;which will encourage new development by keeping taxation as low as possible on normal profits and which will tax heavily only such profits which can properly be described as abnormal or excessive.  In my opinion the present position is anything but satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Few things can be more injurious to trade than the kind of vague uncertainty that exists with regard to future taxation.  Businessmen, who are endeavouring to carry on their trade in an honest manner and who are as genuinely desirous of getting prices down as anyone else, feel that they may be penalised by future taxation because certain persons or firms who have made large profits may fail to do certain things which the Minister wants.  These people read the newspapers but few if any of them read Dáil or Seanad reports.  They have already had experience of excess corporation profits tax and they know that it allowed some people to get away with big profits while it operated in a harsh manner against others who were only making normal profits.  Personally I have confidence in the Minister and am satisfied that he will not allow himself to be stampeded by propaganda into hasty taxation which would be unfair in its operation.  My fear is that false or misleading reports of his speeches may create a want of confidence in him or in the Government. As an instance I would point out that the Minister was reported in the newspapers of June 11th as saying that in 1946 all excess profits were handed back.  This of course is not correct and is a complete misrepresentation of what he said.</P>
    <P>The excess corporation profits tax applied to all profits made up to 31st December, 1946.  None of this tax could be claimed as a refund unless losses could be shown or unless the profits could be proved to have been lower than the pre-war standard.  The Minister says he knows that further <Col N="144" /> excess profits were made after January 1st, 1947, and that those who made them got away without any taxation except income-tax and corporation profits tax.  I presume he is referring to estimates made by the Revenue Commissioners. Most of the accounts for a full year after January 1st, 1947, have not yet been dealt with by the Inspector of Taxes.  I presume also that by excess profits made after January 1st, 1947, he means excess profits within the meaning of the excess corporation profits tax which, I submit, is not and never was a fair standard.  There are quite a few companies which had a low pre-war standard who have had to pay excess corporation profits tax from 1941 until 1946, partly because they had too low a standard and partly because they could not carry out adequate running repairs to their machinery.  In these cases the State has collected 75 per cent. of what are really fictitious profits.  It is no use saying to these people that they have been allowed to keep 25 per cent. when they know that the reserves they were able to accumulate were not enough to meet the accumulated liabilities for repairs.  I believe the facts to be that in some cases the 25 per cent. of profits over the standard was adequate or more than adequate to provide the necessary reserves, while in other cases it was quite insufficient.</P>
    <P>I dealt with this matter in detail in a speech in this House some time ago. I only refer to it now because I want to persuade the Minister that the only way to deal adequately with profiteering is to place taxation on trade profits on a fair and equitable basis.  If he does so and then proceeds to tax heavily all companies who are making excessive or unreasonable profits, he will have.  I believe, the support not only of the public generally but also of many manufacturers and traders, the majority of whom recognise that the only safe and sound way to build up and maintain a business is to sell as cheaply as possible.  Businesses built up on high profits are like houses built upon the sand.  When the wind and the storm of competition come they will fall and great will be the fall thereof.</P>
    <P>The Minister, very wisely I think, <Col N="145" /> decided not to impose a new profits tax in this year's Budget.  He believes that he can get profits down to a reasonable level without it.  I hope and believe that he will get the co-operation of the majority of manufacturers and traders, not so much because he wants it as because it is good policy for Irish industry.  There will, however, always be some people who believe that they are entitled to make as much profit quickly as circumstances and the law allow them.  I therefore urge the Minister to make use of the period between now and the next Budget to have an examination made of the whole question of the taxation of trade profits.  Subject to various alterations, mostly of a minor character, taxation is based on the British Income Tax Act of 1918.  This is 1948 and conditions both here and elsewhere are very different from what they were in 1918.</P>
    <P>My suggestion to the Minister is that he should, as soon as practicable, appoint a small committee to inquire into and report on the present methods of taxing trade and industry.  The committee should be empowered to suggest changes in the methods of taxation and in particular to consider how taxation can be devised so as to (a) encourage the retention of profits in business for use in extension or development, and (b) the best method of taxing abnormal or unreasonable profits. The basis of any recommendations of the committee should be to provide a tax yield as near as possible to the present.  If the Minister adopted the recommendations he could then decide whether there should be any decrease or increase in the total yield.  I suggest that the committee should consist of two or three businessmen with a broad and liberal outlook, two labour representatives who have actually been employed in a responsible capacity in business, and two or three accountants.  I do not think that any civil servants should be members of the committee as the Revenue Commissioners would, of course, have to examine and report on any recommendations. If a retired revenue official of experience could be found willing to act on such a committee it would be an advantage.  The committee <Col N="146" /> must of course have access to figures necessary to estimate the total yield of any proposed alterations.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a scheme examined under which the rate of taxation on normal profits would be somewhat less if the profits are not distributed and an additional tax on profits which are in excess of normal, graduated more or less like surtax.  The main difficulty would be to define normal profits as the rate varies in different trades, but I am not convinced that it could not be done.  Without some effective and fair method of estimating normal profits there can be no equitable taxation of excessive profits. It has been suggested that the standard or normal rate of profit should be based on the capital employed. If so, there would have to be some satisfactory method of measuring the real capital employed.  Any accountant will tell you that the figures for capital which appear on a balance sheet rarely represent with accuracy the real capital.  Personally I am inclined to the view that in order to assess what can be regarded as normal or reasonable profits it will be necessary to have regard to the turnover. These are, however, questions which could best be examined by an expert committee and I do not propose to attempt to deal with them now.  An amendment was proposed in the Dáil which, it was said, would encourage the retention of profits in business.  I could not understand the amendment, but naturally I am sympathetic to the idea and have on more than one occasion made similar suggestions in this House.  I formed the opinion, however, that no Minister for Finance in any Government would ever accept such a proposal if it was taken by itself, as it would upset budget calculations.</P>
    <P>What I am now suggesting is that a committee should see if it is not possible to provide that there will be an inducement for the retention of normal profits in business and make up the deficiency in the total yield by progressively high taxation on excessive profits.  I believe that it is essential to future industrial development and progress in this country that profits should be used for increasing efficiency <Col N="147" /> and keeping methods up to date.  This cannot be done if reasonable and fair profits are taxed too highly.  Whatever system may be devised for estimating fair or normal profits, it is of prime importance that the law should be revised so as to provide that the profits which are taxed are real profits.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that the profits of a company calculated for the purposes of income-tax, corporation profits tax or excess corporation profits tax are almost always considerably higher than the actual profits of the company.  By actual profits I mean the balance of the income over expenditure in any year after provision has been made for annual depreciation and for the amortisation of all money spent on assets which will be used up in the making of profits.</P>
    <P>If a company fails to make adequate provision for wasting assets, and pays out annually, whether in profit distribution or in taxation more than it can properly afford to do, it must sooner or later find itself in financial difficulties.  No well-managed company could confine its reserves to the amounts allowed for wear and tear for the purposes of income-tax assessment.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister carefully to consider this aspect of the problem.  I believe it has an important bearing on the whole question of excessive profits. When taxation is based on a higher figure than the real profits it forces companies to take a higher rate of profit than would otherwise be necessary. When the rate of tax is as high as 75 per cent., as it was under the old excess corporation profits tax, and when this tax is based on a figure higher than the real profits, it is bound to force up prices.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that before any equitable method can be found of taxing excessive profits the British 1918 Act will have to be revised and a proper method of ascertaining the real profits will have to be found.  I have already advocated at length in this House the abolition of the British system of income-tax and the substitution of two separate taxes, one an income-tax on personal incomes, and the other a tax on trading profits.  In <Col N="148" /> view of the circumstances which have arisen since the war I believe that the most urgent matter is that of the taxation of trading profits.  The method of taxing personal income also requires amendment but this can be left over for the present.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which is closely allied and which will have to be closely examined by the Government. I refer to the system of price and profit control.  This is, I believe, operated by the Prices Branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce and is not controlled by the Minister for Finance.  It may have been inevitable, but I think it was unfortunate, that one Department controlled prices and profits and another Department dealt with profits taxation.</P>
    <P>I have only a limited knowledge of the system, but I think I am correct in stating that profit control was carried out in two ways.  One method was to fix the wholesale and retail price for the particular article, and the other was to make a special arrangement with the particular company under which the total profit or total rate of profit was controlled.  After an arrangement was made with the company the Minister made an Order which applied to that particular company, and, of course, such Orders were not published.</P>
    <P>This system has many disadvantages, one of the greatest being that the public knows little or nothing about it and blames companies for making profits which have been approved by the Government as reasonable. Another objection is that firms in the same industry who are competitors may have different rates of profit fixed for them.  The Prices Branch examined the audited accounts for each firm and after consultation fixed the maximum profit or rate of profit for the coming year.</P>
    <P>In order to arrive at this profit they had to take into consideration all necessary expenses, provision for depreciation, taxation, etc.  Where the pre-war standard was too low to provide what the Prices Branch considered to be a fair profit they had to allow for the estimated excess corporation profits tax which the company would have to pay.  You had, therefore, a <Col N="149" /> number of cases in which a company was paying excess corporation profits tax on a profit which the Minister for Industry and Commerce, through his Prices Branch, had decided to be a fair and normal profit.  How often this occurred I do not know.</P>
    <P>The total figures of excess corporation profits tax collected are available but no figures were ever published to show how much of this tax was paid on profits which had been approved by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I suggest to the Minister that he should get these figures from his colleague.  He will then know how much of the excess corporation profits tax was paid on profits which in the opinion of the Government at that time were excessive profits.  I think that in fairness to Irish industry the total figures should be published if they can be obtained.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not there were any industries whose profits were not controlled, either by having their total profits controlled, or by fixed prices for the goods they produced, but I may say that I do not know of any manufacturers who were not controlled in one way or the other.  As far as my experience goes&mdash;I admit it was limited &mdash;the profits fixed by the Prices Branch were not excessive and were nearly always less than the companies felt they should be allowed to make.  I am not criticising the Prices Branch&mdash;as far as my knowledge goes its members did their best under difficult circumstances and tried to fix a fair profit.  Their task was not an enviable one.</P>
    <P>I do not, however, believe in the system of individual profit arrangements and think it should be ended as soon as practicable.  The system of fixing profits by means of fixed margins or fixed prices was, probably, better in some respects, but it also had serious drawbacks.  A profit margin which may be sufficient for a large company with a big turnover may be quite insufficient for a smaller company.  A margin of profits which is just sufficient to allow a country shop to carry on may enable a large shop in a city to make a handsome profit on its trading.</P>
    <P>Fixed prices have to be maximum <Col N="150" /> prices based on an average of what is necessary to allow both large and small to continue in business.  Fixed margins of profit have had the effect of encouraging the sale of the higher priced article as the higher the cost price the more the profit.  They also prevented the system of averaging profits, by which the profit on the lowest-priced articles was low, and the deficiency made up by a higher rate of profit on the more expensive articles.</P>
    <P>When prices were rising, turnover in money value increased and a margin which was fair and reasonable when it was fixed soon became too high and had to be altered.  Now the position is reversed and, as prices fall, I believe the system of profit margins will break down, as many of the margins fixed will become too low as the turnover in money value falls.  This may place traders, especially in the country, in serious difficulties.  From what I believe to be reliable information it would appear that this situation has already developed in some trades.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong, but I doubt if it is possible to devise a really satisfactory method of price control by the State. While there is scarcity the State must make the attempt but, as soon as supplies are sufficient to meet the demand, it is better to rely on competition to adjust prices, and rely on taxation to deal with excessive profits.  This is another reason why I should urge the Minister to appoint a committee on the lines I have suggested.  If it were found possible to devise a method of taxation which would not penalise normal or reasonable profits, but would get at excessive profits, it would then, I believe, be possible to abolish the present unsatisfactory methods of price and profits controls, except, perhaps, in cases where there is still acute shortage of supplies.</P>
    <P>There are many people who like myself are puzzled and rather bewildered by the large sums collected under excess corporation profits tax. We wonder why it occurred when profits were controlled by the Government. I can think of four possible explanations (a) that the Department of Industry and Commerce fixed profits at too high a rate which, I know, was <Col N="151" /> not the case in many industries, or (b) that the excess corporation profits tax was collected on profits which were not in fact excessive profits.</P>
    <P>As I stated, this was true to some extent, or it might be that there was a large number of manufacturers or traders whose profits were not controlled in any way, or it might be that a large proportion of the trade of the country was diverted to a number of very large companies which made profits because of a turnover which was abnormally large, and gained at the expense of smaller concerns.  Where profit margins were fixed they had to be at a rate which would allow smaller traders to carry on, and these margins, though low for a small trader, may have yielded substantially increased profits to very big concerns.</P>
    <P>The whole problem is one of the most difficult with which the Government will have to deal.  The suggestions I have put forward may be briefly summed up as follows: first, that steps be taken to see that the assessment of business profits is on an equitable basis; second, that taxation be arranged so that it will be as low as practicable on reasonable profits and high on excessive profits; third, that profit and prices controls be removed except where acute scarcity still exists.</P>
    <P>Where profit controls must still be maintained, the rates should be the same for all companies in any industry instead of individual arrangements.  It is my considered opinion that a policy on these lines would contribute substantially to the lowering of both prices and profits by increasing production and thus reviving healthy competition. If it failed in some cases to keep profits at a reasonable level, the State would get its proper share of excessive profits, which could be used to reduce taxation.</P>
    <P>While I do not agree with everything the Minister has said in his recent speeches, I have nothing but admiration for the courage, energy and ability which he has shown up to the present and which, I am certain, he will continue to show in the future.  I have endeavoured to provide constructive criticism of the kind which ought to <Col N="152" /> be helpful to the Government.  The ideas I have expressed are my own, and in putting them forward I do not speak on behalf of anyone else or on behalf of any association of traders or manufacturers.  All I ask is that they should be seriously considered and examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with Senator Douglas in congratulating the Minister on the success of the recent negotiations which he conducted in London.  These have a practical bearing on the subject before the House, because, if the newspaper reports of the negotiations and agreement are correct, one result will be a rectification of the balance of payments, an increase of exports and an increase in importation of raw materials such as fertilisers and machinery, with a considerable expansion in the production of the country.  If the production of the country expands the financial problems with which this Bill deals will automatically become more manageable. The modern approach to Budgets is that the Budget is a rather comparatively minor problem in a country's national economic problems during the year.  The problem in a Budget is how to turn over the resources available from private to public expenditure. It is obvious that that is easier when the national income is expanding. Therefore, if the Minister's general agricultural and industrial policy fructifies, and if the expansion in production takes place which we all hope will result from the London agreement, the budgetary problem will tend to become easier.  It has been said, although it is really an exaggeration, that if the production side is right, then the financial and budgetary side will largely right itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This modern approach to a Budget depends on the development of considerable statistical material.  There has been a great advance in modern times in the study of national income. It has become a feature in the presentation of British Budgets.  At the present time there is presented to the House of Commons what is known as the Budget White Paper.  This document <Col N="153" /> is very up to date.  It makes available material which is necessary for an intelligent study of a country's finances, and in particular the size of the national income, the distribution of the moneys in different categories, for example, between profits and wages.  It also deals with what is perhaps equally important, with the volume of savings which takes place in the community.  There can be no question but that the intelligent management of a country's finances can be greatly increased when material of this kind is available.  I would urge on the Minister to attempt to supply us with material for this country similar to that which is supplied in other countries.</P>
    <P>Nobody could admire the work of the statistics branch in this country more than I do.  Its work since the Treaty has been of the highest possible value. I think it is pretty generally agreed that the department is under-staffed and overworked, and, therefore, instead of finding any fault with its activities, I think anybody who knows anything about it will agree that it is a remarkable tribute to the present director that the volume of production there should be as great as it is, considering the great difficulties under which the staff works.  I do not think the Government could expend money more constructively than on an extension of the activities of the statistics branch.  Whether we like it or not, we are coming into an age when a Government has to take a greater part than heretofore in the planning of economic activities.  That can only be done intelligently if the data available are accurate and, above all, fairly up to date.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on National Income, which is a model of its kind, unfortunately does not extend later than the year 1944.  Four years have since elapsed, during which the situation at home and abroad has undergone considerable change.  I do think that the Minister himself must be, to some extent, impeded in the framing of his Budget by the lack of more up-to-date statistics, and it is equally true to say that the members of the Dáil and Seanad are impeded in their criticism <Col N="154" /> of the Budget by not having material of the kind which is available in the British White Paper.  Therefore, I would urge on the Minister to attempt to bring this statistical material up to date for the sake of the House.</P>
    <P>To come to the matters in the Finance Bill itself, while generally agreeing with the Bill, there is one matter which I should like to put to the Minister, and that is whether it would not be advisable when the other taxes imposed by the Supplementary Budget last autumn were being reduced to have included the income-tax rate.  It is very disappointing to find three or four years after the conclusion of war hostilities that the income-tax rate should be raised.</P>
    <P>In the normal course of events one would expect that it should fall.  I must confess to a feeling of disappointment when I saw that the income-tax rate was in an upward direction.  I refer to this particular tax because the constituents I have the honour to represent in the Seanad are people who are particularly affected by a high rate of income-tax.  They mostly belong to the professional classes who cannot escape the payment of income-tax with the same success that wage earners, who have strong organisations behind them, can.  The same is true of the business classes and farmers who profit, quite legitimately, by a rise in prices and a rise in the volume of trade.  The professions, including the university members of the Seanad, are affected by the high rate of income-tax and I do not think it unfair to remind the Minister that while he was in opposition this was a class of people for whom he had particular regard.  He frequently criticised other Ministers' financial proposals on the grounds that the professional salaried class were being squeezed between the upper and lower millstones.</P>
    <P>There is another reason for drawing attention to the unhappy incidence of income-tax on the liberal professional class.  It is a class of society which has a tremendous social value.  I am glad to refer to a series of articles in the <i>Economist</i> in the course of the last six months&mdash;if people have not read them, they are worth knowing about&mdash;<Col N="155" /> on the professional classes and the great amount of unpaid service in one way or another they give to society in research, science, literature, art, and in all the things of the mind.  These are the people who contribute something to society.  This is a class of person that always in this country, and certainly in the past, has contributed a a good deal more to society than is measured by its mere pecuniary reward.  In a country like this, where we have in the course of our policy, a levelling down process, where the old class of rich people has been bought out and liquidated, the existence of a fairly independent and fairly comfortably-off professional class has a tremendous political and social influence.  I cannot help feeling that that class of person suffers very much from income-tax, and the Minister should consider the impact of this increased tax on these particular people.</P>
    <P>In order that brain workers&mdash;artists, scientists and literary people&mdash;should be able to do their work productively, they must have a certain amount of ease and leisure and freedom from day-to-day financial anxieties.  The salaried class here have not had an adequate rise in their remuneration, and the present level of income-tax at 7/- in the £, with the present earned income allowances, does not provide the majority of those people with the requisite leisure and freedom from anxiety.  I do think they could yield an immense social dividend.</P>
    <P>The standard of living among people has been reduced materially.  Take one simple test.  A very large number of people nowadays have to do their own household work who were able to afford to employ people to do it heretofore. Furthermore, I am quite convinced that the high rate of direct taxation has a bad effect on incentive. To take an example, I know people who refrain from accepting invitations to lecture or write, simply on the ground that when the income-tax is taken off the fee does not remunerate them for the trouble.  I have no doubt that a considerable amount of professional labour has not been forthcoming simply because of the feeling that the income-tax <Col N="156" /> takes all the cream off the reward.</P>
    <P>Finally, a high rate of taxation makes it quite impossible for a salaried class of people to save.  We must remember that the high rate of income-tax reduces the net yield on savings.  When you talk about loans being floated at 3½ per cent. you always forget that as the Minister pays 70/- to the bond holder at the end of the year he takes back about 21/-, so that the net return on savings is very low.  I am quite sure that amongst the middle professional salaried classes, the power and the will to save are both reduced by this extremely low net yield on their savings.</P>
    <P>The Minister has learned the lesson of reducing post office rates too low. He has found the reaction that might have been expected.  The working-class make the post office the vehicle of their savings and they have been dissuaded from depositing them.  He has raised the rate of interest, in the hope of arresting the tendency to withdraw them.  I have no doubt that another class of society, midway between the rich business class and the working-class, is also being dissuaded; and one reason is that high rates and other commitments are crippling them. They are not able to live on their incomes, so those people who have inherited a sum of money are using up their capital and dissipating it.  I do not believe that that is a good development.</P>
    <P>I would also support what Senator Douglas said about the necessity for having an inquiry into the taxation of profits.  I am not at all inclined to join in this witch hunt against profiteers. I consider that in industry the real test that we have of progress is the success a man makes of his business and that the reward of people shows their industry.  When we see a businessman making big profits it means that he is producing the things that consumers require and producing them efficiently.  I admit that, in periods of scarcity, in war-time when there are restrictions, you can have too much regulation and control and that results in profiteering.  Normally speaking, however, it seems to me that to tax away profits is to tax the reward <Col N="157" /> of legitimate business enterprise and, therefore, that a tax on profits is a taking away from a businessman of his legitimate profits.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that by far the best way of preventing illegitimate profits, while allowing legitimate profits to be maintained, is to continue active business competition as far as possible. The whole essence of competition is that the man who can produce an article efficiently is the man who will obtain profits for himself.  The man who realises the demand and can produce the article better than his rival will get the market and make the profit.  Therefore, the profit is the regulator of that activity in our society and to tax it all away would have an extremely bad effect on incentive.</P>
    <P>This subject is so delicate that I join in Senator Douglas's plea for an inquiry.  Simply to say that high profits occur because of high prices is over simplification.  It is probably untrue. High profits result from high prices, and the best way to get them down is to allow competition in the broadest sense of the word.  I think it is very important that we should not take too much away in taxation on enterprise or efficiency.  By doing so, we would be taxing the savings out of business, which constitute the fund of capital invested in the future.  Therefore, if profits are singled out for special taxation of a penal kind&mdash;and that is what is in the air&mdash;it should be perfectly clear that those profits are the result of some sort of undesirable, illegitimate, if not illegal, activity.</P>
    <P>The approach to the problem becomes immensely easier in an economy with an expanding national production. Where agricultural and industrial production is expanding the yield of all taxes increases, the margin of taxation is greatly extended and the Minister's position is easier in every direction. This means an improvement in investment. This improvement in agricultural and industrial production is very largely the result of the exploitation of legitimate profit.  If business people are discouraged by high taxation, they will not invest their reserves in new development.  Therefore, high taxation of profits may have extremely <Col N="158" /> crippling effects on our whole national activity.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude on the same note as that on which I began&mdash;a note of congratulation to the Minister for having brought back news that indicates that the national dividend will be expanded; and I wish to ask him not to take some of the ground of that expansion away by too high a tax on the professional class or on the increases in legitimate profits.</P>

      <P>Is dóigh liom nach dtabharfar isteach choíche Cáinfhaisnéis a shásós gach duine.  Níor tugadh isteach go dtí seo é agus ní mheasaim go dtabharfar isteach choíche é.  Níl aon uair dá dtugtar Cáinfhaisnéis isteach nach dtugann sé sásamh do chuid mhaith agus ag an am céanna cuireann sé mí-shásamh ar chuid mhaith eile.  Níl fhios agam nach bhfuil daoine ann atá sásta leis an gCáinfhaisnéis seo.  Níl mé á rá nach bhfuil rudaí ins an gCáinfhaisnéis atá go mhaith do dhaoine áirithe ach cosúil le ubh áirithe a bhíos go maith i spotaí, na spotaí ina bhfuil an cáinfhaisnéis seo go mhaith, níor mhór mionradharcán le iad a fheiceál.  Bíonn dhá chuspóir ag baint le cáinfhaisnéis.  Sa chéad dul síos, cuirtear in iúl dúinn ann an bhail atá ar chúrsaí airgeadais agus ar chúrsaí géilleagair na tíre i láthair na huaire.  Isé an dara feidhm a baintear as, ná, de thoradh scrúduithe a déantar ar ghéilleagar agus airgeadas na tíre, go ndéantear iarracht a chur in iúl dúinn céard é an polasaí a b'fhearr, ó thaobh an ghéilleagair agus ó thaobh an airgeadais san am atá le teacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom go rabhmar&mdash;ná go bhfuilimid&mdash;mí-réasúnta má bhímíd ag súil, chomh maith, le cúntas d'fháil ar chúrsaí airgid, go dtabharfaidh an tAire léargus dúinn ar bheartas an Rialtais don bhliain seo chugainn. Nuair a tháinig an tAire Airgeadais ós ár gcomhair cúpla mí ó shoin bhí mé ag rá go raibh mé mí-shásta nár thug sé an léargus sin dúinn, ach dúirt mé, ag an am céanna, go m'béidir nach mbeadh sé féaráilte bheith ag súil le cúntas uaidh ar an méid a bhí dá bheartú aige.  Dúirt mé, leis go mbeadh muid foighdeach go dtí go dtiocfadh an Bille seo ós ár gcomhair, agus ansin go mbéadh muid ag súil leis <Col N="159" /> an eolas a bhí mé ag rá gur cheart a thabhairt dúinn.  Ní dóigh liom go n-abróidh éinne go bhfuil mé ag déanamh áiféis má abraim nár thug an tAire an léargus dúinn a raibh súil againn leis.</P>
    <P>Tá mion-rudaí ráite aige i dtaobh airgead atá sé ag brath a shábháil. Tá mion-rudaí ráite aige i dtaobh feabhas atá sé ag brath a chur ar na seirbhísí sóisialacha; ach an ráiteas ba cheart dúinn a bheith ag súil leis, ar theacht isteach sa Rialtas nua, ní bhfuaireamar é.  Tá fátha leis, is dóigh liom.  Tá a fhios ag gach duine céard iad na fátha so.  Is deacair do Rialtas mar an Rialtas atá ann a aigne a dhéanamh suas i dtaobh polasaí cinnte. Tá malairt tuairim acu.  Bhí mé ag dul ag rá go raibh malairt prionsabail acu, ach ní ceart dom é sin a rá mar na prionsabail a bhí ag an gcuid is mó de na Páirtithe atá páirteach sa Rialtas, tá siad caite le gaoith.</P>
    <P>Isé an dara chúis, is dóigh liom, nár thug an tAire an léargus san dúinn, ná go bhfuil sé, agus go bhfuil a chómh-Airí ain-eolach ar an gcúram atá siad tar éis a thógaint orthu féin.  D'admhuigh an tAire Cosanta inniu go bhfuil a fhios aige anois-mura raibh fhios aige cheana&mdash;ar na sriantaí atá air, thar mar a cheap sé a bheith ann. Tá an rud céadna ann, is dóigh liom, i dtaobh na n-Airí uilig&mdash;na rudaí a bhí siad a gheallúint tá a fhios acu anois&mdash; muna raibh fhios acu cheana é, agus creidim go raibh an fhios san acu cheana&mdash;nach bhfuil na gealliúintí sin ionchoimhlíonta.  Cúis eile&mdash;marb é an chúis chéanna i gcónaí é&mdash;an imní atá ar na Páirtithe seo faoina a chéile. Níl muinín acu as a chéile, agus tá siad ag faire ar a chéile, le súil go mbainfidh siad buntáiste as dóibh féin.  Muna bhfuil siad le bheith slugtha ar fad ag aon Pháirtí amháin, caithfidh siad, lá éigin, nuair a thiocfas toghchán, dul ós comhair an phobail agus iad fhéin a chosaint.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> Beidh sé deacair cur síos mar ba mhaith liom ar na pointí go léir ar mhaith liom trácht a dhéanamh orthu ar an ócáid seo.  Tá mé buíoch de mo chara, an Seanadóir Hawkins, gur phléidh sé chomh tuigsionach cuid de na pointí seo.  Ní thógfaidh an Seanad orm é, ó thárla baint chomh dlúth sin a bheith agam leis an nGaeltacht agus leis na ceantracha cúnga, má dhéanaim tagairt do scéim na móna.</P>
    <P>Is millteach an buille a fuair muintir na Gaeltachta agus is é an feall é gurb iad san an chéad dream sa tír a toghadh amach le buille fealltach a tharraingt orthu.  Bhí an Seanadóir Hawkins ag caint ar an méid airgid a chaith Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe an bhliain seo caite ar scéim na móna sleáin ach níor innis sé an scéal ar fad.  Go deimhin, na daoine a bhí ag fáil saothrú as scéim na móna sleáin, is iad na daoine is mó a raibh gá acu le cabhair agus níl aon rud faighte acu ina áit. Ní hiad sin na daoine amháin, ach na daoine a bhíodh ag baint mhóna go príomháideach, a bhfuil rud curtha as dóibh.</P>
    <P>D'fhiafraigh an tAire cén dochar dóibh dul ar aghaidh agus móin a bhaint; cén chaoi a bhfuil seisean ag cur as dóibh thar aon dream nó aicme eile.  Níl sé deacair a insint dó.  Is cuimhneach liom an lá i ndiaidh an orduithe a theacht amach&mdash;agus tháinig sé amach go tobann&mdash;go raibh mé ag caint le cuid de na daoine a bhí ag baint móna go príobháideach agus cuireadh an ceist orm.  &ldquo;Ceard atáimid ag dul a dhéanamh?&rdquo;  Níor bhfhéidir liom a rá leo go mba dóigh liom go mb'fhiú dhóibh dul ar aghaidh ag saothrú na móna, go mbeadh an margadh ann dí.  Ansin chuireadar an cheist seo orm, &ldquo;Ach, ceárd is dóigh leat faoi scéal an ghuail?  An bhfuiltear le gual a cheadú isteach ins gach áit ar fud na tíre?  An gceadófar isteach é in Iarthar na hEireann?  An gceadófar isteach é sna ceanntracha cumhanga, sna ceanntracha móna?&rdquo; Ba shin í an cheist nach raibh mé indon a fhreagairt agus ba shin í an cheist nár freagradh i gceart go dtí seo.  Ní raibh mé i ndon an cheist sin a fhreagairt dá sásamh.  Mar gheall air sin&mdash;rud réasúnach&mdash;ní raibh siad ag dul le móin a bhaint agus aimhreas <Col N="161" /> mór orthu nach mbeadh an margadh ann dí.</P>
    <P>Níl aon mhaith don Aire a rá nár chuir sé isteach ar lucht bainte na móna go príobháideach.  Chuir sé isteach orthu díreach chomh mór agus a chuir sé isteach ar aon aicme eile.</P>
    <P>Níor stop an scéal air sin.  Chuir sé isteach ar lucht na gcaráistí ins an Iarthar agus ins gach áit a mbíodh gluaisteáin a lán ag dul síos suas le móin. Cuireadh daoine as obair ins gach baile agus d'imthingh cuid de na daoine sin go Sasana.  I gcás Chontae na Gaillimhe, i gcás Iarthar na Gaillimhe, tá an scéal thar a bheith go dona.  Tá sé go dona in áiteacha eile, ach níl sé chomh dona agus atá sé in Iarthar Chontae na Gaillimhe.</P>
    <P>Níl na figiúirí ar fáil fós ar an tinnreamh scol.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh níos mó eolais le fáil ná an tuarascáil a fuaireamar go dtí seo.  Nuair a thiocfas na figiúirí sin amach, cuirfidh siad in iúl má tá laghadú ar lucht na Gaeilge i gContae na Gaillimhe.  Má tá laghadú ann, is ar éigin é agus má bhionn laghadú ar an méid Gaeilgeoirí in Iarthar na hÉireann, sílim go bhfuighfear an difríocht i scéimeanna Bhórd na Móna ar fud na tíre.  Fágann sé an scéal go dona; hiarradh ar na daoine fanacht sa mbaile.  Mheallamar iad le fanacht sa mbaile.  Tá a fhios agam go dtáinig daoine ar ais ó Shasana.  Tá a fhios agam an géar-ghá atá, le blianta, sa cheantar sin le scoltacha níos mó ná bhí ann go dtí seo.  An buile seo in Iarthar Chontae na Gaillimhe, ní buille gnáthach é ach buile uafásach é.</P>
    <P>Níl muintir na Gaillimhe sásta, ná ní raibh ariamh, gur droch-mhóin a gheobhfadh muintir Bhaile Atha Cliath nó aon mhuintir eile.  Má fuair muintir Baile Atha Cliath droch-mhóin, ní ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta ná ar mhuintir na gceantracha cumhanga a bhí an locht agus ní ceart a bheith ag dul timpeall, mar tá daoine a dhéanamh, i measc lucht na gcathrach mór dá fhuagairt dóibh an faoiseamh atá faighte acu de bhrí go raibh deireadh dá chur le scéim na móna sleáin.  Níor theastaigh ón Iarthar ná níor theastaigh ó aon dream sna ceantracha móna go mbeadh droch-mhóin <Col N="162" /> le fáil ag aon duine.  D'fhéadfaí an droch-mhóin a bhaint as agus an mhóin maith a chur ar an margadh agus saothar a thabhairt do na daoine.</P>
    <P>Gan aon aimhreas, gealladh do muintir Shasana ag an Rialtas go bhfuighdís beithidhigh agus bia ba tíre seo níos saoire ná mar gheobhfadh dream ar bith eile ar an domhan iad. Nuair bheas na daoine a bhfuil báidh chomh mór san acu le Sasana ag smaoineamh ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus nuair a bheas siad ag maoimh as bia na hÉireann a bheith á thairiscint do Shásana níos saoire, cuimhnídís ar an éagóir atá déanta ar an muintir sin thiar.  Nuair a bheas na daoine seo a bhfuil an &ldquo;pint&rdquo; íslithe dóibh agus na daoine a bhfuil an buidéal &ldquo;Champagne&rdquo; íslithe dhóibh ag ól ar sáimhin a gcuimhníonn siad sin ar an drochbhail atá curtha ar an muintir sin thiar mar gheall orthu, an dream is mó a mba cheart dúinn a bheith dílis dóibh agus a mba cheart dúinn féachaint chige go bhfuighidís rud éigin, is cuma cé as a thiocfhadh sé.</P>
    <P>Tá scéal dá fhuagairt go gcuirfidh an Rialtas malairt scéimeanna ar fáil sa nGaeltacht.  Níl a fhios agam cé na scéimeanna iad.  Má tá ar intinn acu &mdash;agus níor chuala mé aon rud faoi aon scéim ach luaidreán&mdash;cuimhnídís ar seo, gurb é an rud a chaithfeas siad féachaint le dhéanamh saothrú a thabhairt do na daoine seo ó cheann go ceann na bliana.  Sin é an beartas a bhí ag an Rialtas deiridh, tamall a thabhairt dóibh ag obair ar na bóithrí agus tamall ag obair ar na portaigh.  Sin é an beartas a bhí acu nuair cheapadar na monarchana bréagáin leis na céadta daoine óga a chur ag obair iontu agus a gcoimead sa mbaile.  Sin é an beartas a bhí acu nuair a cheapadar scéim na dtithe gloine.  Tá súil agam go n-éireofar as an mugadh magadh a déantar i dtaobh tionscail na gcuairteoirí agus an mugadh magadh a déantar faoi scéim sin na dtithe gloine in Iarthar na Gaillimhe.  Níor bhreathnaigh mé ariamh air ach mar thurgnamh.  Dá n-eireodh leis cuirfí i bhfeidmh é ó cheann go ceann na bliana.  Ní inniú na inné, ach b'fhéidir go bhfuil sé 20 bliain anois ó chuaigh mé féin timpeall ag iarraidh léachtaí a thabhairt do na daoine ag iarraidh a chur in iúl dóibh <Col N="163" /> cén tairbhe a bheadh ina leitheid de scéim.  Is éard a mholfainn do dhaoine atá in aimhreas faoin scéim sin nó faoi aon scéim eile, dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht, cás na daoine ann a scrúdú, na fíorais a fháil amach dóibh féin agus gan a bheith ag braith ar scéala ar nós &ldquo;dúirt bean liom go ndúirt bean lei&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Is é an sórt scéimeanna atá ag teastáil ann scéimeanna a choinneodh na daoine ag obair ó cheann go ceann na bliana.  Níl aon mhaith don Aire a bheith a cheapadh go ndéanfaidh sé cúis dóibh má chuireann sé deireadh le obair na móna go gcuirfidh sé daoine ag obair ar na bóithrí.  Má chinneann sé agus cuideoidh muide feadh ar gcumais leis&mdash;scéimeanna nua a cheapadh muid an buiochas dó a bheas ag dul dó dá réir.</P>
    <P>Níl a fnios agam an gá dom mórán do rá i dtaobh cuid de na rudaí atá fagtha as an gCáin-Fhaisnéis.  Gheall an tAire agus a mhuintir le linn an Toghcháin go laghdóidís cánta.  Ar laghdaíodar cánta?  Mar atá ráite cheana ag an Seanadóir Hawkins, nuair a bheas gach rud curtha le chéile, sílim go dtabharfar faoi deara, in ionad cánta a laghdu gurb é an chaoi a bhfuil cánta méadaithe.  Nuair a bhí sé ag tagairt do scéal na cánach ioncaim ba mhian leis an Aire a rá fo raibh sé da chur sin i bhfeidhm mar gheall ar go raibh sé beartaithe ag an Aire Airgeadais a bhí ann go deiridh. Leithscéal gan bhrí é sin.</P>
    <P>Chuir an tAire Airgeadais deiridh nios mó cánta ná sin i bhfeidhm.  Níor chuir sé an cháin sin i bhfeidhm. Cánta a ceapadh a chur i bhfeidhm ní raibh sé le glacadh leo agus chuir sé ar ceal iad.  Dá mba mhian leis, dáiriribh, gan cáin ioncaim a mhéadú, d'fhéadfadh sé gan é a mhéadú.  Ní dóigh liom gur cheart dó a lua mar leithscéal go bhfuil sé á dhéanamh mar gheall ar go raibh sé beartaithe ag an Aire Airgeadais a bhí againn go deiridh.  Ní gá dom mórán 'na dtaobh. Na cánta a cheap an tAire Airgeadais a bhí ann go deiridh, ba cánta neamhchoitianta iad, ba cánta iad le haghaidh ócáide práinneach, le haghaidh ócáide speisialta.  Do réir chosúlachta, tá cuid mhaith de na <Col N="164" /> cúiseanna a bhí leis na cánta breise sin imithe agus dá mbeadh an tAire sin ann anois is dóigh liom go múchfadh sé cuid de na cánta a bhí ceaptha aige an uair sin agus ní bheadh íonadh orm dá dtagadh sé isteach agus a rá, an bhreis cáin ioncaim a cheap sé a bheith riachtanach nach mbeadh sé riachtanach beag ná mór, feasta.  Ach, sin speculation.</P>
    <P>An loch atá agam ar an méid adúirt an tAire, go bhfuil sé á chur i bheidhm mar gheall ar go raibh sé beartaithe ag an Aire Airgeadais deiridh.  Táim ar aon-intinn nár cheart é bheith ann más féidir gan é bheith ann.  Tá an ceart ag an Ollamh Ó Briain ins an méid adúirt sé i dtaobh cáin ioncaim, go gcuireann sé srian le hobair.  Tá fhios againn an chaoi a gcuireann sé srian le hobair.  Tá fhios againn an chaoi a múcann sé an dúil a bhios ag duine tuille agus tuille oibre a dhéanamh.  Dá mhéid oibre a níos is ea is airde an t-ioncam náisiúnta.  Cuireann an cháin ioncaim cosc ar na daoine obair bhreise a dhéanamh agus laghdaíonn an t-ioncam dá réir.  Is léir céard is cúis leis seo.  Tá an argóint simplí agus do b'fhiú don Aire féachaint chuige, ó thárla go measann sé nach bhfuil gá le cánach ar bheoir agus toitini go mb'fhéidir go bhfuil sé direach chomh tábhactach go múchfadh sé an cháin bhreise ar ioncam.</P>
    <P>Mar a deirim, dúradh go laghdófaí cánacha.  Dúradh go méadófaí ar na seirbhísí sóisialacha.  B'fhéidir gur ceann de na rudaí is taithneamhaí sa mBille, an beartas atá déanta le go dtabharfaí breis deontais do lucht sean-aoise.  Deirimid ar fad go bhfuilimid ar aon intinn faoi sin.  Is maith liom go bhfuil sé sin tagaithe chun críche.  Bhí rún ós ár gcóir timcheall sé nó seacht mí ó shion faoi an gceist chéanna.  Dúirt mé fhéin an uair sin, agus an mhuintir a bhí in éindigh liom, go mba iarratas réasúnach é go gcuirfí an oiread ar fáil do lucht a sean-aoise agus a b'fhéidir a chur ar fáil dóibh. Bhí súil ag cuid againn, mura bhféadfaí é a dhéanamh ar an bpointe, go bhféadfaí é a dhéanamh ar dhá shlí ar ball&mdash;sé sin, go bhfaighidís ardú ar an airgead féin mar phinsin sean-aoise, agus go laghdófaí costas earraí&mdash;rud a b'ionann agus breis teacht isteach a <Col N="165" /> bheith acu.  Ní laghdaigh luach earraí agus tá an costas maireachtála ag méadú.  Ní aon mhaith don Aire a rá nár chuir an t-ardú ar mhargarín agus min choirce ach ríbheagán leis an gcostas maireachtála.  Ní leor sin mar leithscéal.  Gheall sé go laghdódh sé an costas maireachtála.  Tugadh gealúint, ní hamháin aige féin, ach ag cuid dá chomh-Aire, go laghdófaí an costas maireachtála 30% ar laghad, ba cheart go n-ísleofaí rud éigin é.  Ina áit sin, cad tá ag titim amach?  Admhaíonn an tAire go méadaíonn sé an costas maireachtála. Tá luach feola ardaithe.  Tá luach aráin ardaithe; tá luach ime ardaithe agus luach ní fios cé mhéid rudaí eile.</P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh, má theastaíonn fianaise uainn nach bhfuil an scéal go sásúil, níl le déanamh againn ach breathnú siar agus timpeall orainn agus ar a liacht stailc a cuireadh ar bun le goirid.  Ní abrófaí linn gur i gcoinne ísliú ar an gcostas maireachtála a cuireadh na stailceanna ar bun.  Gealladh dhúinn go n-ísleofaí an costas maireachtála. Bhíomar ag súil go bhféadfaí é isliú agus go bhféadfaí níos mó a dhéanamh ar son lucht an tsean-phinsin ná na cúpla scilling sa mbreis a thabhairt dóibh.  An méid atá geallta dhóibh, tá failte roimhe, ach ní dada é agus an saol atá ann, le hais an méid ba cheart a thabhairt dóibh.  Nuair a smaoineann tú ar an deontas atá siad sin ag dul á fháil, nuair a smaoineann tú ar an gcostas a bheas ar an tír, baintear a lán de'n tsástacht a airíonn duine dá bharr.</P>
    <P>Cén fáth?  Níl aon amhras nach iad an lucht oibre a íocfas an deontas sin. Tá siad ag dul á íoe trí bhreis airgid d'íoc ar a gcuid árachais náisiúnta agus ar a gcuid árachais díomhaointis.  Tá siad ag dul á íoc tríd an £450,000 ba ghnáth a chur isteach i gciste pinsin na múinteoirí a bheith caite siar ar lucht oibre na tíre.  Ní buntáiste a bheas ann ach a mhalairt.  Ba mhaith liom dá mba daoine atá in acfuinn íoc as d'íocfadh é.  Ach, ní hiad lucht oibre amháin a íocfas as na stampaí árachais, ach na daoine atá briste as obair de thoradh Cáin-Fhaisneise an Aire&mdash;na daoine atá briste as na seirbhísí éagsúla, Bord na Móna, Fuel Importers, Ltd., as na seirbhísí Aer-Línte, <Col N="166" /> agus eile&mdash;iad sin atá ag íoc a gcion féin chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Go deimhin, mar deirim, is maith liom go bhfuil rud beag ag dul do na sean-daoine agus níl fhios agam a bhfuil aon dream so tír is túisce a mbeidh brón orthu mar gheall air é d'fháil ar an gcostas a bhfuil siad á fháil ná na sean-daoine féin a bheas á fháil.</P>
    <P>Tá dhóithin ama faighte ag an Aire le machnamh a dhéanamh ar an mbeartas a cheap sé i dtaobh Aer-Línte. B'fhéidir nach é deireadh a chur leis an tseirbhís sin an rud is measa ach go léiríonn sé sin dearcadh cumhang a bheith ag an Aire i dtaobh forbairte saidhbhris náisiúnta.  Ní féidir leis a rá i dtaobh seirbhis Aer-Línte go mba seirbhis í nach raibh ion-mholta.  'Sé an méid rachmais, an méid caipitil a bhí ag an gComhlucht sin, ná £1,598,000.  As an méid sin, do caitheadh £500,000 ar thréineáil píolóití agus lucht oibre na seirbhísí sin.  Níl aon amhras ná gur mhaith an <i>investment</i> na heitealláin a cheannach. Admhaíonn sé fhéin nár cailleadh aon airgead orthu ach gurb amhlaidh go ndearna sé airgead orthu, ar bhealach.</P>
    <P>Is í an t-aon cheist amháin ná&mdash;an cailliúnt é an £500,000 a chaitheamh ar thréineáil lucht oibre na seirbhíse? Bheadh sé an-deacair luach a chur ar theicniúlacht.  Ní théann sé go han-mhaith don Aire a rá gur stroinséirí cuid de na daoine.  Sin é an rud a thárlaíonn i gcás gach náisiúin&mdash; déaneann siad malartú ar an eolas teicniúil.  Nuair a mhúineamar iascaireacht do na Spáinnigh, chailleamar an teicniúc san sinn fhéin.  Mhúin na Spáinnigh an teicníc san dúinn arís. Mhúineamar an teicnic iascaireachta do na hAlbanaigh agus bhí ar na hAlbanaigh an teicníc sin a mhúineadh dúinn thar n-ais.  Mhúin na hAlbanaigh teicniúlacht na fíodóireachta dhúinn agus tháinigh an lá gur mhúineamar an fhíodóireacht ar ais arís dóibh. Más stroinséirí a thagann isteach i gceannas seirbhísí anseo, is cuma liom má tá siad ag tabhairt an eolais dúinn atá feiliúnach a bheith againn.  An t-airgead a caitheadh ar eolas teicniúil na ndaoine sin, ní cailliúint don tír é. Dá ndéarfá gur chailliúnt é, is ionann <Col N="167" /> sin agus a rá gur chaillúnt é oideachas a thabhairt do dhream ar bith sa tír.</P>
    <P>Ní raibh gá ar bith deireadh a chur leis an tseirbhís sin.  Ní raibh sé maoite go n-íocfadh sí a bhealach sna blianta tosaigh.  Ceárd é an ghnó, ach amháin gnó a ceannaítear mar &ldquo;going concern&rdquo;, a íocfadh as a fhuireann an chéad lá?  Bhí cáil bainte amach againn i gcúrsaí eitleoireachta, a bhí ioncurtha le cáil náisiúin ar bith eile. Bhí éileamh ar ár gcuid seirbhísí.  Ní féidir a rá an éireodh go cinnte linn, ach bhí an seans ann go n-éireodh linn go réasúnta cinnte.  Is cuma, ar bhealach, deireadh a chur leis an tseirbhís sin&mdash;is é an rud atá ag cur imní orm an léargas a bheireann sé dom ar aigne an Aire i dtaoibh feabhais agus forbairte saibhris aiceanta na tíre seo.</P>
    <P>Rinneadh tagairt &mdash; agus is maith liom go ndearnadh tagairt di&mdash;don bheartas atá déanta ag an Aire £85,000 a shábháil trí deireadh a chur le lorgaireacht mianraí na tíre, go mór mhór an obair a bhí beartaithe go speisialta i gContae Chill Mantáin.  Is deacair a thuiscint nach eol don Aire agus do na daoine atá páirteach leis sa Rialtas tábhacht na hoibre sin.  Níl aon aimhreas nach bhfuil &ldquo;fiontar&rdquo; ag baint leis&mdash;níl aon ghnó a cuireadh ar bun riamh nach raibh sé sin le rá faoi&mdash;&ldquo;fiontar&rdquo; do na daoine a chuir ar bun é nó don Stát, go gcaillfeadh siad an t-airgead a chuireadar ann.  Ní haon mhaith dúinn bheith ag caint ar &ldquo;fiontar&rdquo;.  Ba cheart dúinn dul &ldquo;sa bhfiontar&rdquo; ag féachaint a bhfuil brí ar bith leis na nithe sin, is cheart dúinn a dhéanamh agus a moltar dúinn a scrúdú.</P>
    <P>Bhí mé ag caint le cuid de na fir atá ag obair ar an scéim sin in Abhóca&mdash; fir oibre iad.  Níl aon eolas speisialta acu ar an rud.  Bhí an-mhuinín acu, ón méid a chualadar thart timpeall na háite, go dtiocfadh rud éigin fónta as an bhfiosrú.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil nósanna nua anois ann, le triail a dhéanamh féachaint an bhfuil mianraí in áit nó nach bhfuil.  Béidir nach bhfuil mianraí san áit sin; ach, ar an dtaoibh eile, d'fhéadfadh a bheith go bhfuil&mdash;agus do b'fiú £85,000 a chaitheamh <Col N="168" /> chun a fhail amach an bhfuil, agus dul ar aghaidh leis an obair ansin.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam nuair a bheas an imní a bhí ar an Aire caite de, i dtaoibh na Cáinfhaisnéise seo, agus nuair a bheas laghdú déanta aige anseo agus ansiúd, chun na geallúintí a chomhlíonadh&mdash; geallúintí na bPáirtí a rinneadh le linn an toghcháin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Thug mé faoi deara, agus molaim an tAire as ucht go bhfuil sé le faoiseamh éicint a thabhairt do na feilméaraí go bhfuil na <i>tractors</i> acu.  Meabhraíonn sé dom iarraidh ar an Aire anois cuimhneamh ar fhaoiseamh éigin a thabhairt do na múinteoirí scoile a bhfuil gluaisteáin acu&mdash;agus a chaithfidh a bheith acu le haghaidh a gcuid oibre.  Chaith na daoine sin a lán airgid ag iarraidh Fianna Fáil a chur amach.  Bhíodar ag súil le buntáistí éigin, as dream eile a thoghadh in áit Fhianna Fáil.  In áit ardu tuarastail a thabhairt dóbh, is e a thárla ná gur méadaíodh a gcuid costais.</P>
      <P>Níl aon amhras nach ndearnadh a lán do na múinteoirí faoin dtuaith, daoine óga atá ag maireachtáil istigh sna bailtí mar gheall ar nach bhfuil tithe le fáil acu in aice a gcuid scol. Más ceart d'aon dream faoiseamh éigin d'fháil, agus é d'fháil ar an bpointe, do réir na ngeallúintí a tugadh dóibh le linn an toghcháin, tá faoiseamh ag teastáil ó na múinteoirí scoile, agus tá sé tuillte acu.  Is trua nach raibh rud éigin níos rathúla le rá ag an Aire i dtaoibh an méid a dhéanfaidh sé do na múinteoirí ar ball.  Thug Fianna Fáil geallúint dóibh go ndéanfaí ath-scrúdú ar a gcás an bhliain seo chugainn.  Tá súil agam nach mbeidh aon chur leis nó baint de, ach go ndéanfar an scrúdú sin; agus dó réir mar a bheas ceart, do réir cúrsaí costais, go bhfaghaidh na múinteoirí scoile an méid a mba cheart dóibh a fháil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is maith liom go bhfuil go bhfuil socraithe ag an Aire an t-ús d'ardú ar an airgead a <Col N="169" /> cuirtear isteach sa mBanc Taisce.  Tá an ceacht foghlumtha aige féin&mdash;nil aon duine is treise a bhíodh ag caint ar na rátaí úis agus ar a riachtanaí a bhí sé iad d'ísliú.</P>
    <P>Nuair a shocraigh an tAire deireannach an t-ús d'ísliú, ní raibh mise ró-chompordach faoi.  Chreid mé gur theastaigh rud réasúnta le daoine a mhealladh chun a gcuid airgid a chur i leathtaoibh.  Maidir leis an méid airgid atá imithe amach as an mBane Taisce, níl a fhios agam, pé, míniú atá leis, an é an míniú é thug an tOllamh Ó Briain.  Ní hé ragairne ná dúil san gcaitheamh a ba chiontach leis.  Tá dhá dhream ann a chuireann airgead sa mBanc Taisce&mdash;daoine mar lucht oibre, cléirigh agus a leithéidí, agus daoine a raibh airgead acu agus gur mhaith leo é a shábháil nuair nach raibh siad i ndon é a chaitheamh ar na rudaí ar mhaith leo a cheannach.  Chomh luath agus bhí na hearraí ar fáil agus a fuaireadar an deis, thógadar an t-airgead amach as an mBanc Taisce agus chaitheadar é chun rudaí a cheannach le haghaidh a gcuid tithe.</P>
    <P>An dara dream, agus an dream is mó a thug airgead as an mBanc Taisce, isé an dream saibhir.  Ní hiad lucht oibre amháin a chuireas airgead isteach ann, ach daoine deisiúla a bhí ag féachaint ar mhargadh an airgid agus a fuair ráta a bhí níos feiliúnaí dóibh.  Thógadar amach é as an mBanc Taisce agus chuireadar isteach é in aon rud a bhí ag dul.  Níl aon ghá bheith ag míniú faoin airgead a tugadh as.  Do caitheadh é&mdash;agus do caitheadh é go ciallmhar, is dóigh liom.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam, pé ar bith cén beartas diamhair atá ar intinn ag an Aire, go ndéanfaidh sé ath-smaoineadh ar airgead a shábháil ar obair na Gaeilge. Tá imní ar chuid de na daoine a bhfuil baint acu leis an nGaeilge, go bhfuil beartaithe aige deireadh a chur leis an Coimisiúin Log-Ainmneacha.  Tá súil agam go dtuigfidh an tAire chomh riachtanach agus atá sé go gcoineoimís an ceangal leis an am atá caite, eolas cruinn a bheith againn ar na seanainmeacha agus ar an stair a bhaineas leo.  Ag caint ar airgead a shábháil ar chlobhualadh dhá-theangach, ní fiú bheith ag caint ar an méid a sábhálfar, agus is fiú&mdash;cé nach bhfuil sé taibhsiúil <Col N="170" />&mdash;an maitheas a dhéanas sé go bhfeicfeadh daoine an Ghaeilge ar na foirmeacha éagsúla a bheas acu.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom aontú leis an Seanadóir Ó Briain agus an Seanadóir Ó Dubhghlais mar gheall ar an sórt cainte atá ar bun i gcoinne lucht tionscail na tíre seo.  Níl a fhios agam ar thuig an Taoiseach an dochar a rinne sé nuair a labhair sé mar labhair sé.  Teastaíonn uaim go mbeadh misneach agus muinín as an tír ag daoine, go mbeadh siad sásta tuille gnóthaí a chur ar bun.  Is rud fíor riachtanach é má táimid le breis daoine a choinneáil in Éirinn nach gcoinneofar iad ar an talamh.  Is féidir i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh leis an talamh ná mar déantar leis.  Beidh bárr daoine ann, áfach, agus beidh orainn gnóthaí nua a bhunú chun deis a thabhairt dóibh.  An t-aondeis amháin a bheas acu sin, má tá siad le fanacht sa tír, go gcuirfear tionscal nua ar bun.  Ní hé an bealach leis sin a chur á dhéanamh lucht tionscail a mhaslú ar a gcuid brabaigh.</P>
    <P>Má tá brabach éagórach ann is é dualgas an Aire é athógáil ó na daoine a bhfuil an brabach éagórach dá bhaint amach acus.  Ach ní doigh liom go mbaineann an gnáth-thionscalaí sa tír nó an gnáth-thrádálaí brabach iomarcach amach.  Thug an Seanadóir Ó Dubhghlais míniú dúinn i dtaoibh an &ldquo;oll-shochair&rdquo; agus na fáthanna a bhí leis.  A lán de mórdhíoltoirí agus a leithéidí níor thugadar a n-earraí don ghnáth-dhuine; choimeádadar dóibh féin iad agus rinneadar brabach thar an meán.  Ní abraim gur brabach éagcórach é, ach bhí sé níos mó ná rinne siad roimhe.</P>
    <P>Sin é an míniú a bhí leis an scéal. Deir an tAire gur ceart do na daoine gan a bheith ag caitheamh a gcuid airgid ach bheith foighdeach go ceann bliana.  Ba cheart don Aire a insint dúinn ceard iad na hearraí nach ceart do na daoine a cheannach, céard iad na rudaí nach ceart dúinn ár n-airgead a chaitheamh orthu.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom go bhféadfainn an Cháinfhaisnéis a mholadh ach an méid atá le moladh ann go deimhin milltear é ag an méid atá sé incháinte.  Labhair mé ar fad i nGaeilge.  Níl a fhios agam ar thuig an tAire mé ach tá súil agam <Col N="171" /> go dtuigfidh sé an méid seo, nach le droch-mheas air a labhair mé i nGaeilge.  Is í an Ghaeilge a chleachtaim agus is é mo cheart í a labhairt anseo agus tá súil agam nach dtógfaidh sé orm má dúirt mé an méid a bhí le rá agam i nGaeilge ar an mbealach adúirt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBurke" hpid="Mr. R.M. Burke Mr. R.M. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one important aspect of the Budget to which, I think, too little attention has been paid in the past.  I refer to the extent to which the Budget can be used to bring about a more equitable distribution of the wealth of the nation.  I agree that a certain amount has been done on these lines, but I also believe that more can be done in the future.  In spite of death duties and surtax during a number of years we still find one section of the community possessing a very large amount of the wealth of the country, and at the other end of the scale we find extreme poverty on a very large scale.  I believe that it is desirable if additional taxation is needed that it should come as far as may be practicable from taxing the wealthy sections of the community, and I think, therefore, that the increase in income-tax and surtax in this year's Budget is a move in the right direction.  It is far better to increase surtax than to impose taxes that would hit the poorer sections of the community.  I believe that if we are to bring about a more just social order based on Christian principles it is absolutely essential that the wealth of the country should be more justly divided.  In support of this argument I think it would be appropriate to quote a few very significant sentences from an eminent authority on this subject.  I refer to the Reverend Felim O'Brien, O.F.M., a Professor at University College, Galway.  In an article entitled &ldquo;The National Share-out,&rdquo; published in the April, 1947, issue of <i>Christus Rex</i>, he stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  &ldquo;There is a genuine grievance among the abnormally large class of miserably underpaid workers in Eire; (2)  before an employer should spend <Col N="172" /> his profits on luxuries for himself he should ensure that his workers can satisfy their normal human needs; (3)  bread for all before cake for anyone is an axiom that has many centuries of Christian tradition behind it; (4) in a country such as Eire where the national income is meagre, social justice imposes special standards of sacrifice and austerity on the upper income groups.  This standard of austerity is absent in this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He also made this statement: &ldquo;The equitable distribution of the national income invokes moral as well as economic considerations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now I have found that many people in this country do not seem to realise how unjustly the wealth is distributed because sufficient publicity is not given to the facts.  According to recent calculations 7.5 per cent. of the population of this country receive no less than 24 per cent. of the national income, 2.2 per cent. of the population receive 14.5 per cent of the national income and perhaps the most surprising aspect of it all is that 0.5 per cent. of the population receive 8.4 per cent of the total national income.  Those figures show that there are still a number of extremely wealthy people in this country. If anybody wishes to verify these statements the figures can be studied in the reports of the Revenue Commissioners, and the recent statement on national income.  I do not wish to delay the House going into these figures in detail now.</P>
    <P>The question, however, arises how the national income can be more equitably distributed, that is if people are agreed that it is desirable to attempt to do so.  I am well aware that there are some people who object and who are opposed to additional taxation on this very wealthy section of the community but I believe that it is desirable for several reasons.  In the first place how else can we increase adequately the standard of living of the poorer sections of the community? I admit that there are some other methods, but I do not think they are adequate.</P>
    <P>One obvious method is to increase production.  I think everybody in this House, members of all Parties, are <Col N="173" /> agreed that this is desirable, and I am hopeful that there will be greatly increased production and that the total national income will be increased.  But I believe that no matter how speedily we increase production it will inevitably take a considerable time to do so.  Therefore, in the meantime, some of the money will have to be raised by some other method.  Another method would be by taxing people with small and medium incomes, but I do not think there is anybody who has any doubts about the evils of that. Several Senators have spoken about the undesirability of putting taxation directly or indirectly on people with small or medium incomes.  I think we should increase taxation, when the time comes, on those with very large incomes.  I believe that these large incomes are undesirable from many points of view.  First of all a person with a large income inevitably, although indirectly, causes poverty.  It has been estimated that the wealth of the country, if evenly distributed, would give each worker approximately £4 per week.  I hope this figure will be increased with increased production. If, however, some people receive incomes of £5,000 or £10,000 a year, they are using up too much of the national income that could be devoted to raising the standard of living of families with less than £3 or £4 per week.</P>
    <P>Apart from this, I believe there is another serious evil in these large incomes and that is that they tend to divert manpower and materials from useful work to luxury employment. Many people with large incomes spend a considerable amount on luxuries and the manpower and material used in providing those luxuries could be turned to producing the useful goods needed by the masses of the people, and especially by the poorer sections. One example of this is in relation to housing.  I am informed that during recent years a certain amount of luxury dwellings have been built.  If the men employed in the building of these were diverted to clearing slums and the materials used in the building of these large luxury houses were used in the construction of small houses, many families living in slum conditions would <Col N="174" /> have had houses.  Some of these luxury houses cost from £5,000 to £10,000. I am glad to hear that this has been ended and that the materials and manpower being used in their erection will go to building the type of houses that the people need so badly.  Quite apart from housing I believe that people with large incomes draw manpower and materials into luxury trades and encourage the importation of luxuries.  I am glad to see from the recent statements following the conference by our Ministers with those of the British Government that there will be a limitation or reduction of luxury imports. All our imports should consist of those things needed by the masses of the people rather than luxuries for the few. The Reverend Felim O'Brien also mentioned in his recent article that he believed that the most callous section of our community were the profiteers. I think, generally speaking, that people who are very wealthy tend to become callous and selfish, and it would be a benefit to them as well as to the community to relieve them of some of their surplus wealth by additional taxation.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that all wealthy people are selfish or callous.  I agree that some of them are quite agreeable to the bringing about of a more equitable distribution of wealth.  I have been told by certain well-off people that they would have no objection whatever to higher taxation on themselves. Some wealthy people have even admitted that they had far too much money. That may surprise some people, but it is a fact.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one way, as the Minister says, but I agree that I would not approve of that method.  They could get rid of it by sending voluntary subscriptions to the Minister for Finance or to various deserving charities, but, in practice, very few people will do that.  These people stated that they would be willing to pay increased taxation provided that other wealthy persons were taxed similarly.  There <Col N="175" /> are other arguments used against taxing the rich.  One often hears it said that certain charitable institutions which receive contributions from wealthy people would suffer.  I believe that the amount which they would suffer would be very small, because a large amount of the money collected for charitable institutions comes from people with medium incomes.  If the social services were improved sufficiently some types of charity would not need as much funds as they do now, and the money raised by taxing the wealthier sections of the community could be used to improve our social services.  Many people advocate that our social services should be brought, at least, to the level of those in the Six Counties.  I agree, and I would like to see them raised higher for many reasons, but I do not intend to go into details on that aspect now.</P>
      <P>Another argument used against taxing the wealthier section is that there would be less money available for savings.  It has been stated, and stated truly, that some wealthy people spend a good deal less than their incomes, and invest a certain amount of money each year.  In that way they become richer each year and accumulate great wealth.  I agree that money is needed for investment, but I believe that such money could be found partly by encouraging people with medium incomes to save and to invest more.  If it were found that it was not possible to get enough in any other way, there could be a limited amount of compulsory investment in Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the method by which money could be collected from wealthy people, one way would be to increase income-tax and surtax on incomes over a certain figure.  I suggest that taxation could be first increased on persons with incomes over £5,000 a year, then going down gradually to persons with over £1,000 a year.  In addition I believe that there should be either an increase in death duties, or else some other form of capital tax.  I refer principally to the type of people who, when they die, leave over £20,000, and in some cases over £50,000.  One objection is sometimes raised to increasing <Col N="176" /> death duties.  It is that in some families there might be several deaths within a few years, and such a tax might fall heavily on them, whereas in other families there might be only one death of a wealthy person in 30 years.  It has been suggested therefore that a capital tax every five or ten years would be fairer.  That, however, is a matter of opinion.  Definitely there should be some form of increased capital tax, either in the form of increased death duties, or by some other method, with a view to collecting money from those people who have far too much.  That money could be used for raising the standard of living of the poorer sections of the community, especially old age pensioners, widows and orphans, blind persons, and lowly paid workers generally. That is one aspect of our national finance which, I think, deserves greater consideration in the future.  Our aim should be to bring about a more just and more equitable distribution of the national income in accordance with Christian principles.</P>

      <P>I desire to support Senator O'Brien's remarks with regard to the raising of income-tax.  He very properly pointed out that while other taxes had in the main been reduced income-tax had been raised. The Senator emphasised the interests of his constituents and I must emphasise, in the interest of my constituents, that this particular tax hits the professional classes, particularly teachers, writers, musicians, clerical workers and others.  It has been argued they are of the richer classes.  In my belief this tax hits the middle classes, who are now the most impoverished people in this nation, the white collar workers as they are called.  They may not be the backbone of the State, but they influence the thoughts and aspirations of the nation, probably more than any other class.  As the Senator emphasised, creative work such as they do eminently needs freedom and leisure from anxiety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister to try to reduce income-tax.  It is, I believe, an easy tax to impose and also easy to collect. It would probably take a considerable effort on the part of the Minister to <Col N="177" /> reject an increase in income-tax in favour of some other tax, but I insist that such an increase has an undesirable effect in many ways on a most valuable element in our society.</P>
    <P>Is it a fact that children's allowances still mean a loss of money each year to those in the middle class level of income?  Certainly at the beginning, to those with families of more than two children it meant a loss of £1 a year. They lost the rebate on income-tax and gained simply half-a-crown a week. As a matter of fact there was an impious hope that the middle classes would not bother to collect the half-crown weekly, and that the State would be richer by something like £7 10s. 0d. annually from such people.  In fact, however, most of them, like myself, collect the half-crown for each additional child and will probably continue to do so.  We resent the fact that we are paying £7 10s. 0d. in taxation to the State for every child over two. Does the Minister wish to discourage middle-class families from having more than two children?  If not, I hope he will look into the question of children's allowances.</P>
    <P>Another matter for commendation is the Minister's restoration of the 2½ per cent. interest on Post Office accounts. It is a small thing, but it was welcome news to hundreds of thousands of people.  The fact was that the reduction of the rate was symptomatic of what is happening in our society. It was symptomatic of a disease which is roughly but expressively called &ldquo;squandermania&rdquo;.  It meant that people were to be encouraged to spend and not to save, and is partly the result of the war when goods were short and people became habituated to buying at almost any cost.  Now the inclination has remained among us though conditions have changed.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister very strongly to begin a savings campaign on a national scale.  This tendency to squander would suit a nation of shopkeepers, but we are not a nation of shopkeepers, though many have thought that the trend of legislation in the last few years implied that we were or that we intended to become a nation of shopkeepers. I think it is most commendable <Col N="178" /> in the Minister, in this small way, to begin to encourage savings again. He has also made it clear in his recent speeches that he wishes people to save. The Roman Senate, after which we are called, sometimes had to introduce sumptuary laws to curb extravagance. They were never popular and I am sure the Minister is well aware of that. They did good, but there is no need for anything so drastic now.</P>
    <P>We do not need to coerce people to save, but I firmly believe that we need to encourage people to save.  If one travels into neighbouring States one sees on the walls of railway stations and other public places attractive and persuasive posters: &ldquo;Save now!  Save now!&rdquo;  I see nothing of the kind in this country though I think such a thing would be desirable.  We see all around us in our own country attractive posters encouraging us to spend now. That is what the best shopkeepers do, and more power to them if they can do it in their own interest.  Though I do not intend to delay over it now, I think the time may come when we may have to delay over it&mdash;that is the influence of the State-supported Irish Sweepstakes.  Those responsible issue most cleverly designed posters and through radio propaganda they are constantly encouraging citizens to spend in the most unproductive way: to spend small sums and sometimes big sums in the hope of getting large quantities of money without earning them.</P>
    <P>I think the time may come when we will have to examine the effect of this large-scale gambling on our national and financial condition.  I would urge then the Minister to sponsor a national savings campaign not against good living but against extravagant living at all levels.  One does not need to be a rich man to live extravagantly.  I think that in many ways some of the poorest amongst us live more extravagantly, according to their rate of income, than do most of our rich people. I suggest for that purpose the use of posters and advertisements designed by competent and progressive artists, the people whom I have just mentioned as being injured by the increase in income-tax. Someone has well said that the hoardings will be the popular art galleries <Col N="179" /> of the future.  It will be a great thing if the Minister, and indeed all the Ministers do something to make our hoardings the popular art galleries of to-day and of the future and link that with the strong influence of a savings campaign.  I suggest, even though this is a more technical matter, that he should give us financial encouragement to save something on the lines of the increase in the rate of interest on Post Office savings.  The fact is that the old virtues of thrift and providence were starved and defamed in the diabolical conditions of the war and if action is not taken soon to strengthen these virtues then artificial respiration will fail to revive them.  We look to the Minister to do something to save these old and valuable virtues.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to speak on this Bill, because one does not know when one is in order or out of order.  If I were to confine myself to what is actually in the Bill I would have very little to say.  I join with the last speaker in commending the Minister for having restored the old rate of 2½ per cent. on Post Office savings. That was a very good move.  It will help to encourage thrift, and thrift, as the last speaker has emphasised, is a virtue in which we are lacking and without which we cannot progress.  But if we begin to save and are careful we may get rich.  What will happen then? Senator Burke may come along and take what people had saved&mdash;what they had earned by hard work and the practice of prudence.  If the people were looking around for sound investments for their money he would take it and give it to somebody else.  That reminds me of an old cousin of mine.  I think he was a pro-Socialist&mdash;the first that I ever met.  I was very young at the time and I do not know that I was much impressed by his argument. He said: &ldquo;All the wealth of the world should be put in one big heap and then everyone should get an equal divide.&rdquo; Somebody said to him: &ldquo;Well, Hughie, but you would drink your share, what would you do then?&rdquo;  His answer was: &ldquo;Let us have another divide.&rdquo;  I must say that put me on my guard against Socialism as he conceived it. <Col N="180" /> I am afraid there is a good deal of Hughie's philosophy of life in what Senator Burke has been dealing out to the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all that I have to say on the Finance Bill as it stands.  In view of the way the discussion on the Bill has progressed, I would not seem to be out of order in discussing the Budget proposals and what lies beneath them.  It seems to me that the Budget is what might be described as a standstill Budget.  That is not to be wondered at when we remember the circumstances of its conception and birth. The Government that presented it had not much time to formulate any positive policy or to give us a clear indication of what its approach would be to our major national problems. Next year, if the Government is still in office, we will be better able to judge and perhaps get a clearer light on the direction in which the Government is going to provide solutions for our great problems, which to my mind are unemployment&mdash;with its allied evils&mdash; emigration and the high cost of living. These are the things which the Government has really not had time to sit down to, and it would not be fair to us to judge of its achievements until it has been longer in office.  At the same time we know its genesis: that the Parties that compose it had only one common objective as far as we could know, and that was: &ldquo;Put them out&mdash; put out Fianna Fail.&rdquo;  Well, unfortunately from my point of view, the country responded to that, and, hateful as it is to our self-conceit on this side of the House, they did throw us out, though I do not think the country realised that, in throwing out Fianna Fáil, they also, as it is commonly called, threw out the baby with the bath.  They not only threw out Fianna Fáil, but I have the fear&mdash;I hope it is not a justified fear&mdash;that they may have also thrown out the courageous forward looking self-relying policy which I believe Fianna Fáil stood for, without which we cannot make the most of our post-war position or the most of the development of our natural resources. I do not think the country realised that was going to happen, or that when they did combine to put us out they were <Col N="181" /> throwing out the one chance we may ever have of taking our place in the air.  They did not think they were going to sell our Constellations and renounce all our chance of getting a place in the air.</P>
    <P>When we look back on Irish history we find that one of the greatest things we have to lament is that, although we were an island with the sea all round us, we did not develop as a maritime nation.  Maybe we did, in the days of Niall of the Nine Hostages, who got a bad name for himself raiding Europe. After that, we had no shipping or fishing and that was a desperate thing to say of an island.  However, there was an excuse for us: we were not our own masters.  We were deprived of the opportunities of developing our shipping and our fishing.  Now, in this part of Ireland, we are as free as the air. We got this freedom at a time when the development of the air was in its first stages.  We saw a chance of getting in on the ground floor, and I am sorry that that opportunity seems to be missed.  It may be said that we are a poor country and the Minister seems to think we could not afford it; but there are many countries which the war has made much poorer than we are&mdash; we suffered only from the backwash&mdash; yet they thought it well to spend the money that would secure their place in the air.  It was most regrettable and I was very sorry that the Minister was persuaded by the policy of retrenchment to sacrifice that great chance.</P>
    <P>In these discussions on the Budget, I have always tried to speak from the national point of view, rather than from the Party point of view; and I know I am voicing the opinion of a great many people of every Party when I deplore that development.  The country would have been well content to spend what was necessary for developing our short-wave station.  We have Irish people in all parts of the earth who are eager to listen to the voice of the motherland, and hardly any nation could make better use of a short-wave station.  In the event of war, it could help us from being isolated.</P>
    <P>In regard to turf, just before I came to Dublin I had a letter in reply to one I wrote to my own home town to get <Col N="182" /> turf.  I did not think they would go back to coal, as they were accustomed to turf.  The writer said that, unfortunately, turf around Galway would be very scarce and very dear.  I am not telling this to the Minister so as to make any capital out of it.  It is a deplorable fact.  It will be very hard on places like Galway, on many poor people&mdash;I am one of the poor myself and income-tax does not worry me too much&mdash;as we all depend on turf and if it is going to be very scarce and dear it will be hard on the people.  It may not be too late&mdash;and that is why I mention it&mdash;for the Minister to make it quite clear that there will be a market for all the turf produced.  It is very important that he should state that.  I will show the Minister the letter if he likes and he will see that it comes from a supporter of his own.  It is just a statement of the facts&mdash;the regrettable facts.</P>
    <P>There are two smaller economies that I think the country rather regrets&mdash;one is the £25,000 for the development of athletics.  One could not help thinking it was well spent money.  One of the great dangers the Government will have to face is the new attitude towards drink, and to preserve young people from drink there is nothing better, after religion and the training of the will, than athletics.  If you have a good healthy scheme of athletics and if people are encouraged to take part in athletics, it is a great protection against that evil.  If the Minister can restore that £25,000&mdash;perhaps in the next Budget he will do so&mdash;it will be a great thing.</P>
    <P>I regret, too, that the £85,000 earmarked in the Book of Estimates for minerals development is being cancelled.  I know that Senator Stanford does not like sweepstakes, but I think it is not a bad idea when you can put 10/- into the sweepstakes and so help the hospitals and get the chance of winning £25,000.  This £85,000 would be an investment as if in a sweepstake.  If we did not get the minerals we hoped for, we might get something that would be very useful in years to come.  Science has made great advances, and if we only knew what was beneath our soil we might be <Col N="183" /> able to make use of it.  I hope the Minister will restore the grant as soon as things get right.  We cannot criticise the Minister very much because he is not long in office to have information about everything.  He is a very clever man and I have great respect for his brains and enterprise, but I think if he looks at it he might restore that small sum.</P>
    <P>In other respects I have to congratulate him.  I am glad he kept to the promise made during the election to the old-age pensioners and that the pension will be raised to some extent, as well as the non-contributory widows' and orphans' pension.  He must not forget the old pensioned teachers.  I have heard arguments against them and I could never be convinced.  Every time I get up on an appropriation Bill I talk about them, but I could never get the official mind to make a move. There is some financial theory that prevents it, and I never could grasp it. It is outrageous that the teachers who gave the best years of their lives should now be in dire poverty, and I hope the Minister will do something about it.</P>
    <P>I must commend him for what he has done in making the grant to Cork University College for the provision of a hostel to accommodate the students. It is a crying need.  I need not tell the Minister as he knows the position in Dublin himself much better than I do. I hope he will get into consultation with the heads of the university and that something will be done.  The money spent on university education cannot be properly utilised or bear its full fruits if the students are living under appalling conditions, as a good many of them are, at least in Galway, and, I am sure, in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister luck.  He has a difficult job and we all hope he will succeed.  On the Finance Bill, we should not talk so much on Party lines.  We might criticise freely, but we should do it from the point of view of helping the Minister to do his difficult work well and do it for the good of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has on this occasion the rather doubtful privilege of discussing a Finance Bill which makes provision for a higher <Col N="184" /> amount than ever has come before the Oireachtas.  I appreciate, of course, that these Estimates were prepared by the outgoing Government and that the present Government cannot accept responsibility for them in the ordinary way.  In this connection, it is well to remember that, in 1932-33, when Deputy de Valera was defending the action of the Government in withholding the land annuities and other payments to the amount of £5,000,000 per annum from Britain, he used to say that the taxable capacity of Great Britain and Éire was in the ratio of 66 to 1.  Hence he argued that £5,000,000 a year to Éire was the equivalent of £330,000,000 per annum to Great Britain.  For example, on 16th November, 1932, he said in the Dáil:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are paying a sum to Britain which corresponds to £330,000,000 a year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Taken on this estimate, £76,000,000 the amount of this year's Estimates would be the equivalent of over £5,000,000,000 sterling in the case of Britain.  In actual fact, nothwithstanding the circumstances in which that country is paying the cost of the most disastrous war in recorded history, the British estimates amount to less than £3,000,000,000 and, out of that amount, £500,000,000 has to be paid on war debt, £700,000,000 on defence at home and abroad, £400,000,000 on food subsidies and £350,000,000 on pensions, family allowances, etc., to maintain one of the best social security schemes in existence.  We have no war debt on which to pay interest.  We do not have to maintain naval, military and air forces over a great part of the earth and our social security provisions are far and away inferior to those in operation in Great Britain.  In these circumstances, the wastefulness of our expenditure, having regard to our taxable capacity and to the return we make to our people for all this expenditure, must be obvious to all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, necessity and commonsense have been sacrificed to what has been known as prestige.  Grandiose air services, calculated to serve the pleasure needs of war profiteers, have been established at great national <Col N="185" /> expense, while the ordinary citizens of Dublin and other cities have had to stand for hours in the rain in queues because of an inadequate transport service, although we could buy at least 100 buses for one Constellation which cost us £250,000.  While the country as a whole, or at least that part served by Córas Iompair Éireann, has been left for years without any transport whatever, either road or rail, on Sundays, on the grounds of austerity and the difficulty of obtaining the necessary transport equipment, we purchased and furnished palatial hotels, at national expense also, to tickle the palates of war profiteers of this and other lands.  While the ordinary citizen has to stay at home during the holiday time, because he cannot get even an ordinary lodging house at the seaside, building materials were made available for cinemas, aerodromes and luxury houses to the great detriment of homes for the ordinary citizen, so that the housing position has become desperate beyond anything we have yet experienced.</P>
    <P>For five or six years, wages were effectively controlled, clamped down to a maximum of 16/- per week bonus over and above pre-war rates, while the so-called control of prices, notwithstanding anything said by Senator Douglas, turned out to be an absolutely tragic farce.  I say that not in regard to everybody, because I think Senator Douglas does speak for the better and more honest type of manufacturer and trader, but in regard to certain considerable sections of the population. Certain people got away with murder in this connection.  It could not be otherwise, because any attempt at price fixing was on the basis of the least efficient unit in any particular industry and on that basis was calculated not only the manufacturer's profits but the wholesaler's profits and the profits of the retailer.  Then the half-hearted excess profits tax, which nevertheless realised over £4,000,000 per annum, was handed back, but not 1d. reduction in the cost of any single commodity emerged as a result.  The tendency, in fact, was the other way.</P>
    <P>The simple fact remains to-day, no matter what anybody may say, that, <Col N="186" /> while wage and salary earners are almost entirely in an infinitely and disastrously worse position from the purchasing point of view than they were in 1939, those who have been engaged in production and distribution have had a golden age.  These people all, or almost all, enjoy prosperity without precedent, while the worker who even suggests a return to his pre-war standards is designated a Communist and is looked upon as being outside the pale.  We are asked how could the world have gone through the most disastrous and destructive war in history and everybody expect to be as well off as he was before it.  That sounds logical enough even to countries which were not themselves in war, but it applies only to certain sections, to a majority of the community, and it is, in my view, utterly unfair that certain privileged sections of the community should be infinitely better off than they could ever have been in the piping days of peace.</P>
    <P>The newly-rich, determined to have a good time, have indulged in orgy of expensive pleasures, setting the worst possible example to workers trying to make ends meet, and when I say &ldquo;workers,&rdquo; I mean not only the manual worker but the salaried worker and lower middle-class.  Look at the vast display of expensive motor cars, two or three of them belonging to the same family, to be seen in the centre of Dublin every night and the orgy of expenditure in the principal hotels would lead any visitor to believe that Dublin was a modern Babylon.  This has been written up by all the foreign Press.  They talk about the wonderful steaks and so on which can be supplied in Dublin hotels, while the tragic fact remains that a considerable number of Dublin citizens rarely eat meat or can possibly afford it.  Is it any wonder that, when it comes to a question of assessing our assistance under the Marshall Aid plan, the United States Government, because of this propaganda worked up by the previous Government and by various publicity organisations, comes to the conclusion that Ireland is not entitled to any free grant under that plan?</P>
    <P>The amount of money in circulation <Col N="187" /> as a result of these excess profits&mdash;I am not referring to ordinary profits and I do not begrudge them to the people who have got the excess profits, but I say that it is wrong for a Government to have facilitated them in that connection&mdash;tends definitely to inflation and that was perfectly obvious last autumn. Deputy de Valera proposed to solve this problem, not by trying to collect this surplus money in the form of special taxation or anything of that kind, but by bringing in a new Emergency Powers Order, clamping down wages again, notwithstanding the fact that wages here had risen on an average by something less than 50 per cent. while prices had gone up by over 80 per cent.  Speaking in the Dáil on 15th October, 1947, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government regards this temporary limitation of wages increases as vitally necessary in present circumstances, and if the trade unions cannot undertake such an agreement as I have outlined, then the Government will produce proposals for legislation to the same effect.  To avoid possible misunderstanding, I should say here that if such legislation is necessary, it will relate to wage rates prevailing at this date, October 15th.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the manner in which inflationary tendencies were to be checked &mdash;not by collecting the surplus of what would be normal profits, but by taking from those who had got very much less than their pre-war standard of life.</P>
    <P>Fearing inflation, the new rich have been rushing to turn their easily-secured gains into property, including house property.  One result of this has been to send house prices soaring to fantastic heights and has caused luxury building to attract away from the ordinary contractor who builds for bodies like the Dublin Corporation the skilled workers whom these builders of luxury houses are paying 4/6 an hour instead of the 3/3 paid by the ordinary builder.  They know they can get the price for the house, no matter what it is.  This has made it absolutely impossible for people of small and medium means to get an ordinary shelter, and there is no measurable time within <Col N="188" /> which conditions may change to enable them to get a home at a price at which they can possibly pay.  I do not mind these people investing as they have been doing in expensive jewellery and works of art, the qualities of which very few of them, I believe, can appreciate, but when it comes to a form of exploitation which affects the ordinary citizen in the matter of such elementary essentials as a home, it becomes a very serious matter.</P>
    <P>A lot of this easily acquired money could have been taken up, as has been done elsewhere, in the form of taxation and the amount realised in that way might have been used for the purpose of subsidising utility clothing and furniture, as has been done elsewhere.  It might have been used for the purpose of increasing the miserably low pensions paid to the aged poor, to the blind, and by way of children's allowances, or it might have been utilised, in part, for relieving the burden on the lower income groups, about whom Senator O'Brien and Senator Bigger have spoken.  In that connection, I should like to support the remarks made regarding the complete absence of anything in the nature of encouragement of voluntary savings.  We have not got a single society here encouraging that.  The Minister's predecessor seemed to go deliberately out of his way to discourage private saving by reducing from 2½ to 2 per cent. the rate paid on Post Office investments.  If the Minister did nothing else but to restore the old rate, he has done well in his Budget.</P>
    <P>Another sinister feature of the present position is the failure of traders, manufacturers and others, to respond to the Minister's request for an attempt to reduce prices.  This is a very stark reality and it has got to be faced not only by the Government but by the country as a whole.  The only response so far has been a very sharp and critical rejoinder from a member of the Oireachtas speaking for those in a position to reduce prices, a sort of gesture of defiance, instead of doing, as a number of manufacturers have done in Britain, coming together and trying to see to what extent they can meet the request of the Minister on <Col N="189" /> the other side in the matter of reducing prices.  The unfortunate part of it is that these people, during this golden age for them, have got into such a habit of getting abnormal profits that they are not now prepared to accept normal gains.  I am afraid they regard the Minister's threat to get the unreasonable profits as mere bluff.</P>
    <P>It is time, I think, that we dropped the idea that it is patriotic on our part to allow ourselves to be exploited by certain people just because they happen to be natives of this country. Whenever a complaint is made about abnormal and unjustifiable charges, we are immediately reminded of the marvellous employment which these people give.  One would imagine that this was the only country in the world in which employers gave employment, or that employers in this country were merely philanthropists, who were not running industry for private gain and profits at all but merely for the purpose of giving employment to some wretched worker who otherwise would have nothing to live on.  Unless we are to have fantastically high prices and a very low standard of life, protected industries will have to rely far more on efficiency and enterprise and a good deal less on tariffs and embargoes.</P>
    <P>Whenever there is an attempt to adjust the balance and a certain amount of imports are allowed, we have a howl about alleged dumping.  Competition in any form is denounced by anybody here who has anything to sell as dumping, even though it is the most fair form of competition.  We had, for instance, at one period of 1944, the absurd position in which the import of tomatoes was prohibited, and in which the Irish tomatoes available could be obtained at 7/6 per lb.  I remember checking up on that and mentioning it at a meeting of the Trade Union Congress.  That meant that these tomatoes produced here could be bought here only by the very well-to-do, and, until they were sold out, the ordinary lower-paid and middle-paid worker was entirely deprived of the right to buy anything in the nature of a tomato.</P>
    <P>If we give Irish manufacturers the Irish market to the full extent to which they can supply it, and I am in favour <Col N="190" /> of that, we should do so only on condition that, quality for quality, they sell as cheaply as do manufacturers in nations in which the same rate of wages or a higher rate of wages is paid.  I think that is eminently fair.  We give them the market absolutely free of competition to the extent to which they can supply it, but they must not ask us to pay higher prices than are paid for similar commodities, quality for quality, in countries where the rate of wages is at least as high, or even higher.  Otherwise, we must inevitably adjust the rate of wages to the new scale of prices, and, in order to do that at present, it would be necessary to have about a 30 per cent. increase in existing wage rates.  If we do that in order to meet the requirements of tariffed industries, we have to take into consideration the position of these industries which have no protection, industries like transport, like agriculture, and will have to lift up the purchasing power of the agricultural consumer to meet the new and increased prices.</P>
    <P>One more fact is that, taking quality for quality, there is at the moment a whole range of articles here that are far higher in price than those obtaining in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, notwithstanding the fact that in Great Britain and Northern Ireland they pay a very heavy purchase tax. Is there any explanation or justification for this state of affairs?  I have heard it stated that our people here are not satisfied with the same rates of profits accepted elsewhere, or alternatively that their efficiency or experience is far below the normal standard. They rely upon protection, upon tariffs, and upon their being able to exploit the community by charging any particular prices they like.  Even where they do not make excessive profits notwithstanding the high prices, it is probably because they have not achieved the high state of efficiency that normal competition would compel them to attain.  Emphasis has rightly been laid on the fact that agriculture is our best and basic industry.  At any rate it is one of the very few able to sell in competition on the world market.  Yet during the past 15 or 16 <Col N="191" /> years the industry has steadily declined until to-day it is, I think, in a worse position than at any period in the lifetime of this generation.  There are nearly 1,000,000 less sheep in the country than in 1931 and the position is getting steadily worse.  If you take January, 1947, and compare it with January, 1948, there are 172,000 less cattle, 153,000 less sheep, and 84,000 less pigs.</P>
    <P>The same decline is evidenced in poultry, eggs and butter.  Yet agriculture is the only substantial source from which we can hope in the measurable future to get exports to pay for the imports we need.  For this reason the treaty which has been made between the Governments of Great Britain and this country can be an excellent one for us if we are able to exploit it, but unless we can develop and increase our agricultural production in all its departments to the utmost possible extent it becomes a meaningless thing.  In this connection I would like to mention that farmers and farm workers must get articles produced by secondary industries at an economic price.  If they cannot get their needs at prices which are economically sound we cannot expect the people to remain on the land and develop the land and expand production to the extent that requirements demand.  There should be more attention paid to this side of our economy and less to the question of prestige, which is merely a propagandist façade with nothing of substance behind it.  The present Government seems to have started their career with a sense of realism and I hope they will maintain and develop it to the utmost of their power during their period of office, whether that period be short or long.  I regret to find from the other side of the House so many complaints because of the savings effected by the Budget.  That is an extraordinary attitude of mind from a Party who came into power on slogans of retrenchment and economy.  They criticised the previous Government because the taxation then was £23,000,000 per annum, and they promised to run the country on something like £15,000,000 per annum.  Even allowing for the increase in the cost of everything, <Col N="192" /> they increased that £15,000,000 five-fold, and it is something abnormal in view of all that, to find them complaining of economy in this extremely high Budget.  One of the forms of activity in which they indulged was on the lines of digging holes and filling them in again.  In other words they would keep on cutting turf which no one wants because the price was uneconomic.</P>
    <P>Senator Mrs. Concannon referred to the position in Galway.  I suggest Galway can go on as it did pre-war, producing turf by private enterprise at an economic rate.  Surely it is not suggested that this essential war-time measure should be continued now.  It is alleged that 20,000 more people are unemployed since this Government came into power.  That is not so. There are 20,000 more people registered because people with four acres of land could not register previously, only people with two acres could register. That is not an increase in unemployment. It is an increase in the facilities for giving unemployment benefit to more people.  There is one question I would like to ask the Minister merely for the purpose of getting information.  He referred in the Dáil to a rather abnormal incident that took place on the day before the present Government took office when 75,000 tons of wheat were purchased from the Argentine at the enormous figure of £50 per ton, involving the State in a subsidy of £2,000,000.  This wheat was bought by agents, and I would like to get from the Minister what are the conditions under which these agents are employed for this purpose. Are they paid a salary or does their salary carry a commission?  Did any individual outside the Government gain as a result of this purchase what he would not have gained if the purchase had not been completed?  Reckless suggestions had been made and I think it would be well if they were dispelled. My impression is that these people have a salary and that they gain nothing whatever whether a purchase is completed or not.  On the whole, I would like to congratulate the Government on the sense of realism displayed for the first time in several years and on the Budget which has been introduced <Col N="193" /> and on the Estimates to the extent that the Government has been able to influence them.  But I would like to say that a good deal more is expected of them.  As Senator Professor O'Brien pointed out, we were going on with the same colossal expenditure as if we had been in the war and suffered all the horrors and destruction that nations in the war did suffer.  We have been priding ourselves that we escaped all those things and yet we were imposing taxation that was equivalent to over £5,000,000,000 in the case of Great Britain.  That is the equivalent of the £76,000,000, which is the amount of this year's Estimate.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance is attacked from three different positions.  He is criticised by Fianna Fáil for what he has done and he is criticised by others for what he has not done and by others still for what he may propose to do in the future but there has been very little detailed criticism or examination of the Budget. I think the Party viewpoint should not operate in discussing the Budget. Speaking for myself and giving my own view I would say that I think the Minister should not have taken the additional tax off beer, tobacco and wine. That is my own personal opinion and I think we should be able to express our own personal opinions.  We cannot be told then that we committed our Party to a policy.  I have seen Senators standing up here when their own particular interests are affected. Once that happens the Party interests are submerged.  My view is that taxation should be put on luxuries and not on necessaries.  Nobody would have died of thirst if the price of the pint had remained a little higher than it is at present and, if the money so got could have been put to some constructive purpose, it should have been done. But supposing we leave that out and say that the Minister was committed to reducing these taxes because of the statements made by the different Parties in opposition during the election. He had this difficulty to face. Senator Mrs. Concannon said that there was danger he might throw out the baby with the bath water.  He <Col N="194" /> found himself in the position of having to take over a Book of Estimates compiled by a Government with which he did not agree and whose policy he had attacked during the election.  He took over the Book of Estimates and, had he carried out all their proposals, he would have been kicked out of the country and might as well have gone over to join Fianna Fáil before the election.  He was committed to altering these but it was not that he was in danger of throwing out the baby with the bath water; he was afraid that the baby would be drowned in the bath if he did not throw out something. He threw out some of these taxes.  I would have liked him to put on further taxes.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke talked about additional taxes and Senator Douglas deplored the possibility that there ever will be taxation higher than it is now. So did other speakers.</P>

      <P>Senator Douglas read a very lengthy thesis on taxation in general which had very little to do with the Budget because he criticised a tax that is not imposed in the present Finance Bill.  He devoted his statements, as far as I was capable of understanding them, to the possibility that sometime in the future there would be an excess profits tax and he wanted to make sure, if he could, to prevent it. There is no excess profits tax proposed in this Bill.  I thought, therefore, he was providing for the possible rainy day ahead by raising the umbrella now.</P>

      <P>If I had been the Minister, I would have imposed new taxation.  It is easy to say that because I am never likely to be Minister for Finance, but I would have put a heavier tax on betting because far too <Col N="195" /> much money in this country goes over the bookmakers' counters in the betting shops and far too much money is brought down to the race meetings and pent there.  If there is taxation on betting, it is very low taxation.  I believe even at the low rate they have imposed on it, it brings in somewhere about £500,000 a year.  If a man wants to put £1 or £10 or 10/- on a dog or a horse, I think the State should take as big a proportion of that as possible because, one way or another, the chances are ten to one that he will never see his money again.  Most of what he bets, whether on a horse or a dog, never comes back to him.  I would have put heavier taxation on betting.  There are other things I would do.</P>
      <P>I am not fascinated by all this talk about improved social services.  There must be good social services in the country and the social services should be available to everybody who needs them but as few as possible should have to depend on the State to do the things that they ought to do themselves. I will say this, and let who likes make what capital he wants to make out of it, that a good deal of the money that goes to people in this country in the form of social services or doles or some other way goes, not to their families, but to the people who have the £1,000 motor cars, because a lot of it goes in betting, a lot of it goes in extravagant spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people here seem to think that a rise in wages automatically will raise the standard of living of the people. It will not.  Wages have risen and risen and the standard of living will not rise until the people have a new outlook. You can raise wages and still keep the people, or rather still let them stay, in a deplorable condition if they do not want to raise themselves.  We have not talked enough commonsense to our people.  We have not persuaded them that much of the things they complain about are of their own making.  That is my honest belief and I have worked in this country in lowly-paid jobs and I understand the position of the workers.  Ninety or 99 per cent. of the workers are decent people, but there <Col N="196" /> are amongst the workers, as there are amongst every class, an element whose activities I do not approve of.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned very much about the abandoning of the short-wave radio station, so I can talk on both sides.  A short-wave radio station might be a good thing if we knew what we were going to broadcast to the world, but if we are merely going to tell the world what a poor opinion we have of ourselves and what a very deplorable people we are, we had better do without it.  There are things more essential than that at the moment.  If we cannot get on here in harmony at the moment, if we cannot set our own house in order, what do we want to tell the world, what is the world's interest in us?  The expenditure on a short-wave station might be a desirable thing in future.  It might even be a desirable thing now if we had some sort of unity in this country and if we could have a policy to put before the world as a united nation.  We have not got that yet and merely to indulge in a short-wave station now because there may be another war in a few years' time and we want to tell the world what we think of them and what we think of the war seems to me an extravagance we might well avoid.  In my opinion, it is as unjustifiable as a man on the dole buying a radiogram.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned a great deal about the abandoning of the transatlantic air service.  My namesake has given very good reasons for it.  A transport service for our own people, in my opinion, is much more important and should come first.  By all means let us have a transport service for foreigners into and out of this country bye and bye but it is not the most pressing thing.  We need not get in a panic about it.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the abandoning of the proposal to search for minerals and to spend a certain amount of money on it.  No great harm has been done by that.  If the money were there, I would like to see it done immediately but the minerals, if they be there at all, have been there for a good many thousands of years and probably will remain there for another 12 months.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="197" /> Deputy Hawkins made points about the increase in the cost of living.  I think that was merely propaganda; he really did not believe half the things he said because the increase in the cost of living brought about by the additional halfpenny, or whatever it may be, on margarine, is not going to kill anybody or leave anybody hungry. I do not know what the present price of margarine is but Senator Hawkins says that the increase brings the price of margarine to 2/- a lb.  That is certainly a tragedy but I can remember, and probably he can, when margarine was selling at 6d. per lb.  How did it get from 6d. to 1/11½d. without somebody protesting on behalf of the poor? It was only the last ½d., the last straw, that brought any protest.</P>
    <P>There are a lot of things like that, if you look back.  No protest has been made at all about the other things that went on and it was not always taxation that put prices up.  I can remember also, as can a good many people in this House, when you bought other things very cheaply and they have gone to extraordinarily high prices now and it was not the Minister for Finance that put them up, and no protest was made. One instance is matches.  There was a time when you bought six boxes for a penny, and five for a penny without any compliment.  You have to pay 1½d. a box now.  It is not all extra taxation that put them up.  There may have been other contributory causes but nobody protested and the poor man has to buy matches year after year.</P>
    <P>Senator Professor O'Brien protested against income-tax as an unjust tax. Income-tax is a hard tax to pay because it means handing back something after you have got it, and if you once get it into your hands you will think very hard of parting with it.  I know income-tax when originally introduced was to be a purely temporary measure and was only 1d. in the £.  It was to disappear the next year. Income-tax has gone up from that penny year after year.  No great protest was made.  It is only the last sixpence that creates the criticism.  Even that sixpence would have come whether you had a change of Government or not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> I am in sympathy with doing something to improve the condition of the salaried classes, the middle classes, the professional classes&mdash;give them any of the names by which they are usually known.  But I do not believe that Professor O'Brien is quite right in saying that they above all others need leisure, comfort, high salaries and protection from any worries that might arise over the possibility of increased taxation. He says that unless they have all those things, literature, and art and science will suffer.  I do not want to take from the middle classes or from the professional classes any credit to which they are entitled, because by some mischance I became a member of the middle class myself, having graduated lower down, but I can recall such names as Burns, Mangan, O'Carolan, Connellan, Chatterton, Blake and Thompson, even Karl Marx&mdash;I present him to Deputy Burke&mdash;and Johnson.  I could go on.  Not one of them had security, not one of them was in a sheltered profession, not one of them had leisure, and not one of them could have been protected from the income-tax. Every one of them, you might say, if he belonged to the middle class at all, certainly belonged to the lower middle class in the matter of income. I do not think any class has a monopoly of brains or genius in this or any other country.  If I had been Minister for Finance I would have imposed the excess profits duty.  The very name-itself is sufficient justification for it.</P>
    <P>If profits are being made in excess of what they normally should be they should be taken back.  I remind the Minister that he can threaten pressure to take back the additional profits, but until he takes steps to do so these people will continue to make the additional profits.  Additional and unfair profits have been made.  During the war some of us did complain when there were Standstill Orders against workers, while unfair and unreasonable profits have been made, but we suggested that the workers were not getting a fair do.  Everybody protested then that there was no such thing as profiteering, but Senator Douglas now stands up and admits that there was profiteering, so that each in turn lays <Col N="199" /> his hand on his heart and says: &ldquo;It was the other fellow; it was not I.&rdquo; There has been profiteering somewhere, when excess profits are made.  They have been made and they are still being made.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Farrell has pointed to the number of luxurious motor cars in the city and country as being proof that a great many people got rich too quickly and got rich on too little work.  I could quote cases of people who profiteered. I know a man who at one time had not 5/-, yet a couple of months afterwards was a business man, wholesaling stuff.  Then he was arrested and prosecuted for selling stuff other than what it was described to be.  He went to jail, but before doing so the profits he made were carefully stowed away.  He then came out of jail, having got a remission of his sentence, but with the hidden profits started two or three industries.  He is now one of the new industrialists in the city, whose photograph can be seen in the newspapers under the caption &ldquo;Mr. so-and-so.&rdquo; I could give names, but I do not want to bring them further into the limelight.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will keep another matter in mind.  I understand that when people break the revenue laws by attempting to smuggle gold or other things, when captured and brought to trial they are sentenced and fined perhaps £1,000 or £2,000 with the alternative of 6 months imprisonment. I understand that all they have to do is to go to jail for six months.  Being first or second-grade prisoners they can get their food brought in, can live in comfort, get a remission for good conduct and at the end they are free.  On the other hand, if a person commits a burglary and is captured, whatever he has burgled is taken from him and the offender is sent to jail where he is not treated as a first or second grade prisoner.  Why keep up a pretence like that?  Thousands of pounds could be secured if such fines were collected and usefully employed.</P>
    <P>I desire to make one reference to the increased interest on Post Office savings. <Col N="200" /> Everything possible should be done to encourage people with medium incomes to save.  I do not believe that a mere ½ per cent. was a deterrent.  The difference between 2 per cent. and 2½ per cent. on £50 in the Post Office would amount to something like 1d. per week, and that amount would not deter anybody from saving or for that matter induce anybody to save.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Captain Orpen Captain Orpen">
      <NameTxt>Captain Orpen</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the Budget gives an opportunity for a sort of economic review.  The Minister gave us an economic review but, unfortunately, it was rather sketchy.  He had not some of the background&mdash;the statistical material&mdash;available that we would have liked him to have.  It is most important that we should have a periodic economic review&mdash;a sort of national stocktaking.  The imposition of taxation determines to a large extent the direction in which enterprise and productivity may flow.  The Minister has immense power to alter things by the incidence of taxation.  Admittedly we have to have taxation, but it is a very powerful weapon and, therefore, in order to have continuity in any productive machine where the process is slow, we want some assurance that once we have started in one direction it will not necessarily be hurriedly changed by taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his review the Minister drew special attention to the importance of agricultural production as the major field from which our national income may be said to be derived.  He pointed out that the volume of production has been falling over a term of years.  He mentioned that in the last year or two there was a rise of some 4 per cent. in the volume of industrial production.  I do not think the Minister has fallen into any error in thinking that agricultural production can vary.  There are many factors involved in agricultural production that make it extremely difficult for it to adjust itself to rapid changes.  Most factors of production in agriculture affecting land and labour cannot be augmented.  Increased fertility of the soil seems to be the only line that will lead to greater production on the land, unless by some miracle technical improvement can <Col N="201" /> more rapidly outstrip an increase in fertility.</P>
    <P>Now, obviously we are dependent and very much dependent, on agricultural production.  Since the Minister drew the attention to this fall in volume and stressed, in another place, the importance of trying to increase the products from the soil, we have had the recent agreement with Britain.  This agreement gives us the opportunity that we have been looking and hoping for for a long time.  It seems to point to an understanding between the two countries and to be based on a term of years sufficiently long to allow the slow march of nature to permit our agricultural production to become effective. I would like to point out that this question of land fertility is really a national thing and that is why I want to bring it in on the Budget.  In pre-war years we had roughly speaking, 1,400,000 acres of tillage and we imported annually 200,000 tons of mixed manures.  During the war years, on average, we got up to 2,500,000 acres of tillage but the quantity of artificial manures that we got became negligible except in the year 1940 when we did get a little bit.  I calculate that, at the present moment, merely to supply the same amount of artificial manures that we used in the 1930's, we would want 350,000 tons a year.  The deficit of some 2,000,000 tons during the war years represents, as Senators can see, a very considerable quantity.  These things are in short supply and we probably will not see them for some years.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the agricultural community is owed a rather large debt.  If we are to be repaid the reserves we exhausted&mdash;and, mind you, soil fertility is the farmer's reserve: he does not have a bank reserve of any size, his soil fertility is his bank reserve&mdash;it is going to take time.  Without a very considerable supply of manures, I cannot see how we can very easily augment our production.  It is to be hoped that people will realise that we have got not only to alter the trend of the fall in volume, but that we have got to stop that fall and, if possible, to bring a negative figure to a positive figure.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his <Col N="202" /> speech, deplored the fact that current savings seemed to be a thing of the past, and pointed out that whatever capital reserves were being used for the replacement of machinery and so on to-day were coming out of past savings rather than from current savings.  Our agricultural community, unfortunately, has neither any substantial current savings nor, possibly, past savings of any magnitude on which it can draw to provide fresh equipment or vital expenditure of a capital nature and, without that, vastly increased production does not seem possible in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>A year ago in this House, Professor Johnston made a remarkable prophecy, and if I may I would like to remind the House of his words.  Speaking here, in May, 1948, on the Appropriation Bill, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Unless markets can continue to be found for America's production, something of the nature of another 1929 seems to be staring the American people in the face.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What seems to be wanted is a kind of gigantic blood transfusion into the economic sphere from the full-blooded American economy into the anæmic economy of the rest of the world.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems to me that Professor Johnston's forecast was of the Marshall Plan.  I would like to regard this Marshall Plan as a magnificent gesture on the part of the United States to help Europe, and in helping Europe I think they are helping themselves.  I feel we are quite legitimately allowed to make the case that this nation, like other nations in Europe, has suffered war damage.  Our war damage does not consist, fortunately, in many people killed or many houses damaged, but the war has damaged our land, and seriously damaged it, and it will take considerable effort on our part, with the help of others, to put that right.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister for Finance is aware of all these things, and may rightly say to me: &ldquo;That is nothing to me; that is all for the Minister for Agriculture&rdquo;, but I feel that, in his <Col N="203" /> opening speech, the Minister drew attention to a serious maladjustment in our economic machine&mdash;the fall in the volume of agricultural production&mdash; and invited some of us who are interested in that direction to say something about it.  It is the most serious feature in our economic set-up. We used to pride ourselves that the volume of our agricultural production was static.  We were always showing figures to point out how the value had gone up year after year from about 1937 onwards.  But value is not the important thing&mdash;we do not eat value&mdash; we eat volume, and I think falling volume is serious and that we must counteract it if we possibly can.</P>
    <P>We should stress the point&mdash;and I think it has been stressed&mdash;that the assistance we would like to get from the United States is some assistance to raise the fertility of our land.  If we can get machinery and equipment, it is welcome as an additional item of value.  Our prime necessity is to restore the fertility of our land as soon as possible and in every way that man can devise.</P>
    <P>In the last few days I had the privilege of piercing the iron curtain and going around Northern Ireland with the British Grassland Association and looking at the work they are doing there on grass.  We hope to do something similar here.  They are realising that high fertility is the keynote to production.  It seems to me that they have been able to get equipment over the past war years that we have been told repeatedly was unavailable to us. They have got at least two lime-grinding plants, one quite a large one, and that put up in a country where they have a certain amount of fuel and certainly could burn a little bit of lime. If we are going to try to get this large increase in volume of agricultural production we are talking about, we will need our lime and we will need plant to crush it.  It is quite impossible, owing to the high prices of fuel, to think that we could burn it any longer&mdash;and, anyway, the ground lime seems to be equally effective.  I hope every effort <Col N="204" /> is being made to accelerate the process.</P>
    <P>There is another thing that maybe the Minister for Finance would look kindly upon.  We have been struggling to try and improve our knowledge and technique in agriculture, yet we have not had the experimental background which is so necessary to be quite sure that what we are doing is based on ascertainable and measurable facts and not on vague tradition.  When one sees the immense amount of research work and trials that have been done in other countries, one realises that though we cannot afford to do a lot of <i>ad hoc</i> research here, a great deal more might be done which would be very helpful in finding out for certain how far discoveries in other countries are applicable here.  We can guess, but we want to know, and it is only by measurements we can find out.  The only measurement of any use to the country and to the farmer is that in terms of money.  &ldquo;Better&rdquo; to the farmer means an increased financial return.</P>
    <P>This continued fall in the volume of agricultural production, which began about 1931, is a very serious feature and the sooner we have the means to check it the sooner we will be able to increase the volume.  Then we will have a chance of raising the real standard of living and the real incomes of the people.  After all, the mere raising of monetary wages is of no use when they are all running one after another.  It is the real wage and the real income we must raise and that can be done only by greater productivity, which must come mainly from the land and which must be assisted by everybody else.  If we can increase the productivity and change the fall in volume to an increase in volume, we will see a happier and a more pleasant country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make an appeal to the Minister to consider the repeal of the tax on whatever petrol is used in connection with agriculture. If we are to increase production and give work to our unemployed to stop the flight from the land, we must help agriculture in every possible way.  We must remove any taxes connected <Col N="205" /> with it and we must subsidise it wherever it needs subsidy.</P>
      <P>The farmers who have produced farmers' butter are the most disorganised and helpless section of the community, and I am sorry that the Minister has interfered with them. Many people are wondering whether the farms building scheme is in abeyance or not, and several people in my locality are waiting for information and would like to know the position. Again, the savings in the national health scheme will be a tax on agriculture, inasmuch as the employers in agriculture generally pay that tax.  I suggest to the Minister that he should be sympathetic to agriculture in every possible way.  I leave the matter there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>First and foremost, I want to refer to the tax on cinema seats.  In rural Ireland, the cinema is very small. Formerly the seats were very cheap. From May, 1947, there were two or three increases in the tax levied on cinema seats which affected very vitally the cost of admission to these cinemas in small towns and rural areas.  The latest of these impositions, the tax which was imposed in September, has been removed but there is still a very substantial grievance so far as the semirural cinema is concerned.  The amount of money involved is rather small and I would urge on the Minister that he might regard sympathetically the claim of these cinemas for complete exemption from tax on the ground that the cinema is practically the only source of recreation for our rural community, small farmers and farm workers, road workers and others.  It is about the only form of recreation they have and, as everybody knows, wages and incomes in rural areas are relatively small and the tax is a heavy impost on those concerned. I would like, therefore, to <Col N="206" /> make an appeal for a remission of the cinema tax in these cases.</P>
    <P>While I am on that subject, I would like to refer to the taxation which is levied on admission to cinemas in which formerly there was a stage show.  The Minister very properly drew attention to the abuse which took place, particularly last year, when the taxation on cinema seats was increased in respect of a particular type of cinema.  I am aware that some of these cinemas, in order to avoid the tax, brought in some person to play a mouth organ, or something of the kind, for two or three hours and claimed the remission of tax which applied in the case of cinemas having a stage show.  There are, however, other cinemas in which there was a genuine stage show and in which considerable sums of money were paid out every week in wages to artistes.  They are all affected by the decision to revoke the remission in taxation given in respect of cinemas having stage shows.</P>
    <P>I made some inquiries as to what this represents and I was given these figures by an organisation representing workers in Irish cinemas.  The weekly expenditure in a particular cinema in Limerick in respect of wages to artistes, extra staff, and things of that kind, amounted to £212.  A cinema in Cork under the same heading pays £184 16s. 3d. and of that sum £144 was paid to the artistes.  In one cinema in Dún Laoghaire which had a stage show during the past six months the weekly expenditure in respect of that part of the entertainment was £134.  In Dundalk the average weekly expenditure in respect of the stage show runs from £190 to £225.  In Drogheda, the average for a period of weeks was £193; in Galway, £120 and in Sligo, for the period from the 18th January to 5th April, expenditure in respect of the stage show in one cinema was £1,554. In some of these cases the number of persons employed was as high as 20. In others the figure was 15.  That represents a considerable volume of employment and employment which is not available elsewhere in this country. If the stage show is to get exemption from tax, I am informed that at least 100 cinemas will put on a genuine stage show and, on the assumption that each <Col N="207" /> artiste will give a turn of say, 15 minutes, it would mean employment for roughly 600 artistes.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from that volume of employment and the amount of money which would be expended in respect of the show, I think it is very important that opportunities would be provided for people of artistic taste to practise their art and this is one of the few opportunities they have to practise their art in this country.  A large proportion of the people concerned in the first instance enter into this work as a part-time relaxation.  If they are successful, they turn professional.  Unfortunately, nowadays, if they turn professional they must find an outlet for their talents outside this country.  I suggest that the Minister might have regard to these facts.  I do not want him to throw the door wide open so that people who have abused the exemption in respect of taxation should be encouraged to continue to do so.  I do not want that.  I would suggest that there might be some test applied in respect of, say, total expenditure, not merely the number of hours during which the stage show is given or the proportion of the time given to the stage show, but the expenditure in respect of the stage show should bear some proportion to the total expenditure of the cinema in respect of stage and films.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour the matter further but before I get away from the artistes and the theatres and cinemas, I want to make an appeal on behalf of the artistes, which will not cost the Minister very much but which is very important to them.  I refer to the expenditure which the artiste has to incur in respect of greasepaint.  It is not a terribly important matter from the revenue angle and it is not very exhilarating, but greasepaint, I am informed, is scheduled amongst cosmetics, so that the same duty is levied on greasepaint, which is part of the artiste's stock-in-trade, as is levied on lipstick, which is part of the adornment of the modern lady.</P>
    <P>I am concerned only with the greasepaint which, I am informed by the <Col N="208" /> people concerned and by the people in the trade, can be identified easily.  It is made up in sticks and in a particular kind of container and there is no difficulty about identification.  It is true that greasepaint is manufactured in this country, but I think it is manufactured on a somewhat different basis from the imported stuff and is very much more expensive and is very much less effective.  I am told, for instance, that if a person using Irish-made greasepaint is on the stage for half an hour the make-up simply slips off and that the naked face is exhibited to the audience.  That is not suitable for most artistes.  I have got some figures from the importer of a particular brand of greasepaint which, I understand, is world known.  I saw his invoice for 6 lbs. 11 ozs. of this material.  The invoice price was £1 5s. 5d., and the customs duties and parcels tax £3 5s. 0d. &mdash;that is a tax of £3 5s. 0d. on an article involved at £1 5s. 5d.  I do not know what rate of profit is in the trade.  I am assuming that if I add together the profits of the importer, the wholesaler and the retail chemist they would amount to something like 100 per cent.  I do not want to make any reflection on the trade, but I am assuming that the total profits would be 100 per cent.  If that is so, the artistes would have paid £2 10s. 10d. for this parcel of greasepaint if there had been no tax, but, with the tax added, it is going to cost them £9 10s. 0d.&mdash;a jump from £2 10s. 10d. to £9 10s. 0d., the difference being the tax and the profit on the tax, because, never forget, that the importer, the wholesaler and the distributor adds his profit to the tax just as he does to any other expense incurred by him in connection with an imported article or a home-manufactured article, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>There is one other appeal that I am going to make in respect of taxation which was imposed last September and which has not been removed.  I am now referring to the stamp duty imposed in respect of property transferred from one Irish citizen to another.  I think the old rate of stamp duty represented a figure of 1 per cent.  In the Supplementary Budget of last September that was increased, in the <Col N="209" /> case of an Irish purchaser, to 5 per cent., and of a foreign purchaser to 25 per cent.  So far as the foreign purchaser is concerned it does not matter very much.  He probably has money which he wants to get rid of, or money that he would prefer to invest in real estate here rather than in coal mines in South Wales or in gold mines in South Africa.  It does not matter to him what he has to pay, and I am not concerned with the stamp duty so far as he is concerned, but I am very much concerned with the 5 per cent. which is charged in the case of an Irish purchaser.</P>
    <P>If I may, I would like to quote an example which came to my notice recently of the manner in which this stamp duty affects the cost of a house to a person of very limited means.  The person concerned was a civil servant. He was unable to get a house to rent and was forced to buy one.  Now the insurance society, or the loan society, or the bank, I cannot say which, was prepared to lend, and did lend the sum of £2,500.  The purchaser had to put up £500 of his own money.  It was all the money that he could put up, and, in fact, I think some of that was borrowed. The stamp duty in that case was £150.  The purchaser had to find that sum in cash.  The loan society would not advance it, so that he had to provide not merely the £500, but £150 additional, to pay the stamp duty, and that had to be paid on the nail. I do not think the Minister can put right all the wrongs of a lifetime in this Budget, but I think he might look into the situation that is created by this imposition, and see what he can do next year to remit the additional taxation in respect of stamp duties imposed last year, so far as these stamp duties affect the transfer of property from one Irish citizen to another.</P>
    <P>Now, I was challenged by Senator Hawkins, early on, in respect of the discontinuance of schemes affecting hand-won turf, and I think the air services. I listened to Senator Hawkins make his plea.  There was one phrase he used which captivated me.  He talked about the airship flying to America carrying the Irish flag. Senator Hawkins will remember that <Col N="210" /> towards the end of last year I drew attention in this House to the fact that legislation was being promoted by the last Government to permit foreign-owned ships to fly the Irish flag.  I protested vehemently, and I asked this House to refuse to give legislative effect to the proposal of the late Minister for Industry and Commerce authorising foreign-owned ship-owners to register their ships in this State for the purpose of flying the Irish flag.  I pointed out how dangerous it could be in the event of war or of strained relations amongst foreign powers.  On that occasion Senator Hawkins was discreetly silent, although I gathered from what he said to-day that he agreed entirely with my point of view, and regards the flying of the Irish flag as the be-all and the end-all of our desires in the face of foreign countries.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Government has discontinued certain schemes relating to hand-won turf.  I am not going to go into the reasons assigned for that policy, but I feel satisfied that there was nothing else that could be done in the circumstances unless we were to continue paying large sums of money for the mere pleasure of seeing people cutting turf with a slean on the bog. The same can be said truthfully of the air services.</P>
    <P>I want to say for the benefit of Senator Hawkins and those supporting him that instead of blindly following the Ministry in their policy of retrenchment the Labour Party adopted a formal resolution at a Party meeting last week which was sent to the Department of Industry and Commerce and a copy to the Taoiseach calling upon them to institute a Government inquiry into the administration, the organisation and the financial structure of Aer Lingus and the other air services, because we are advised by people of integrity and competence that there is waste, extravagance and a colossal expenditure of public money on useless services in connection with air lines.  I do not know whether that is true.  I have said that we have been informed by very good and reliable authority, by people of integrity, and we have asked the Minister to inquire into the matter through a Government Commission of Inquiry.  Therefore instead <Col N="211" /> of following blindly the lead of the Government, instead of the Labour Party accepting everything that the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce may put up to us we in fact are urging them to go much further to eliminate waste than they have gone so far.  The reason is that we want to save the reputation of State-owned concerns.  We do not want it to get abroad that State enterprise in Ireland has been a colossal failure and we believe if something is not done to put certain concerns &mdash;including, for instance, Córas Iompair Eireann&mdash;on a completely new basis the failure of State enterprise and of publicly owned industrial and commercial enterprises is a foregone conclusion&mdash;these enterprises will not survive the odium which was attached to them in recent years due entirely to the wasteful and incompetent manner in which they have been organised.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the attitude of the Labour Party is going to be in regard to Córas Iompair Éireann, but I feel personally that they cannot remain silent in regard to the management of that concern, which is going to eat up something between £1,000,000 and £2,000,000 of the taxpayers' money in the present year.  I think the losses in 1947 were £1,000,000 and I understand their losses at the moment are running at a level of £2,000,000 a year. That may be true or untrue&mdash;I think there is a shareholders' meeting to-morrow to have an inquest on the concern as it stands.  We are very much concerned in seeing that these undertakings will be a success.  We do not want to reflect on the late Government for having established these concerns.  I think Senator Hawkins will agree that the Labour Party has helped, encouraged and assisted the late Government in every effort to establish enterprise of this kind, and our anxiety is to see that the enterprise, when it is established, is going to be a success, something worth while to the Irish people and something of which we all can feel proud.</P>
    <P>I have a suspicion, however, that Senator Hawkins and his friends began to realise six or seven, or perhaps ten, <Col N="212" /> months ago that all was not too well with some of these enterprises.  I think they realised that a number of the concerns in which large sums of public money were invested in the last seven, eight or ten years were not all they might have been.  I think they realised that something drastic would have to be done&mdash;perhaps something more drastic than is being done to-day by this Government&mdash;and I think this reflection had something to do with the holding of an election in the month of February, 1948, instead of in the month of June, 1949.  I think the intention in calling the election was to get out of this mess: &ldquo;If we do not win the election, it is someone else's job to deal with it; if we win the election, we will be in office for another five years, and in that time the memory of what we did in 1948 and 1949 will be wiped out before another general election becomes due.&rdquo;  I think that represents the idea which Senator Hawkins had (and after all he is one of the advisers of his own political Party) when it was decided first to have by-elections in September which they knew they were bound to lose, and which they were prepared to lose so that they might have a pretext for calling a general election 16 months ahead of due date.</P>
    <P>I do not want to pretend that I regard the present Finance Bill or the Budget on which it was based as a very satisfactory method of doing the things which in the modern world Budget proposals are expected to do.  Senator Hawkins was concerned only with querying the wisdom of discontinuing something which saved £120,000 and something else which saved £28,000 and so on.  Senator O'Brien, of course, took the opposite view.  Senator O'Brien and Senator Hawkins agree in this, no matter how profoundly they may differ in their arguments, they agree that the main thing is to spend all the money the State needs provided it does not come out of the pockets of those in whose welfare they are interested.</P>
    <P>For instance, Senator O'Brien made a very telling plea on behalf, as he said himself, of his constituents, the graduates of the National University. They may be professional people or <Col N="213" /> business people but no matter what they are or what their income may be, the Senator thinks that they are paying too much income-tax and that it is going to be a bad thing for the country if the graduates of the National University&mdash;and I take it the corresponding elements in the community who were not in the university&mdash;continue to pay 7/- in the £ income-tax. He was also very much concerned because he thought there was a witch hunt in relation to profiteering.  So we are not to tax the middle classes, we are not to get after the manufacturers and the distributors who are making phenomenal profits in their business.  Whom are we to get after?  There is only one class left in this country and that is the ordinary wage earner&mdash;so he is to pay for everything.  Of course, he is paying at any rate; it is the small farmer who works on his land, the farm labourer, the mechanic and the road worker, those who are producing the things we use, who are paying the taxation in any event although it is not always clear that they are the source from which the taxes come.</P>
    <P>I would urge strongly that the Minister would be as adamant in rejecting the advice of Senator O'Brien as he will be in rejecting the pleas of Senator Hawkins.  The truth, I think, is that in this country the amount of wealth which is being created is declining.  I think Senator Orpen made that point a few moments ago&mdash; that the volume of production, measured in terms of volume as distinct from its price, is declining and has declined over a period of years. May I quote two or three examples of what the decline has been during the past 16 years?  In 1931 we had 4,025,000 cattle, and in 1947 we had 3,960,000.  In 1931 the sheep population was 3,500,000&mdash;I am giving round figures&mdash;while the figure for 1947 was 2,095,000.  The pig population in 1931 was 1,250,000, and in 1947 it was 563,000.  In 1931 we had 22,500,000 poultry, and in 1948 only 17,107,000. These figures seem to me to show that the resources of the country are being dissipated, and if these resources are dissipated, the source from which we are going to get the pool of wealth <Col N="214" /> which will enable us to give better conditions to the mass of the people and reduce the weight of taxation on the middle and professional classes will dry up.  We cannot have social services; we cannot have subsidies unless there is some pool from which the money is to come.  But the pool has been allowed to dry up.</P>
    <P>I was rather amused by Senator O'Callaghan.  He first wants a reduction in the petrol tax, so far as petrol is used by the farming community, and he then wants a subsidy for the farmer's butter.  Where is all this leading to? Who is going to provide the subsidy, if nobody pays the tax on petrol?  It seems to me that nobody, in making these pleas, bothers to look at the situation or to examine what is happening in the country.  We cannot approach this subject realistically if we do not admit the facts to ourselves, and it is not an admission of the truth when Senator Hawkins, Senator O'Callaghan and others talk about farmer's butter being sold at 1/10 and 2/- a lb.  After Senator Hawkins had spoken I mentioned the matter to a member of this House who deals very largely in the handling of farmer's butter, and he tells me that the farmer is now getting 3/- a lb. in the shops for his butter.  This member happens to be a shopkeeper, who is paying the money.  I suggest to Senator Hawkins that we are not going to improve the situation by making loose statements, by making allegations which cannot be substantiated.</P>
    <P>My view is that the farmer is getting a very substantial price for everything he produces to-day.  The real trouble with the farmer is that he is not producing enough.  The productivity per acre in this country is lower than that of any country in Western Europe.  The figure for the value of agricultural produce was £5 per acre in 1938.  Let us say it is £15 now.  Compare that with the pre-war figure of £15 in France, £20 in Denmark, and £25 in Switzerland. In other words, taking two farmers, one in Ireland and one in Switzerland with farms of equal size, the latter had five times the income of the Irish farmer.  That is the real trouble in this country.  There are so <Col N="215" /> many smallholdings, so many holdings which do not give the farmer at the best of times a reasonable standard of living, that he is forced to go out to look for work on the roads, to look for work draining rivers, to go to England for two, three or four months in the summer, to earn a few pounds which will enable him to pay the shop bills when he comes home.  If we cannot do something to raise enormously the income of the farming community so that they can live without subsidies, can pay taxation without its being a burden on them, can increase the volume of the nation's income, then all our plans and all our schemes are going to lead where they have been leading for a long time, to the point at which we have a Budget of £80,000,000.</P>
    <P>There are no politics about this. Senator Hawkins knows these things as well as I do.  He moves through the country and he understands it.  Most people in this country live very close to the land.  Whether they are shopkeepers, civil servants, judges or Senators, they live very close to the land and know how the people on the land live.  I think they will all agree with me, if they face the facts realistically, that the farming income is too low and that, because it is so low, it is spreading poverty and destitution throughout the whole country.</P>
    <P>One of the matters referred to by a number of Senators in discussing this Bill was the question of prices and profits.  I am going to say right away, irrespective of what opposition I may encounter from Senator Douglas, that I know that fantastic profits are being made in certain instances&mdash;not in all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

      <P>I will give an example. In a particular house in the County of Dublin something went wrong with the drain pipe.  The people of the house asked the local contractor to send a man around to settle it.  The firm did so.  When he was through the workman wrote his time sheet.  The total time involved in doing the job was 15 minutes.  I am prepared to concede <Col N="216" /> that ten minutes were spent in coming there and another ten minutes in returning to the shop.  However, he charged one hour's time and the contractor's bill for that hour was 12/6. I saw the bill.  I went with the contractor to the builders' provider who employs the man.  I said: &ldquo;How do you make the bill 12/6 for one hour for a plumber?  His wages are 3/-&rdquo;.  The reply was: &ldquo;That does not matter to you.  Our price is 12/6&rdquo;.  This firm was paying 3/- an hour to the man. He worked less than half an hour on the job.  He claimed an hour which, I suppose, is not unreasonable, but the cost to the person having the work done was 12/6.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>This man had no mate. A gentleman who is connected with transport in this city was able to check up on a certain commodity.  In this case the item was fruit.  He told me he went into a house in Grafton Street and asked the price of certain fruit. It was 3/6 a lb.  He said: &ldquo;This price is fantastic.&rdquo;  The assistant replied: &ldquo;That is our price.&rdquo;  He made inquiries through the company with which he is associated, back to the shipping and railway companies and to London, and discovered that this fruit was delivered on the quays of Dublin at 9d. per lb.  The selling price in Grafton Street, less than half a mile from the quays, was 3/6.</P>
      <P>Does anybody calculate the profits made by, let us say, building contractors? A gentleman who was very closely associated with the building industry and knew a good deal about it from the inside, told me a few years ago that any man who started in 1932 on a fairly big scale, who built 25 to 30 houses a year, could have retired when the war was over and lived comfortably for the rest of his life on the profits he had extracted from the building operations in that period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening to <Col N="217" /> that story for years.  As a matter of fact, I came to the conclusion many years ago that most business people get prosperous on their losses.  That is the kind of reply you always get if you ask them to increase wages, shorten hours or in any other way to improve the conditions of their employees.  That is the stock answer and Senator Hawkins apparently has inbibed it during the period Fianna Fáil spent in office.</P>
      <P>What happens in the case of transport charges?  I am speaking of the pre-war period, 1934-1935, from evidence given to the Prices Commission. A thousand bricks made in Cork, placed on board a steamer in Cork outside the City Hall at 30/- a 1,000, were sold at Mount Merrion in County Dublin at £6 a 1,000, the £4 10s. 0d. representing the cost of transport and profits.  As a matter of fact, I am satisfied that, taking all the elements which make up distribution, it is the outstanding case where there are vast profits which are entirely unnecessary, entirely unjustified.</P>
      <P>One has only to read the evening papers.  One has only to read the cases of the young boys who killed somebody along the Bray road or somewhere else in the vicinity of Dublin.  What do you find?  All of them the sons of people who started in business during the last 20 years and have made such vast fortunes that their children cannot remain sober between Dublin and Bray.</P>

      <P>Is not the position in the Dublin Corporation that they are confronted with the need to build an extensive car park to accommodate all the motor cars lining the streets of Dublin from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.?  I happened to travel down the country some months ago and, between the time I left Naas and got to the Curragh, I counted over £2,000,000 of motor cars returning from the races. It is not out of poverty or out of losses in industry or commerce that all these cars have been purchased.  There is a vast pool of wealth in this country which is entirely untapped and which the Minister has not yet been able to get.  It has developed at an unprecedented rate during the war years and, in fact, for the last 15 or 16 years.  If the Minister can get at that he will be able to reduce the rate of taxation very considerably, and remove entirely many of the taxes which are levied indirectly on the consumers of dutiable goods.</P>
