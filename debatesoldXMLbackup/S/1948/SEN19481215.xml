      <P>From the latest information we have received regarding the course of business in the Dáil we gather that we will receive from the Dáil this evening the Defence Forces Bill and the Agriculture (Amendment) Bill; we received last night the Workmen's Compensation Bill, all of which, we understand, are required to be completed before the adjournment for the Christmas Recess.  In the normal course none of these Bills could appear on the Order Paper until three days after their receipt from the Dáil but if the House is agreeable we could list them for a sitting to-morrow.  The advantage of this course would be that we could take the Second Stages to-morrow and conclude the business next week.  If the House be agreeable to that suggestion we would propose to meet on Tuesday of next week.  Perhaps the House will now indicate whether they are agreeable to the course suggested.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to Bills being placed on the Order Paper, but I certainly have an objection to the rushing through of legislation at the end of the period, particularly in view of the fact that we had a long recess. While we on this side of the House are prepared to facilitate the passing into law of urgent Bills which it is necessary to pass before the 31st December, we certainly would not be in favour of going any further than that.</P>

      <P>All we are asked in effect is that we should meet to-morrow to consider the Second Stage of certain Bills which should not be dealt with for three days ordinarily.  If that does not satisfy the House, the House can consider to-morrow what it is going to do.</P>

      <P>Tá súil agam go mbeidh cead agam beagán a rá i dtaobh an Ailt seo den Bhille.  Ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil mé i bhfábhar an Ailt agus ba mhaith liom a rá, thar ceann na ndaoine atá ar an taobh seo den Teach, agus atá in aon pháirtí liom, gur maith linn an tAlt seo a bheith sa mBille. Caithfidh mé a rá, tar éis bheith ag éisteacht leis an diospóireacht an tseachtain seo caite, go raibh faitíos orm go b'fheidir go loitfí cúrsaí an Bhille sa tSeanad trí leasú a chur isteach sa mír seo.  D'éisteamar go foighdeach leis an Seanadóir Bigger an tseachtain seo caite agus é ag cur síos ar an Acht arb é is ábhar don Alt seo. Bhí sórt faitís orm mar gheall ar a mhíshásta a bhí sé agus mar gheall ar a mhéid a bhí sé in amhras ar <i>bona fides</i> an Rialtais i dtaobh an Ailt seo, go mb'fhéidir go mbraitheadh sé de dhualgas air féin leasú a chur isteach.  Tá mé an-tsásta nár chuir sé a leithéid isteach.  Mhillfheadh sé cúrsaí an Bhille agus mhillfeadh sé an aondacht atá in ár measc fré chéile i dtaobh tábhacht an Achta seo a dhul ar ceal. Is dóigh liom gurb é an fáth nach bhfuil aon chur i gcoinne an Ailt seo ná gur léir do gach duine sa tSeanad, <Col N="297" /> sa Dail agus taobh amuigh nach bhfuil aon amhras a thuille ann i dtaobh status an Stáit seo.  Ar feadh blianta bhí amhras ar dhaoine&mdash;is doigh liom go raibh údar acu, údar ag a lán acu, amhras a bheith orthu&mdash;i dtaobh status an Stáit.</P>
      <P>Níl mé sásta a rá go bhfuil an leithscéal sin ag gach duine.  Tá daoine ann, agus is dóigh liom go dtaispeáinfidh mé ar ball é, nach raibh aon ghá go mbeadh mí-thuiscint ar chuid mhaith acu agus da mba rud é go mbeadh daoine níos fonnmhaire mó ná bhíodar breathnú ar an bhfhírinne idir an da shúil, nach mbeadh an oiread sin amhrais ná an oiread sin easaontais sa tír agus bhí.</P>
      <P>An mhír seo, Alt I, agus an réiteach atá inti; go gcuirfear an tAcht Caidreamh Coigríche ar ceal, admhachtáil é sin, ann féin, ar neamhspleáchas iomlán an Stáit seo.  Marach go bhfuil Bunreacht na tíre ag tabhairt na cumhachta dhúinn, marach go bhfuil an Pháirliméid seo neamhspleách go hiomlán, ní fhéadfaí an mhír seo a chur isteach sa mBille.  Ach an raibh gá leis an amhras bheith ann, an oiread agus a bhí?  An Taoiseach é féin in áiteacha, is léir&mdash;tá mé sásta é sin admhachtáil&mdash; go raibh amhras air, agus a údar aige. Níl mé sásta go bhfuil údar aige agus amhras bheith air an t-am ar fad, nó faoi gach rud; ach chuir sé ceist antábhachtach ar Dháil Éireann, nuair a bhí sé ag caint ar an mBille, nuair a bhí sé ós comhair an Tí sin.  Dúirt sé ar cholún 372, iml. 113:&mdash;sí an cheist a bhí ag déanamh buartha dhó san am: an rabhamar taobh istigh den Comhchiníochas, an raibh Rí os cionn na hÉireann:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have not been able to find out or to get a specific answer to that question, whether we were or were not a member of the Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sin ceist réasúnach: an rabhamar taobh istigh den Chomhchiníochas nó nach raibh?  Dá gcuireadh daoine thíos faoin tír nó, béidir, cuid againn sa tSeanad nó sa Dáil, ceist den tsórt sin, go n-abróimis go rabhamar in amhras, béidir go mbeadh leithscéal éigin againn; ach níl mise ar na daoine a déarfadh go bhfuil an leithscéal sin ag an Taoiseach, ná ag <Col N="298" /> Árd-Chounselléirí a bhí ar aon intinn leis cur i gcoinne an Bhille ar an mbealach a bhíodar.  Tugaim faoi deara gur luadh na nithe seo cheana sa Dáil agus taobh amuigh de.  Sílim go raibh sé riachtanach dúinn go gcuirfimis ar Thuarascáil an tSeanaid é, an chaoi díreach a bhí an scéal san am atá caite.</P>
    <P>B'fheidir, ag an am seo, nach mbeadh sé as bealach má abraím chomh mí-shásta agus tá mise go háirithe agus chomh mí-shásta agus tá an mhuintir ar an taobh seo liom mar gheall ar nach bhfuaireamar cóip de Thuarascáil an tSeanaid go dtí a haon an chlog inniu.  Cinnte, is dóigh gur cuireadh isteach sa mbosca aréir í nó am éigin inné, ach ní bhfuair mise mo chóip i gcóir an Diardaoin agus na hAoine seo caite go dtí a haon an chlog inniu. Ar ócáideacha, is cuma, béidir, faoi sin; ach ar ócáid den tsórt seo, agus Bille chomh tábhachtach leis an mBille seo, agus Imeachta chomh tábhachtach leis na hImeachtaí a bhí ar bun sa Seanad, Diardaoin agus Dé hAoine na seachtaine seo caite, is dóigh liom nach ceart nach bhfaighmis, ar ais nó ar éigin, cóip de na hImeachta, tamaill roimh an gcruinniú.</P>
    <P>Nílim ag cur aon mhilleán ar aoinne a bhaineas leis an Taoiseach nó leis an gCléireach, ach is ceist í go gcaithfidh an Coiste um Phríbhléidí a scrúdú, agus féachaint chuige nach dtárlóidh a leithéid arís.</P>

      <P>Tá cúis chasaoide aige, díreach mar atá agamsa.  Sílim go bhfuil an Seanadóir Ó hAodha ar aon intinn liom.  Tabhair faoi deara nach bhfuil aoinne againn i gcoinne an Bhille, ach ag iarraidh rudaí a léiriú, mar is dual agus is ceart iad a léiriú.  Ní féidir é sin a dhéanamh i gceart mura mbeidh cóip d'Imeachta an Chruinnithe seo againn, go tráthúil, le go bhféa dfaimís é scrúdú agus freagraí a cheapadh ar aon phointe is dóigh linn a bheadh ag teastáil.</P>

Tá clódóirí anois, agus le tamall maith, ana-mhall.  Is dóigh liom, mar sin, gur íontach ar fad an rud é go bhfuil Tuarascáil Díospóireachta na hAoine againn inniu mar atá.  Ní bhfuair mise é.  Ní dóigh liom gur féidir óráidí na hAoine seo caite, a rinneadh ar a hocht a chlog sa tráthnóna, a chur ar fáil roimhe seo.  Bheadh sé thar chumas na dtuairisceoirí agus thar chumas na gclódóirí é sin a dhéanamh.</P>

      <P>Is dóigh liom go bhfuil Imeachta an tSeanaid ar Bhille Phoblacht na hÉireann chomh tábhachtach sin go mba chóir go mbeadh gach tuairisc againn go tráthúil, go bhféadfaimis scrúdú a dhéanamh orthu roimh theacht isteach go dtí an chéad chruinniú eile.  Tá a fhios agam nach raibh sé indéanta sa chás seo.  Ach shílfeá, agus a thábhachtaí an ócáid, go mbeadh an Bille curtha siar go dtí an chéad sheachtáin eile, go dtí go mbeadh seans againn scrúdú a dhéanamh.  Bíodh sin mar atá, tá a fhios agam go bhfuil a ndícheall déanta ag na daoine a raibh baint acu leis an Tuarascáil.  Admhaím an méid sin, ach is trua nach raibh na leabhair ar fáil.</P>

      <P>Tá mé ag iarraidh fháil amach an raibh an cheist faoi status an Stáit chomh deacair ar a socrú agus tá daoine a rá. Táim ag iarraidh a thaispéaint chomh maith, a shásta atá mé, go bhfuil Alt l ann.  Nuair a pléidheadh an cheist sin, i 1936, labhair an tOllamh Thrift ar an scéal.  Ba duine anchruinn, an-tuigsionach é agus duine &mdash;chomh maith agus is cuimhin liom&mdash; a raibh tuairim aige nach raibh ar aon dul le tuairmí an Rialtais a bhí ann <Col N="300" /> san am.  Scrúdaigh sé an scéal agus dúirt sé:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do not think it is possible to stress too strongly that this Bill is not a Bill which, in a sense, appoints a successor to King Edward VIII.  If we pass this Bill, we shall do two straightforward things.  We shall, on our part and of our own free will, accept the abdication of the late King.  We shall appoint to the new King certain functions in relation to external matters.  That is all that this Bill does.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Níor mhiste, b'fhéidir, a mheabhrú don Teach céard a bhí sa mBille féin a raibh sé ag caint air.  Is Bille í atá beagnach chomh gairid le Bille Phoblacht na hÉireann agus Bille, dar liom, atá chomh simplí le Bille Phoblacht na hÉireann.  Is é Alt a 3 an tAlt tábhachtach.  Deireann sé:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) It is hereby declared and enacted that, so long as Saorstát Éireann is associated with the following nations, that is to say, Australia, Canada, Great Britain, New Zealand and South Africa, and so long as the King recognised by those nations as the symbol of their co-operation continues to act on behalf of each of those nations (on the advice of the several Governments thereof) for the purposes of the appointment of diplomatic and consular representatives and the conclusion of international agreements, the King so recognised may, and is hereby authorised to, act on behalf of Saorstát Éireann for the like purposes as and when advised by the Executive Council so to do.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá dhá rud thábhachtacha ansin&mdash; an focal &ldquo;may&rdquo; an chéad rud, agus an dara rud, nach bhféadfadh an Rí feidhmiú, beag ná mór, gan comhairle agus gan údarás ó Rialtas an Stáit.  An focal &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash;cé mhéad uair a bhí sé i gceist againn sa tSeanad cén chiall atá leis?  Ma bhreathnaíonn sibh ar an mBille ós ár gcóir, bhéarfaidh sibh faoi deara an chaoi a bhfuil &ldquo;may&rdquo; agus &ldquo;shall&rdquo; á úsáid ar chaoi nach mbeadh a fhios agat céard díreach atá i gceist. &ldquo;May&rdquo; sa gcás seo, sa mBille Caidrimh Coigríche, is é an chiall atá leis go cinnte, go bhféadfadh an Rí feidhmiú <Col N="301" /> an uair a gheobhadh sé údarás agus comhairle ó Rialtas an Stáit seo.  Ní fhéadfadh sé é dhéanamh uaidh féin; ní raibh aon údarás aige beag ná mór, méar ardú i dtaobh gnóthaí na tíre, ach amháin an uair a déarfadh Rialtas an Stáit seo leis é.  Thairis sin, ní fhéadfadh an Rialtas Éireannach aon chomhairle a chur air, ná aon údarás a thabhairt dó, ach amháin sna cásanna áirithe atá luaite sa mBille.</P>
    <P>Tuigeann an Taoiseach go maith an rud atá i gceist agam, mar bhí sé in a Theachta an uair sin agus bhí sé ina Ard-Chounseléar chomh maith.  Is duine é a bhfuil an-mheas agam air i gcónaí mar Chounseléar.  Ach, san am chéanna is fiú an méid seo a thabhairt fiao deara.  Bhí sé a rá a dheacra a bhí sé míniú fháil an rabhamar taobh istigh den Chomhchiníochas nó nach raibh; an raibh údarás ag Rí Shasana feidhmiú ar ár son no nach raibh maidir le ghnáth-imeachta na tíre.</P>
    <P>Dúirt sé:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I entirely disagree with the views put forward by Deputy Norton on this subject&mdash;that we are by our act to-day in a hurried fashion electing the British King as King of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>An locht atá agam ar an rud ar fad&mdash; níor mhínigh an Taoiseach é nuair a bhí sé ag caint san am&mdash;gur húsáideadh caint daoine áirithe i dtaobh an Bhille mar chruthúnas go raibh an Stát seo ceangailte lámh agus cos le Impireacht Shasana, agus go mba é Rína hImpireachta sin Rí na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>Ag leanúint dó san óráid chéanna dúirt sé&mdash;agus tá na sleachta le fáil ar cholún 1433 Iml. 64:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Section 3&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>an tAlt is tábhachtaí san Alt atáimid anois a phlé:&mdash;</P>
    <P>is a most extraordinary section and I am not at all sure that on its strict legal construction it may not have the effect which would, I am sure, be very welcome to some members of the Fianna Fáil Party and some of their supporters throughout the country. In fact, the effect of this Bill which is to give us half a Crown is that it gives no Crown at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> Ansin, tá an Taoiseach i n-amhras. Ceart go leor, admhaím go bhfuil sé i n-amhras, ach, ar a laghad, má táthar i n-amhras ar rud ar bith, agus go háirithe nuair atá an tír i gceist, ba cheart an breithiúnas a thabhairt i bhfábhar na tíre.</P>
    <P>Deir sé arís&mdash;bhí sé fíor&mdash;go raibh sé an deacair a rá an rabhamar taobh istigh den Chomhchiníochas nó nach raibh&mdash;col.  1433, Imleabhar 64:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We propose solemnly to pass an Act of this Dáil stating that we will allow the King to act for us in external affairs so long as the other nations recognise him as the symbol of their co-operation.  But they do not recognise the King as a symbol of their co-operation.  Therefore, this Act never can come into effective operation and, therefore, the King cannot act at all in external affairs with the authority of this Bill, when it becomes an Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Nach é an trua nár cuireadh i n-iúl do dhaoine áirithe sa tír, ar a laghad, muna bhféadfaimis a bheith cinnte faoi cén chaoi a raibh an scéal, go raibh, ar a laghad amhras an-mhór ann ina thaobh?  Sin buaidh an Bhille seo, má bhí amhras ann, agus má tá amhras ann, go gcuirfidh sé seo an t-amhras ar ceal.</P>
    <P>Scrúdaigh an Seanadóir Ó Labhradha an scéal agus dob fhiú a thuairim cuid mhaith.  Deir sé:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Examining the Bill in the time that I and the House have had in which to do it, it would seem to me that the effect of it is to remove the King from the Constitution and to give to this country a republican Constitution. That may or may not be a desirable thing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>An rud atá tar éis titim amach, an fáth go bhfuilimíd ar aon intinn i dtaobh an Bhille seo, go bhfuil sé admhaithe inniu ag na daoine a bhí i n-amhras le fada, go bhfuil an scéal mar a bhí Fianna Fáil a rá an t-am ar fad, gur Bunreacht Poblachta an Bunreacht atá againn.  Ar a laghad, má bhí amhras ann, be cheart go dtabharfaí an breithiúnas i bhfábhar an Stáit.</P>
    <P>Ach bhíodh daoine eile taobh amuigh <Col N="303" /> den Taoiseach agus de dhaoine sa mbaile ar an dtuairim nach rabhamar taobh istigh den Chomhchiníochas. Mar shompla, luadh é sa Dáil.  Ní misde má dhéanaim tagairt don nóta a chuir Cordell Hull chuig Ceannasaí an Stáit, mar bheannú &ldquo;to the young Republic that had been newly born here in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom sliocht amháin eile a luadh agus beidh mé réidh leis.  Fuair mé tamall ó shoin cóip d'aiste a scríobh Dorothy MacArdle i dtaobh status na tíre seo.  Is fiú áird a thabhairt ar a tuairim.  Is stairí í.</P>

Fágfaidh mé é faoi breithiúnas na stairí a thiocfas inar ndiaidh agus faoi breithiúnas an phobail.

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act was the last signed by a Governor-General of the Irish Free State for it removed from the King and his representatives every trace of their remaining functions touching the Irish Free State.  The signing of Bills and the summoning and dissolving of Parliament became duties of the Chairman of the Dáil, the appointing of judges that of the head of the Executive Council.  It was sweeping in effect.  It transferred to the Executive Council the rights which the King had exercised outside the Irish Free State, the right to appoint as advised the State's diplomatic and consular representatives and the right to conclude on its behalf treaties with other States. <Col N="304" /> This enactment released the Twenty-Six County area from all that remained of subjection to Great Britain.&rdquo;</P>

Its critics are here at home.  &lsquo;De Valera's fairyland republic&rsquo; and &lsquo;the shadow without the substance'&rsquo; it has been called, but the opposite is the truth.  We had the republic of our will and vision from 1916 to 1923 but it struggled unsuccessfully for recognition and a stable place in the international scheme.  What we have to-day is substantially a status and a constitutional freely working democratic State.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wondering, after all this discussion, what precisely the last speaker has been trying to prove.  We are discussing Section 1 of the Bill which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Executive Authority (External Relations) Act, 1936 (No. 58 of 1936), is hereby repealed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not yet discovered whether the last speaker is in favour of repeal or against it, and, after all, that is the issue which we are considering in this <Col N="306" /> Committee Stage.  One would imagine that, in the course of a speech occupying 45 minutes, the House would be told on which side the Senator was speaking. It is true that he devoted a great part of his speech to proving, I think, that there was no need to repeal the section inasmuch as we had, under the External Relations Act, all the elements of a republic, and that, therefore it followed that the repeal effected here was unnecessary.  I take it that it was his case that the Bill as a whole was unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I think the case that was made for the Bill on Second Reading mainly rested on the fact that it removed confusion; that it got rid of confusion. I think that is the case that was made for it.  No one argued very enhusiastically whether, in fact, it was necessary to have this Bill in order to secure the republic.  What was argued was that there was confusion in people's minds, and that the effect of this Bill would be to remove the confusion.</P>
    <P>Well, Sir, with all respect, might I point out that the first person who, so far as I am aware, used the expression &ldquo;confusion&rdquo; in relation to the situation which we are now discussing was Deputy de Valera.  As far as I can discover, he was the first person who alleged that there was confusion, and who encouraged most people to think that the External Relations Act must be disposed of to get rid of the confusion. I think there will be no difficulty in showing that that confusion was widespread.  It was not confined to the people of this country.  It was shared by people in other countries, including people who are very friendly towards this country.  For instance, the Deputy-Acting Prime Minister of New Zealand, Mr. Walter Nash, commenting a few weeks ago on the introduction of this Bill said according to a message which appeared, with the Wellington date-line, in the <i>Irish Press:</i>&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Although the legal effect of the repeal of the Bill is clear and Ireland will cease to be a member of the Commonwealth, it should be a matter of the utmost satisfaction throughout <Col N="307" /> the Commonwealth that the Government of Ireland...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and so on.  The governing words in that statement are: &ldquo;Ireland will cease to be a member of the Commonwealth.&rdquo; The Acting-Prime Minister of New Zealand believed, when this Bill was first introduced in the Dáil, that Ireland was then a member of the Commonwealth, but he was not alone in that view.  In an editorial in the <i>Sunday Times</i> on the 28th November last this was said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Republic of Ireland Bill, and Mr. Atlee's statement on it, at least dispel the uncertainty and sham that have surrounded Éire's relation with the Commonwealth since 1937. Britain and the Dominions held that she was still a member.  Mr. Costello said she was not.  Now, beyond equivocation, Éire is out of the Commonwealth, and the principle is vindicated that no country can belong to it which cuts all links with the Crown.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are two widely differing authorities, one being the Acting-Prime Minister of New Zealand and the other a leader writer on one of the most influential of the British Sunday newspapers, and both taking the view, first and foremost, that there was some ground for confusion, but insisting that their interpretation was right&mdash;that Ireland was in the Commonwealth. Writing on the 5th December in an article already quoted from the <i>Sunday Times,</i> Viscount Simon, at one time Attorney-General of England and at a later period Lord Chancellor of England, said, regarding the measure which is before us:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That does not alter the fact that a community may take a step which, in its own eyes, is justified and necessary but which none the less snaps the last remaining constitutional thread.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There you have an ex-Lord Chancellor and an ex-Attorney-General of England talking of this Bill as snapping the last constitutional thread.</P>
    <P>But without going abroad for these authorities, I would like to come nearer home, and quote what Deputy de <Col N="308" /> Valera said.  The quotations which I propose to give are not new.  The bulk of them, I think, have already been used by the Minister for External Affairs in the debate on this measure in the Dáil.  The first quotation which I have is from a speech delivered in Dáil Éireann on the 25th May, 1937. That was the occasion on which the Dáil was considering the present Constitution. It was then in the form of a Bill before the House.  An amendment was submitted for the purpose of making it clear that this country was a republic.  The Taoiseach of that day opposed the amendment and, in doing so, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that as there is an acute difference of opinion of such a character that it would mean that we would not get acceptance of this Constitution by a large section of the people, was to leave this matter to be decided as a separate independent question.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>An amendment which was tabled proposed to declare that this country was a republic, the amendment was resisted because the Constitution might not get acceptance if it were included. Consequently, the Taoiseach that day believed that there was something to distinguish the State described in the Constitution from a republic.  If he did not believe there was something which distinguished one form of constitutional position from another, there was no point in resisting this amendment, which was successfully resisted. Developing his argument and encouraging people to believe that what was being done then was not the last word on the subject, Mr. de Valera said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It can be decided outside the Constitution and put as a separate and independent question.  I think that is the proper place for it and so I have to resist the amendment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The question whether this country was to be described as a republic or not was a matter for decision outside the Constitution, a matter to be decided independently.  Why Senator Ó Buachalla gets all hot and bothered about this, I do not know.  We have here in unmistakable language in the official records of Dáil Éireann the views of the Leader of his Party on this subject, <Col N="309" /> the view of the Minister who was piloting the Bill for the enactment of the Constitution through Dáil Éireann, and he was in no doubt whatever that he was asking the House and asking the country to accept something which constitutionally was not a republic.  If there is a doubt about that, we can pursue it further.  We have the question raised at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis in November, 1938, when delegates from Fianna, Fáil cumainn were not happy about this, 12 months after the Constitution came into force, and they raised the issue in order to have it clarified.</P>

      <P>In other words, there is not a republic to-night but you can have one in the morning by declaring it.  He said:&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator allow me to conclude before reaching a decision? The difficulty is that Senator Ó Buachalla devotes 45 minutes to a discussion on Section 1, the only purpose of which is to repeal the External Relations Act, and I am endeavouring to find out&mdash;because it is very helpful to all of us to know exactly what we are doing&mdash;precisely where he stands on this.  I am trying to suggest that he is suffering from an overdose of the confusion of which Mr. de Valera complained on a number of occasions in relation to our constitutional position. I am now trying to encourage him to support this section on the grounds that it will get rid of the confusion.  I am entitled to show that and I want to come exactly to the point where Mr. de Valera conceded and argued that there was confusion.  Speaking in 1938, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I feel that if we were able to say we are an independent republic, there would be none of this confusion which exists at the moment and which is helping to cause dissatisfaction and, in a sense, is a source of danger.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the section we are dealing with is to get rid of that source of danger, to dispose of the argument on one side by the Acting Prime Minister of New Zealand and the London papers, that we are in the Commonwealth, and the assertion on the other side that we are an independent republic.  When this section has been passed&mdash;as undoubtedly it will be passed, and to leave Senator Quirke in no doubt as to how I stand, I say I am <Col N="311" /> voting for the section as it stands&mdash;and when this Bill becomes law, there will be no doubt there as to where we stand.  We are outside the Commonwealth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, sure.  If the Senator would only have the good sense to read the facts surrounding this subject before coming in to consider this Bill, we would avoid a good deal of confusion in different terms.  If the Senator were to read, for instance, the declaration made in Dáil Éireann by the Labour Party on the 6th December, 1922, he would probably begin asking himself a number of questions as to why there were five years of frustration following the Treaty instead of getting busy to alter and amend it there and then.  I would like to point out that some of the things for which the Labour Party agitated during those years were achieved with the consent of the people who then sat in Dáil Éireann.  For instance, one of the most important of all was the refusal of this country, notwithstanding the Treaty, to permit an appeal to the <Col N="312" /> Privy Council.  I suggest that that was one of the most important indentations made in the whole Treaty position.  I do not want to pursue it on this section because I am trying to confine myself as closely as I can to the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to show that the main purpose, I think the big achievement, of this Bill, is to get rid of confusion and I think I have shown that there was confusion in various places, including important places, in this country and, if we have got rid of the confusion, we have acieved something valuable.  That is why I am uneasy about the criticism of the Bill and the attitude that has been adopted towards it in certain circles. I want to say at once that, in the Dáil, Deputy de Valera made it perfectly clear that he was a supporter of the Bill, that he believed it was necessary. He justified the various sections, even those that were challenged, and pointed out that they were essential.</P>
      <P>What troubles me, therefore, is, why there should be a good deal of time devoted to an indirect criticism of the Bill, a kind of subdued opposition, not expressing itself in a vote against the measure but in creating suspicion, in creating a belief, as was attempted on the last occasion when we were discussing this Bill, that there was something behind it, that there was something we had not been told, something we must be careful about.  That is not a reasonable attitude towards a Bill of this kind.  If those who are criticising the repeal of the External Relations Act are opposed to that, they should say so.  If they are not opposed to it, if they are in favour of the repeal of the External Relations Act, then they should vote for this Bill in an uncritical manner.</P>

      <P>Senator Duffy finds very great fault with the speech made by Senator O Buachalla but, as far as I could hear, he has not quoted one thing that Senator O Buachalla said with which he did not agree.  Anybody would think that Senator Duffy in his statement on this particular section was trying to convince Senator O Buachalla that he should, in fact, vote for this section.  We did not hear what Senator Duffy had to say on the Second Reading, but anybody listening to Senator O Buachalla on the Second Reading could not possibly be under any misapprehension or be suffering from any misunderstanding as regards his attitude.  His attitude is the attitude of everybody in the House, not alone in connection with the Second Reading but in connection with this section in particular, the repeal of the External Relations Act.  Senator Duffy goes to great rounds to explain all this misunderstanding and what Mr. de Valera said on such a date and what the Taoiseach said on another date.  We have it on the authority of the Taoiseach, the Minister for External Affairs, the Attorney-General, Mr. de Valera and about 40 others who would ordinarily be regarded as authorities, that we had, in fact, a republican Constitution here and I think it is spurring free horses or pushing open doors to press the thing any further.  If we want to go back to find out what Mr. de Valera said, we find that on April 23rd, 1933, at Arbour Hill, he said:</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Let us remove these forms one by one so that this State that we control <Col N="314" /> may be a republic in fact and that when the time comes the proclaiming of the republic may involve no more than a ceremony, the formal conformation of a status already attained.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;They are autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate to one another in any aspect of their external affairs though united by a common allegiance to the Crown and freely associated with members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sin sain-mhiniú ar bhallraíocht an Chomhchiníochais.  Tá sé in am, dá bhféadadh an Seanadóir Ó Dubhthaigh sreangscéal a chur chuig Mr. Walter Nash, ag meabhrú dhó gur cheart dó <Col N="316" /> eolas níos cruinne a bheith aige ar céard is ballraíocht den Chomhchiníochais ann.  B'fhéidir go mbeidh sé scioptha á dhéanamh agus a bhí nuair a bhí sé ag cur sreangscéal chuig Mr. Attlee.  Deireann Mr. Nash gur comhalta den Chomhchiníochas sinn. Níl an Taoiseach ar an tuairim sín agus b'fhéidir go scríobhfadh an Seanadóir Ó Dubhthaigh chuig Mr. Nash a rá leis céard dúirt an Taoiseach.  Luaidh mé é an lá deiridh.  Scrúduigh sé an scéal, é fhéin agus an tAire Gnóthaí Eachtracha nuair tháinig sé i gcomhacht. Bhí mortabháil níos troime air nuair bhí sé ina Thaoiseach ná mar a bhí nuair nach rabh sé ina Thaoiseach agus d'fhreagair sé an mhortabháil sin, gurb é an tuairim a bhí aige faoi status na tíre:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The result of all these questions and the discussions which took place between the questions was that the Minister for External Affairs and myself having come one way or another</P>
    <P>(beagán paraphrase)</P>
    <P>finally came to the conclusion that we were not a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <P>Mr. Baxter: And we were not a republic.</P>
    <P>Liam Ó Buachalla: &ldquo;Apparently then as a result of all that we reached the point where everybody said we were not a member of the Commonwealth of Nations.  That is the answer to those who are asking why we are leaving the Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deir an Seanadóir Baxter &ldquo;and we were not a Republic.&rdquo;  Is í an cheist atámuid a phlé anois: an rabhamar ins an Impireacht?  Ar chomhalta sinn den Chomhchiníochas?  Sin é an sórt cainte a bhí ar bun ag an Seanadóir Ó Dubhthaigh a chur an míthapa ar an tír sna blianta atá caite agus sin é an bhuaidh atá leis an mBille, an tAcht Caidrimh Coigríche a chur as, go nglanann sé an ceo agus go scaipeann sé an t-amhras.</P>
    <P>Bhí caint ar an bPoblacht, caint ar status na tíre, agus eile.  Is truaigh nach gcuimhníonn an Seanadóir Ó Dubhthaigh nó an Seanadóir Baicstear ar thuairisc a thabhairt i dtaobh brí na <Col N="317" /> bhfocal a bhfuil siad ag baint feidhm an oiread sin astu, &ldquo;Republic agus Republicanism.&rdquo;  Is seafóid an chainnt acu a rá gur &ldquo;Dictionary Republic&rdquo; an Republic seo againne.  Nuair tháinig an t-iar-Thaoiseach os cóir na Dala le freagra a thabhairt ar an gceist díreach, na foclóirí a thug sé isteach nó ar thug sé isteach na téacsleabhra is údarásaí? Ní as foclóirí ach na húdair is fearr a d'fhéadfadh sé fháil ionas go bhféadfadh sé an cheist a fhreagairt go cruinn. Ag an am sin bhí an t-iar-Thaoiseach á ionsaí ar na dlíodóirí&mdash;dlíodóirí do réir gairme agus dlíodóirí nach raibh ina ndlíodóirí do réir gairme.  Tá fhios againn an chaoi a raibh cuid acu sin ag iarraidh é chur i sáinn.  Bhí Sasana á rá, nuair a ritheamar Bunreacht na tíre, an Republican Constitution, nach ndearna sé aon difríocht chomh fada agus bhain sé leo.  Bhí fhios ag an tiar-Thaoiseach, nuair a bhí freagra le tabhairt aige, go mba cheart dó am a thógáil agus a bheith cinnte dá chuid téarmaí sul a dtabharfadh sé an freagra.  Sin é an saghas duine é, nach gnáthach leis freagra tapaidh a thabhairt. Taispeánann gach a ndéanann sé gur fear stáit é.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir nar mhisde a mheabhrú don tSeanadóir Ó Dubhthaigh agus don tSeanadóir Baicstear an chiall atá leis an focal &ldquo;Republican&rdquo; do réir an fhoclóra. Dá gcuirtí ceist ar an Taoiseach sa gCúirt faoi abhar ar bith, nach mbeadh ar an Taoiseach féin dul go dtí na leabhra dlí agus na foclóirí, sul a bhféadadh sé freagra a thabhairt ar an gceist?  Ní shamhlaíonn aon duine gur rud mícheart é, ná aon mhasla don Taoiseach na d'aon dlíodóir eile go rachaidís go dtí na leabhra dlí, nó na teacsleabhra, nó na hAchta le go bhféadaidís freagra a thabhairt ar aon cheist a cuirfí orthu.

      <P>We are all agreed about this Bill.  We are all in favour of it and we will all vote for it.  It will pass without a division. There has been a lot of discussion which was really not necessary at all.  The discussion has turned on the question of whether we were a republic before this will become law or not. One side say that we were not and the other side say we were.  We on this side believe that in essentials the republic was in force in this country for the past 12 years since the enactment of the Constitution, while other people say that it depends on the passing of this Bill.  When we are all in agreement on this particular section of the Bill, that the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act of 1936 is hereby repealed, we all admit that a certain amount of confusion was caused by this Act.  People all over the country and all over the world who did not study the Bill did not realise what it meant.  If this clears the confusion and the misunderstanding we are all in favour of it, so why talk about it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak on this section, but a point occurs to me on which I would prefer to ask for information rather than attempt to make a statement.  I am in favour, naturally, of the passing of Section 1 and of every other section in the Bill, but Section 1, in repealing the External Relations Act, withdraws from the King the authority which he was authorised to use on our behalf in <Col N="319" /> the External Relations Act of 1936.  In that way, we are getting rid of the King as our external agent, but I assume from what has been said in this House and in the other House that we will still be in some form of external association with Canada, Great Britain and the other nations we have been working with in the past and will no longer be any part of the British Empire.  Article 29 of the Constitution, however, says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For the purpose of the exercise of any executive function of the State in or in connection with its external relations the Government may, to such extent and subject to such conditions, if any, as may be determined by law avail of or adopt any organ instrument or method of procedure used or adopted for the like purpose by the members of any group or league of nations with which the State is or becomes associated for the purpose of international cooperation in matters of common concern.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The point I am making is that, by the repeal of the External Relations Act, we are definitely withdrawing the authority from the King to act, but it seems to me that, under the Constitution, if we remain in association with any group of nations in the future, it is quite possible for some future Government&mdash;perhaps a Government led by Senator Bigger&mdash;to come in here and quite constitutionally to restore the King as a constitutional instrument.</P>

I claim that the King was not entitled to do certain things under the Act as such, but that we, under that Act, to use the particular expression &ldquo;may, in certain instances, use the King&rdquo;.  That is a completely different thing.</P>

      <P>I realise the folly of those of us who are not lawyers getting into a discussion on this matter. We had a whirligig of an argument from Senator O Buachalla which led nowhere, and, so far as one could judge, he was not clear himself what he wanted to do and he did not succeed in clarifying the situation for us.  So far as this section is concerned, it is quite clear what it will do.  Senator Quirke has stated it briefly.  We are going to create a situation in which outside nations will be under no misunderstanding as to who accredits our representatives abroad or who signs international agreements.  The President, the head of the State, will do that and whatever Senator O Buachalla may think, the Premier of New Zealand and the people like the author of that article in the <i>Sunday Times</i> are people with international reputations.  They have stated their views as to the status of this country.  That is going to be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 1916 to 1921, we were fighting for recognition for the Irish Republic. We spent a fair amount of money on the man who is now President up in Phoenix Park when he was in Paris trying to get recognition from other nations.  We did not succeed and we have not got it yet.  We are not recognised as an Irish Republic by any nation outside, and it is quite clear that there has been a great deal of confusion within the country.  The statement of Deputy de Valera at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis is an indication of that.  That is all going to pass into history and nobody will be in any doubt whatever, when this Bill is passed, as to what the status of this country is. It is important that we should recognise <Col N="321" /> the fact that not only do we know ourselves what our status is but our status will be accepted by all the other countries, by Mr. Attlee and by all the heads of the States of the Commonwealth. The United States, the French or any of the other peoples of Europe will have no doubt about it.  I think we can all be agreed on that and can accept this section for what it is.  I have not taken up much time on it, but there has been a great deal of talk about nothing and a great deal of talk by some people who did not understand what they were talking about.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Farrell referred to Article 29 and asked how far it would be possible for a future Government to make an arrangement in respect of external association with any group of States.  I suggest that Article 29 is flexible enough to allow any future Government to make an arrangement with any State or group of States.  According to that Article, it would be possible, if the Government of this country considered it expedient, to make an arrangement with, say, the United States of America to do certain things, including the things that have been done under the Act now being repealed. If the Government wanted to do so and provided also that the President of the United States was agreeable to do the things which have been done under the Act which is now being repealed, that sort of machinery could be set up, but, if that is to be done, it can be done only with the sanction of the Parliament of this country.  It would require an Act of the Oireachtas to bring about that position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Senator O'Farrell is the only one which is not simply a matter of discussing history.  I think he wants to know what the Constitutional position will be when this Bill has been passed, and it seems to me that the answer is that this is an act of the Oireachtas, done within the powers it has under the Constitution. It does not amend the Constitution because you cannot amend the Constitution simply by an Act of Parliament.  The Constitution remains exactly where it was before. That means (1) that Parliament has power to pass this Act and (2) it would have the power, if it were foolish enough, to-morrow to reinsert the same thing within the Constitution and to pass some similar Act, provided it came within the Constitution.</P>
      <P>We cannot simply, by an Act of Parliament, amend the Constitution. Therefore the matter does not arise.  I think that if Senator O'Farrell is suffering from any illusions or fears that, for example, Senator Bigger might get into the Dáil or that people with similar views to his might succeed in forming a Government and proceed to pass such legislation, I do not think he need be unduly alarmed, because it would require a majority of both Houses to do so, just as it requires a majority of both Houses to pass this Act.  It seems to me that there is no need for the Senator to worry.</P>

      <P>The Senator misunderstands me.  I did not say it would be necessary to do that.  My point was that it seemed to me it would not be necessary to have special legislation, because Article 29 of the Constitution gives the Government, even though we repeal the External Relations Act, exactly the same power to appoint any foreign instrument, organ or method of procedure in connection with our external relations.  A Government, having that power under the Constitution, would require no new legislation.  It could still appoint anybody it liked, including the King of England.</P>

      <P>May I tell him the practical reason why we put in &ldquo;the Republic of Ireland&rdquo;, apart from the legal reason?  Ireland is, of course, the name of this State in the Constitution. If you are giving a description of the type of State this is, then you will <Col N="325" /> refer to it as &ldquo;the Republic of Ireland&rdquo;, using the constitutional name. If you call it &ldquo;the Irish Republic&rdquo; you are doing something that is not in the Constitution.  What we did, from the constitutional and legal point of view, was to follow the Constitution specifically. Otherwise, we would be told that we were doing something which was unconstitutional.  I suggest to the Senator that what is really worrying him in regard to the expression &ldquo;the Irish Republic&rdquo; is this: that that expression became current in popular usage.</P>

      <P>It probably would, in one sense, but I hope it will not remain because, apart from our desire and our necessity of following the constitutional appellation of the State, we wanted to get rid of the jeering use of the word &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; which has become current in the last few years.  That is the practical reason why we have adopted the expression &ldquo;the Republic of Ireland&rdquo;, and the practical reason coincides with the constitutional necessity of using the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;.

I remember that when the Constitution was going through the Dáil, and when the use of the word &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; was under discussion, somebody asked&mdash;as well as I remember it was Deputy Jordan&mdash; what would be the adjective for Éire. Nobody seemed to know what it could be.  I think it was the same Deputy who suggested that it would be a great disadvantage, which we all agreed it would be, if people began to talk of Éire butter as &ldquo;hairy butter&rdquo;. Well, we are getting rid of that now.</P>

      <P>I should like to have some assurance that, when this Bill becomes <Col N="326" /> law, official documents will bear the heading &ldquo;The Republic of Ireland&rdquo; when they are published in the English language.  In this matter, I think one of the biggest sinners amongst the Departments of State is the Department of Education, a Department from which one would naturally expect precision of language.  The report of that Department bears the heading &ldquo;Éire&rdquo;. The body of the report is in English, with the exception of the Minister's signature.  The Minister for Education continues to use the word &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; in the English text of the Department's reports.  The body of the reports, as I say, is in the English language, but the title at the top is &ldquo;Éire&rdquo;.  I should like an assurance that official documents published in the English language will in future bear the title of &ldquo;the Republic of Ireland&rdquo; and not the incorrect title &ldquo;Éire&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>San Alt seo, Alt 2, táimid ag déanamh, is dóigh liom, rud ciallmhar go dtí pointe, sé sin, táimid ag baisteadh Poblacht ar an Stát.  Fearracht go leor daoine eile, b'fhearr liom dá bhféadadh an Taoiseach agus an Rialtas téarma éigin eile fháil mar ghairm don Stát in ionad an téarma &ldquo;Pobacht,&rdquo; mar is cuma liom céard a tharlós, ní díbreofar as ár gcuimhne go <Col N="327" /> gciallaíonn na focla &ldquo;Poblacht na hÉireann&rdquo; an Phoblacht a fógraíodh i mbliain 1916 agus a bhí i réim sa tír suas go dtí 1921.  Tá deacaireacht ann, fé mar is léir don Taoiseach, téarma feiliúnach fháil.  Cén difríocht a níos an téarma seo &ldquo;Poblacht&rdquo; i gcás na tíre?  Thug an Taoiseach sompla anmhaith air.  &ldquo;Costello&rdquo; an sloinneadh atá air, an t-ainm atá air.  Dlíodóir é&mdash; sin é a ghairm.  Míníonn sé sin céard tá ann.  Díreach ar an gcaoi a dúirt mé an lá eile, tá cúpla miliún beithíoch againn sa tír seo, agus dá gcuireadh an tAire Talmhaíochta&mdash;agus is duine é a dhéanfadh a leithéid&mdash;fógra amach amáireach go gcaithfeadh gach feilméar sa tír cárta a clóbhualadh agus é a chrocadh thart ar mhuineál gach bó agus bulán sa tír á rá gur bó nó bulán an beithíoch sin, cén difríocht a dhéanfadh sé?  Ar aon chaoi, tá súil agam go bhfuilmid ar aon intinn i dtaobh an Ailt seo agus thug an Taoiseach féin míniú ar cén fáth go mba cheart dúinn bheith ar aon intinn faoi.  Is Stát Phoblachtach í seo. Admhaíonn sé gurb ea ó ritheadh an Bunreacht.  Níl seisean anois ach ag tabhairt láí ar láí.  Dúirt sé féin, ag caint ar Imeachta na Dála, colún 1022, Iml.  113, 3, ag cur síos ar an mBunreacht&mdash;ba mhaith liom an réamhrá a léamh chun bheith féireálta dhó:&mdash;</P>

    <P>An Seanadóir Baicstear, nuair chuir sé isteach orm tamall ó shoin, theastaigh uaidh go n-inseoinn dó céard díreach a deireann an foclóir.  Tá cead agam a mheabhrú dhó anois:&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="328" /> Poblacht a bhí sa tír seo ó 1937. D'fhógair mé sin de ló agus d'oíche gach áit a raibh an seans agam, ach is cuimhin liom an t-am nuair a bhí an Bunreacht á chur os cóir na tíre, daoine údarásacha ag dul síos agus suas tríd an tír ag obair in a choinne agus ag rá a mhalairt.  Is mór an moladh don iar-Thaoiseach agus is mór an moladh do mhuintir Fhianna Fáil an obair a rinne siad sna blianta atá caite Mír 2 a bheith sa mBille.  Ag an am céanna, ba mhaith liom a mhiniú don Taoiseach gur dóigh liom nach bhfuil éirithe leis an deacracht a bhí ann i dtaobh &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; nó &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; a bheith mar ainm ar an gcuid seo den tír a sheachaint. Mar shompla, caithfidh mé féin, beagnach gach aon lá a bheith ag cur síos ar chúrsaí tráchtála agus ar chúrsaí geilleagair na tíre fré chéile. Go dtí seo, nuair luainn an téarma &ldquo;Éire,&rdquo; bhíodh orm, go mórmór ag caint le strainséirí, míniú dhóibh gurb iad na 26 contaethe a bhí ar intinn agam. Nuair bhínn ag caint ar thuaisceart na hÉireann bhíodh orm a mheabhrú dhóibh nach é Cúige Uladh a bhíodh i gceist agam ach na Sé Contaethe, cuid d'Éirinn.  Cén difríocht a dhéanfas an téarma nua nuair a bheas muid ag caint ar dhaonra Phoblacht na hÉireann?  Nach gcaithfidh muid a rá i gcónaí: &ldquo;Ní hé Poblacht 32 Contaethe atá ar intinn agam&mdash;séard tá i gceist agam ná na 26 Contaethe&rdquo;?  Ar an gcaoi chéanna, tá an-trioblóid agam maidir le tuaisceart na hÉireann&mdash; caithfidh mé &ldquo;na Sé Contaethe&rdquo; a rá. Bhíodh an Seanadóir Ó hAodha ag magadh go minic faoi chomh míchruinn agus bhí na téarma, &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; agus &ldquo;Ireland.&rdquo;  Is dóigh liom&mdash;agus tuigim go maith an trioblóid agus an deacracht atá ar an Taoiseach&mdash;nach bhfuil an deacracht sin sáraithe againn. Ní féidir linn, ón méid adúirt sé féin linn an lá eile, ach a iarraidh ar mhuintir na hÉireann, an oiread agus tá ar ár gcumas, an téarma seo &ldquo;Republic of Ireland&rdquo; nó &ldquo;Poblacht na hÉireann&rdquo; a chur in usáid.  Is cuma cé leis a dtaitneoidh sé nó nach dtaitneoidh, ach ina dhiaidh sin tá sé chomh maith againn a admhachtáil go bhfuil an deacracht chéanna ann faoin mBille seo agus bhí sa scéal suas go dtí seo.  Mar adeirim, ní dhéanann an tAlt seo ach láí a thabhairt ar láí&mdash;<Col N="329" /> Poblacht a bhí againn ó 1937, admhaíonn an Taoiseach féin é sin.  Admhaíonn duine ar bith a bhreithníos an scéal go réasúnta, Éireannach nó Albanach, gur Poblacht í seo ó ritheadh an Bunreacht.  Ní gá dhúinn dul isteach sa gceist cén fáth nár tugadh Poblacht uirthi.  Pé ar bith fáth a bhí leis, sin í an fhírinne i gcónaí.  Nílmid anois ach ag rá gur Poblacht an Phoblacht a bhí againn go dtí seo.  Is maith liom gur shocraigh an Taoiseach, an dá théarma &ldquo;Republic of Ireland&rdquo; agus &ldquo;Poblacht na hÉireann&rdquo; a thabhairt isteach.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh gach aon duine sa Stát dílis don chomhairle a thug sé dhó, agus go n-úsáidfear ceachtar den dá théarma sin do réir mar is Gaeilge nó Béarla a húsáidfear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>This, like Section 1, is a very simple section, saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is hereby declared that the description of the State shall be the Republic of Ireland...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Already a Senator has asked as to what &ldquo;description&rdquo; conveys.  From the discussion here and in the Dáil since the Bill was introduced, we have heard much about the declaration of the republic, that we now have a republic, but when we read the section before us, we can easily see that we are not in the process of declaring a republic.  We admit that we have already a republic but that that State &mdash;which everyone has known as Eire or Ireland&mdash;is in future going to be known as the republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two questions to which I would like to have a definite answer in connection with the Bill before us.  Article 4 of the Constitution of 1938 reads: &ldquo;The name of the State is Éire, or, in the English language, Ireland&rdquo;.  There has been confusion concerning the use of the word Éire.  Some people suggest that the description was made use of in order to distinguish as between one part of Ireland and another, while others suggest that it is used as being the existing Irish term in preference to the English one.  The Constitution which governs this State and which passed through both Houses cannot be <Col N="330" /> altered here.  The only authority that could change the Constitution are the Irish people.  The Constitution lays it down definitely that the name of this State is Éire or in the English language, Ireland.</P>
    <P>As a layman, seeing that this Bill is being piloted through the Oireachtas by two very capable Ministers, I am sure that one or other of them will be able to answer a question, for instance, as to the position when legal action is being taken.  Will it be by the people of Ireland, of Eire or by the Republic of Ireland?  When will the term &ldquo;Republic&rdquo; be used.  Is it legal to drop the term &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;Republic of Ireland&rdquo;?  In future years that may be a delicate question for lawyers to decide.  I leave the question to the two Ministers.  It is one that should be clarified.</P>
    <P>It is because such a clarification was not in the Constitution when enacted, that people did not quite understand what was being done by making widespread use of the word &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; and that difficulties and confusion were created.  Senator Duffy when speaking on the Bill said there was confusion.  I suggest that there was no confusion, and that whatever confusion did exist was deliberately created.  We are not here to declare a republic.  I do not ask the House to accept my word seeing that at the last sitting of the House we had a statement on the matter from the present Attorney-General. He said when speaking on the Bill:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The point I wish to bring out is that, on the 11th December, we enacted in Dáil Éireann this Act which gave us a republican Constitution...</P>
    <P>Examining the Bill in the time that I and the House have had in which to do it, it would seem to me that the effect of it is to remove the King from the Constitution and to give to this country a republican Constitution. That may or may not be a desirable thing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the statement of Senator Lavery who is now the Attorney-General under the Constitution by which this State functions.  While it is <Col N="331" /> regrettable that the republican Constitution when put before the people met with very serious opposition, we are very glad that people who put up the obstacles have been converted&mdash;both the present Taoiseach and the Attorney-General, and that those associated with the Government have come to accept the Fianna Fáil policy and every step that was taken then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>When this House assembled after the election, Senators elected a Cathaoirleach and a Leas-Chathaoirleach and I think they have sufficient confidence in them to conduct the business without Senator Baxter taking upon himself the duties of the Chair.  Having put these questions to the Taoiseach, as to the use of the word &ldquo;republic&rdquo;, a word that is sacred to the Irish people and which was first declared in 1916, I conclude with the hope that, having renamed this State a republic, we will not go <Col N="332" /> back, seeing that there is no necessity to abandon the &ldquo;republic&rdquo; and that a guarantee will be given that it will be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that by general consent the Bill has passed through various stages, and removed any confusion, I should like to say that I regard as important what Senator Duffy said about the future name of the State, whether it should be described on official documents as Eire or as Ireland.  In order to avoid confusion in future, and perhaps to dispel any that existed in the minds of people in neighbouring countries, the matter should be clarified.  We all know that English writers persist when dealing with Irish affairs in describing this State as Eire.  It is our wish that they should use the term given in the Constitution, Ireland.  If we send literature abroad, as we have been doing for the past 25 years, how can we blame English people for calling this State &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; when we do so ourselves?</P>
      <P>I want to see whatever confusion exists removed by the passing of this Bill.  I wish to ensure that correspondence for places outside the State should have the word Ireland on it.  We could, perhaps, use the Irish version within the State.  For those living in foreign countries the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; has a sentimental value, an association with Irish history.  We ought not to depart from that.  I hope it will be possible to have all literature leaving Ireland for America and for other countries headed with the constitutional version &mdash;Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the last two speakers that the name may be of considerable importance for purposes of clarity.  But, I do not think there should be any too hasty decisions made.  We cannot control the English language and we certainly cannot control the way in which the English people use their own language or the names which they may adopt.  We can, I think, by using &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; help to prevent the likelihood of misunderstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the criticisms of the present <Col N="333" /> Constitution was the belief that the English people, at any rate, would use the word &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; to apply to 26 counties.  We all resent that and all are most anxious that it should stop.  The Government, by changing the name on stamps and by making other changes, particularly in documents that go outside, will be able to do quite a bit, although the most important immediate change would be on customs boundary posts.  It is quite absurd when, say, English people travelling from the Six Counties to the Twenty-six Counties, find one marked &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo; and the other marked &ldquo;Éire&rdquo;.  They naturally assume that is the boundary of what we call &ldquo;Eíre&rdquo;.  It is extremely important that that should be changed.</P>
    <P>I have no sympathy or interest in praise or blame or claims as to who did this or who did that or who made more mistakes or caused more confusion than the other.  That is rather undignified and is something which should be avoided as far as possible in this Bill.  I think, however, that Senator Hawkins got a little bit muddled in his facts.  He quoted Senator Lavery when he was a Deputy and he quoted a speech that he made on a Constitution (Amendment) Bill, amending the old Constitution.  It was the old Constitution which, as amended, by removing the name of the King from it, which then Deputy Lavery described as a republican Constitution. With great respect, I do not think it is of very much importance what he thought at that particular time, and I imagine he would agree with me but it is just as well that we should be clear and that Senator Hawkins should be clear when he raises the matter.  I have no idea what attitude Deputy Lavery took to the new Constitution when it came.  I do not know whether he was a member of the House at the time or not.  I was not a member of Parliament at the time but that is an entirely different matter.  One thing that is quite clear is that the old Constitution was amended, I think the day before the External Relations Act was passed, and that amendment took the King's name <Col N="334" /> out of the Constitution and it could be argued that it was then a republic <i>de facto.</i>  I am not interested in these arguments because I think we look silly to people outside when we spend too much time arguing what we were in 1936 and what we are now, when we can get a Bill which creates a status and makes a description which is carried unanimously through both Houses. Surely we might be content to leave it at that without too much argument.</P>

An trioblóid atá ann faoi an scéal seo ar fad, in Alt a 4 den Bhunreacht adeirtear: &ldquo;The name of the State is Eire or, in the English language Ireland.&rdquo;  'Sé an chuspóir a bhí ag lucht ceapaithe an Bhunreachta agus sé cuspóir agus aidhm an Bhunreachta duine ar bith a bheadh ag caint i mBéarla go dtabharfadh sé &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; ar an Stát agus go dtabharfadh sé &ldquo;Eire&rdquo; ar an Stát dá mbeadh sé ag cainnt i nGaeilge.

Níorbh fhéidir linn tada a dhéanamh faoi.  Sin é an fáth go ndúirt mé gur thaithnigh liom an faire a thug an Taoiseach an lá deireannach do mhuintir na tíre a bheith cúramach faoin ainm a thabharfadh siad arár Stát. Luaidh mé trioblóid a bheith agam fhéin ó am go ham.  Admhaím trioblóid bheith agam go minic agus &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; úsáidte i mBéarla ar an Stát go dtí seo.

      <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill I confined my remarks almost entirely to references to the misuse of this word &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; in the English language.  I had not intended to speak at this stage of the Bill but was persuaded to do so because of the remarks of other speakers who feel, as the people of the country feel, that now that the change in our description has taken place under this Bill, we in the Government should, in all thing which are under Government control, drop completely the misuse of the word &ldquo;Eire&rdquo; when the English language is used.  Our use of the word &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; has been a reason to encourage other people who are not friendly disposed towards us to coin the abominable word &ldquo;Eirish&rdquo;.  We are all agreed, whatever our political opinions may be, that our description is &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; and nothing we do should encourage other people to take that from us.  Other nations have changed their titles and taken new names and the new names <Col N="336" /> have been accepted by the world.  We are entitled to expect that other English-speaking countries associated in the Commonwealth of Nations should accept that change.  It is only reasonable to expect that they should accept our designation of ourselves.  The Taoiseach should give us an assurance, and through us assure the people, that we will never again see official documents in which this country is described as &ldquo;Éire&rdquo;.  We must bring back the use of the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; as the description of the country for it is ours.</P>

      <P>This section simply sets out the form of the words used to describe the State and its objective is to avoid any further confusion or ambiguity in this country or abroad. It has been repeatedly pointed out by the Taoiseach and others that the Constitution of 1937 is republican in form, and it might be said that this Section does little more than to add a label. It is well, however, to guard against <Col N="338" /> implying anything more into the term &ldquo;Republic of Ireland&rdquo; than the words connote, that is to say a type of Constitution in which the people act through their elected representatives only.  In the past many of those who desired and worked for the establishment of a republic both here and elsewhere adopted a policy of non-co-operation with others.  This policy was determined by circumstances and has nothing to do necessarily with a republican form of Constitution.  I stress this point because some people seem to think that a republic must of necessity remain in isolation if it is to survive.  It means that a State is sovereign and has the undisputed right to determine its own destiny, but republics need good will and co-operation just as much as other States in similar circumstances.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that I cannot give the Senator any specific information as to the precise date on which the Bill will come into operation. I think I have explained that there are certain matters that must be the subject of discussion between the two countries.  Legislation will probably have to be passed in the British Parliament and in the Oireachtas.  I think it may not be necessary to wait for the actual enactment of the legislation, but until the precise subjects that have to be dealt with are definitely ascertained I think it is not possible for me to say the date on which it will come into operation.  It will be as early as possible and I do not think it will be too long.</P>

      <P>I want to say just a few words.  First, there has been no confusion in my mind as to whether or not we had a republic.  I know we have had it since 1937, but there has been confusion and it has been difficult sometimes to explain the position to other people, both within the country and outside it, to those who wish to see the truth and also to those who did not wish to see the truth, and there are none so blind as those who will not see. We all know that the republic was first declared in 1916 outside the G.P.O., and it was approved by the people in 1918 and ratified by the Dáil in 1919. Through many vicissitudes and very sad years, it fought its way for life until 1923, when it was finally defeated in arms.  Years passed, and another Government came in, and from the time that Government came in until 1937, bit by bit, to use a commonplace expression which I was accustomed to use at home amongst my friends, they made strenuous and successful efforts to dig us out of the Empire.  One effort after the other succeeded, in face of fierce opposition.  In 1937 we were in the position of having our republican Constitution and from that moment we were a republic.</P>
      <P>Now the name is to be definitely affixed.  There is much to rejoice about, because it is better to have the thing clear, especially when we can discuss it in a reasonable manner with other people, those who are with us and those who are against us.  It has been a hard fight, and I am very pleased that this Government has been the Government to put the label on the republic, if you like to put it that way, to put the name on it.  If the Fianna Fáil Government had attempted it&mdash; for wise and unwise reasons, they did not&mdash;it would not have gone through unanimously, and, in face of the world, it is a great thing to have such an important Bill as this going through unanimously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> There is one more thing I want to say, and it is a rather strange thing&mdash; I do not think there is one in the country who will agree with me&mdash;I am very sorry that we are not to be aliens. Why?  Because we are aliens.  I always like to be what I am.  If I am rich, I do not want to be called poor, and, if I am poor, I do not want to be called rich.  If I am Irish, I do not want to be called English, and, if I am English, I do not want to be called Irish.  We are either Irish or English, and, if we are Irish, we are aliens.  I look on myself as an alien to England, as much as I am an alien to France, Italy, Germany, Switzerland or any other country.</P>
    <P>It is not that I want to be an unfriendly alien&mdash;I am just as friendly as I am towards France&mdash;but I am definitely an alien to England, and I think it is an extraordinary thing that we are to be Irish and yet not aliens to England.  It is trying to have the thing both ways and we cannot have it both ways.  Perhaps we are still living another lie.  However, I am very pleased to be here when this Bill is passing through, as I was very pleased and very proud, on 3rd May, 1933, to be one of 77 Deputies who voted to remove the Oath from the Constitution. That was the first big step and it was a proud and happy day when I went into the Division Lobby in the Dáil to vote against the detested Oath, which up to then all Deputies and Senators had to take.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom féin a rá chomh mór agus tá bród orm agus chomh mór agus tá bród orainn ar fad gur ritheadh an Bille seo d'aon ghuth.  Is rud an-deas é agus is moladh mór do mhuintir an Oireachtais é.  Mar dúirt mé, nuair thosaigh mé ag caint ar an mBille inniu, bhí imní orm ar eagla go gcuirfí leasú síos ar cheann de na hAltanna. Tuigim go maith na smaointí a bhí ag an Seanadóir Bigger.  Ní aontaím leis, ach, san am chéanna, ní féidir liom a rá nach bhfuil trua agam dó agus an chaoi ar cheap sé go ndearnadh feall air agus gur ligeadh síos é.  Is maith liom taobh amuigh de sin, gur admhaigh sé an chaoi a bhfuil an scéal agus an chaoi a bhfuil an saol, agus nár chuir sé as <Col N="341" /> dúinn agus nár mhill sé cúrsaí an Bhille trí aon leasú a chur síos.</P>
      <P>Tógann an Bille seo, tá súil agam, ábhar achrannach as saol polaitíochta na hÉireann.  Mhínigh mé agus mé ag caint cheanna, gurb é mo thuairim nach raibh gá leis an achrann ná leis an easaontas sna blianta atá caite, ach bíodh sin mar atá.  Ná ceapadh aon duine, agus sinne ag cur síos ar na rudaí seo ar an mbealach ar a bhfuilmuid ag cur síos orru agus mé ag dul siar ar an méid a dúradh sna blianta atá caite, ag bailiú fianaise i dtaobh ár gcúis é fhéin, gur le holc don Taoiseach nó don Rialtas é.  Ná ceapadh aon duine nach rabhamar go láidir ar thaobh Bille mar seo ón gcéad uair agus anois. D'fhéadfadh tuairim a bheith aige&mdash;bhí sé agam fhéin&mdash;gur ar éigin a bhí gá leis an mBille; ach ag an am chéana, is léir ón díospóireacht go raibh amhras ar dhaoine, agus, fé mar mhínigh an Seanadóir Nic Phiarais, go raibh gá deireadh a chur leis an amhras sin.  Sa mhéid go gcuireann an Bille seo deireadh leis, tá ríméad orm agus sa mhéid sin molaim an Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an gcuid eile den scéal, caithfear é fhágáil ag lucht staire.  An tAire Gnóthaí Eachtracha, nuair bhí díospóireacht idir é féin agus an t-iar-Thaoiseach, Éamon de Valera, dúirt sé nach rabhadar ábalta teacht ar réiteach faoi na pointí a bhí i gceist acu agus dúirt an Teachta de Valera&mdash;tá sé le fáil ar cholún 946, Imleabhar 113, Uimh. 6:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You are playing with words&rdquo;,</P>
      <P>agus ansin:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. MacBride: I will leave that to the people.  They will be well able to judge.</P>
      <P>Mr. de Valera: And they will judge.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An méid atá scríofa, tá sé scríofa.  Ar an dara lá de Mhí na Nollag, dúirt an tAire Gnóthaí Eachtracha go bhfágfaidh sé an scéal faoi bhreithiúnas mhuintir na hÉireann.  Ar an 7ú lá, tar éis dícheall mór chun an scéal a chur os a gcomhair chomh fada agus d'fhéadfaí é a dhéanamh, thug muintir na hÉireann breithiúntas ar an scéal. <Col N="342" /> Tá sé chomh maith é fhágáil mar sin ag muintir na hÉireann san am atá le teacht.</P>
    <P>Déanann an Bille an méid seo, agus deir an Taoiseach é, agus tá mé ar aon intinn leis: Réitíonn sé an bealach dúinn le díriú ar an gceist achrannach dheireanach atá a déanamh buartha dhúinn a réiteach.  An Bille seo a ritheadh, níl fáth ná abhar nach seasóchaimis ar fad le chéile agus go dílis chun a fháil amach cad é an plean a bheas againn le deireadh a chur leis an deighilt mí-ámharach atá ar an tír. Tá súil agam, de thoradh an Bille seo a rith, nach fada go gcuirfear plean os ár gcomhair le gur féidir linn díriú ar an gceist gan é fhágáil mórán níos fuide.  Tá súil agam, maidir leis na geallúintí a rinneadh le linn an toghcháin deiridh, go bhfuil plean ag cuid de na daoine atá san Rialtas anois le deireadh a chur le deighilt na tíre agus go gcuirfear na pleaneanna sin os comhair na tíre gan mórán moille.  Tá súil agam gur pleaneanna ciallmhara iad chun an eagcóir sin a réiteach.  Tá súil agam nach fada go mbeidh sé de rath agus d'onóir againn sa tSeanad a chur in iúl do mhuintir na hÉireann go huile agus don domhan go huile go bhfuil deireadh leis an deighilt sin atá ag déanamh an oiread sin trioblóide agus an oiread sin caillteanais dúinn mar náisiún.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this Bill leaves the House I would like to say one or two words in relation to it which, I think, may at least show that all of us do not subscribe to the view that the enactment of this Bill is going to effect, by itself, any profound change in the setup of this country.  I am not going to go over any of the ground covered already by the very extensive, almost unlimited, volume of quotations which we have had from Senator O Buachalla. I want to address myself to the condition which will be created here by the enactment of this measure.  The discussion leads me to feel that what most people consider important is separation from Britain.  What I consider important is not merely separation but freedom, and when I say freedom I mean real freedom, not merely the freedom to sing <i>The Soldier's Song,</i> or to fly the Tricolour.  I want to feel <Col N="343" /> that this country is free to protect its people, free to promote their welfare and free to alter its economy in such a way as to ensure that nobody will suffer hunger or want in the midst of plenty.</P>
      <P>Now, I do not know whether some of the speakers on the other side of the House, who have been enthusiastic about the devotion of the Fianna Fáil Party to the republican cause, feel just the same way as I do about this matter. At least, they did not feel that way a year ago.  Some members of the House will remember that I then endeavoured to prevent the enactment of legislation in this House which authorised a British ship-owner to fly the Irish flag on a British-owned ship.  I got no support from the people then supporting the Fianna Fáil Government.  Now, there is not much use talking about freedom or talking about the description on our letter heads if we are going to permit the economy of this country to be subordinated to that of another country, and we are doing that clearly and unmistakably so long as we permit our maritime laws to be construed in the interests of foreign ship-owners.</P>

      <P>That is my difficulty. There is nothing in the Bill dealing with it, and, so far as I know, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent an Irish <Col N="344" /> Government from dealing with it.  I am not aware of any law passed during the last 16 or 17 years which would prevent an Irish Government from dealing with it.  Governments here have, in fact, dealt with currency; they have dealt with trade unions and they have dealt with insurance companies, but in every case they left the position worse than they found it.  I do not know whether you object to my proceeding.  If you do, I do not want to.</P>

      <P>Some of Senator Duffy's friends or supporters are apparently in favour of this Bill.  Others of his friends are not in favour of the Bill. If I judge him rightly Senator Duffy wants to be in the position when this Bill becomes law, of being able to say to one side:&ldquo;When the Bill was under discussion in the Seanad, here is what I said,&rdquo; and to the other side:&ldquo;When the Bill was being discussed on the Final Stage in the Seanad, look at what I said.&rdquo;  I think we have passed the time for any more misunderstanding. Senator Duffy's final contribution could do nothing more than create more misunderstanding.  There is no longer any room for doubt.  We know where we stand to-day and we can say it is a good job that this Bill was introduced if for no other reason than to make a lot of people go back and learn the history of their own country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wanted to make a correction, and I think my colleague Senator Bennett was wrong. It is a great job that the people of this country&mdash;in saying &ldquo;people&rdquo; I mean certain people who did not heretofore go to the trouble of learning Irish history&mdash;as a result of this Bill have gone to that trouble so as to realise what has taken place.  I believe that that is a good thing and I do not think it was right during those debates for people to suggest that those opposed to the Treaty at the time were not on the right side, or that those who were anti-Treaty took the wrong side and because of that we are in the position we are in to-day.  I deny that emphatically. I say that were it not for the people who took the anti-Treaty side then we would never have reached this position to-day.  Since the people who were then in opposition to us became the Government they took the line of opposing every possible advance which was made since Fianna Fáil came into power.  The same thing happened right along.  At every step we were opposed, in the case of the removal of the Oath, the Governor-General and so on.</P>

Many unnecessary points have been introduced in the debate as to what this or that person did.  If we take the long and the broad view we will realise that in every generation over the last 700 years there have always been men and women who did what they considered best for Ireland and there is no necessity to say what we would have done in such circumstances. Let us give credit to all who did something.  I remember as a <Col N="348" /> young man I had no room for the late John Redmond and his Party but on coming to mature years I realised that he did sincerely what he believed was in the best interests of Ireland.  If it were not for these people we would not have the inspiration to do what we did eventually.  Senator Duffy referred to me as a humbug.</P>

      <P>I am very loathe to intervene on the Fifth Stage.  This Bill does remove confusion, but Senator Quirke is labouring under a very grave illusion if he thinks that any Act of Parliament can remove confusion or misunderstanding from the human mind.  Confusion and misunderstanding derive from original sin and we cannot legislate them away as has been very amply proved in the course of this <Col N="349" /> debate in both Houses.  Senator Quirke is under a complete misapprehension if he thinks that the republication of one volume of debates of Dáil Eireann will help to put our history right.  Those of us who have taken part in the history of recent years can only gauge that history in one way.  History is something that will have to be written, measured and appraised later on when the actors who made the history will have passed away.  The best thing we can do is to leave a record of what we think and what we did.  The notion that Parliament and Acts of Parliament can make history clear is a very foolish one.  Governments cannot make history, but Governments can, of course, make certain material available.</P>

      <P>Everything that has happened since, including this Bill seems to me to have confirmed that particular stand.  There is a volume of the Dáil Debates which is just as difficult to get as the volume that Senator Quirke has in his hand. That is the debates after the Treaty had been accepted and approved by the Dáil&mdash;from January 1922 to May 1922.  These debates were very important and if Senator Quirke is doing any historical research I recommend them to him.  They would help him to realize how much he owes to the Treaty. The very seat he occupies was made by, with, and under, the Treaty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's seat was physically made by, with, and under, the Treaty.  The seat on which the Senator sits, the House in which he speaks, the very building in which these debates are held in this and in the other House were transferred to us by virtue of the powers we got as a result of the Treaty.</P>
      <P>Senators have been worried about another section of this Bill dealing with the name and title of the State.  We have been humbugging ourselves to a very large extent by pretence on this language question.  We have made a very foolish effort to mix two languages.  A good deal of the trouble and the objection by us to what the English do, arises from a very foolish attempt of ours to mix two languages which, in fact, do not mix.  We called the State Éire in the English language. The Constitution of 1937 did so in the first draft, or purported to do so; it said that &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; was the name of the State.  There was an amendment; &ldquo;and, in the English language, Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The original idea was to call it Eire. We tried to bring a word into the English language.  When the English people got that word, they naturally did what they liked with it, making adjectives &ldquo;Éireann&rdquo; and &ldquo;Éirish.&rdquo;  We cannot dictate to the English people what kind of language they will speak, and neither can we, by any process, mix the two languages here and expect to get satisfactory results.  I do not know if Senators ever attended a meeting which they had to address and began with &ldquo;Mr. Chairman&rdquo;, or when the Taoiseach was present with &ldquo;Mr. Chairman, Mr. Taoiseach&rdquo;.  That is very stupid.  &ldquo;Mr. An Taoiseach&rdquo; which I have heard, would be still more stupid.  If you happen to know Irish and say &ldquo;Mr. Chairman&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Thaoisigh&rdquo;, that seems to be an incongruous mixture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one starts out to do something with a perfectly good intention, it sometimes leads one to paths that were never suspected.  One must travel these paths.  We cannot make English people use their own language <Col N="351" /> in the particular way Irish politicians wish them to use it.  If we continue to use the word Eire the same result will follow.</P>
    <P>I should like to express my complete agreement with Senator Colgan that nobody ought to think at this stage that he has a monopoly of patriotism or sole charge of the republican tradition. The republican tradition is neither Gaelic nor Catholic.  The Gaelic tradition in this country was essentially royalist and was not democratic in the modern sense.  The republican tradition comes to Ireland entirely through the English language and is comparatively recent.  <i>En passant</i> Saorstat Éireann was the official Irish translation of Irish Republic by the first Government in 1919.  We should not endeavour to find out what Party has done most but rather acknowledge that every Party, and Parties before we were heard of did good for Ireland in different generations and that when this Bill has been passed it will be a distinct advance. This Government is doing something now which the previous Government did not do and perhaps in their circumstances could not have done. Ministers in the present Government have the opportunity to do it now.  It is a step forward.  We should welcome the advance without wrangling as to where the credit for the advance should lie.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to prolong this debate but I feel that it would not be proper for me to let it conclude without thanking Senators from all sides for the manner in which this debate has been conducted and for the sympathy with which this Bill has been received.  It is a great source of satisfaction to me and to my colleagues in the Government that while naturally Senators on different sides wish to put forward their own viewpoints to make clear their claims to have made contributions to the situation which will be, shall we say, clarified by this Bill, there has been no effort to belittle results achieved or benefits that we hope will accrue to the people from the enactment of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> There has been considerable discussion on the confusion that existed, or that was thought to exist, since 1936, as to the nature of this State's status. I want to say on this Final Stage of the Bill what I have stated before and reiterated.  The purpose of this Bill is not to end the confusion.  The purpose of this Bill is not to gain any political advantage for the Government.  The real aim of the Bill is to end the bitterness that has been in existence between sections of our people for the last 25 years.  I think Senators generally, in discussing the measure, have given a headline to the people.  They have not attempted to belittle results.  They have not, as a whole, endeavoured to introduce any bitterness into the discussion. We hope, and I think it will be the unanimous desire of all Senators, and of every section, that from this time onward there will be no digging into the past, no recrimination, no competition as to whether this Party or that Party gave the greater contribution to the fulfilment of the national ideals, which we all share.</P>
    <P>Senator Miss Pearse said that she was sorry she would not be an alien after this Bill passed.  May I assure Senator Miss Pearse that when this Bill is enacted and put into operation, she will be an &ldquo;alien&rdquo; because, from the point of view of our law, she will be an Irish national&mdash;an Irishwoman. As I stated in the Dáil when this Bill was going through, the purpose of the fight for freedom for the last 700 years has been to make Irishmen what are called &ldquo;aliens&rdquo; but what we recognise as Irish nationals.  No Party in this State has ever recognised that any Irishman or Irishwoman has any nationality other than Irish nationality. We fought for that in the Imperial Conferences of 1926, 1929 and 1930.  We never gave way one inch on that.</P>
    <P>That fight for recognition, according to British law, was only recognised by the British Parliament in passing the recent British Nationality Act, which will come into operation on the 1st of January of next year.  Up to last month, according to British legal authorities, Irishmen or Irishwomen in England were British subjects.  That has come to an end now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="353" /> I say that if we had not been able to achieve what we have in fact achieved, recognition of this as a republican State, without dislocation of business, economy or finance, we would still have brought in this Bill and taken all the consequences with it.  We would be regarded as &ldquo;aliens&rdquo; as Senator Miss Pearse has stated.</P>
    <P>The Commonwealth countries agreed with us&mdash;South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India.  They recongnised that there is a certain relationship between us, not based on any nonsense about links or whether we are in or out of the Commonwealth, but a relationship arising from tradition and long established usage, and that it is good business to continue it.  Therefore, while our people will be recognised in England as Irishmen and Irishwomen we will have attached to our Irish nationality the same rights as the British, or as it is in the Act, British subjects.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that we are still &ldquo;aliens&rdquo; but with special rights as such accorded by British law.  That is to say, we have our Irish nationality but, by arrangement, we will give British subjects and Commonwealth citizens certain rights in this country that these countries have reciprocally agreed to give Irish citizens in Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa and India.  That does not jeoprdise our nationality.  It recognises what we have asserted for 700 years.</P>
    <P>When this Bill comes into operation we will have something which will be of inestimable advantage to the Irish people.  I hope and I believe we will have put an end to bitterness based upon the past history of this country and that we will have given to the Irish people institutions round which they can rally, and of which they can be proud.  These institutions will be to Irishmen and Irishwomen what the Crown is to British subjects, whether they are in Australia, in Canada or elsewhere.  They will be our institutions.  Irish institutions, and the young people who have held apart from politics in this country for the last 28 years, can now come in and <Col N="354" /> take their part in the very serious and difficult tasks that still lie ahead of us.</P>
    <P>I rejoice to hear from Senators Stanford and Fearon that the people whom they represent are resolved to play their part.  We have welcomed them long before to-day or yesterday, or this month or last month. They have a part to play and I believe they will play it, a part in the new Ireland, a part we want them to play, and one which will be valuable to the new Ireland.</P>
    <P>Throughout the course of this debate, I have carefully and scrupulously avoided referring to myself personally or to the Party to which I have the honour to belong.  I do not propose to depart from that self-imposed rule in my concluding speech on this Bill, but I will give myself one indulgence and one only.  I will say that it is a matter of the greatest regret to me that I had not the opportunity&mdash;and never will, I suppose&mdash;of having Senator Bigger in the witness box for one quarter of an hour.  If I had, I would demonstrate to any impartial judge and jury that the speech he made about me was not merely disreputable but dishonest.</P>
    <P>The last thing I have to say is that I have often been proud to belong to Cumman na nGaedheal and Fine Gael and was never prouder than I am to-day on this last stage of The Republic of Ireland Bill, that I am still a member of the Fine Gael Party.</P>

      <P>I beg formally to move the motion standing in the name of Senator Hayes:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Cork Gas Order, 1948, proposed to be made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and laid in draft before Seanad Éireann on the 9th day of December, 1948, under sub-section (4) of Section 10, Gas Regulation Act, 1920, be approved, <Col N="355" /> subject to the following modification:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;Deletion of Article 17&rsquo;.  </P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave) Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cork Gas Consumers' Company has made an application to the Minister for Industry and Commerce under Section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, and the Gas Regulation (Special Orders) Rules, 1940, for a special Order to effect certain modifications of the Cork Gas Act, 1868, and the Cork Gas Order, 1940, for the purpose of making better provision for the proper and efficient conduct of the company's undertaking.  The principal object of the Order is to provide for increased, borrowing powers to the extent of £150,000; and to authorise the creation, issue and redemption of debenture stock, the interest being limited to 4 per cent.  Section 17 of the Cork Gas Act, 1868, authorised the issue of £150,000 capital, the issue of which was not completed until 1947. The immediate purpose for which the new capital is required is to acquire additional plant to a total value of £133,000.</P>
      <P>The Cork Gas Act of 1868, which fixed the original capital at £150,000 and limited the rate of interest of debenture stock to 5½ per cent. requires modification accordingly.</P>
      <P>It is proposed also to create a redemption fund from the profits of the company for the purpose of redeeming the loan, mortgage, debenture or debenture stock raised or created by the company.  Another proposal is to secure power to grant pensions, gratuities or allowances to employees of the company, and to create schemes allowing employees to participate in the profits of the company as part of the terms of remuneration.  Power is also sought to improve the internal management of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to repeal Section 27 of the Cork Gas Act, 1868, which formerly provided for the creation and issue of stock, and Section 57 of the same Act, which empowered the company to cut off gas; and Articles 4,5, <Col N="356" /> 6, and 21 of the proposed Order replace the repealed provisions.</P>
    <P>The Gas Regulation Act of 1920 altered the old and cumbersome procedure whereby statutory gas undertakings were obliged to secure their powers by way of Private Act or provisional Order confirmed by a special Act of Parliament, and provided instead that powers or additional powers could be secured by a special Order approved by a resolution of both Houses.</P>
    <P>The procedure, as now laid down, requires that the draft Order be prepared by the Gas Undertaking, and that full publicity of the intention to apply for the Order, and of the contents of the draft, be given by notices in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and local newspapers. Notification must also be given to the State and to private interests involved. One month is given for the lodging of objections; the subsequent stages being dealt with in accordance with the Gas Regulation Act, 1920.</P>
    <P>If there are objections, an inquiry may be held and after considering the report of the person who held the inquiry the Minister may modify the draft before submission to the Oireachtas, or he may decline to submit the draft.  As the representations from objectors have been disposed of by agreement, no inquiry is necessary in this instance.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that the draft Order, as now before the House, contains Article 17, whereby the company applied for powers to make a minimum charge of 10/- per quarter for gas supplied. Shortly, the company's case was that as they were required by law to supply gas on demand, a minimum charge of 10/- per quarter would be reasonable.  I felt, however, in view of all the circumstances, that I could not recommend the grant of powers which might possibly result in hardship for consumers from the lowest income groups.  The company subsequently agreed to the omission of Article 17 from the proposed Order.  Subject, therefore, to the deletion of Article 17, I submit the draft for approval of the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I be allowed to say a few words?  This is the kind of Order that we have been discussing for <Col N="357" /> the past two or three years as being a desirable type of Order, that is to say an Order which is laid in draft before both Houses so that it might be considered before being confirmed by the Minister.  Under recent statutes relating to companies it has been the practice to permit the Minister to make an Order and to provide for its annulment by either House within a specified time.  These older Acts proceed along different lines.  They require that an Order be tabled in draft and provide that it shall have no effect unless or until it is confirmed by resolution of both Houses.</P>
      <P>We are asked to-night to confirm the Order described in the motion moved by Senator Douglas.  There are one or two points concerned with this undertaking which I think require some clarification.  As I understand it the company, when it was first incorporated under the Act of 1868, had an authorised capital of £150,000.  I think that £120,000 of that capital was actually paid over to the old companies whose property was purchased by the present undertakers, the Cork Gas Company, leaving a sum of £30,000 as being the total amount of new capital which could be raised under the Act of 1868, but Section 25 of that Act provided that independently of its capital the company might borrow £25,800.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was also power, I think, in Section 27 for the creation of debentures and I do not know whether there is any limit to the sum which could be raised by way of debentures.  What is being proposed under this Order is that the company shall be empowered to create new debentures.  The company is authorised by the State to issue redeemable debenture stock to the extent of £150,000, a sum equal to the total capital.  I do not know whether that is a good system or not, but it is one at any rate, which might seem the subject of some inquiry.  I take it that the Parliamentary Secretary has made some inquiry into the structure of the company, its financial prospects and methods of operation, but I would like if the House could get some assurance that the company is in a position to issue debentures for £150,000 and to meet the charges of <Col N="358" /> 4 per cent. which would be guaranteed in respect of these debentures.  I do not want to oppose the motion but I would have asked the House to resist the confirmation of the Order were it not that Article 17 was deleted, because it would be a preposterous proposition for the gas company to have a minimum charge of £2 a year whether the gas were used or not or that anybody that was linked up with the company should have to pay a minimum fee of £2 a year whether he used the gas or not.  It was the practice with regard to electricity in Cork to pay 7/6 a quarter as a minimum fee in the old days, and maybe the gas company are trying to get away with something similar.  I have no objection to make to this Order but I think we should have some further explanation as to what is implied as far as capital structure is concerned.</P>

      <P>Senator Duffy has asked for further particulars.  The position is that the company requires to carry out certain improvements. They are in a position to acquire plant which was not available during the war but the company require to increase their capital to purchase it and also certain other equipment.  The Senator is anxious to know whether the company is in a sound financial position. I can assure him that it is and that all the capital which is now required will be profit earning.</P>

      <P>They are free to take any steps the company see fit.  I do not know whether it is proposed to apply to any other State companies or not, but I imagine they will go on the open market.  I would like to say in connection with this that the Cork Gas Company have reduced their prices by 4d. a therm, so that from the point of view of prices the company is satisfactory and I think that the fact that they require this money for capital purposes is an indication of the successful way they have operated.  In addition to the plant required there is, approximately, £133,000 for certain other works they <Col N="359" /> wish to carry out, and that makes up the balance of the £150,000.</P>
      <P>The Senator referred earlier to the form of the Order.  This Order is, as he says himself, in a desirable form, because it gives the members of the Oireachtas the opportunity of reading the proposed Order before it is actually made and of refusing to confirm it rather than annul it by resolution, as is the case with most Orders under the Emergency Powers Act.  The Senator will realise, as the House will realise, that this Order is made under an old statute when Orders of this kind were not as urgent as orders in the present day.</P>

It is the company make the draft Order and the Department submitted to the company that they should delete Article 17, which they agreed to do; but if they were to redraft the Order, they would have to republish it and a further period of a month would have to elapse before any inquiry with all the necessary publication and detail attached to it.  For that reason, and only for that reason, this Article 17 appeared in the Order as it is.  It is really only a question of procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators will remember, this is an annual measure.  The House will also remember that it is necessary that it should become law before the end of this year.  It seeks to continue in <Col N="361" /> operation a certain very limited number of enactments.  So far as the bulk of the enactments mentioned in the explanatory memorandum circulated to Senators are concerned, they must await permanent legislation.  There are a number of Local Government Acts scattered through the whole code and it will be some considerable time before proposals for legislation to deal with them will be ready.</P>
      <P>There are two items to which I want to refer.  One is the Statutory Undertakings (Temporary Increase of Charges) Act, 1918.  This has been replaced by a provision in the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948.  The other is the Combined Purchasing Act of 1925.  The change in that respect is that the Combined Purchasing Act, 1939, replaces the Act of 1925, but it will not be possible to give effect to that measure for some time. Senators will understand that it is very largely associated with the supply position and the time is not quite opportune for putting it into force nor does the supply position warrant the putting into force of the Act.  The only point I wanted to make was that certain progress has been made in the matter of preparing the permanent legislation which must replace the bulk of the enactments mentioned in the explanatory memorandum, and I do not think that at this stage any further explanation of the Bill is called for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is no harm to point out that, as most members of the House will remember, ten years ago, the Schedule would be a complete page of enactments which were being continued. We are now getting to the stage at which there are very few of these being continued as annual enactments. As the Minister pointed out, <Col N="362" /> the two enactments of the Oireachtas which are continued here will eventually go.  The Combined Purchasing Act will go the moment the 1939 Act takes its place.  It is a matter of the shortage of supplies which we were told last year was the cause of the holding up of the implementation of that Act. Section 65 of the Local Government Act will disappear from this list, I take it, when the Sanitary Services Act comes into force and there are therefore left these three old British Acts mentioned at the top of Part I of the Schedule.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether these are satisfactory or not, but there is one which I think ought to be re-examined at some stage, the Labourers Act of 1883.  That is, in fact, the basic law in relation to labourers' cottages.  Why it has been continued since 1883, a period of over 60 years, I do not know, but apparently there was some reason why it could not be made permanent. I suggest that the Minister might have it examined again with a view to finding out why the whole of the Labourers Act of 1883 should not become a permanent measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to make a very long statement on this Bill.  It may be necessary to trouble the House with certain figures so that there will be a full understanding of the position arising in connection with it.  For instance, in the other House, certain doubts were expressed as to whether this measure was, in fact, continuing the provisions in previous Acts.  We are advised that the <Col N="363" /> operation of the 1946 Act is being definitely extended in this measure. The earlier Acts dealing with the payment of the agricultural grant, and regulating the basis of its distribution, go back to the Local Government Act of 1898.  Senators familiar with the earlier history of this matter will know that at first there was a fixed amount. It was originally fixed at £599,011 and remained unaltered until 1925.  From 1925 on, various Acts which were passed varied the amount of the grant.  That was the position from 1925 until 1946. For example, in 1936 the amount of the grant was fixed at £1,870,000.  This figure obtained until 1946.  In that year the Act which was passed increased the grant substantially and made a fundamental change, the change being that a fixed amount was no longer provided.  Provision was made for certain reliefs on a fixed basis.</P>
      <P>The first of these was a primary allowance at the rate of 3/5th of the general rate on land valuations not exceeding £20 and the first £20 of higher valuations; secondly, a supplementary allowance of 1/5th of the general rate on the whole of the land valuation above £20; and thirdly, an employment allowance calculated at the rate of 10/-in the £ on the land valuation above £20 subject to the limitation of £6 10s. 0d. for each man at work.  The position has since continued on that new basis.  The 1946 Act applied to the two financial years&mdash;31st March, 1947 and 1948.  The Act was also applied to the present financial year by the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1947, which was passed this time last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that there was an intention during the lifetime of the previous Administration to make a change in the matter of the employment allowance after the 31st March, 1948.  In fact, that was fairly clearly indicated in the Budget statement of the Minister for Finance in 1946.  It was eventually decided to continue the allowance, and provision was made accordingly in the Bill which continues the operation of the scheme up to the 31st March, 1949.  Roughly, the position <Col N="364" /> therefore is that the fixed amount having disappeared, certain variable amounts have been substituted for it. That is related to the actual amount of rates struck by the local authority and varies accordingly.</P>
    <P>I feel that a number of questions could be raised on this Bill affecting the whole position of local taxation.  I have a recollection of such discussions in the other House, and I am aware that it opens up the prospect of a general discussion on the question of local taxation.  In the other House, I pointed out that opportunities would be afforded for discussions of that kind on motions which appear on the Dáil Order Paper.  I would like to ask, as far as I can, the indulgence of Senators on that particular matter.  This is, of course, a temporary Bill.  Neither do I feel confident or ready to discuss in any broad general way the whole question of the agricultural industry which, to some extent, is linked up with this matter of rates on agricultural land.  I do not think that at this stage there is anything further I need say.  If there are any points that I have not made clear or any information which members of the House think I can give them, I shall be happy to do so before the debate concludes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has very wisely pointed out, this is a Bill which could provide a very wide field for discussion if we were not inclined to confine ourselves to the provisions contained in it.  The question of rates, and the relief of rates, is one which affects the vast majority of the people in urban and rural Ireland.  At the present time&mdash;and I suppose we may expect the tendency to continue for some years to come&mdash;an increase in rates is to be observed in the case of every county and under every local authority.  As the Minister has pointed out this Bill proposes to give certain reliefs in the matter of rates to the agricultural community.  There is the primary allowance at the rate of 3/5ths of the general rate on land valuations not exceeding £20 and the first £20 of higher valuations.  There is a supplementary allowance of 1/5th of the general rate on the whole of the land valuation above £20.  Part III of the <Col N="365" /> Bill is the part to which I desire to direct the Minister's particular attention, because I think it is the one that is most important.  There is then the employment allowance calculated at the rate of 10/- in the £ on the land valuation above £20 subject to the limitation of £6 10s. 0d. for each man at work.  What that allowance means is this that we are giving a rebate up to a maximum of £6 10s. 0d. on every agricultural holding for each man employed there.  I have had complaints that while that is the general principle there are certain flaws which nullify the effect of the provision.  In order to benefit under it a man must be employed on a holding for a complete year.  For example, if for any reason an employer has to change his employee, or if the employee, for some good reason decides to change his employer during the year, then the employer will not get the £6 10s. 0d. relief in respect of that man.</P>
      <P>A particular set of circumstances existed at the time the 1946 Act was passed.  I am sure many Senators will agree with me that conditions have changed since then and not for the better.  While the relief of rates on agricultural land might be regarded as generous at that time, it is not so now due to the changed conditions.  We are aware that after the 1st of January, agricultural wages, for example, will be increased and that it will then be obligatory on a farmer to give his employee not only holidays with pay but a half holiday as well.</P>
      <P>We have increased rates throughout the country, increased demands for public health services, and increased wages for local authorities' staffs. This general rise in rates eventually will bring about a rise in the cost of living; so what was generous in 1946 is not going to be of such great benefit to the farmers in 1949, for whom this Bill makes provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said in the Dáil, as he said here to-night, that when this relief of agricultural rates was first introduced it was for £599,000.  It is proposed to spend in the region of £3,600,000 in the current year.  While that may seem to be a considerable <Col N="366" /> sum, we have a figure given by the Minister for Agriculture in the Dáil that the increase in agricultural wages is going to place a burden of some additional £6,000,000 on the farmers. While the giving of a grant of £3,000,000 might be generous in 1946, the Minister should consider making this Bill more generous.  He has informed this House and the Dáil that this is a temporary measure and that the whole question of rates and its relation to social activities and the maintenance of our institutions is under active consideration.</P>
    <P>We have had in the past many proposals for complete derating and a commission sat to examine this question and turned it down.  In recent weeks and months we have a tendency, deplored many times, of adding on to the local authorities the carrying out of functions and services that should be carried out by payments from the Central Funds.  We had first placed on them the responsibility of giving supplementary assistance, 75 per cent. of which was borne by the Central Fund previous to the Order made by the Minister for Social Welfare.  We made provision last year that the extra cost of health services would be borne by the Central Fund until the Central Fund would be contributing 50 per cent. of the total cost.  Quite recently, I have seen in the local Press throughout the country where applications for wages increases are being made and the Minister for Health and the Minister for Local Government himself have sanctioned them, on one condition &mdash;that the local authority be prepared to bear the additional cost on the rates.  I have an idea that that is not strictly in accordance with the terms of the Public Health Acts.</P>
    <P>However, that is a matter for local authorities themselves to take up later on.  I would ask the Minister particularly to consider the grievances of employers where they are not given an opportunity of benefiting under this Bill because the employment is broken for any particular period.  You must have an employee for the whole period of 12 months or you are not entitled to benefit and that is one of the grievances.  The Minister should increase <Col N="367" /> the employment allowance, as the sum it will take will be very small. If the present policy is continued much longer, the number employed by farmers will be so small that there will be very little use for this third section to the Bill at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of Senator Hawkins' plea for additional grants in aid of agricultural rates, I was a member of the commission to which he referred, in 1931, the Derating Commission, when the whole subject matter was considered carefully in the light of the then recent English derating of agricultural land where the circumstances were entirely different from ours.  That commission reported against the general derating of agricultural land on the grounds that the real relief granted to agriculture would not be as great as was popularly supposed.  Before we can really measure accurately the effect of derating or agricultural grants, we need far more statistics regarding agricultural costings than we have at present. The Department of Agriculture has always been rather slow to engage on agricultural costings.  That may not be exactly relevant to the present measure, but I throw out the suggestion that the correct and scientific investigation of rating problems is quite impossible in the absence of more agricultural statistics.</P>
      <P>The 1931 Commission came to the conclusion that the rates actually formed a smaller percentage of total costs than appears to farmers' imagination. They further recommended against complete derating on the ground that the money which would be necessary for the additional agricultural grants would have to be found either by the non-agricultural population, which was already very heavily taxed, or by taxes which ultimately would fall on the shoulders of the farmers themselves. The difficulty here, unlike England, is that the greater part of the population is engaged in agriculture, directly or indirectly, and, therefore, the taxes necessary for the additional grants must fall ultimately on the farmers themselves and the apparent relief would really be illusory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" /> Since that date in 1931&mdash;not that I am in any way opposed to reducing taxation on agriculture, but I am opposed to reducing it at a time when other sections of the population have much stronger claims to relief, if relief can be given&mdash;the situation has changed in favour of agriculture in two respects.  In the first place, as the Minister said this evening, and the detailed figures are given in the Dáil Report for Thursday, 9th December last&mdash;the actual amount of money available for the agricultural grant has been very substantially increased since 1931.  To that extent, the recommendations of the commission have been disregarded.  Secondly, the agricultural income of the country has greatly risen, owing to the rise in agricultural prices.  Since 1939, agricultural prices have doubled.  As Deputy Childers pointed out in the Dáil last week, as given in column 1282 of the 9th December, in 1938 the rates on agricultural land were roughly 5.6 per cent. of the agricultural income; in 1947 they were only 3.2 per cent; in other words, the rates had not risen as rapidly as the money income of the farmers.</P>
    <P>I do not want to oppose any reduction of taxation on any section of the community.  My reason for intervening is that the figures in the Derating Commission Report suggested that in 1931 farmers, far from being more heavily taxed than other members of the community, were less heavily taxed and that the urban members of the Irish community were paying a disproportionately large share of taxation.  Those figures are to be found in the Report and Appendices. If that was true then, it is even more true to-day, because the whole course of events since then, especially since the beginning of the war, has been in favour of the agricultural population and against people with fixed incomes in towns.  If the farmers were favourably situated, as the Derating Commission suggested in 1931, in relation to people in towns, the whole course of events since then has made them even more favourably situated to-day.</P>
    <P>While I should like to see farmers getting additional relief from rates, I <Col N="369" /> should like to see everybody who is suffering from taxation getting relief. Inside the narrow limits of the Bill I suggest that, before any relief is given to farmers by way of agricultural grants, the salaried classes in the towns have a very much more cogent claim for relief.  They have suffered from a steep rise in income-tax, a form of taxation which, for the most part, farmers do not pay at all.  They have also suffered from a very steep rise in the cost of living and, in very few cases, has that rise been matched by advances in income, while there has also been a steep rise in rates for which they get no assistance.  I intervened in this debate to point out the difficulties of a section of the population which I regard as having a prior claim for consideration in any relief that the Government may give.</P>

      <P>As it does not matter on what side of the House one sits in a debate like this, one has to express one's views accordingly.  I was impressed by Senator Hawkins's remarks and had a feeling that had such statements as he expressed been made when he was on this side of the House we, when on the opposite side, would have been in a much stronger position. That may seem a complicated comparison but it is a fact.  The truth is that the inheritance of the present Minister for Local Government was built up by Senator Hawkins and members of his Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that any Senator from the provinces who casts his mind back over the last eight or nine years must admit that rates then were about 10/- in the £ less than they are to-day.  Many extra charges were heaped on local authorities in these years.  For instance, we had to contribute towards the purchase of boots for children of neighbours, some of whom were in a better position to purchase boots than those who had to contribute to that charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hawkins made a number of intelligent suggestions.  The truth is that the present Minister will be confronted with demands for concessions <Col N="370" /> from the agricultural community that they have never yet been able to wring from any Minister for Local Government or Minister for Finance towards the relief of rates.  Rates and other demands on farmers are mounting.  In my view farmers' incomes here and in every other country have reached their peak and, probably, have passed the peak.  It does not matter what Party is in power.  We have come to the point when there is a decline in farmers' incomes.  A well known American economist has expressed the view that farming incomes in the United States may be cut by 20 per cent.  A situation like that will have to be faced by the Minister and his colleagues.  The present burden of rates is beyond the ability of farmers to carry on their incomes.</P>
    <P>In reference to Senator O'Brien's remarks I find a difficulty in dealing with them.  The Senator has a trained mind and has all his life been making a study of economics, not only as they affect agriculture but the nation's business as a whole.  I was a member of the commission to which the Senator referred, that considered the derating problem.  It is true that the commission as a whole was not prepared to recommend complete derating, but the Senator will admit that even on the commission there was a distinct break, and that there was different reports.  The Government of the day did something in between, and made concessions approximating more closely to the view of the country members of the commission.</P>
    <P>In 1938 the proportion of the agricultural income spent on rates amounted to 5.6 per cent. of the total income and in 1947 that percentage had fallen to 3.2 per cent.  I have not come armed with statistics, and I cannot remember the figures, but I suggest that they require closer examination. Out of the total agricultural income in 1947 the proportion spent on rates was 3.2 per cent. but the proportion of income retained by farmers in that year was considerably less than the proportion they retained in 1938.  If the question is examined it will be found that the amount spent on wages is now a very much larger proportion than it was <Col N="371" /> previously and that, as a consequence farmers have much less money on hands.</P>
    <P>Before making a comparison regarding relief for farmers and for the salaried classes, I would want to have statistics relating to our total national income.  If I had these statistics, I think I could prove to the satisfaction of the House, and even of Senator O'Brien, that the salaried classes in town enjoy a much higher proportion of the national income than farmers, in proportion to what they produce. The vast bulk of the people in the towns and cities are non-producers. If they are to be entitled to the same measure of relief out of national taxation as essential producers lay claim to, I do not think, in equity, that that could be justified.  As members of county councils having to deal with local administration know, the whole question of local taxation arises.  There are more claims for mental hospitals, for roads, and even for the manning of local institutions since the introduction of the County Management Act. I wish that some member of a county council would examine the increase that has taken place in administration costs at the centre under the County Management Act, and make a comparison with the cost before the introduction of that Act.</P>

These developments over a long period of years have presented us with a situation to-day which is really very difficult and financially is getting almost beyond our control.  I am very largely in agreement with Senator Hawkins in many of the points he makes.  The fact is, of course, that he is a convert, because he has gone over to that side of the House.  The facts remain and have to be faced by the Minister.  I know people of the point of view of Senator Professor George O'Brien are reluctant to yield to the agricultural community the claim they make for relief in local taxation, but I would ask Senators to consider the increase in all these charges over the years and would suggest to Senator O'Brien that it would be a very interesting study to examine the maintenance of roads, the maintenance of our public institutions, and see the immense increase in the cost of upkeep compared with the time when we made that report, to consider the agricultural income and the national income; the proportion of national income that the farmers get; sub-divide it again between the farmers and the people who work for them, and see what resources they have to bear these burdens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an aspect of our policy with regard to the relief of rates, in so far as it concerns the Minister for Local Government, which must be faced.  It has to be faced scientifically, not, as heretofore, by rule of thumb method, determining a certain amount to-day and a different amount to-morrow, so that you do not know whether you are going to get it or not.  We did not know at the beginning of this year before the elections whether there would be any relief or not and, whatever the Minister is going to do now, I suggest that he and his colleagues will have to face up to this situation, as will the whole country.  My opinion about it is that the urban community and the people who are not in possession of land are not making the contribution to the maintenance of <Col N="373" /> these institutions and local services that they ought, in equity, be compelled to make.</P>

      <P>The enactment of the Republic of Ireland Bill has had immediate results here.  We find Senator Baxter and Senator Hawkins on one word in relation to the relief of rates on agriculture&mdash;the first time that it has happened during the long years that this House has been in existence.

      <P>The question that has eluded me is the effect which this Bill has on the ordinary farmer.  I have no idea, and I have never been able to find out, what the farmer gets out of this Bill.  Judging by Senator Baxter, he is getting nothing out of it.  Senator Hawkins takes much the same view, and the contribution of Senator O'Brien was not helpful from the point of view of telling me what we are giving the farmer.  I have been calculating, however&mdash;I may be entirely wrong&mdash; that if the farmer is getting a remission equal to three-fifths of his rates, it means that out of £10 there is a remission of £6.  In other words, the farmer is paying £4 where otherwise he would be paying £6, if it were not for this Bill or a Bill like it.  I think there are other reliefs.  I do not know whether the gentleman with the £10, for instance, would also get a supplementary allowance.  He probably would, at any rate in certain circumstances, get relief in respect of employed labour, but the thing that I am at sea about is the total contribution which we are making out of public funds, the contribution which is being made by the taxpayer, including the farmer himself, of course, to the farming community, under this Bill.  That ought to be <Col N="374" /> cleared up, if it can be cleared up, but, from what has been said by different speakers, it is not at all easy to make that calculation.  At one stage it was a simple thing, but nowadays, apparently, with the three headings under which calculations are made, I imagine each farmer is a unit and it would be very difficult to tell me what the Bill means in pounds, shillings and pence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The total rate on lands would be something over £7,000,000 were it not for these reliefs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it, therefore, that the figure which has been mentioned by the Minister for 1947-48 the last local government financial year, of £3,175,000 odd means somewhere in the neighbourhood of £9 per farm, that is to say £9 on an average for the small farmer and the big farmer.  It means that the small farmer is getting very little, but that the big farmer is getting a very substantial sum.  I suggest to Senator Baxter that that is one of the difficulties of this matter; farms are not all the one size; we have big farmers and small farmers; there are very wealthy people in the farming community, but there are also very poor people in the farming community. What I feel is that the whole principle of giving relief of rates on any system which has been adopted up to the <Col N="375" /> present has the effect of giving to the farmer with 1,000 acres a very substantial relief indeed, and to the man on the bogs of Connacht with ten or 15 acres and a poor law valuation of a couple of shillings an acre, very little. That is one of the things we must keep in mind.  I take it that some Senators will tell us what is wrong with my argument, and I suggest that it is something to argue about.  The system enshrined in this Bill is a device by which a certain proportion of the local charges are transferred from the agricultural community to the general taxpayer.  There can be no doubt about that.  The £3,175,000 provided for the relief of rates on agricultural land last year came out of general taxation, and was used by the State via the local authorities to reduce the charges which local authorities were levying on the occupiers of agricultural land.  The amount of relief calculated according to the principles set out in this Bill comes from the general taxpayer. I do not know whether Senator Baxter and Senator Hawkins see any virtue in transferring more and more of the local charges from the ratepayer to the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a discussion on this matter in this House about three years ago, and I remember making the point in relation to the Mental Treatment Bill. I may be wrong, but as far as my recollection serves me, I made the suggestion that it was unwise to keep pressing that more and more of the charges in respect of local administration be transferred from the ratepayer to the taxpayer.  I qualified it by pointing out that the taxing system for local authority purposes was unfair and inequitable.  But in the meantime I pointed out&mdash;and repeat now&mdash;if you are going to transfer charges, more and more of the cost of roads, more and more of the cost of hospitals, more and more of the cost of nurses, doctors, engineers and veterinary surgeons, or anything else from the ratepayer to the taxpayer, you will let the man who is comparatively well off get away with less and less rates, while you are imposing the cost of administration on the poor people who consume tea, <Col N="376" /> sugar, clothing or any of the other things that are taxed.  On that occasion Dr. Ward, who was then Parliamentary Secretary, entirely agreed with me and said that he had thought of it before I had.</P>
    <P>We need not quarrel with that, however, but we do need to keep in mind that if we are going to take £3,000,000 off the local rates, we are imposing that sum as a charge somewhere else.  Where are we going to get it?  From the taxation we levy on cigarettes, shoes and so on.  If that is the remedy, all right, but let us recognise it and not fool the small farmer or the big farmer that we are giving him something for nothing, a relief of the rates, a grant from the Government, and tell him that the Government have presumably got the money from heaven, so that they need not tax anybody.  The people who are giving these allowances do not tell the farmer that, while he is getting relief as a ratepayer, he is paying more as a taxpayer in order to relieve himself. The small farmer pays more indirect taxation because the unfortunate man has to buy more consumable goods. He will use more consumable goods than the wealthy farmer because he has little choice except to use consumable goods that bear taxation.</P>
    <P>When Senator Baxter and Senator Hawkins were talking, it occurred to me that certain charges were borne by the rates which should I think never have been charged on the rates at all, for example that substantial sum of £300,000 a year which is paid by the ratepayers to the Central Fund under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  I thought that was a most foolish enactment in 1933 when it was first brought in and I thought it was worse when it was raised from £250,000 to £300,000. It is one way of kidding the public. The public are not told how much the unemployment assistance is because it is paid partly by the ratepayers.  This relief of rates is only for one class, the occupiers of agricultural land, but there are something like 90,000 agricultural labourers paying rates in rural Ireland.  They are getting nothing of this relief but are paying more taxation on cigarettes and tobacco and <Col N="377" /> even on the despised pint&mdash;because farm labourers consume an occasional pint on a Saturday night.  They have to pay for these grants in relief of the rates to farmers, but what about blacksmiths, shoemakers and various tradesmen in the country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course he has no land, but he must pay rates on his house and if there are small rates on his house it is a measure of his poverty.  A shoemaker would live in a mansion if he could afford it, but he usually lives in a broken down shed because he cannot afford anything else.  If people in this House would only look at the facts in this country without bias in favour of their own interests we would have a more easy appreciation of what is involved here.  If we can have this matter discussed, as I hope we will, without any tinge of politics, now that the Republic of Ireland Bill has gone, we will probably find a new alignment by which people who are in favour of placing taxation where it can be borne will stand face to face with those who want to put taxation on the poor and weak in order to relieve those who are better off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That at least will be a very satisfactory development when it takes place, as I hope it will.  I do not want to be misinterpreted later on&mdash;whether it is germane to the Bill or not I do not know&mdash;but I want to say that I think the system of levying taxation for local authority purposes is an entirely wrong system.  It seems to me that much as we dislike the system by which we collect income-tax it is a far better system than the system of levying rates on poor law valuation, in other words collecting from those who can afford to pay rather than imposing taxation on people who cannot afford to pay.  I have seen people in the County of Dublin evicted from their homes because they could not pay the rates and then the Balrothery Board of Assistance, operating on moneys provided for them by the county council, maintains these families in the Dublin <Col N="378" /> Union.  It is a monstrous system, but so long as we keep, each of us, trying to get a slice for the fellow we are interested in and ignore the system, that will go on and these tragedies will occur.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think we could have had so many fallacies introduced as we have had in the short discussion that has taken place.  Senator O'Brien, for whom I have very great respect, based his argument primarily on statistics, but, as Senator Baxter forcibly pointed out, these statistics might be very misleading.  For instance, he compared the 1938 figure of 5.6 per cent. of the agricultural income with the percentage of 3.2 in 1947, but that does not at all mean that the farmer was better off in 1947 than in 1938.  As has been said, you can prove anything by statistics, and Senator O'Brien's statistics in that respect would be very misleading.  For instance, the 1947 <Col N="379" /> statistics represented the inflated prices of the war period, while the 1938 statistics relate to the very small prices the farmer got pre-war.  The House will readily understand it if I compare the man who purchased goods at £2 and sold at £3 with the man who, ten years after, purchases goods at £9 and sells at £11.  The margin of profit of the first man might be much greater than that of the second.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>But the percentage does not alter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>It does.  The agricultural income is represented by very many Senators, and I think that Senator O'Brien fell into the trap himself, as the price which can be computed as the price which the agriculturist gets for his goods.  That is generally what is assumed to be the agricultural income, but it is an altogether fallacious argument. I was more impressed by the other suggestion which Senator O'Brien made when he asked for a system of costings before we relate anything in regard to agriculture.  In the other House, I pressed for that for the past 20 years and we have not got it yet.</P>
      <P>Senator Duffy made a much more fallacious statement.  Senator O'Brien was only fallacious because his was a misrepresentation in reality, although accurate in figures.  Senator Duffy's statement was altogether misleading because he said that the small farmer got practically no relief while the large farmer got tremendous relief.  As a matter of fact, what happens under the Act is the very opposite.  The small farmer gets everything and the large farmer nothing, or a very small amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator has not studied the Act at all and has not taken any particular care to find out what happens.  What happens is that the primary relief of the small farmer is three-fifths of the first £20, and, to the ordinary small farmer, the first £20 means practically all and, in some cases, all his rate. The first £20 of the large farmer's rate might be anything.  He might be a man <Col N="380" /> with a 1,000, 500 or 200 acres and his proportion of relief is much less than the small farmer's.  That is the danger of Senators stepping in and talking about something they do not understand.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked for our indulgence in this matter and I was prepared to give him every indulgence because I think another occasion would be more appropriate for discussing this matter.  Any Senator who desired to go properly into this matter would need to deal with it for threequarters of an hour or an hour and I do not intend to take up the time of the House to that extent.  The history of rate relief&mdash;I am older than most Senators here, but there are some Senators who ought to remember it&mdash;is that the landlord ceased to exist and he, before 1898, was paying a certain portion of the county rates&mdash;what was called the county cess.  He was relieved of that and the British Government stepped in by way of an agricultural grant and paid to the local rates what the landlord had hitherto paid.  That was what instituted all this matter of agricultural rates relief.  What was a fair proportion of the agricultural rate to give by way of agricultural grant in 1898, as every Senator, including Senator O'Brien and Senator Duffy, will agree, would not be at all a fair proportion in 1948, 50 years after.  I merely want to draw the Senator's attention to where the argument could begin and end.  Since the British first instituted the principle of giving back to the farmer what the landlord hitherto paid, one hundred and one changes have taken place.</P>
    <P>There were one or two matters that I had intended to speak on before the scope of the discussion became enlarged. May I say that when I was a member of the other House I always made it a point to object, root and branch, to the manner in which this grant is administered. I have always held that its distribution is altogether inequitable. Senator Duffy said that the relief given to the small farmer is much less than that given to the large farmer. As a matter of fact, it was the other way round.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="381" /> The large farmer gets practically no relief on the amount of rates he pays. Senator Duffy also made the point that income-tax would probably be a fairer way of getting money out of a person than through the payment of rates.  I would ask the Senator to remember that the large farmer does pay income-tax, if he has an income.  I happen to be one of those who is in that unfortunate category.  The Senator can relieve himself of the thought that the large farmer does not pay income-tax. I can assure him that he has that additional burden to bear.  Senator Duffy seems to think that nobody but himself has any interest in the small farmer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I said nothing which would create that impression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>One would think, listening to the Senator, that we had no consideration for anybody except the large farmer.  I have a good deal more sympathy for the small farmer than I have for the large farmer, and I hope that some day in this House we shall have an opportunity of discussing this question fully, and that it will be possible for us to make our case in a more general way than it is now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two points which I would ask the Minister to take a note of: in the first place, I object to the manner in which the distribution of the grant is made because, in my opinion, it is not on an equitable basis.  It is altogether erroneous, so far as this country is concerned, to have the distribution on a valuation basis.  We all know that Griffith's valuation was made over 100 years ago.  The valuations in the County Limerick are very high, while in the County Mayo and other counties they are very low.  The same is true of certain counties.  In one part of a county you may find a farmer with 20 acres having a very high valuation, while in another part of it a man with 20 acres may have no valuation at all. I could give many instances of that, even in my own county, without making any comparison at all between <Col N="382" /> it and a county like Meath.  The principle of allocating this relief on a valuation basis is wrong.</P>
    <P>My other point is with regard to the employment allowance.  In the dairying district, comprising my own county, with the County Tipperary and parts of the County Cork, the milkers employed are, to a large extent, women.  For 20 years in the other House I spoke strongly in favour of having this employment relief extended to include women workers.  I see no reason in equity why that should not be done.  The Revenue Commissioners at one time tried to ram it down my throat&mdash;they afterwards had to retract the suggestion&mdash;that there was a differentiation in the wages paid to women workers and men.  There is not.  The women in my county who are employed milking cows get the same wages as the men, and in some cases they get more.  No case whatever can be made for this differentiation. It is very unfair to the farmers in the dairying area that I speak of who are endeavouring to carry on that important branch of the agricultural industry, a branch that, at the moment, is probably paying less than any other in the industry.  I hope that we shall have an opportunity of discussing this whole matter at some early date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Captain Orpen Captain Orpen">
      <NameTxt>Captain Orpen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points that I would like to deal with on the very big subject which this Bill opens up for discussion.  I should like to point out to Senators who may not have devoted much attention to this subject that what bears heaviest on most farmers, so far as rates on land are concerned, is that the rate is a first charge on gross income. It has to be paid, whether any profits are made or not.  If we could have arrived at an alternative method whereby the necessary funds were collected out of profits, it would be much more satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite in agreement with Senator Hawkins in regard to the anomaly that arises in respect of reliefs for male employment. If a male worker does not <Col N="383" /> appear on the return for the whole year, there is no allowance paid.  Very often it happens that it is not the employer who has got rid of the employee.  It is that the employee has gone off and sought work elsewhere.  The result is that there is no abatement by way of relief of rates in respect of that employment. I would like to say to Senator O'Brien that I do not think the derating commission really understood the chief objection on the part of farmers to the burden of paying rates.  It is not so much a question of the amount as the fact that they have to find this money, whether it is earned or not.  That is the real kernel of the farmer's difficulty.  Some years he is able to do so; in other years he is not. There is one point that I would like to get clear from the Minister's statement. If there were no allowances under this Bill the total rates would amount to approximately £7,000,000. The allowances come to about £3,000,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">

      <NameTxt>Captain Orpen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Captain Orpen Captain Orpen">
      <NameTxt>Captain Orpen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>50 per cent. relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Captain Orpen Captain Orpen">
      <NameTxt>Captain Orpen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that to say 50 per cent. relief is the correct way of looking at it at all.  The rate paid is a certain complicated fraction of the poor law valuation of the land. We will not go into details.  It is a complicated method which reduces the proportion the small man pays and leaves the larger man less affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not mean that the farming community should have paid £7,000,000 rates.  These abatements have been <Col N="384" /> existing&mdash;going back to 1926, I think&mdash; when the first one came in, because it was felt that the method of collecting rates in this manner was not altogether equitable; and so a system has grown up of relief.  That is the way I look at it.  Regarding the £7,000,000 that it would have been to-day had there been no relief, the corresponding figure to this £7,000,000 was never collected. The total amount was never collected. There has been a varying system of relief.  The question remains whether, with the great increase of the rate, some further relief may become necessary. That is a matter that could be debated at some other time.  We have this anomaly of broken employment, and if the Minister could devise a system by which rates could be collected rather from profits than from gross receipts, it would be an enormous step in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODwyer" hpid="Mr. O'Dwyer Mr. O'Dwyer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the two previous speakers.  On the question of relief for employment, I would like to point out that the dairying counties have a particular grievance.  It has been the custom always that men were employed for a period of 11 months and they remained idle during the other month and drew unemployment assistance, but the farmer is not allowed for that system now because under the regulations he would have to have them employed for 12 months to get relief.  It would be very desirable if a change could be made.  The dairying industry is a very important one at the present time and it is hard to keep it going.  Also, women employees should be included in the allowance. It would be much better if the relief were given on the total amount of wages paid, instead of on the period of employment.  It would be worth considering, in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding increasing the rates, whether the general cost of poor law should be borne by the urban or rural population, I would say the Minister is in a position to judge that.  I understand he has been around to several county council districts and will have seen the general condition of the country&mdash;the tumble-down houses, the <Col N="385" /> derelict sites and the general air of poverty.  Coming back to Dublin, he will be faced with a sea of unparalleled luxury and extravagance.  The wealth of the country seems to be in the cities.  The salaried classes may not be well off, but some class is, in some way, able to provide motor cars and picture houses.</P>

      <P>There may be, but whatever wealth is distributed is in the cities, and the country is not able to carry the burden.  The past year has been the best for the past ten years, but we know that in agriculture, more than in any other industry, the price of the produce has always been very low. The income from farming has been low in this and every other country.  We know from experience that the wartime boom does not last very long and may not be expected to last, but the expenses and charges, causing increases in the rates, will probably remain in great part.  I ask the Minister to take seriously that there is a point beyond which the rates cannot rise in proportion to the income of the country.  He should be careful not to exceed that point, as, if so, the country could not carry it and it will mean a break.  If the present rates had been in existence three years ago it would have been impossible to meet them. The good year has, to some extent, enabled them to meet the higher rate. The tendency seems to be, now and for some time back, to throw a lot of additional charges on the county rates.  The general cost of living will increase it also.  That cannot go beyond a certain point and the Minister must bear in mind that the country cannot bear a great increase in rates.  This House and the other House should realise that before great harm is done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Many very useful suggestions, I believe, have been put forward this evening but there is one point which seems to have been overlooked by a good many speakers.  It is that when we speak of reducing the <Col N="386" /> rates payable by the rural or agricultural community, many people seem to assume that that must necessarily impose a heavier burden of rates on the whole urban community.  In other words, people are inclined to refer to the whole urban community as one unit as if they were all the same type of people.  It is extremely important that we should distinguish between the wealthier sections of the urban community and the poorer sections.  As Senator Duffy pointed out, there are very poor people who have not agricultural land and who pay a large amount of rates in proportion to their small incomes.  Take a family with £3 or £3 10s. 0d. a week in a rural area or a small town.  At the present day, that family have to pay very often more than £5 a year or 2/- a week in rates, which is a lot for a family with a small income.  Then there are very wealthy people in the urban area who should pay more, and in that way money could be made available to relieve both the poorer farmers and the poorer urban householders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I entirely agree with Senator Duffy's suggestion that it would be desirable if a scheme could be worked whereby local taxation could be paid according to a person's income.  There are at present some people with big incomes who get away with paying very little rates.  There is the case of a wealthy man who may not have any agricultural land, who may not have any big business premises or shop.  He may be a professional man, and only have a small private house.  There is also the case of a wealthy man living in a hotel. He may own no land or business premises, and his wealth may consist of investments in the form of stocks and shares.  He may be a retired man with no business.  These people with big incomes may pay very little in rates.  They should pay more, and thus money could be found to help the poorer farmers and urban dwellers with small incomes.  When we consider gross agricultural income, as Senator Professor O'Brien did, the total sounds large, but some people forget there are many small and medium-sized farmers who still, in spite of the increased <Col N="387" /> prices of recent years, have very small net incomes.</P>
    <P>The recent publication by the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland on that subject is very helpful.  I believe that more costings of this nature should be made.  In this paper, by Mr. R. O'Connor, read before the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland, in October, 1948, with regard to the costings on a number of farms in Roscommon, it was pointed out that in nine out of 20 farms, the total family income, per family unit, was less than that of the agricultural labourer with the Agricultural Wages Board's standard wage, which, I think, everyone will agree is very low.  I am glad it is to be increased soon.  In spite of that, there were nine out of 20 farms where the farmer had less than the agricultural labourer in income.  These farmers certainly deserve a reduction in rates.</P>
    <P>In the same paper it was shown that the proportion of expenditure on a group of small farms on rent and rates was 21.6 per cent. of their total expenditure.  That shows that rates are an important item for many small farmers.  Very careful consideration should be given to all these points in future, because the present rating system is undoubtedly very unfair.  It will take the Minister a considerable time to have this done, but I believe it will be well worth while, because at present many people with very small incomes pay a comparatively large amount in rates, while others with very large incomes pay very little.  The sooner that system is rectified the better for the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to know that it is the intention of the Minister to continue the good work of his predecessor. In the years 1946-7, 1947-8 and 1948-9 there has been a considerable increase in the grant for the relief of rates on agricultural land, and I believe that the grant should be even bigger next year because the charges in the case of any farmer will be <Col N="388" /> much higher next year because the working man is getting what he is rightly entitled to, a higher wage, and his overheads increase more and more rapidly every day.  In addition to that, practically all local authorities will be confronted this year with the problem of increased rates.  For that reason the Minister will be faced with the problem of providing a much larger grant for 1949-50 than for 1948-49.  Therefore, I would like to compliment the Minister on continuing the good work of his predecessor and would advise him to keep an eye on the future because the people will expect the grant to continue increasing so long as overheads increase.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the Minister should get the Department or the Government to notify local authorities earlier in the year as to what the grant will be.  The notification is rather late at times, and work of most local authorities is held up.  That applies, not only to the grant for relief of rates on agricultural land but also to the grant from the Road Fund.  Very often, local authorities have to adjourn the striking of a rate because of the failure of the Government or the Department to let local authorities know the amount they will receive. These difficulties could be eliminated so that the local authority would be able to strike the rate, and so obviate the necessity for rushed estimates, and estimates not getting the consideration they should get.  Very often, the fault may lie with the Department, not with the officials of the Department, who are very helpful and excellent gentlemen in their jobs.  They must take directions from the Government.  The Government should let the officials know their intentions and the Government must make up its mind as to what the amount will be.  It is most unfair to local authorities that they should not know the amount of the grant</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time has come when urban authorities should get some relief also by way of relief on agricultural land within urban areas.  They have got no relief, as far as I am aware, although there is a sum of £10,000 or £11,000 in the way of relief in this Bill which I <Col N="389" /> never heard of before.  I think very few urban authorities get it.  There are many urban districts in which there is a fair amount of land in respect of which the people have to pay 30/- in the £, which is very heavy, whereas in rural areas the people may not be paying 10/-.  If I am right, the Cork County Council passed a resolution requesting the State to provide relief for agricultural land in the urban areas and I personally make a plea that the Minister should make representations to the Minister for Finance in the matter of the urban community, whose lot is not a very pleasant one, because of the higher rates in most urban areas.  They need some relief.  I am certain that the farmer expects the things I have mentioned because, to a certain extent, there is a wave of unrest not alone amongst farmers but amongst workers.  There is a certain fear of instability because they cannot get prices for certain things they have to offer.  They cannot get a price except at the whim of the purchaser for certain things that I do not want to mention.  They are supposed to be able to get a certain price, but the world knows they cannot get it.  For that reason, the farmer's lot is not a very rosy one.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter reminded us here that the previous Government put this and that on to the local authority.  That happens with all Governments.  Even the present Government has continued that system, putting the sum of £150,000 in respect of food vouchers on the local authorities and probably another £150,000 to try to provide employment because of the cessation of turf production.  It is quite obvious that all Governments will continue to put what they can on the local authorities.  It is not that the previous Government have done the things that Senator Baxter mentioned but the present Government have done them.  I do not wish to say any more except again to advise the Minister to continue the good work of his predecessor. I think he can make up his mind, however, that the allowances for the relief of rates on agricultural land will be a lot greater in 1949-50 than they were in 1948-49.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to keep as far as possible immediately within the scope the Minister has envisaged in bringing in this Bill, and the first thing is unemployment allowances.  I believe that Senator Hawkins has mentioned this earlier in the debate, and I would like to ask the Minister to bring in an amendment to deal with this matter.  What often happens in this country is that a man leaves agricultural employment, and the farmer must employ a man immediately if he is to receive any of that grant.  It often happens in the winter time that if a farmer cannot get a man immediately he will not employ any man for two or three months.  I think if it were possible for the Minister to cover that point farmers would keep men continuously in employment.  If a period of, say, four weeks were allowed between the cessation of one man's employment and the employment of another man it would be to the advantage of the employment position, and the State should consider his position in a matter over which he has no control himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker said that there was a need for relief of rates on agricultural land within the urban districts and the percentage of the rates levied on agricultural land in urban districts is not fair.  I have heard of cases where people pay rates on agricultural land in urban areas which are far greater than the old rack rents charged by the landlords.  I know of cases where the rates were as much as £3 per statute acre and, in my opinion, that is an exorbitant charge to make on any citizen of this State.  Many Senators have made the case of the towns against the country, but one thing we should bear in mind is that a farmer may have his land flooded.  I have seen land which, as a result of floods, was so covered with stones and shingle that it may be years before it can produce any crops, grass or otherwise, and there is no system whereby a farmer can get any relief.  If a man's house in town is put out of occupation, either a business premises or a residence, he will not have to pay rates for the period he was not in occupation.  I think that should be borne in mind in considering <Col N="391" /> the farmer's position.  Further, farming is a very hazardous occupation and anything that this Government or any Government we will ever have in this country can do to encourage people to go back on the land is all to the good.  When too many people are working on the land and living on the land it will be time enough to consider what we will have to do to get the people to go back into the towns.</P>

      <P>It is very pleasant to listen to the debate in this House but unfortunately I happened to read the <i>Herald</i> and see that an increase has been given in university scholarships and unfortunately it is by my own council.  Everything in the garden is lovely and Senator Professor O'Brien is quite correct in his statistics, but we have no statistics as to what is the tendency in Irish life.  You can see it and everyone feels it, this prejudice against life in rural Ireland, this tendency to leave it.  If we are sincere, we must look at things nationally and looking at things nationally, regarding all this talk about Northern Ireland I say that the strength of the Government of Northern Ireland is the fact that the farmers have no rates to pay. The authority behind Basil Brooke is the strength of the farmers of Northern Ireland and before we talk about getting rid of the Border we should have a levelling up ourselves and then our people of the North will come in enthusiastically.  The tendency here is peculiar and it is very loose.  We can get grants from Dublin.  In fact it is almost a case of asking for a grant and you will get it and then it is a case of putting up the rates.  It is worse since the County Management Act came in because the finances of the council are not placed before us every fortnight or every month and the further from the rating period we are the less we worry about it.  As long as it is June, July, September or October, we will vote for any popular measure and say that it can be paid for out of the rates next year but when we see the rates have gone up by leaps and bounds we become super-economists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" /> What does the implementation of the collection of these various sums amount to?  In my council the wages are £50 but what would it cost to put the Minister's scheme into operation and pay all the clerks that are required?  What is the benefit to me of this £6 10s. 0d.? My wages are pretty tough and I had a clerk in examining it a year ago.  He looked into it and said it would be 2/-a week but then another clerk came and looked into it and said it would be 3/3 a week.  It is an unhealthy sign when every Department that wishes to look for extra money such as this thing comes down to the rates, but there is no Minister to see that the rates are limited, to protect the farmers or to protect agriculture.  Deputy Dillon, Deputy Ryan and Deputy Smith had as much to do to protect the farmers in their schemes and their implementation in the Department as I have in the council.  The statesman I most greatly admire after Arthur Griffith, Kevin O'Higgins, said in 1926 that we would have to try to keep a decent rate and that there was not sufficient money among the farmers to leave them a prey to every service.  That statement is backed up by Irishmen like Senator O'Brien and by the statisticians.  Salve your own consciences and see how Ireland is going.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Government and the Fianna Fáil Government divided up estates but are those estates giving more employment and are the people on them happy?  Perhaps they are happy on some of them but I know some that are giving less employment now and the tendency is to reduce employment where you can.  If a person feels that he is not equal to the rates he will dismiss a man.  Surely there could be some system of Government where 50, 60 or 100 acres of Irish land should be competent to rear a family without relief of rates.  It is the finest position in the world to have 50 or 100 acres of Irish land and surely there could be a system that would make its owner an independent man who could hold up his head with all the millionaires in Grafton Street. Everybody else makes money as far as I can see, but the farmer at home dies as rich as his father and he is damned <Col N="393" /> lucky if he does.  I have no prejudice in this matter one way or another but looked at broadly this is a big question, a question which affects the foundation of our whole system of Government. You are not going to increase employment by having a successful Custom House which escaped being blown up in the days when it might have been.  I want to ask Senator Fitzsimons, as chairman of his county council, if he has the slightest idea what the increase in the staff of that institution is since the county manager came in, or if there is any increase.</P>

The Minister has a difficult task, but we are experiencing healthier times.  I am a great believer in inter-Party government, and you have five or six different viewpoints in this Government, and one man will have to bend the knee eventually, provided the economists exert themselves. The rates are going up this year at a frightening rate.  Rapid progress is being made, and where the Minister for Finance comes in, I do not know.</P>

      <P>When I rather mildly expressed the hope, at the opening of this debate, that it would not range <Col N="394" /> over a very wide and very vexed variety of topics, I felt that the hope of success was faint, and unfortunately the hope was not realised, even in the slightest degree.  I do not complain of that.  I think it inevitable that that should happen because this whole question of local taxation is, as I said in the other House, a highly controversial and vexed question, and perhaps, in all the circumstances, I am fortunate that the debate did not take even a wider scope.</P>
      <P>What I would like to emphasise is the temporary nature of this measure, the fact that it extends an Act passed some time ago and that because it is purely an extending Act, it is not possible to amend it, and neither is it possible to review whatever defects, if any, exist in the matter of the employment allowances to which Senator Hawkins and other Senators referred. Because it is always a live issue, and the agriculturists and even the urban dwellers will never be short of champions to put forward their claims and their interests in this very vital matter of local taxation, there will, unquestionably, be many opportunities for having, on a wider field, a review of this question.  I must not be tempted, therefore, to-night, to express any views that I have on the question, or to pronounce, except in a very limited way, on the views expressed to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, of course, is not the last rating Bill and neither could it, by any stretch of the imagination, be considered to be the last occasion on which this subject can be discussed, any more than it is the last generation of Irishmen.  I feel that during the year a further examination of this matter in a wider way will be afforded on motions on the Dáil Order Paper at present, and I am sure that opportunities will arise in this House for fuller consideration of the whole matter.  I can, therefore, only reply briefly and not in any very full way to some of the points raised.  Obviously, I could not even for a moment contemplate discussing the question of derating.  It is a very much bigger question than that which I am asking <Col N="395" /> the House to deal with and it is a question in which other Ministers would have a very definite interest and one on which I could not possibly commit myself, whatever personal views I have on it.</P>
    <P>I want to say, however, that, personally, I am not in favour of the viewpoint which has been expressed occasionally in the past, with increasing strength now and then, in favour of what is termed the nationalisation of services which are now in the hands of the local authority.  I intend to make only a passing reference to this matter. I feel that a result of that kind would not be good for the local authority.  I want to feel and to hope&mdash;perhaps it is a peculiar reason&mdash;that the local authorities will, in the future as in the past, provide the training ground for public representatives to take their part and their place in the discussion of matters which appertain to higher national politics, and the more you take away from local authorities the more restricted are the opportunities of that kind.  That is the only view I propose to express on the matter this evening.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter asked me, in the course of the discussion, if I could give the figures of the assessment on agricultural land before the deduction of the agricultural grant.  They are: in 1946-47, £5.3 millions; in 1947-48, £5.9 millions; and in 1948-49, £7 millions. There is at least one important recommendation in favour of this measure which I may claim.  It is that, while it is true that there has been a progressive increase in local rates, this Bill does provide that to some extent in any case, that increase will be offset by a progressive increase in the amounts of the reliefs given, and I point, therefore, to what I am sure is already within the knowledge of Senators, the elasticity of this measure and the fact that, in that particular matter at least, it can be recommended.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Senator Bennett will understand that it is not possible to discuss this matter of the employment allowances for female worker to-night, <Col N="396" /> or to offer, within the scope of this measure, any prospect of relief in that respect.  It is a fact that the £599,000 originally voted towards the relief of rates was intended to give relief up to the extent of 50 per cent., and it is a rather remarkable fact that at the present time that proportion seems to be maintained, because the relief which will be afforded in the coming year will be £3,600,000 out of a total rate estimate on agricultural land of about £7,000,000.  I must, therefore, ask for the consideration of Senators for a dispensation in the matter of a discussion on the future basis of local taxation. I realise that it is a very important matter, and is one that must in the ordinary way come up for review very frequently in the future.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer finally to the point which Senator Fitzsimons made of informing local authorities as to the amount of the agricultural grant.  In fact, the position is that local authorities should, under this Bill, be able to calculate themselves what they will get from the grant.  On the Senator's second point it is a fact that in 1948 a larger proportion of the grant was paid in the first part of the year than formerly, and it is hoped to continue that practice.  I am glad to be able to give that much information to the Senator.  As regards most of the other matters that were raised on behalf of urban dwellers and on the whole question of rates, I must say that I am not free or fully competent or even authorised in any way to discuss them this evening.  I must therefore ask to be excused from participating in such a discussion at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>On that question, I want again to direct the Minister's attention to the question of employees leaving their employment in a particular period of year.  I do not think the Minister dealt with it in his reply. It is quite true, of course, that on a Bill of this kind one can travel over a very wide field.  It gives an opportunity for making various suggestions. Senator McGee had a very serious complaint to make this evening.  He said that during his absence attending to his Parliamentary duties the Louth County Council had committed the terrible crime of increasing the value of their university scholarships.  I want to point out that that is a matter for the county council and not for the manager.  The manager cannot be blamed for it.  I understand that there is a proposal under consideration to amend the County Management Act. I would advise the Minister to go very slow in that direction.  The members of a county council are the people who control the county purse, and if the rates have gone up that, surely, is not the fault of the manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to bear this in mind&mdash;it is a tendency that we have noticed in every Government we have had here, but it has been more pronounced in the last ten months than during any previous period&mdash;that the cost of quite a number of services is now being transferred to the local authorities, thereby placing on them the obligation of meeting very heavy charges indeed.  Senator Fitzsimons referred to some of them.  There was first the food voucher scheme.  Later, the obligation was placed on local authorities of providing employment for those people who lost their employment through the cessation of the turf schemes.  The Minister for Finance, in his Budget this year, placed another unnecessary burden on the local authorities.  In that connection, may I say that I was surprised to hear <Col N="398" /> Senator Duffy this evening, on the repeal of the External Relations Act, seriously object to the powers which, he said, the Bank of England exercises over this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Why the Senator did not object to the Minister for Finance putting a very serious burden on the ratepayers, as he did when he increased the rate of interest on loans to local authorities to carry out the works assigned to them, I could not understand. If we are going to increase the social services by passing on to the ratepayers the obligation of providing the greater part of the money required to finance them, then, no matter what Government is in power, it surely cannot claim the credit for whatever benefit may be derived from the operation of those social services.</P>
      <P>The Minister himself is not entirely free from guilt in this matter.  He has already passed on some charges to the local authorities.  We will have another Bill before us to-morrow, the implementation of which will place additional burdens on the local people.  I do not want to anticipate the discussion on that Bill now.  I can say, however, that the tendency I speak of is to be noticed in practically every Bill that has come before us in recent months&mdash; the tendency to compel the local authority to bear, if not all the cost of the expenditure involved, at least a great part of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local rates in Galway are the highest in the whole country, 35/- or 36/- in the £.  I have been accused of speaking here in the interests of the farmers, but I speak, too, in the interests of urban dwellers and workers in Galway City.  What is the position of local authorities going to be if additional burdens are placed on them?  I have already pointed out that they are now obliged to pay increased interest rates on the loans they require to carry out essential services.  I say that should not be done.  The Government should take into consideration the very serious burden which these increased <Col N="399" /> rates represent not only on farmers, big or small, but on the workers and people generally throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I did not make it perfectly clear to the Senator and his colleagues that I am definitely precluded within the scope of this measure from examining into the question of the employment allowance.  The 1946 Act says that &ldquo;where an adult workman, or each of two or more adult workmen, was during the whole of the qualifying period for a financial year to which the Act applies, at work on agricultural land in the rated area of the council of a county,&rdquo; then the reliefs enumerated come into effect. This Bill merely extends the 1946 Act so that the matter referred to by the Senator will have to wait whatever examination may be given to it during the year.  I express no opinion on the matter now, but I promise that it will be looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the consideration I have got from the Seanad, I do not think I should engage in any general discussion on the other matters Senator Hawkins has raised.  I entirely dispute <Col N="400" /> the conclusions he has come to and I think his statements are to some extent devoid of foundation.  He has suggested that all the burdens in respect of social services have been heavily accentuated during the year. Apparently, he is entirely unaware, or prefers to omit, one important concession that local ratepayers will get in a very short time, that is, total relief from the allowances that they have to pay up to now to old age pensioners. The operation of the Health Act will provide certain other reliefs.  If this is a bad practice, it is one of very long standing.  Most of the calls for the social services on local authorities have been of some years' standing.  I do not want to say anything on that question. It is inevitable, in the trend in recent years, that that should have happened.
