    <Title>Road Fund (Advances) Bill, 1948    (Certified Money Bill)  &mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">

      <P>This legislation is to amend earlier legislation of the year 1926.  Under Section 1, sub-section (2) of the Road Fund (Advances) Act, 1926, there was a limit put to the amount of money that might be advanced to the Road Fund.  Under the section, the ceiling was £2,000,000.  It is proposed now to raise that ceiling to £5,000,000. Actually, the position was that under the Act of 1926 the £2,000,000, with the exception of somewhere in the neighbourhood of £210,000, was all from time to time required, and has all been repaid. Under the old Act there would be a further possible advance of £210,000. Road works this year will be very heavy.  It is proposed, therefore, to put the new limit at £5,000,000.  That will enable £3,210,000 of a further advance to be made.  That is the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the Bill, its purpose is to enable the Minister to mortgage the Road Fund and to raise the limit from £2,000,000 to £5,000,000.  That will enable the sum of £3,210,000 to be made available at the present time.  In connection with the Act of 1926, it is well to remember that the Road Fund was established for the specific purpose of seeing that the moneys derived from motor taxation would be made available for the development of our roads.  Under that Act the Minister was empowered to borrow on the strength of the Road Fund, a sum of in or about £2,000,000. As the Minister has pointed out, the sum so borrowed was £1,790,000, and all that has been repaid.  When we <Col N="632" /> examine the situation we find that in the period 1926 to 1931 a scheme was in operation of mortgaging the Road Fund and expending the money so obtained on road repair and reconstruction, and that from 1932 onwards a very delicate position arose as to the financing of our road development.  We are now about to undertake the former type of borrowing.  As a result of the emergency, our main and trunk roads are in a very bad state, and also our village and by-roads.  That is because they had to serve the nation as a whole when our railway system had almost ceased to exist.  During that period our people had to depend on road transport for food supplies and other necessaries of life.</P>
      <P>I think that the nation, as a whole, owes it to the people to repair the damage that was done to the roads during that period.  Provision in that respect had been made by the outgoing Government.  They had sent a request to the various county councils&mdash;the road authorities&mdash;to set about, immediately, the repair of damage that had been done to the roads during the emergency.  In addition, they directed the local authorities to draw up a scheme of national road works for the improvement of our highways in general.  It was suggested by them that the moneys that would be made available for that purpose would come from the Central Fund and not from the Road Fund.  As I have stated, the Road Fund is made up of the moneys derived by way of revenue from motor taxation.  The people who contribute those revenues certainly feel that the money which they subscribe should be devoted to the improvement of the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal in this Bill is that, in the future, the Road Fund should be mortgaged to the extent of £5,000,000. The figure does not really amount to that.  The real figure is in or about £3,210,000.  The people who contribute by way of taxation to the Road Fund feel that an injustice is being done to them in that their money is going to be devoted to the repair to damage that was done to the roads during the emergency when they were put at the service of the people as a whole instead of to the rebuilding and to the making <Col N="633" /> of new roads suitable to their mode of transport.  Much, of course, might be said for and against that.  It is most unfair, however, that we should mortgage the future of the fund in this way, and that we should go back on some proposal or guarantee that was given to our road authorities by the outgoing Government.</P>
    <P>There are members of this House who are members of county councils.  They are aware that the county councils were asked by the outgoing Government to have estimates prepared for road repairs, and to employ engineers whose duty it would be to prepare large scale general plans for road development.  The moneys so required were to be supplied from the Central Fund.  I understand that the amount that would be required to meet expenditure this year and to assist local authorities to meet the demands that would be made on them would be in or about £1,500,000.  That sum of money is not now going to be met out of the Central Fund but rather by mortgaging the Road Fund. Some years ago a fund called the Transition Development Fund was established.  A case might be made for taking moneys for the repair of our roads out of that particular fund rather than from the Road Fund.  If we are going to develop the roadways of this country, and I am sure the Minister holds we should because if I remember rightly he suggested in this House and in the other House that road transport was the cheapest and most effective&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That was the promise or the suggestion made by the Minister and his colleagues.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope on the Committee Stage to be able to produce the exact words the Minister used on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently my words do not matter.  It is your interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know where we are going to get or if we are to accept that position.  This is not the proper way to meet the demands to repair the damage done during the emergency and prepare our national roadways for the future.  In place of mortgaging the Road Fund, the sum necessary should be made available from the Transition Fund.  The Minister may say that that fund expires on the 31st March next.  I am sure Senators will agree that the upkeep, repair and provision of roads is a very serious burden on the rate-payers of each county.  The time has arrived to examine this from another <Col N="635" /> aspect, since no longer is the wear and tear confined to the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Senator remember when we used to make that case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely Senator Baxter does not object that, because he suggested something sometime, long ago, in his dreams of youth, he is displeased when other people come to recognise that there may be something in it?  The same applies to the Minister.  It seems that the more we come together the more we can agree.  We in Galway have a large burden for road maintenance. It is a tourist county and we have to bear the cost of the roads in Connemara, which are used by the tourists.  Tourists left £35,000,000 in this country last year, no matter how much we may dislike their coming amongst us.  Small counties are faced with the burden of building and maintaining roads, and it is time now to approach it from a new angle, instead of from the local angle.  Each county council last March budgeted for double the previous year's expenditure on roads, on an intimation from the then Government that they would be generously met&mdash;not by mortgaging the future of the Road Fund, but by a generous advance from the Government in appreciation of the services rendered by engineers and roadworkers during the emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator quote?  Has he a notice to that effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot do better than quote from the Taoiseach, who said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The decision of the last Government undoubtedly was that £2,250,000 should be advanced to the Road Fund.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the end of the quotation?  The Senator should not stop in the middle of a sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is from the Dáil Debates, column 1599, of the 28th July, 1948.  It continues:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;but it was not decided whether the sum should be obtained from the <Col N="636" /> Transition Development Fund or out of the moneys provided by Parliament.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is, it was not out of the moneys provided by the Road Fund.  The Taoiseach has admitted that the last Government's decision undoubtedly was that the £2,250,000 would be advanced to the Road Fund.  He did not say it was out of the moneys provided by mortgaging the future of the Road Fund.  The present Taoiseach admitted the case arrived at by the previous Government, who had intimated to the road authority that they were prepared to make available sufficient money to put the roads back into the state of repair they were in before the emergency, in appreciation of the services rendered over those roads during the emergency.  It was a reasonable proposition and in the best national interest that that policy should be carried out.</P>
    <P>This is a very small Bill, but it mear mortgaging the future of this Road Fund to the tune of £3,210,000 and curtailing the future development of our roadways.  We all, especially roads authorities, would like to know if the same employment grants and assistance will be given from the Central Fund to road authorities as were proposed to be made by the outgoing Government.  That requires a straight and simple answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>We all have great sympathy with Senator Hawkins in his endeavour to speak on this Bill.  This was created a vocational Chamber by those who occupied these benches in the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hawkins has forgotten the vocational character of the Seanad and has repeated in this House the speeches made by Deputies MacEntee and Allen in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>The first person to repudiate the vocational character of this House early in 1938 was the present Minister for Education.  It is on the records of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hawkins is in a difficulty.  I cannot imagine him <Col N="637" /> making that speech otherwise.  He is quite capable of understanding the Bill and discussing it intelligently. However, let me first draw attention to what the Bill does not contain.  I have here a cutting from the <i>Irish Press.</i> There happened to be two newspapers with two articles headed quite differently and I think they are likely to mislead members of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Do they deal with the present Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  They have misled Senator Hawkins.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> for July 29th, reporting the proceedings of Dáil Éireann on the Road Fund Advances Bill, 1948, heads the article: &ldquo;£3,000,000 Extra for Road Work.&rdquo;  The <i>Irish Press</i> of the same date heads the same report: &ldquo;£3,000,000 Raid on the Road Fund.&rdquo; Can we be surprised that Senator Hawkins was misled?  The <i>Irish Press</i> gives the report a heading which creates in the mind of the people the impression that the Road Fund has been raided of £3,000,000, whereas, in fact, the Bill proposes to advance that sum to the Road Fund.  In other words, the Road Fund will be able to advance to the roads authorities £3,000,000 more than it could have advanced if it were depending on the normal taxation revenue of the Road Fund.  Senator Hawkins has been misled by the <i>Irish Press</i> report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Hawkins was misled, Senator Duffy is befogged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there anything wrong or improper, or financially unsound, in advancing £3,000,000 to the Road Fund on condition that the Road Fund in better times would repay that loan? If Senator Hawkins were interested in buying a house and the bank advanced £1,000 to be repaid when he was better off&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would there be anything wrong if they did?  If the Senator appreciates what is in the Bill, I cannot understand his logic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Can Senator Duffy inform me of a bank that will lend me money on the condition that I will repay it when I am better off?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not what the Minister is doing here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is.  I hope the Senator will not persist in correcting me, as there is no doubt about what is happening.  The Minister is simply advancing a sum of £3,000,000 to the Road Fund so that local authorities can build better roads and put the present roads into better condition, on the understanding that, as time goes on and income flows into the Road Fund from taxation, the fund will repay to the Treasury the amount advanced.  That is what has happened, whether we like it or not.  Senator Hawkins's plea is that instead of advancing this money in the manner provided by the Bill, it should be advanced as a free gift from the Transition Development Fund.  That is the only question between us, as to whether or not the money should be repaid by the Road Fund.  Is it not better that the Road Fund should repay a lump sum of this kind&mdash; £3,000,000&mdash;than that the Road Fund should be raided by the Minister for Finance for Budgetary purposes? That is what was done, with all respect, for a great number of years during which the Fianna Fáil Administration was in charge of the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not being done now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Senator Hawkins will not persist in saying that what is being done is not in accordance with the facts in the Bill.  The Road Fund was raided in 1926-27 to the extent of £100,000.  It was raided on nine occasions deliberately by the Fianna Fáil Administration to the extent of £1,100,000, a sum which, if now in the Road Fund, would pay interest on a <Col N="639" /> capital advance of £27,000,000.  That is what happened.  The Road Fund was raided in the past and the money which motorists, according to Senator Hawkins, expected to see expended on roads was expended on the relief of taxation of other kinds.  It was grabbed up by the Exchequer, by one Minister for Finance after another, during the past 15 or 16 years.  Before Senator Hawkins and the <i>Irish Press</i> commence discussing raids on the Road Fund they ought to have regard to the fact that they have been raiding it year after year, until they took out of the fund £1,100,000 which should be there now for road construction, and to make up deficiencies of the war period.</P>
      <P>On that point I should like to draw attention to the fact that the <i>Irish Press</i> in giving a heading of that kind to the article to which I referred had no justification for such a heading, and seems to me to be creating a public mischief which, if done by some private citizen, would involve that person being brought before a court and charged with the criminal offence of creating public mischief.  I offer that advice to the Minister for Finance, so that he might consult the Attorney-General to see if this misleading heading and misleading article would come under that heading.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not stand for a lying Press.  What we are asked to do is to give our approval to a Bill which, when it becomes law, will enable the Minister for Finance to advance on loan £3,000,000 for the purpose of expending the maximum sum which local authorities can expend on road maintenance and road repair, and also, I take it, on road construction.  Let us bear in mind that when this sum is made available the Road Fund will advance in respect of main roads £9 for every £1 put up by local authorities.  Broadly speaking, it means 90 per cent. on main roads or 66 per cent. in respect of every £1 put up by local authorities in respect of county roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I am making.  Actually, what is being done is that a larger sum is being made available now for road maintenance and road repair and represents a contribution by the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>By the Exchequer to the Road Fund, to be repaid later on by the Road Fund and amounting to £9 in the case of main roads for every £1 put up by local authorities.  Senator Hawkins seems to me to have one complaint in relation to this Bill, that the advances which are to be made under the Bill must be repaid.  Is it not better and more honest to repay advances to the Road Fund than to allow the Treasury to seize the proceeds of the Road Fund and to divert them to other purposes?  That has been going on since 1926, when £100,000 was taken&mdash;pure robbery&mdash; without the knowledge or consent of the taxpayers.  As I pointed out, a total of £1,100,000 was taken out of the Road Fund by the last Government.  I suggest it is better to have the money in the Road Fund and to pay interest on the advances than to have it collared by the Exchequer for other purposes.</P>

      <P>Ceart go leor &mdash;admhaím sin; ach ó thárla go bhfuilimid ag cur síos ar airgead i gcóir na mbóithre, sé mo thuairim go mba cheart cuimhniú air seo: gur éagcóir a rinneadh mar gheall ar an rangú atá déanta ar na bóithre. I dtaobh na bpríomh-bhóithre, níl mórán locht le fáil agam ar an aire atáthar a thabhairt dóibh; tugtar aire réasúnta maith do na mór-bhóithre; ach na bóithre contae a theastaíonn ó an-chuid daoine, is náireach an bhail atá orthu.  An fhaid a bheas na bóithre contae ag fáil deontais ar an mbealach a bhfaigheann siad iad, is dóigh liom go leanfar leis an bhfaillí atá á dhéanamh faoi na bóithre seo.  Tá <Col N="642" /> scoltacha suite ann; tá séipéil suite ann; agus tá hallaí paróiste suite ann.  Is dóigh liom go mba cheart go bhfuigheadh na daoine a bhaineann feidhm as na bóithre sin serbhís a bheadh ar a laghad chomh maith leis an tseirbhís a gheibheas na daoine a úsáideann na mór-bhóithre. Níl mé ag rá go bhfuil aon bhaint ag an Aire le rangú na mbóithre; ach feicthear dhomsa gur ócáid oiriúnach é seo leis an gceist seo a phlé.  Tá éagcóir á dhéanamh ar na daoine mar gheall ar an bhfaillí atá á dhéanamh maidir leis an rangú sin.</P>
      <P>Iarraim ar an Aire féachaint le cabhair speisialta a thabhairt do na húdaráis áitiúla mar gheall ar an gcaitheamh speisialta a rinneadh ar na bóithre le linn na héigeandála.  Ní dóigh liom gur iarratas mí-réasúnach é sin.  Le linn na héigeandála bhí na bóithre ag dul in olcas.

Dúirt an Seanadóir Hawkins gur ar mhaithe leis an náisiún fré chéile a thárlaigh an damáiste sin toisc an gá a bhí ann móin agus beithigh d'iompair nuair nach raibh traenacha le fáil chun na ruda seo d'iompair.

    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. Ruane Mr. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know that as a result of the excessive motor traffic over many roads, extra expenditure is required for restoration work.  We also know that the traffic was entirely out of proportion to what the roads were originally intended to bear. Senator Hawkins believes that the people owe a debt of gratitude to those who maintained this transport during the emergency.  I would not like to detract from that, but I would like to point out that they were well paid for their services.  This work of repair must be paid for and there are several ways by which it could be paid for. The cost might be met out of the Central Fund, out of the Transition Development Fund, as Senator Hawkins suggested, or it could be made the responsibility of the rate-payers and met by way of direct levy on the rates.  I maintain that the cost of restoring the roads to their original condition and of improving them should be the responsibility of the Road Fund.  That fund was built up by a tax on mechanically propelled vehicles and in making that fund bear the cost it would be really saddling vehicles with the cost of the damage they have done.</P>
      <P>During the war years, some essential materials used in the repair of roads were in short supply.  Machinery replacements were difficult to obtain.  It is peculiar, however, that in some counties, at any rate, the cost of road maintenance was on the upward curve every year within that period.  If they had not the materials, it is difficult to understand how they could spend more money in keeping up the condition of the roads.  From 1934 on, because of the very large number of unemployed, extra unemployment grants were made available, which were based on a census of the unemployed compiled in the month of January each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1934-35, in County Mayo, a grant amounting to £90,000 was made and distributed in proportion to the number of unemployed in each area.  Only those parts of the county in which there was a number of unemployed on the unemployment register benefited by those grants and in other parts of the county, where people who paid very <Col N="644" /> high rates live, the roads deteriorated. They were not able to procure those grants and such repairs as were done were met out of the county rates. When the money provided in this Bill is made available and when the works of repair start I hope that those roads which did not benefit by the former grants will not be lost sight of.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of road-making machinery lying derelict in quarries throughout the country.  If it is not possible to put that machinery into a useful condition, it should be scrapped and sold as scrap.  The fact that crushers, traction engines and steamrollers are lying derelict is no tribute to the supervision that is exercised in regard to the maintenance and repair of machinery.  At a time when road-making materials were very scarce, tar was wasted in many cases.  This should not have occurred.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Minister in providing for the work that has to be done by supplementing the Road Fund is doing it in the proper way.  Any other method would mean an increase in taxation.  That is something that the present Government are out to control. Their aim is not so much to keep down taxation as to provide money that may be usefully employed.  I have discussed this matter with other people and I have come to the conclusion that the Minister, in adopting this plan for the repair of roads that have suffered during the emergency, is adopting the sensible plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hawkins has made an effort to get out of the mess which the <i>Irish Press</i> landed him in by its heading the other day.  It is impossible to describe this as a raid. The term was an unfortunate one.  It has directed the attention of inquirers to the real raiding that was done on the fund.  On nine occasions, from 1932, the fund was raided in the proper sense of that term.  Money was taken from the Road Fund and handed over either to special schemes or to general Exchequer purposes, and the sum involved was £900,000.  That was a raid.  What is happening now is that the Central Fund is advancing to the Road Fund, or at least, it is asking leave to be allowed to advance, certain <Col N="645" /> extra sums of money so that the advances will not come to more than £5,000,000.  It must not be forgotten, however, that the alleviation is only in respect of £3,000,000, because, even although the advance has been repaid, it still counts as an advance for the purpose of the legislation.  The sum is being lent on the strength of the Road Fund.  The Road Fund has found it impossible to repay these advances from time to time.  There is no fear that it will not be able to repay these moneys in future.  When the new scheme for restoring the roads which had suffered under the heavy traffic of the war years was inaugurated, it was the intention that it would be financed completely and entirely out of the Road Fund, and for 1946-47 and 1947-48 that was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to whether this money could be found from the Transition Development Fund, it must be remembered that there are certain objections to that.  That fund has already been earmarked for other purposes.  If any portion of that fund were diverted now to meet expenditure on roads, whatever the amount that was diverted would have to be provided from some other source and there is considerable legal doubt as to whether the section of the Finance Act under which the Transition Development Fund was inaugurated would permit this type of expenditure on roads to be financed from the Transition Development Fund.  In any event, there has been a contention that, if it was thought that the Road Fund might not be able to bear the cost of this restoration, then the proper thing was for the Minister for Local Government to conserve the Road Fund by maintaining a lower scale of grants.  These were the arguments that were used by my predecessor in the Ministry of Finance in regard to this whole matter.  It was these arguments, in addition to one other matter, that led to the peculiar decision being taken which Senator Hawkins half read from the Dáil debate, that was, that £2,250,000 should be advanced to the Road Fund.  The part that I persuaded him to read afterwards is part of the same sentence.  It is a bad habit to break <Col N="646" /> sentences for the purpose of distortion. It is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But it was not decided whether that sum should be obtained from the Transition Development Fund or out of moneys provided by Parliament.&rdquo;</P>

This, of course, was all part of what I may call the late Government getting ready its going away clothes.  A decision was taken on the 13th February, when they had just five days to go.  It was very easy to take decisions about making grants of £2,250,000 in those days.</P>

The percentage of these is not being disturbed.  What was referred to in the Taoiseach's statement in the Dáil was the decision taken on the 13th February, 1948.

      <P>Yes.  The date of the decision was the 13th February and the memorandum on which it was taken was a memorandum submitted on the 12th February, built up hurriedly, and the request that was demanded of the Government in those days by the Minister for Local Government was that the existing scale of grants should be continued until the work of road restoration is completed and a grant of £2,250,000 should be made towards the cost from the Transition Development Fund&mdash;and that was not accepted.  The minute of the decision was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was understood that the question whether the State grant of £2,250,000 should be made out of the Transition Development Fund or out of moneys to be voted for the purpose would be further considered by the Minister for Finance&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill of very limited scope and application.  It applies to a relatively small number of persons. The Bill will enable certain persons who had erected dwelling houses before the 31st March last to benefit by the remission of rates for a certain number of years&mdash;two-thirds of the rates for a period of five years.  The purpose of the Bill is to continue that concession for a period of one year.  It does not apply to houses eligible for grants under the Housing Acts or to houses erected by local authorities.  Therefore, the concession is applicable to a very limited number of people and is to be continued for a period of 12 months.</P>
      <P>I take it that it will be readily understood by Senators that there are certain types of houses that have been from time to time in the course of erection which do not conform to the standards set down under the Housing Acts.  I think it would not be fair if the position which has obtained hitherto in respect of the class of persons dealt with in this Bill were not continued for at least a period of one year.</P>

      <P>We on this side welcome the Bill.  It represents a continuation of the present position.  If there is any fault that we have to find with it, it is that the time limit is rather short.  I cannot understand why the Bill should extend only to the 31st March next in view of existing circumstances. Senators are well aware of all the formalities that have to be complied with at the present time in connection with building.  There is, first of all, the essential document to secure &mdash;the licence to proceed with the building.  Then there is the scarcity of materials and of labour that we hear so much about.  In view of all that, one might well ask if it is worth while going to all the trouble and expense of passing a Bill at this time in order to grant a remission of rates to <Col N="651" /> people who have begun a building or who will have completed one by the 31st March next.  I think that the time limit might well be extended to 1952 or 1953.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has pointed out, this Bill has no relation at all to houses which receive assistance under the various Housing Acts.  Therefore, we must assume that it caters for the type of person that we heard so much about during the recent general election campaign&mdash;the person building a house of over 1,250 square feet.  Some people might look on such buildings as being of the luxury type or as being non-essential.  We, however, have always held that a person who builds a house for himself is not alone doing a national work but is adding to the rateable value of the area in which the house is erected.  For the first few years the remission in rates on such houses is only a very small matter.  It was referred to in the Finance Bill. We know that under the valuation of new buildings the amount of rates remitted is quickly recouped.</P>
      <P>I happen to have a special knowledge of matters in relation to housing. There is a hold-up at the present time in the building of houses, quite apart from houses built under the Housing Acts, and particularly of the type of house dealt with under this Bill.  We know that there is a reluctance on the part of the Department of Industry and Commerce to grant licences.  There is a hold-up in connection with the allocation of materials.  I feel that the number of people who will become entitled to this concession will be very limited, not through any fault of their own, but by reason of having to comply with red tape regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, a number of houses will be built in rural areas where the labour is of an unsatisfactory type, as it is engaged mostly in agriculture and only available for building in slack periods.  It takes a year or more to complete a house in a rural area, as compared with the very much shorter time in urban areas.  Therefore, the Minister should extend the time, and we are prepared to facilitate him in extending it to 1952 or 1953.  Otherwise, <Col N="652" /> the Bill will be brought forward again next year.</P>

      <P>Most of us have noted with satisfaction that the Minister has raised the ceiling on money that may be advanced from £1,750 to £2,000. However, the conditions are somewhat changed, to the disadvantage of the builder.  When the ceiling was £1,750, 90 per cent. of the amount could be advanced, whereas now when it is £2,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same class of house.  There is a little discrepancy in the remission of rates.  Where a grant is given, the remission of two-thirds is given for seven years, but where no grant is given, the remission is for five years only.  If anything, the reverse should be the case&mdash;a builder who does not call on the public purse should not be penalised while those who do so call get the seven years' remission.  There may be some explanation, but if these are the crude facts they require the Minister's attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the greatest doubt about the wisdom of giving a remission of rates at all, as it is held out by the builder as an inducement to a potential customer to believe that the house is worth more than it normally is.  It means giving an additional grant to the speculative builder.  I have not examined the technicalities of this question and do not know how it operates, but that seems to be the likely tendency; and, if so, I dislike the proposal.  It is generally understood that, in the case of luxury building&mdash;houses costing £3,000 or £4,000&mdash;there is already a big margin of profit and I do not think the taxpayer&mdash;or the ratepayer, in this case&mdash; should be asked to subscribe another moiety to the profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the manner in which the Bill is presented, I would urge on the Minister to insist that when the draftsman is giving him a Bill of this kind, which is entirely a work of reference, there should be an explanatory memorandum with it.  We have <Col N="653" /> urged that here and in the Dáil for some time and with some success. Most Departments now are inclined to prepare a memorandum explanatory of such Bills.  That was done last week in connection with the Social Welfare Bill and it is very necessary in a Bill of this kind.  There is only one important clause in it, but it would take any Senator the best part of the evening to find out what it means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to give the House any assurance of incorporating any amendment in this Bill extending the period of its operation.  It has always been regarded as a Bill of a purely temporary character and, while it may not have been continued from year to year, its duration was always definitely and rather severely limited.  Therefore, I have no accommodation to offer on that point.</P>
      <P>The Bill will apply only to a very limited number of people.  At the moment, building licences are issued only to local authorities and to private persons whose houses will comply with the requirements of the Housing Acts. There is a very good reason for that, and while it would not be advisable for me to enter into the merits of the arrangements here and now, I think that the good sense of the arrangement will commend itself generally to the people of this country.</P>
      <P>If this Bill were not brought forward, it might have been suggested that there was a breach of faith with persons who had started to erect houses which are covered by this Bill, and who had started in expectation of this concession, which has been available over a number of years.  We are bound to keep our side of what they might look upon as something in the nature of a contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the future course of legislation of this kind will be it is not yet possible to say.  If a similar Bill is to be brought forward next year, I will have examined the point made by Senator Honan.  I will arrange to give effect to the suggestion of Senator Duffy, in order that this Bill, and Bills of the kind, for which I am responsible <Col N="654" /> should bear on their face an explanation that is easily understood.  There is no objection to that, and I will arrange, as far as possible, to have it done.</P>
    <P>Because of the fact that this Bill is a continuation of an Act that was in force for a number of years, it might be regarded as one, the provisions of which would be generally understood. On the other hand, there are in this House, as in the other House, new members who, perhaps, may not be familiar with the terms of the measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Murphy) Timothy Joseph Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill arises out of the proposal to hold local elections in County Dublin in a short time.  When the new council is elected, one of its duties will be to elect from amongst its members the Dublin Board of Assistance. In the ordinary way there would be no interruption in that course, but for the fact that in St. Kevin's, the centre of the Dublin Board of Assistance, a very important scheme of reorganisation is in progress for a considerable time.  In consultation with the Minister for Health, it was decided that the best course to adopt was to continue the arrangements for control of St. Kevin's Institution that are now in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a commissioner in charge of <Col N="655" /> Dublin Board of Assistance who is an officer of the Local Government Department, and the purpose of this Bill is to continue the arrangement until reorganisation is completed for the limited period mentioned in the Bill. If it is found that the administration is not completed at the end of that time, it is proposed to continue the operations of this Bill by Order, but any Order of the kind would be subject to consideration by the Oireachtas and will be subject to annulment if the Oireachtas so decides.</P>
    <P>There is also a section in the Bill which restricts the appointment of permanent assistant county managers in Dublin area.  That was considered necessary and desirable in view of proposals now under consideration dealing with the whole question of local government; proposals that have been, to some extent, mentioned already but the outline of which has not yet been settled.  This Bill is a purely temporary measure, to allow the process of reorganisation, which is fairly well advanced, and which I hope may be concluded by the date provided in the Bill, to be carried out and to continue the arrangement for that period?</P>
    <P>As far as the rights of elected representatives of the people are concerned this Bill does not alter the position. If the election of members of Dublin County Council and the subsequent election of members of the Board of Assistance take place, as is likely, before the new proposals dealing with county managers are given effect to, the position, in fact, will be the same. The elected representatives will take office, and the position that obtains of having certain very important functions reserved to the county managers and assistant county managers, or whoever the appropriate officers be, would be the same.  The Bill is purely temporary in character and arises only because of the likelihood of local elections being held in Dublin shortly, for the purpose of continuing an arrangement of the work that is now in progress at St. Kevin's Institution, for a certain period, but I hope not longer than that provided for in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that this Bill arises out of another Bill dealing with local government which was passed some weeks ago.  Senators on this side then drew attention to the necessity of bringing in a Bill of this kind.  Many of us are aware of the magnificent work being done in the reorganisation of St. Kevin's.  Owing to the progress that has been made in that respect, we learn from the Minister that something more has to be done, but he is satisfied, when the reorganisation is completed, that it is proposed to carry on, on much the same lines as at present.</P>
      <P>There are one or two points in the Bill that aroused my suspicion.  The first is that we heard much condemnation of the managerial system, of the appointment of managers, and the taking of responsibility from local authorities.  We heard much in that direction in the past, that people who were appointed managers were there at the behest of the Minister, that they were acting for and on his behalf, whereas the real position was that county managers were, in most cases, appointed because of the fact that they were county secretaries when the Act came into force, and where that was not the case, they were appointed by the Local Appointment Commissioners. The Minister had no function there, and was not in a position to remove, to promote or take any part in their activities.</P>
      <P>In this Bill we find a new phrase introduced, that of &ldquo;executive officer&rdquo; which, in the ordinary term known in local government administration, might be referred to as &ldquo;manager&rdquo;.  In future, he will be known as &ldquo;the chief executive officer&rdquo;.  It is one and the same thing, He is the chief executive officer.  A rose will be just the same, no matter what name we call it.  But this person will not be appointed by the Appointments Commissioners. Section 4 (4) reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  The person who, on the day immediately preceding the commencement of this Part, is, by virtue of Part IV of the Local Government Act, 1941 (No. 23 of 1941), the commissioner for the board shall be <Col N="657" /> deemed, as on and from the said commencement, to have been appointed, under sub-section (3) of this section, the chief executive officer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is much the same procedure as was gone through in relation to the appointment of county secretaries and county managers.  The chief executive officer is to hold office during the pleasure of the Minister and not during the pleasure of the elected representatives of the local authority controlling the board.  He is to remain in office so long as he carries out the Minister's wishes.</P>
    <P>This is a very strange section to incorporate in the Bill, and especially a Bill introduced by the Minister who is a member of a Party which was outspoken in the past on the question of democratic rights and in their criticism of the managerial system.  We now have a proposal by the Minister to continue that system and in what might be described as its very worst form&mdash; the maintaining in office of an officer who to all intents and purposes is the manager.  He is to hold office during the pleasure of the Minister, which may be a very short or a very long time. The provision in the Bill is of rather short duration and probably is not worth going into in any great detail, but it gives us and people outside a fairly good idea of what we may expect in the future.  We are promised an amendment of our local government system, and, if that amended system is to provide that the chief executive officer is to hold office during the pleasure of the Minister, and only so long as the Minister wishes him to remain, the present position is much better than that which we might expect to obtain in the future.  I should like to see that section removed from the Bill, so that the chief executive officer may not be removed from office, except for some very good reason. Otherwise he will not be free to carry out any reorganisation scheme except the scheme which he knows is in complete conformity with the Minister's wishes and desires.</P>

      <P>Senator Hawkins speaks as if there was something in the nature of a conspiracy to alter the <Col N="658" /> managerial system by the sidewind of this Bill.  I have great regard for Senator Hawkins.  We have heard a great deal from him in recent times, and it seems to me that he is suffering from two things: he is being worked too hard by his colleagues and is reading the <i>Irish Press</i> too constantly and too much.  The <i>Irish Press</i> has reduced his well-known intelligence to a state of complete confusion.  The chief executive officer, mentioned in Part II, is not a county manager, a city manager or a manager of any type or description.</P>

      <P>We shall have to adopt my old remedy for the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;we shall all have to learn Irish, because we become very indistinct, very absurd and very confused in English.  The Senator said that we were going to get a County Managerial Bill in the near future which would give us county managers like the particular person in this Bill who will hold office during the pleasure of the Minister, which he construes, quite foolishly, as meaning that he must carry out the Minister's wishes.  It is not the same thing.  This is a temporary measure&mdash;it is not an amendment in any shape or form of the managerial Acts&mdash;to preserve St. Kevin's Hospital under a particular form of management which was invented by the former Minister and for which Senator Hawkins, when he began, took credit. If there is any credit due to the former Minister or to the Senator, I do not want to take it from him, but what the Bill does is to continue an arrangement existing at present for a limited period, up to 30th June, 1949, and to continue in office an officer of the Department appointed by the Minister to carry out certain functions as a commissioner and not as a manager working with a local body.  I hope that is clear.</P>

His position is not being altered in any way.  We are not discussing the individual at all. The particular individual is a rare person&mdash;he is a Dublin man who has actually got a job in Dublin, a very rare thing.  He is neither a Corkman nor a Galwayman, which is very remarkable, but this provision is not strange or peculiar and is not an innovation in the managerial Acts. There is nothing remarkable about the sub-section which says that he shall hold office during the pleasure of the Minister.  He is an officer of the Department of Local Government and this Bill is merely to enable that officer appointed by the former Minister to work out to the end a particular scheme.  There is nothing sinister in it, nothing extraordinary and nothing extravagant.  There is nothing in it which indicates the Minister's views about the managerial system casting their shadows before.  The real remedy for Senator Hawkins is to let his own natural intelligence and good nature work and not read the <i>Irish Press</i> so much.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that the Minister has adopted the expedient, if I may call it so, which he has put forward in this Bill of allowing the person who has done so much for St. Kevin's to continue until the change-over is complete and we make it an institution of which we are proud and hope to be still prouder.  I rise to congratulate the Minister, therefore, on that decision.  I take the opportunity also to remind him that a great deal of the good work performed by the commissioner, who is now to be known as chief executive officer, was done with the help of a woman.  I think it was because he had a woman to help him with the woman's point of view that conditions in St. Kevin's were so much bettered.  There are a great many things which a woman sees sooner than a man, and in this particular case the man and woman acted <Col N="660" /> very harmoniously.  The woman has now retired, but the man is still carrying on, and I think it would be ungenerous of us if we did not pay tribute to the selfless service of that woman.  I hope it will set a headline to the Minister to employ women very often in such cases where their particular qualities ensure the results which are apparent in St. Kevin's.</P>

      <P>I think that, unwittingly, certain portions of my short opening statement were calculated to mislead the Seanad to some little extent.  I should have made it clear that there were two bodies entitled to make nominations to the membership of the Dublin Board of Assistance.  It was not alone the Dublin County Council but Dublin Corporation also who were entitled to make nominations. The statement by Senator Hayes has relieved me of the necessity of making any extended reply to the points made by Senator Hawkins.  I want to assure the House that there is no intention to arrogate any powers to the Minister or to obtain powers in any surreptitious or unfair way.</P>
      <P>The fact is that this reorganisation work has been in progress for some time.  It is under the control of an officer who is an officer of the Department, and, having made that clear, Senator Hawkins will easily understand the reason for not interrupting that arrangement and for having that official, in the matter of recall, subject to the Minister.  I hope that neither this House nor the Dáil will be troubled by proposals for an extension of this Bill, but I cannot guarantee that.  I hope, however, that in the period provided in the Bill, this work of reorganisation will be completed, and that we will be in a position to put the arrangement regarding the Dublin Board of Assistance which would have been made if this work of reorganisation had not been proceeding into effect.</P>

Everyone will agree that the man who has been acting is a person to whom no objection would be raised if he were made chief executive officer.  The Section 3 of Part II states that the chief executive officer shall, from time to time as occasion requires, be appointed by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Health.  The important thing about that is that it seems to leave in the power of the Minister for all time the appointing of the chief executive officer over the heads of the elected public representatives.</P>

      <P>(a)  at least one week's annual holiday with pay, and</P>
      <P>(b)  leave of absence with pay on all Church holydays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people have asked me why I mentioned &ldquo;Church holydays&rdquo; instead of bank holidays in this motion and I propose to explain this in a few moments.  At the outset, however, I think it is well to state that I believe <Col N="663" /> that the proposals contained in this motion are extremely reasonable.  In fact, some Senators may wonder that I have not proposed more for the benefit of agricultural labourers.  In this connection, I would like to say that I am very hopeful that, in due course, and as quickly as possible, many other improvements for these workers will also be brought about.  I believe that agricultural workers, road workers and farmers with small holdings of land are amongst the lowest paid sections of the community and that anything, therefore, that we can do to benefit them would be most desirable and would deserve the careful consideration of all those in favour of social justice.  With regard to holidays, I think Senators will know that the majority of wage-earners in this country already receive holidays with pay.  In fact, almost every section of the community, except agricultural labourers, receive holidays. In addition, it will be well to remember that a certain number of agricultural workers already receive holidays owing to arrangements made individually between these workers and the farmers who employ them, or as a result of trade union action.</P>
    <P>The object of this motion is that every agricultural worker shall receive holidays in future.  Now, some Senators who live in the cities have asked why we, in this motion, suggest Church holydays instead of bank holidays.  The reason is that, in rural areas, as I think all Senators from rural areas know, it is the practice already to observe Church holydays in agricultural employment, and not bank holidays.  I think it is very desirable that I should make it clear that we are not suggesting both.  We are suggesting Church holydays and we believe that the vast majority of agricultural workers would prefer Church holydays.  I cannot see any good reason why these workers should not have one week's holiday with pay, and Church holydays, but I am well aware that many arguments have been made against that proposal in the past, and I propose, therefore, briefly to refer to some of those arguments.</P>
    <P>One thing, however, that is very <Col N="664" /> encouraging is that our present Minister for Agriculture has on several recent occasions expressed his desire to do what he could to improve the condition of agricultural workers.  On the 13th May, 1948, the Minister for Agriculture made this statement in the Dáil&mdash;I mention it in case some Senators may not have seen it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is a source of humiliation to me that the agricultural worker in this country who, in my judgment, is the most highly skilled worker we have, should have the figure of 55/- a week associated with his name as a minimum wage.  I hope to change that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is a very welcome pronouncement. Again, he did not say it merely on one occasion.  The Minister said something similar on July 15th:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The agricultural worker has a minimum wage throughout the greater part of this country of 55/-per week.  Frankly, I am ashamed to name it.  He is the lowest paid worker in the English-speaking world, and that is something of which I am bitterly ashamed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think we all should be ashamed of that state of affairs, and that we should all do everything in our power to improve his position as quickly as possible. What we have been up against is the mentality of a certain number of people in this country, who seem to accept this present position as natural and right.  The Minister made another interesting statement on the 15th July:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There has been for long enough in this country a proposition that if you are an industrialist, or a racketeer or an exploiter, you are entitled to wear a silk hat, and drive a Chrysler car, and occupy a house standing in its own grounds in the suburbs of Dublin, and draw your living out of the hard-working men who live upon the land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the Minister's statement. This distinction operates in regard to holidays, as well as in regard to remuneration.  Many of the people with a big income, to whom the Minister <Col N="665" /> referred, can also afford to take very long holidays.  Some of them have a month, or perhaps more, holidays in the year, while the agricultural worker is not legally entitled to any holidays. It is sometimes argued by those who are opposed to giving holidays to agricultural workers that, as they work in the open air, they should be content to work for 52 weeks of the year without a break.  I freely admit that working in the open air in fine weather is pleasanter than working in an enclosed factory, but it is not quite so pleasant working in the open air in very bad weather.  There are many farming jobs which involve getting up early in the morning, and working late at night, in surroundings that are not by any means ideal.  In that connectior also I would like to quote very briefly another statement by the Minister, because I feel that his words will carry great weight.  This is what he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A lot of people have said that you cannot get fellows and girls to milk cows.  I think that is true and I do not blame them.  Why should they take work sitting under a cow and getting slapped in the face with the cow's tail, if they can get a good job in the town?  If we want people to do agricultural work we have to make that agricultural work as agreeable as rival forms of occupation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that statement by the Minister is very true, and the people who have to get slapped in the face with the cow's tail deserve some compensation, in the form of some holidays on pay.</P>
    <P>I base the whole of this proposal on fair play and social justice, but there is also another consideration, and that is, that if we do not improve the condition of agricultural workers they will, as the Minister has said, go to the towns or emigrate to England: In fact, large numbers of them have already done so, and that tendency will continue unless their conditions are improved.</P>
    <P>It has been rightly stated that the farmer with a small holding should receive as much consideration as the agricultural worker who is paid a wage. Personally, I do not wish to make any distinction between them.  The man <Col N="666" /> with the small holding undoubtedly deserves consideration also.  I would like to see his position improved, as well as that of the agricultural labourer, for there is no doubt that many men with small holdings have a very low standard of living.  I find that in the West of Ireland, where I come from, many of them are as badly off as the agricultural labourer. In order that they should have more leisure, and be able to take a little holiday from their normal work, one very necessary thing for them is suitable machinery.  In that connection, I was very glad to read in the newspaper recently that the Minister for Agriculture stated that plans were being made to give the small farmers the use of up-to-date machinery through co-operative societies.  The sooner that is done the better, provided they get machinery on reasonable terms.  That should help to increase production, and also to lighten their labour and enable them to have more leisure.</P>
    <P>With regard to leisure, one of the arguments that has been made in the past against giving holidays to agricultural workers is that we are short of food, that we need increased production. I entirely agree but, no matter how much we need increased production, I do not think it would be justifiable to ask anybody to work 52 weeks of the year without a break.  In civilised countries it is an accepted fact that everybody should have a reasonable amount of leisure. If people have a little leisure they usually work all the better for the remainder of the year.  I agree entirely that increased production is very necessary, not only in this country but all over the world, if we are to secure a much better standard of living for the lower-paid sections of the community. I consider, however, that everybody should get a fair share of leisure. Agricultural labourers work longer hours than the majority of other workers, and yet the vast majority of other workers get longer holidays than they get.  There are many people in this country who get a fortnight's holidays. There is a certain number who get a month's holidays, and even more. Why should the agricultural worker <Col N="667" /> get no paid holidays at all?  Another argument used against giving holidays to the agricultural worker is that it would make it difficult for a farmer to carry on the work of the farm.  I am a farmer, and I fully realise that you cannot close down a farm for a week, as you could close down a factory.  The holidays would have to be &ldquo;staggered&rdquo;. All the workers could not get their holidays the same week.  I do not think there would be any objection to &ldquo;staggering&rdquo; the holidays.  I believe a friendly arrangement could be reached between the agricultural workers and the farmers with whom they worked so that the necessary work of the farm would be carried on, and that each man would get a week's holiday during the year.</P>
    <P>In the same way, with regard to Church holydays, on a farm we recognise that on Sundays, holydays and on every other day we have to milk cows and do every other necessary work.  My idea is that it should not be always the same men who are on the job.  On the farm on which I work, we take the work in turn, and every man gets a certain amount of leisure.</P>
    <P>Another argument used in the past was that the country could not afford to give these conditions.  I believe that, although the country is not wealthy, and although our national income is not very great, we are not quite so poor as all that.  We could afford to give the agricultural workers one week's holidays in the year, and Church holydays.  According to the present rate of wages that would work out at approximately £8 per man per year, which is not a very large amount.  If you calculate at the rate of £2 15s. Od. a week which covers most of the country, it would come to £8 a year approximately per man.</P>
    <P>Enormous sums of money are being spent in this country by some of the wealthier sections of the community on luxuries and amusements, and, I think, some of the money which they spend in that way should be used to benefit the poorer sections.  It has also been said that some individual farmers <Col N="668" /> cannot afford to give these conditions. If there are still some such farmers, I think they should be put into the position in which they can pay the small amount which we are asking.  I admit that, in the past, many farmers got such low prices for their produce, and were up against so many other difficulties, that it was, in fact, impossible for them to give really decent wages to the agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>Another Senator mentioned here recently that some farmers are already giving their workers a little more than the Agricultural Wages Board rate of wages.  Some farmers already give their workers some holidays with pay, and some of them give their workers a little bonus, if they have a good year or if they get a good price for their stock or produce.  I believe that every farmer should be put in a position in which he could afford to pay a decent wage to the agricultural workers.  I realise that to put all farmers in a position to pay a really good wage may take a little time.  It cannot be done immediately, but I do not think it will take very long to enable every farmer to be able to pay the additional £8 per year per worker which we now suggest. The Minister has said on many occasions recently that he is doing everything in his power to improve the economic condition of the farmers so as to enable them to pay a better wage.</P>
    <P>I think that this small concession that we are asking is long overdue.  I hope, as I said at the outset, that much greater benefits will be conferred on agricultural workers as soon as possible.  I do not think I need take up the time of the House any longer in putting forward any other arguments in favour of this proposal.  If any points are raised, I will, at the end of the debate, be able to reply to them.  I consider that the proposal is a very reasonable one.  What we are asking is long overdue.  The granting of it would benefit one of the most hard-wording and underpaid sections of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmyth" hpid="Mr. M. Smyth Mr. M. Smyth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smyth</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. During the past seven or eight years, before and during the emergency, the <Col N="669" /> farm workers were praised by all Parties for their splendid work in the campaign for food production.  But now, in the year 1948, we still find them working under the worst conditions. During the past 30 years their conditions have not been improved, but during that very same period the conditions of industrial workers have been vastly improved.  Their hours of work have been reduced to 50 a week, to 48, to 44 and in some cases are now down to 40 hours.  We find that in many factories industrial workers are only working a five-day week, or 40 hours.  We find farm workers, in some rural areas, working in the vicinity of factories where these hours prevail. In addition, they get a half-day on Saturday, they get one week's annual holidays with pay, and now, in most cases, they are getting two weeks' holidays with pay.  They are paid for bank holidays, while farm workers get no holidays whatever.  If a farmer employs a servant girl he must give her at least one week's annual holiday with pay, but the farm worker, who is the hardest worker on the land, is not entitled to any holiday whatever.</P>
      <P>I agree that many farmers do pay their workers for Church holydays, but in the majority of cases they are not paid.  I think that great credit is due to farmers and farm workers because they are the only people who keep Church holydays.  Church holydays occur eight or nine times during the year, so that the majority of farm workers are at a loss of one day's pay in the week in which there is a Church holyday.  Senator Burke has pointed out that farm workers are the worst paid of any workers.  When a Catholic holyday occurs they lose about 9/-because they do not work on that day.</P>

      <P>Would the Senator be good enough to give me any instances where he knows that that is happening in the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmyth" hpid="Mr. Smyth Mr. Smyth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smyth</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that it happens in the County Kildare where I come from, and that in many cases they are not paid for Church holydays.  In the week in which a Church holyday occurs a farm worker loses about 9/4. <Col N="670" /> His pay packet for his wife, family, and himself is the smaller by that amount that week.  About two years ago in the County Dublin, as Senator Counihan knows, an agreement was come to between the farmers and the farm workers to give a weekly half-holiday and a week's holidays with pay. In North Kildare at that time&mdash;it adjoins the County Dublin&mdash;we had an unfortunate strike.  The farm workers in North Kildare saw the farm workers in the County Dublin getting a weekly half-holiday on Saturday and a week's annual holiday.  They were working at one side of the road and had not the same conditions as those working on the other side of the road in County Dublin.  As well as that the men in County Dublin were getting better pay, therefore we had the unfortunate strike during the harvest season. It failed and left a bad feeling between the farmers and their workers.  That was very unfortunate.  At the present time the North Kildare workers are not getting the weekly half-holiday or the week's annual holiday with pay.</P>
      <P>This time 12 months we had a similar strike in South Kildare.  It occurred in the best tillage area in the country. The demand of the men was for a weekly half-holiday and for an annual holiday with pay.  It also failed.  This has also been the cause of great dissatisfaction among the farm workers. Senator Burke has pointed out that we are all anxious to see increased agricultural production.  If we are to get that, then we must have in agriculture, as in every other industry, satisfied workers, but the present position is that farm workers are working for the lowest wages paid to any class of worker and under the worst conditions of any worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the North Kildare strike this matter was referred to the Agricultural Wages Board, which found that they had no authority to deal with it.  The terms laid down for the Agricultural Wages Board specify a 54-hour week and the board found that they could not change those conditions.  Recently, at a meeting of the No. 3 area of the Agricultural Wages Board, a resolution was passed agreeing to give annual holidays with pay.  The Minister <Col N="671" /> recently sent a communication to all the agricultural committees.  When that communication came before the Kildare County Committee of Agriculture it was very fully discussed, and some very practical farmers on the committee dealt with it in a commonsense way.  Many of those farmers state that, unless they get better conditions, there will be no farm workers, especially young people, as they are going to the towns and looking for other work.  The Kildare Agricultural Committee passed this resolution, which, I am sure, the Minister has received.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oddly enough, I have not received it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmyth" hpid="Mr. Smyth Mr. Smyth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smyth</NameTxt>
      <P>It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That, in the opinion of this committee, the conditions of employment for agricultural workers, the most important in the country, should not be less favourable than workers employed in other industries.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers say it cannot be done.  In County Dublin and in some other places it has been done, and what can be done in one district can be done in another.  Of course, the farmers say that farm workers never got holidays and should not want them now.  The question of the weekly half-day is difficult, and it is not in our motion.  If it were said 50 years ago that in 1948 industrial workers would have a five-day, 40-hour week, the statement would have caused great surprise.  If the farm workers now get holidays and improved conditions, they will work better and will not be dissatisfied. They have a 48-hour week in Britain under the Agricultural Wages Board, with a weekly half-holiday, holidays with pay and other concessions. Senator Burke has made a very good case for the weekly half-holiday and payment for Church holydays.  In every country district there are factories, and farm workers see the factory workers getting a half-day on Saturday, while they have to work on Saturday nights. The Minister has said that he hopes, at the end of his period of office, to see the agricultural workers in the <Col N="672" /> same, if not a better, position, as the industrial workers; so I hope that the carrying of this resolution to-day will help him to carry that out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot find fault with the way this motion has been presented, but both the proposer and seconder have an aim which, however worthy, will defeat itself, if they seek to carry it out by the methods they propose here.  No one will deny that the conditions of the farm workers are not comparable with those of other workers.  It is the Minister's object to improve those conditions and that should also be the object of every Christian man, but I do not think this is the right approach.</P>
      <P>In the motion we have the words &ldquo;agricultural workers&rdquo;.  These men are not so classified in my county and this term &ldquo;agricultural worker&rdquo; is a concept of the British bureaucrat, where we had &ldquo;labourers&rdquo; Acts and many such styles and titles that were not of our creation.  Farmers do not talk of their &ldquo;workers&rdquo;, but of their &ldquo;men&rdquo;.  I have had many meals with the men along the fences and in hay fields and in the bogs and I know that is so.  I have been in Senator McGee's farm, where he has ten or 15 men, and he always spoke of them, not as his labourers, but as his men.  This term in itself has a significance from which we should be slow to depart.  Farmers classify these men along with themselves, working in the fields with themselves and their sons, and eating with them.  The problem of the farmer is the problem of his workers.  Anyone who tries to draw a comparison between the conditions of agricultural workers and those of industrial workers is talking about two things which cannot be discussed in the same breath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That relationship is one which the Oireachtas should be slow to disturb. If we attempt to compel men by law to establish a new relationship, we will be doing something foreign to nature itself, giving a new concept to Irish rural life, separating the farmer from his workers and classifying them in a way never done before, in a way which will not be for the welfare of <Col N="673" /> agriculture, of the agricultural worker, of the farmers or of the nation.  We look upon our men as real men, whole men, able to do a full and an honest day's work and who understand the significance of it.</P>
    <P>Of course, we live in a peculiar age. There is a great deal of talk about holidays, about tourism, and about ease and comfort, and, in the same breath, we have talk about the high cost of living, about the inflationary spiral that nobody seems to be able to deal with, forgetting that all this inflation and shortage is due to the fact that people are expected to produce things when they are not working as they used to work.  In this country we are short of commodities that the land produces.  Eggs are dear, butter and bacon are dear and other things are not available at all.  While that is a fact we are urging a policy that means less work, and fewer people at work.  Naturally, that means a lower standard of production.  I do not think the mover or the seconder of the motion attempted to measure the significance of such a proposal.  I do not think they troubled to look at what it involves.  Such figures as I have deal with workers not belonging to families on the land, relate to 1944, when they numbered 84,000 permanent whole-time people, and, in addition, there were 50,000 part-workers not fully employed on the land.</P>
    <P>The motion means that men would be away on Church holydays.  If you give one week's holidays to men working on the land that means a standstill order for 500,000 men.  When they are drawn away from agriculture for one day that means a definite cut in the amount of work done.  If 500,000 men were at a standstill when corn was ready to be reaped who could say that there would not be a rain or a hailstorm that night?  If that happened they could not work at it the next day. That is of vital significance in the world we are living in, where supplies are so short and where there is so much talk about shortage of food.  At the same time we are told that it is essential that there should be a higher standard of life for human society and that fewer hours should be working <Col N="674" /> hours.  That must be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke pointed to these difficulties. It is possible to draw men away from the face of a coal mine for a fortnight or for a week as the coal face is there when they return.  Rain or storm will not affect that.  It is possible to hold up the equipment in a textile mill or in a factory and no damage is done.  Of course there is a lower output.  You cannot handle agriculture like that.  Crops must be handled when they are ready for cutting.  If we feel that our agricultural workers&mdash;as Senator Burke classified them&mdash;need a higher standard of living, I would prefer if a motion was put down aiming at raising their living standard, by giving them better wages, and let us discuss how that could be done rather than claiming that they would have a higher standard by getting a week's holidays.  I do not think many of the idlers that we see around are happier than those who work hard.  Those who work hard are the happiest people.  The Minister for Agriculture knows that vast problems confront this country.  The difficulty of raising agricultural production is an immense one.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke and Senator Smyth believe that if there is to be increased production the standard under which our people work must be improved.  I agree.  But I think it would be much better if we applied our minds to methods we want adopted in order to improve conditions so as to see if this is the best way.  I do not think it is. If this motion were adopted, and if the State took the responsibility of legislating, I think we would disturb the human relations that have existed between farmers and their men for generations.  I believe that that would be very undesirable at this stage in our history.</P>
    <P>There are other things that require attention.  In my view, and the Minister in some of his speeches addressed himself to the problem, we want rural Ireland to be much better organised. I believe we want something on the lines of what is being done on the Continent. The rural community here is <Col N="675" /> the worst organised in Western Europe.  I speak with some knowledge of the organisation of the farming community on the Continent.  What we have to do is to try to get the rural community to come together, farmers and workers.  It is a problem which cannot be solved from the point of view of increased production or better use of equipment when we get it.  It cannot be solved by the methods with which we are attempting to solve it. Our problems can be solved if our people can be got together in their districts to discuss them.</P>
    <P>Holland is one of the most progressive agricultural countries in the world.  There farmers and their men are organised.  Rural organisation in Holland is drawn partly from farmers and partly from their employees.  That is what we ought to have, and it is something at which we should aim.  I believe that if the Minister for Agriculture took the responsibility of organising our farmers, according to the plans proposed in the Report of the Vocational Commission, so that in every parish farmers and their men would be drawn together, we would get an entirely new approach to our agricultural problem.  Those of us who own land, whether the acres are broad or are few, and the men who work for us should be able to determine what is best for agriculture.  Those of us who own farms ought to make a Christian approach to the problem.  I do not like to be driven to do anything by State determination.  I would not like to be driven to do things against my better judgment.</P>
    <P>I believe it would be an error on our part to pass this motion.  I agree absolutely with the proposal that there is a real problem and that we have to face it.  We know how difficult it is to keep people on the land to-day.  I do not know whether Senator Burke put the case fully when he stated that on his farm the work of men changes, that one man takes over the duties of another man on Church holydays. Senator Smyth pointed out that in Kildare farmers do not pay their men for Church holydays.  Probably Senator O'Dwyer could explain that there <Col N="676" /> is another type of employment in County Limerick, where men are engaged for a certain number of months.  That would indicate that men do not work on Church holydays except to milk.</P>
    <P>There are different conditions in different areas.  It is difficult to legislate for the country as a whole.  Conditions in North Kildare and South Kildare are different from conditions in West Kerry, West Donegal or West Cavan.  A motion of this kind, if passed, would apply to the country as a whole.  It is all right to speak of how easy it would be to change about where a number of men were working on a farm.  Take the position of a small farmer in Cavan who employs one or two men.  Many farmers there employ only one man, and if that man is away for a week, and if there are nine or ten cows to be milked twice daily and calves to be attended to, difficulties would arise.  Take care that in a case like that the farmer would decide to keep only five cows the following year.</P>
    <P>While I agree with what the proposer and the seconder said, the difficulty with regard to work in rural Ireland poses a problem for all of us.  I suggest that to pass the motion in its present form would be no solution of the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusOFarrell" hpid="Mr. S. O'Farrell Mr. S. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>While my heart is with Senator Burke and Senator Smyth in regard to this motion, my head would not allow me to follow them into the division lobby, if the motion were put to a division.  I intended to make the point which Senator Baxter made as to what is meant by agricultural workers.  I take it that every farmer and every farmer's wife, son and daughter is an agricultural worker.  I know a great many of them.  They have to work very long hours on very many days of the year and for very little pay. We should have no hesitation in talking about agricultural labourers, if we mean agricultural labourers.  It has been a recent fashion to look on the word &ldquo;labour&rdquo; as something derogatory, as something to be despised, but one can go back very far for justification for the use of the word &ldquo;labourer&rdquo;&mdash;back as far as the <Col N="677" /> labourers in the vineyard, who were not the vineyard workers.  I never had any objection to being called a labourer when I was a labourer.  It is an inferiority complex which is growing up amongst us.  There is nothing dishonourable in the work and nothing dishonourable in the title.  If we use the more comprehensive title, such as that used in this motion, we must give it its literal meaning and must say that the motion is that at least one week's annual holidays with pay and leave of absence with pay on all Church holydays should be given to all farmers, their wives, their children and their paid employees.  That is one objection I have to the drafting of the motion.</P>
      <P>Another is that it is an attempt to make a different set of laws for the rural community and the urban community. If you want the agricultural labourers &mdash; the agricultural wage-earners, to give them another title&mdash; to have as many holidays as workers in urban districts, why not put down a motion asking for a fortnight's holidays with pay and be done with it? If you think they should get Church holydays and are not getting them, should the city worker not also get Church holydays?  Who among you will be so daring as to suggest that every employer in the cities and in the towns shall let off all his men on Church holydays?  None will do it, because you know it would be most unpopular and that employers in cities and towns, in factories, who could quite easily shut their shops and not be at any great loss, will not do it.</P>
      <P>The motion asks that the farmers be compelled by law to give their employees a holiday on Church holydays, when, so far as I know, 99 per cent of them already do so without any legal compulsion.  Why compel them to do what they do voluntarily?  If you compel them to do it, you give them a grievance.  I have worked in the country and I have lived in many counties.  I never lived in any county where the men did not get a holiday on Church holydays.  They got them without any insistence on getting them and as a right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="678" /> Senator Baxter raised the point that if you make it compulsory that a man must get a Church holyday, it may be a day on which the safety of a crop and of a considerable part of the people's food supplies depend on harvest operations.  If it is a legal compulsory holiday, no man will go, but a Church holyday is a voluntary holiday and even the Church itself relaxes its laws in that respect.  I have heard it announced from the altar that harvesting work can be done on 15th August and can be done on Sunday, if the weather is fine, because the year has been bad.  The Church will always meet the case, but, if you make rigid State laws, you will tie yourself up in them.</P>
    <P>The Church holydays number ten, and the men, as I say, get these holydays already.  In the cities, the bank holidays number six and workers get six holidays, so, even if we took the motion as it is and made it compulsory, we are compelling the rural employer to give ten days' holidays over and above the annual holidays, whereas the city man is compelled to give six holidays over and above the annual holidays.</P>

      <P>If the Senator does not know them it is his own lookout. There are six bank holidays and ten Church holydays and if it were a matter of bank holidays with pay, I could understand the motion.  It would be quite consistent, because it would be more in harmony with what operates in the cities and towns, but to single out the Church holydays and to make them apply only to the rural community seems to me to be something which we ought not to do.  We are not so free, remember, even about the Church holydays in the city.  No employer in the city is compelled to give a Church holyday to his employees, although 90 or 99 per cent. of the men and women he employs may be Catholics and under an obligation to go to Mass on that day.  Unless they are civil servants and slip out the side door, they are expected to go to Mass in their own time, as a general rule.  But if we are to agree with Senator Burke and to insist that Church holydays be public holidays, will it apply to milkmen, bus drivers, bakers, and breadvan drivers, and, if not, why should it not?  If the food producer can be spared for ten days, surely the food distributor is not so essential that he cannot be.  Let us be consistent.  I am arguing now only from the point of view of consistency to show that this is not a motion to which one can say yes or no.  We are all in sympathy with its object, but I for one am not in sympathy with the method by which it is attempted to be brought about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Burke was very fortunate in being able to make his speech mainly by repeating bits of the Minister's speeches.  He quoted the Minister as saying that racketeers and others go round with silk hats.  I have seen silk hats in the country, too, but they were not on the farmers or farm labourers. Any time I saw them, when not at a hunt, they were on scare-crows.  He talked about the argument put up that farm workers do not need so many holidays because they live in the open air.  There are a great many people who do open-air work in the city, but who still get holidays.  I think we will have secured the object which Senator Burke and Senator Smyth have in <Col N="680" /> mind in putting forward this motion if we express our belief that the agricultural workers, farmers and labourers, are not paid a wage or given treatment commensurate with their importance to the nation.  If we express that opinion and are determined to improve the condition of the agricultural labourer, we shall have to begin higher up and make the condition of both the farmer and the agricultural labourer the object of our improvement. If we can make farming so profitable, so well conducted and so modernised that it would pay the farmer, then and not till then will it pay the labourer a wage which will induce him to remain in rural Ireland rather than to migrate or emigrate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this motion and I should like to say that it is not quite as innocent as it looks.  I believe it is an insidious effort to get in the thin end of the wedge in the matter of organising agricultural workers for the political ends of the Labour Party.  I think it would be much better for the Government and for the Labour organisers if they left the farmers and the agricultural employees to fix their own business and arrange their own terms on holidays and work between themselves without any outside interference.  The Labour organisers were never able to make any headway amongst the agricultural workers and they now want the Government to come to their assistance and enact a law, the main object of which is propaganda for the Labour Party.  If they succeed in getting such a law enacted they will be able to say to these agricultural workers: &ldquo;Look at what you have got by organising.&rdquo;  I think it is a very insidious scheme by the Labour Party, which would break up the friendly relations which exist, and have always existed, between the farmers and their agricultural workers.  Of course something could be said for a week's holiday with pay for the agricultural worker, but nothing could be said in favour of stopping all work on the farm on Catholic holydays.  Cows will have to be milked and cattle will have to be fed and looked after on Catholic <Col N="681" /> holydays as well as on every other day of the week.  I do not believe Senator Smyth, when he said that they are not paid for.  As far as I know Catholic holydays are paid for whether the men work or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the objections to giving a week's holiday with pay, as Senator Baxter pointed out, there is a very big percentage of farmers who employ only one man. Those farmers cannot spare these men. If a farmer who employs one man lets him off for a week, the whole work of the farm falls on himself because he cannot get a substitute very easily.  I think there are about 90,000 small farmers in this country who each employ only one man.  We must consider the hardship that would be imposed on these farmers if they had to let their men off for a week.  I think there are somewhere about 130,000 agricultural workers in the country, of whom about 40,000 or 45,000 are boarded and fed by the farmer.  These people are regarded as members of the farmer's family.  They eat the same food as the farmer and in 95 per cent. of cases eat at the same table. They play the same games as the farmer and his sons and join in the family Rosary at night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be a terrible disaster if, for the sake of political action by the Labour Party, these good relations were upset.  This motion is going to upset these good relations, and, as Father Hayes said at Copsewood, we should all do everything in our power to counteract the evil teaching which would create class warfare between the farmer and his agricultural worker.  Senator Baxter again pointed out that there was no connection whatever between the conditions of employment on the farm and in the factory.  The worker in the factory is paid for the hours he works, while the farmer's man is paid for every day he presents himself.  There are a good many occasions on which these men cannot work owing to wet weather, but nevertheless, when the week is finished the agricultural worker gets <Col N="682" /> his week's wages without any deduction.</P>
    <P>If the number of hours for which a farmer paid his men for doing no work were counted up for a year it would not be one week's pay without work but 15 or 16 weeks' pay without work that the agricultural workers would be receiving.  This motion is probably the thin end of the wedge.  It is going to cut down production.  We in County Dublin, through the action of the Labour Party, are observing a 50-hour week.  Our men only work for 50 hours per week and they have to have a week's holidays and a half-holiday on Saturdays.  Any practical man who knows anything about farming will appreciate that Saturday afternoon is the busiest time for a farmer, particularly in the winter months when he is stall-feeding cattle. In a number of cases this weekly half-holiday has resulted in cutting down stall-feeding in County Dublin.  I could say a good deal more, but I do not want to say anything that might affect the good relations existing between myself and the Labour Senators in this House, but I hope the Minister will turn down this proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is one that I cannot possibly support, although I have the greatest sympathy with the whole labouring community. I feel that the motion has not been well thought out: I feel that the agricultural community as a whole has not been considered from the point of view of the small farmer who employs no labour or from the point of view of the farmer who employs one, two or three men, right up to the men who employ from 15 to 20 men.  Since legislation was enacted controlling the life and the work of the labourer and the farmer there has been a rift which we have failed to mend.  The present motion, I feel, if adopted, will cause a greater rift. It is bad enough as it is.  Twelve years ago, before there was a fixed minimum wage or fixed hours, the farmers who employed from two to four men, which is the majority of the farmers, worked with their labourers harmoniously.  The men went to their religious duties. <Col N="683" /> They did not take a half-day or a few hours off.  They went to the local race meeting, the point-to-point.  There was never any bickering on a Sunday morning or on a Sunday evening as to who would milk the cows.  The farmer's wife had not to go out and milk them, as has happened during the past nine years since we legislated as to how many hours the labourer would work and as to the minimum wage.  The effect of the minimum wage is that the slacker gets as much as the very best man, and eventually the best man gives up because, he says, &ldquo;Why should I work hard when that other man is getting as much as I get?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not wish to dwell on this matter at great length.  You could spend hours talking about the relations between the farmer and the labourer. As I have said, twelve years ago the relations were harmonious, and it was only a very exceptional case that a man was cut in his wages because he took a day off to go to a race meeting.  I never heard of it.  When the labourer's wife or some member of his family was sick he went home.  He got the horse to plough his plot.  In a good many cases they got a week's holiday.  There was not this hard and fast rule.  In the circumstances that existed, the farmer was as badly off as the labourer but the conditions were better than they have been since we began to legislate to make the labourer better off.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Senator Counihan that the motion was put down for propaganda purposes or for the purpose of organising labour, but I do believe that it was not thought out well enough.  I believe that the less interference there is between the farmer and the labourer the better.  If this matter is to be dealt with, it should be done through trade unionism, not by legislation.  We cannot legislate as to how the farm should be run, as to when the farmer can give his labourer a day off and when he can take a day off himself.  If we were to legislate for all these matters, we should arrange that the small farmer's wife should not have to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning and work until late at night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> I do not know the position in Kildare and Dublin, but I do know the position in the South of Ireland and I know that harmonious relations always existed between the farmers and the labourers there until we started to legislate.  We caused the rift and we continue the rift and we will make it bigger by further legislation, so much so that the labouring man feels that he will work only five hours if he can, that he will do as little as he can, and will get paid as much as the man who produces more.</P>
    <P>As to the appeal to the Minister to make the farmer better off, he cannot make the farmer better off if in rural Ireland they cannot work harmoniously together and produce a little more than we are producing at the moment. Again I appeal to Senators Smyth and Burke to consider the matter and to withdraw the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess that it is with a little diffidence that I approach this motion.  For some 20 years, in the Parliament of this country, I have tried as best I could to advocate the cause of the agricultural worker.  I never thought there was any slur on me or the men who worked for me in describing ourselves as agricultural workers.  I have been 60 years an agricultural worker or an agricultural labourer and never thought it a slight to be so described.  For 20 years I have endeavoured, as far as in me lay, to advocate the cause of the agricultural worker, to direct attention to the inadequacy of his pay and to his conditions generally and to ask for an improvement. Happily, in the last year or two, his conditions have been a little improved in the matter of pay, but they have not yet been brought up to the level of his fellow-workers in industrial occupations.  I hope eventually they will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been at one with the Minister in resenting the term unskilled workers being applied to agricultural labourers. I believe we are the most intelligent workers in the State or in any other State, that we are the most skilled of all workers.  As proof of that, our agricultural workers who emigrate to Britain and even to the City of Dublin <Col N="685" /> very quickly obtain positions of trust. The ordinary agricultural worker is quicker than the city worker in picking up a new job.</P>
    <P>I have a certain diffidence in approaching the motion, because I have always advocated the cause of the agricultural worker, <i>vis-á-vis</i>, the industrial worker and if I now take objection to this motion, it is not because I am not interested in the agricultural worker, it is because I believe the motion will be injurious to the employer and the worker.  There has been in agriculture a condition not generally obtaining in industrial pursuits, a condition of <i>laissez faire</i>, on the part of the men as well as on the part of the farmers.  I never bother and neither does any other employer, once my cows are milked in the morning, if the man spends an extra half-hour at his breakfast.  Nobody bothers. If he goes into a neighbour's house during a shower of rain and waits half-an-hour after the shower is over, I do not resent it.  Senator O'Farrell knows that as well as I do.</P>
    <P>I have always been an agricultural worker.  I have worked in this country and in other countries as a very hard-working agricultural labourer, as distinct from a farmer.  Recently a Canadian friend came to visit me. Originally he was a gentleman farmer, a man who did not want to soil his hands too much, and he got broke because he was rather too decent to his men.  He emigrated to Canada and came back three years ago.  He went to his own home to find out were there any of the men who had worked for him still there.  There were a few and they sat around him for an hour and a half discussing various things, the conditions of the agricultural worker here and the conditions of the agricultural worker in Canada, the big wage he got in Canada and the small wage he got here.  Finally, he said to the men, &ldquo;After all, this is the best country in the world.&rdquo;&ldquo;How do you say that, sir.&rdquo;  one of them asked, &ldquo;considering the dollars they get in Canada?&rdquo;&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but this is the only country that I know of where some poor fool of a farmer would pay you for <Col N="686" /> talking to me for one and a-half hours.&rdquo; I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House adjourned I was endeavouring to point out to the movers of the motion that the conditions as between agriculturists and industrialists are altogether different.  The conditions in agricultural life provide for a greater amount of freedom and, if you like, laxity in general conditions <i>vis-á-vis</i> conditions in industry.  Most of our people provide the Church holydays for their fellow-workers with pay.  There are a hundred and one things that I could mention which the agricultural workers have that industrial workers have not. If an agricultural worker wants a day off to go to a coursing match, to a race meeting or to a point-to-point meeting, he asks the farmer if he may have the day, and generally the farmer says that he can when the essential work that has to be done on a farm in the morning has been attended to.  In addition, if he wants a day off to attend to his agricultural plot he gets it.  That happens in 99 cases out of a 100.  You may have an odd black sheep in the farming community, as you have in every association, but, as I say, in 99 cases out of 100 the farmer tells him that he can have the day off and also that he can take the horses with him.</P>
      <P>As I have said, there are a hundred and one things&mdash;one can call them perquisites if one likes&mdash;which the agricultural worker has that the industrial worker has not.  There is no hard and fast rule in agriculture so far as the workers are concerned.  There is a spirit of give and take.  I would remind Senators that the give is not all on the one side either.  The farmer, if he is a decent man, and he generally is, gives his labourer all the time he wants when the essential work is done. He is not particular as to whether in certain circumstances a full day is worked or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to give the agricultural worker the credit that is due to him.  He plays the same game.  If the farmer is cutting corn and if the prospects for <Col N="687" /> the next day are not too rosy, I can say this that my men have come to me and said themselves that they would finish the job that night.  I have never asked a man to work extra hours if he did not want to, but what I have described has happened, and I emphasise again that that is the spirit in which work is done on a farm.  It is the good spirit of give and take as between the owner and his fellow-worker on the land.  I do not want to see that spirit extinguished.</P>
    <P>I want to give the movers of this motion every credit.  I believe they were sincere in bringing it forward, and I am quite satisfied that they had no political object in doing so.  I am sure they are just as desirous of helping the agricultural worker to achieve better conditions as I am, and I have been anxious to do that for the last 20 years.  I believe the movers of this motion are as anxious as I am to achieve better conditions for their workers, but if we make hard and fast legislative rules, both sides will come eventually to take it that they must be adhered to, there will be no give and take and we will do away with a lot of things that make life so happy in agricultural districts.</P>
    <P>I hope the mover will not press the motion to a division.  We all want to better the conditions for the agricultural worker and I hope we will succeed. The Minister&mdash;good luck to him &mdash;is as interested in that as any man in Ireland, and probably more so than most, and if we leave it to him a lot will be done.  In the meantime, whether we are owners of land or paid workers, we can do a lot to better the conditions.  We hope to see in the near future, a set of conditions whereby the agricultural worker will get the full wage the industrial worker gets, and more if possible, so that we may build up agriculture.  All of us, the farmer and the labourer in combination, must take such an interest in life in the country that we will combine in increasing production.  Let us not raise any issue that might endanger the happy relations that exist at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of the <Col N="688" /> motion.  This matter has been before the Louth County Committee of Agriculture and it was practically all farmers who were at the meeting.  The motion was rather wide and they walked cautiously and carefully, but said they were in favour of it.  Senator Baxter has paid me the tribute of saying I referred to the workers as &ldquo;my men&rdquo;.  I have been trying to live in such a way and not to recognise class in any way.  As a public representative, it would be my duty to see that the benefits the Land Acts gave to the farmers, and which created them independent in their own homes, may make every labouring boy enjoy the self-same measure of independence, both of his employer and of everyone else, as the farmer now has of the landlord.  In other words, they might meet on level terms socially and otherwise, on the basis of a fair return for the money given.</P>
      <P>I am perfectly pleased to hear that labourers get all the days they ask.  I am not satisfied that this State should permit the system to obtain where a worker must go hat in hand to ask his master for a holiday.  The law should be so implemented that he will have that as a right.</P>
      <P>Before the last war the Minister for Industry and Commerce put through a Bill for industrial holidays, giving one more kick to agriculture and creating the inferiority complex which remained all through the Fianna Fáil régime, and which never should have been permitted by the people.  We are the main industrialists and owners of the land of Ireland.  Arthur Griffith has bowed down and stated: &ldquo;The farmers have done their work so well, they should be left alone in enjoyment of the independence they have.&rdquo;  That independence was taken from us when we were not permitted to pay the same wages and give some relief to the agricultural community.  There are no playgrounds for them, no theatres, they have not the same assets or amenities as the industrial employees.  We are placed in an inferior position, more like slaves than white men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, through the good offices of the Minister, we have undone a <Col N="689" /> system under which, by order of Local Government some two or three years ago, no cottages were to be erected more than a mile and a-half from a church.  At that time, I lived more than a mile and a-half from a church and was anxious to give houses to some men, and they were quite pleased to take them.  This Minister wrote to us recently, that he would resume the right to do that, irrespective of the distance, as long as the site was correct. Amongst five to whom I offered them, one said he was not fully satisfied about coming permanently.  He was a young fellow about to be married, ideal in every sense of the word, but he was afraid that the life in front of him as an agricultural labourer would make him want to live as close as possible to a town, to get the work the town might provide.  Thousands have left the land in the last ten years in that way.  We should make the land workers as independent in their cottage homes as industrialists can make their workers, and it is the duty of the Government to do so.  We must not permit a class, from which the chief part of us have sprung down the years, to have to go and ask some one for a holiday.  We must give them an independence of soul in order to build the independent Ireland that Griffith desired.</P>
    <P>I see one difficulty where there is only one man employed on a farm, but difficulties were created to be overcome. Because there are farms with only one or two men employed, one cannot say the entire agricultural community should be denied the same rights as the industrialist.  Properly worked&mdash;as it was about to be after the Wyndham Act of 1903 and as Griffith was trying to lead it to, when he saw other things in the air&mdash;the country can employ everyone born on it in the last 20 years.  The spirit of the Government should be to do for agriculture here what has been done for it in Northern Ireland for a number of years.  Who will go to work for a farmer for 55/- a week when £4 10s. Od. is to be had in the nearby town?</P>
    <P>The terms of the motion may not be ideal, but they are worthy of the most <Col N="690" /> serious consideration of the Government. The importance of this debate is second to none, except finance. Every section of the community has been helped.  Is the living of the agricultural labourer to be for ever darkened, and is he to be the one individual in the State whose claims will not be dealt with?  The labourer has few amenities.  In Louth recently organisations have sprung up whose aims I look upon with admiration.  I think they are doing good work.  I refer to young farmers' clubs and the Federation of Rural Workers.  There is room for the two of them.  They should rule Ireland.  If they do not they will ruin themselves and ruin Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter spoke admirably of what is really lacking in rural Ireland. I have spoken on the same lines as this motion on other occasions and I commend it to the support of the Minister and the House.  As regards fears of what might happen, I have none.  I want to meet my men as they meet me, independent. Their homes are a credit to them and in nine cases out of ten there is nothing in them but happiness.</P>

      <P>I must ask the indulgence of the Seanad if I intervene at this stage, but I find myself constrained by other work calling me to leave before the conclusion of the debate.  There is other work waiting which I cannot afford to drop until to-morrow.  Otherwise, I would like to remain until this question was finally disposed of by the Seanad.  Let me say at once that I do not think it is expedient to deal with the proposal by legislation now, because if I were going to legislate at all, or going to ask Oireachtas Éireann to legislate, this is not what I would ask.  If I were going to ask Oireachtas Éireann to legislate, I would ask it to give a weekly half-holiday and seven days' annual leave.  I think they ought to get it.  But, you see, this is a democratic country and the majority of our fellow-countrymen may not agree with Senator Smyth there.  He has no right to seize the community by the throat to make them do that for those on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="691" /> I am doing one man's part to convince my neighbour that it is just and practicable if we go the right way about it, to make available for the agricultural worker the same amenities as are available to the industrialist and the industrial worker, who are living on the efforts of agriculturists. I know cases where there are two sons working, one of whom is an agricultural worker, a very highly skilled man who is getting 55/- weekly.  He works a 54-hour week and gets no half-holiday and no annual leave.  His brother works within a mile of him for 46½ hours, with a half-day each week, seven days' annual leave and £4 a week.  His entire occupation consists of rolling bags of flour to and fro across the floor.  Does any rational man or woman in this country believe that we can long maintain a situation in which a highly skilled worker gets 55/- a week for a 54-hour week, without a holiday or half-day, while his brother, doing common labouring work, gets £4 a week, annual holidays and a half-day?</P>
    <P>Somebody said to me recently that I was not giving due weight to the joys of rural life.  I replied that perhaps I was not, but that if I were asked to work a 54-hour week for 55/- I would fly from the land like a scalded cat.  I want to say quite deliberately that, unless we can change that, my advice to the agricultural worker would be to get off the land; that they are damn fools to stay there, when they could earn more money with the gifts or ability they have here or elsewhere. There may be some romantics amongst them who like the pure country air. This is a free country, thanks be to God, and just as I do not propose compulsion against farmers, so long as I am Minister for Agriculture, I propose to allow nobody to invoke compulsion against agricultural workers, except in so far as all are required to work for a living within the four corners of the criminal law.</P>
    <P>I want to say deliberately that, passionate as my interest in the agricultural industry is, and in the aim to make every farmer who gets a living on the land a comfortable man, I do not aim to make him rich.  I do not <Col N="692" /> believe any man living on the land and getting a living out of it will ever be rich in Ireland, but he may be a comfortable man.  The realisation of that objective would not be worth two straws to me if it were purchased at the price of leaving the agricultural worker in the lowest category of wages where he at present is.</P>
    <P>I want to say this, that it would be a great mistake, from my point of view, if those who claim to speak for the agricultural worker should attempt to hurry the pace faster than the machinery at present will permit it to go, because the only result of doing that will be to upset the applecart and make it impossible to achieve our objectives in the reasonably proximate future.</P>
    <P>When I was listening to the discussion to-day I sometimes felt that we were not really discussing this matter in an atmosphere of realism.  I have a great respect for what Senator Counihan says on any agricultural matter, but when he spoke to-day it seemed to me as if he envisaged riot and red revolution and the tearing up of laws. It even seemed to me that he felt that here was a dark conspiracy to prohibit the recitation of the family Rosary.  I cannot read into any proposal made here by Senator Smyth or Senator Burke any desperate assault upon the institutions of civilisation or upon the foundations of the Catholic Church. All I can find is a somewhat inadequate request for the increase of the non-existent amenities enjoyed by the agricultural labourer.  My fault with the Senators is that, if anything, they did not ask for enough.  It is an amazement to me to hear that there are employers on the land in Ireland who have refused to their workmen pay for a Church holiday in rural Ireland. I want to say quite deliberately that I have never met any such.  I have never known one.</P>
    <P>The point may be raised that some of the workers are non-Catholics and why should they be paid for not working on a Catholic Church holiday?  The answer is perfectly simple&mdash;because, whether we like it or not, this is a Catholic country and, on Catholic holidays, we do not work, and, on bank <Col N="693" /> holidays, we do.  As 95 per cent. of us are Catholics and will not work, whether they want us to or not, and think we are right not to, and to get paid for it, as I think we ought to be paid for it, living in the kind of society in which we live, ordinary convenience and the ordinary orderly relations that exist between us suggest that our non-Catholic fellow employers would, without legislation, without hullabaloo, without coercion or dragooning, fall in with their neighbours.</P>

      <P>That is my experience in any case.  I never heard a complaint of that kind before, so that, so far as the first half of the Senator's proposal is concerned, which so distressed Senator Counihan and Senator Baxter, I think we are all knocking at a non-existent door, a door which was taken off its hinges about 75 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the second half, the week's annual leave, I have lived most of my life in the County Mayo, God help us.  Very few of us run to employing anybody at all.  Most of my neighbours spend their time walking around looking for somebody to employ them, but an occasional one amongst them rises to employing one man, so that I speak with some authority, on the views of the man who has only one agricultural worker.  We have seen the deplorable picture painted here, of the position if that one labouring man were given a week's holiday and I think Senator Baxter said he could conceive of a man with 20 cows resolving that he would keep no more than five after one week's agony.  What does that fellow do if the labouring man gets measles?  If he gets a whitlow on his thumb what does he do?  Does he lie down on the kitchen floor and kick and scream, and say that life has become so intolerable that he will alter the whole basis of his economy, so long as farm labourers are subject to these inconvenient human ills?  He does what every other sane man does&mdash;goes down the road and hires his brother or cousin to come in for a week until the whitlow leaves the fellow's finger.  Is it so extraordinary that, one week in <Col N="694" /> 52, a farmer should ask his man to send in his brother or his cousin?  He has 51 weeks to prepare for it, and surely the man who employs one labouring man, unless he is universally hated in the barony, in the electoral division, will find somebody in the whole width of a countryside who will come in to do one week's work for him while he lets his agricultural worker off on seven days' leave.  He is quite entitled to employ his own agricultural worker, always provided he pays him time and a quarter for working overtime, so that really all the hubbub and desolation arises from the appalling proposal that a farmer if he employs one man, would be made liable for the expenditure of 13/6 per annum for rehiring his own hired man during his week's holiday, and paying him time and a quarter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, gracious, no, but remember that I am resisting a situation in which it is suggested to me that ruin and desolation are going to come down on the House, that the farmer is going to slaughter his cows, to empty his stables and abandon hope on account of this week's holiday.  The picture drawn for me by Senator Baxter was that the creamery industry stood in instant and desperate jeopardy.  As Deputy Madden said in the Dáil, &ldquo;bawns&rdquo; of cows would be disposed of overnight.  My mind went back with irresistible attraction to the debates which one may read with fascination in the British House of Lords when there was a proposal before that solemn body 150 years ago that the employment of children under 12 should be prohibited for periods longer than six hours at a time.  There were venerable peers thundering that the sunset of British industry was at last on the horizon and nothing awaited the mighty empire but ruin and desolation, if the labour that was necessary for the safe prosecution of this fundamental industrial activity of Great Britain was snatched from the benevolent employer's protecting hand. They actually went so far as to prohibit women working naked in the British coal mines and British industry <Col N="695" /> still survived, though nobody dreamed it could.</P>
      <P>When I am told that the whole creamery industry is going to collapse if we give agricultural workers one week's holidays per year, that the whole agricultural industry will be put in peril by any such proposition, I cannot feel that we are approaching this question in an atmosphere of realism.  Somebody else said that friendships would be snapped like nuts on November Eve, if workers in rural Ireland were given a statutory right to a week's holiday.  Thenceforth, farmers and agricultural labourers would scowl at one another on the road. I never found that it ruptured any friendship between myself and the men who worked for me that they should have their rights defined by statute as against me.  On the contrary, I find it extremely convenient.</P>
      <P>I am not so much married to this business of give and take, because my own experience is that, when you proceed to work out give and take for 52 weeks in the year, you find that it is astonishing how little the workman takes.  I suppose it is natural.  He does not want to acquire the reputation of being a continual &ldquo;asker&rdquo;, whereas the industrious and zealous employer, who likes to get the place cleaned up at night and to have everything in apple-pie order before the day is over, is not behindhand in suggesting it and no industrious worker will cavil over 20 minutes or half-an-hour to get the place cleaned up at night.  But let the worker come along at 20 minutes past five and say that everything is done and I think, as a general rule, he will find some buckets to clean or a plough-share to be shod or a barn to be swept. Personally I have a profound reluctance to see fellows trailing off 20 minutes before time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They rarely do, but very often they work 20 minutes' overtime and therefore I would sooner have some system whereby our respective rights are defined.  I do not give in to the popular occupation of proclaiming <Col N="696" /> that I am an agricultural labourer.  I am not.  I have been employing agricultural workers for 20 years and it is perfectly manifest and obvious that if I were asked to go out and do a day's work that the agricultural worker is expected to do and does, it would kill me.  But similarly if an agricultural worker came into my office and tried to do a day's work there he would be up in Grangegorman before very long. I employ agricultural workers and they, as a body, employ me if it gives anybody satisfaction to say so.  I would prefer to have our rights defined so that if a man wants to work a half an hour extra it can be chalked up and I will pay him.  There is no threat there or humiliation.  He is not humiliated and I am not humiliated.  If a shopkeeper is selling three yards of calico and there is a remnant of three and three-quarter yards I am not humiliated if I say to the woman will you take the extra three-quarters of a yard.  I am very glad to get rid of the remnant. Now on the other hand, if I break my leg in the yard just as the men are ready to go home I do not expect them to step over me and leave me where I am lying.  Common humanity would demand that they should stop, pick me up and carry me in just as I would carry them in.  I would not expect that they should carry me in and ask me for overtime.  That would not occur to either of us.  I do not think there is any embarrassment.  Where I ask for extra work I should pay for it.  If I do not want to pay for it then I do not want the result of the work and if the result of the work is not worth the pay to which the men are entitled then it is not worth doing at all and it should not be done.  I am not at all satisfied that a great evil here exists.  If we were all here prepared to sit down and resolve that this was the best of all possible worlds and that there is nothing whatever that we wish to change in it then I would think the hour had come to rouse up this Senate considerably.  I do not think there is any Senator who feels that all is well. I am not a Senator and certainly I do not.  I think it is dreadful, but I am bustling about the best I can and I think, between hopping and trotting, <Col N="697" /> that within the last six months we have laid the necessary and essential foundations.</P>
      <P>I was rather amused to hear two or three non-Labour Senators say that this motion has no political flavour. One of their Labour colleagues interjected and asked why should they not use it for political purposes.  Of course they should.  They think I am going to do this in any event and they want to be in the position to say that they made me do it.  They do not think I came down with the last shower.  If they did not think that I am going to do it they would be as quiet as mice. They are sitting in the same Cabinet with me and it is because they are perfectly certain that I am going to do this that they put down the motion.  I congratulate the Senators because they will get all the credit for having made me do it.  I will be busy and they will go around saying: &ldquo;We have him now and we will squeeze it out of him&rdquo;, and then when it is done they can say: &ldquo;I told you we would put behaviour on that fellow&rdquo;.  I deprecate the reluctance of committees of agriculture to say yea or nay to this proposal and the resources employed by them in order to avoid saying yea or nay, travelling all the way from marking my letter &ldquo;Read&rdquo; to drafting resolutions a mile long to which there is neither head nor tail and which said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo; to every proposition contained in it.  The only committee that answered me is Louth.  They said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  They were in agreement with the principle of holidays for farm workers but thought it should be left to employer and employee to arrange the period of holidays.  Wicklow decided to mark my letter &ldquo;Read&rdquo; and then decided not to submit any views but to leave the question in the hands of the Minister.  Waterford thought it better to leave the matter to be settled between the individual farmer and his worker.  Tipperary North Riding thought it undesirable to introduce a rigid system of statutory holidays with pay and thought the whole question should be left to the parties concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Offaly approved in principle of the grant of six days' annual holidays to be <Col N="698" /> arranged between employer and employee but thought that the proposal re half-holiday would seriously dislocate work on the farm, adversely effect output and would not be capable of being worked satisfactorily.  Mayo thought it undesirable to introduce legislation and suggested that the matter should be settled between employer and employee.  Longford approved of the suggestion of six days' annual holidays with pay to workers in regular employment.  Mark those words, &ldquo;Regular employment&rdquo;.  They considered that the cost of such a scheme should be recouped to the farmers by way of an increase in the agricultural grant.  They thought that the period or the time of year of annual holidays should be left to the employer and employee and they thought that the grant of a weekly half-holiday was impracticable. Kilkenny marked the letter &ldquo;read&rdquo; and expressed no views at all.  Cork considered there is no necessity for any interference between farmer and worker with regard to holidays and suggested that the parties concerned should amicably make their own arrangements.  I wonder how many farmers in Cork give their workers any holidays at all and what are the arrangements to which they refer.  County Clare thought the matter should be left as between the farmers and the workers themselves, and the rest of the county committees have not answered at all.  The county committees complained that they wanted to have their views heard before policy is determined.  I have challenged them.  I have asked a categorical question and I am still waiting for a categorical reply.  I have sent it by letter, then I sent a reminder and now by word of mouth, I wish to renew the invitation to give us the benefit of their views.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the time of the year at which he gets the annual week's holidays presents any insuperable difficulty.  There is no use presenting a picture of the corn ripening in the field and the whole population of agricultural workers dashing of to Strand-hill or Sandymount just because the corn is ripening in the field.  I have met bank clerks going on their summer <Col N="699" /> holidays in the month of January.  That is an extreme arrangement but a middle course can be employed.  Late September, a time of year when I always take my own holidays, after the ricks are thatched, would permit of some of them going.  There would be a period, I imagine, in June, while the crops are growing, when it would be possible to arrange for their holidays.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down, I want to outline to the Seanad and to the movers of this resolution the essential prerequisites to securing for the agricultural labourer in this country a standard of living worthy of the work he does.  So long as the agricultural worker works with the equipment and implements that his grandfather's grandfather was using, there is no use talking about getting an equitable wage for him.  I remember as a child that an agricultural worker got 12/- a week.  There has been a change in the value of money, admittedly, but remember that the man who is working behind two horses and a plough is using precisely the same agricultural implements as were being used 150 years ago.  I ask any industrial Senator, if his workers were using the same machines, the same equipment, that their grandfather's grandfather was using, what dividends could he pay and what wages could he pay? &mdash;Not one-fourth of what are at present being paid.</P>
    <P>The first essential to get for the agricultural workers of this country a reasonable wage is to equip him with the implements which will enable him to do that measure of work which it takes four or five men to do at the present time.  One man ploughing with a pair of horses and a plough is a good man to do a statute acre in a day.  One man ploughing with a tractor and a two-furrow plough, not to speak of a three-furrow plough, can do four acres in a day.  One man milking cows, if he is a good milker, will he milk more than six cows morning and evening and look after them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The same man equipped with a good milking machine and a conveyor to the dairy can milk two to <Col N="700" /> three times as many, if his work is organised.  We all know the difference between the man who harrows with a horse and the man who harrows with a tractor.  Senator Orpen and I inspected the difference between sowing seed broadcast and manure broadcast upon it and the same seed sown by a combined drill sowing seed and manure at the same time.  Four or five times the area was covered and the job was done three or four times as well.  What farmer in this country would dare to offer the man who finished four or five acres ploughing in a day the same wage as he would give to the man who, by his best exertions completed one?</P>
      <P>There are some dafties in this country who think that there is a kind of virtue if you work upon the land in being filthy dirty.  If you do not smell like a goat, they turn up their noses in scorn at you and say you never worked on the land.  If you are not prepared, in order to please their idea of what a farmer or farm worker should be, to have the dust of ages in your hair, they sneer at your pretensions to be an agricultural worker.  If your clothes are not greasy and disreputable, then you are a gentleman farmer. Why should people who work on the land require for respectability's sake to appear in public in rags and tatters and with the dirt of ages on their persons? I know it to be possible to do the work of Irish agriculture more efficiently than it has ever been done before and still to live as dignified and decent a life in that occupation as it is for any worker in any trade in Ireland. My aim is to make available, not only to the agricultural workers of this country, but to their wives as well, that standard of living and decency which every craftsman of their standing is entitled to demand of the community in which they live and, if we fail in that, then, so far as agriculture goes, we fail in everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How many Senators have adverted to this fact?  There are 645,000 persons engaged in agriculture in Ireland.  Of them 140,000 work for wages.  That is the body of persons who, taking a week's holiday, will throw the whole economy of Ireland into chaos and confusion. There is a problem that <Col N="701" /> nobody has referred to to-day.  Forty per cent. of those agricultural workers have no permanent employment.  They are temporarily employed by one farmer after another.  The provision of a week's holiday and a weekly half-holiday envisages the status of a man permanently employed.  One of our grievous problems in regard to the agricultural worker is that so great a number of our agricultural workers have not got that <i>sine qua non</i> of a decent life, permanent and assured employment. Some of them are temporarily employed by their own choice. They are men who go to work for the farmer for so many months and who elect to work at home for the balance of the year but too many of them are men who are temporarily employed because they cannot find jobs where permanent employment is available.  I want therefore first to place within the reach of the farmers of this country the equipment which will enable them to afford their employed labourers an opportunity of making the maximum use of the gifts God gave them and I intend to do it.  I have uttered this challenge to any branch of Muintir na Tíre that will accept it: that if they will constitute themselves a social unit and a co-operative society that I will put within their reach the credit to purchase any machinery their heart desires for the better working of the land of the parish which they represent; I will undertake to place at their disposal the entire resources of the Department of Agriculture, to reconstitute every acre of land in that parish under the schemes operated by the Department, to rebuild every farm building in the parish; the Department contributing substantially to that cost, the land improvement scheme to reconstitute the land, the poultry scheme to provide them with the wherewithal to increase the numbers of their poultry, to build pig sties and to help them to get pigs if they have not got them, and to place in permanent occupation in that parish an agricultural supervisor whose sole duty it will be to see that everybody living in that parish has made known to him the resources of which the Department is capable, and to provide, <Col N="702" /> whenever they are wanted, the educational facilities by way of cinematographic films, lectures, demonstrations or otherwise which the people living in that parish require.</P>
    <P>I see no way out to raise the standard of living of our people on the land other than by putting within their reach the means of raising it for themselves. I stake my existence in public life on the proposition that, given the opportunity, they will raise their own standard better and quicker than any Government or than any compulsion or direction from above will be able to raise it for them.  I propose in one parish in any case&mdash;and the challenge goes for every parish in Ireland as far as I am concerned&mdash;to ask them to cooperate with my Department to afford me the opportunity of demonstrating what my Department can do.</P>
    <P>The amount of knowledge, the accumulated wisdom, experience and skill that is available in the Department of Agriculture is a never-ending source of admiration and amazement to me.  Hitherto, it has stayed, as far as I can find out, in the Department, and no machinery seems to have been put to work to get it out to the people. I am going to have a very good shot in getting it out.  It is doing no good where it has accumulated in the archives in Upper Merrion Street.  Out it is going to go to reconstitute the face of the country.  I am going to have it brought to the people's homes, to be used by them on their holdings so that, out of the increasing surplus thus created, I have no doubt the farmers in this country will gladly pass on an equitable share to the workers who work for them.</P>
    <P>I want to say this that, much as I sympathise with the charm of the pastoral scene described by Senator Bennett, his Canadian friend was right. There is not anybody in Ireland who can afford nowadays to pay a workman for one-and-a-half hours' conversation with a neighbour.  I think that requires to be said.  If we are to look at agriculture as a way of life, consistent with a dignified and reasonable standard of living, then we have got to act like responsible people and, without surrendering our souls to materialism, at <Col N="703" /> least to go about our business with a modicum of efficiency.  I think that the farmers are entitled to say &ldquo;all this is desirable but quite impossible unless we have the certain knowledge that what we labour to produce can be disposed of profitably.&rdquo;  They have it now. For four years hence there is nothing that any competent farmer can produce off the land of Ireland that cannot be sold at a profit.  It is the first time, I think, that any Minister could say that in this Seanad, but it is true.  There is nothing that a competent farmer can produce off the land of Ireland for the next four years for which he has not got a certain and a profitable market, and if any farmer should fail to avail of it he has no one to blame but himself. I shall esteem it a favour if some of our friends on my right hand will quote me to that effect when next they are speaking at the cross-roads.</P>
    <P>I think that one of the greatest curses that ever fell on this country was the Act entitling people to enter into purchase agreements for labourers' cottages in rural Ireland.  It was done by a man who did not understand the country.  My people were in no small measure responsible for the erection of these cottages, and they stipulated that they should never be sold because they knew what they were meant for.  They were meant to provide decent living accommodation for agricultural workers, working in the area where the cottages were built.  They are now becoming the country villas of engine drivers, retired teachers and a whole cross section of deserving citizens in the enjoyment of modest incomes, the vast majority of whom have incomes far in excess of the small farmers who are required to subsidise the houses which those people are buying on the instalment plan.  I know bakers in receipt of £4 a week who are purchasing their cottages with an acre of land annexed thereto for 1/2 a week.  When they have got the cottages if they put them up for sale for £700 they will be killed in the rush.  They are at present buying them from the ratepayers in the County Roscommon at 1/2 a week, while agricultural workers are, in the majority, tenants in one room of these cottages <Col N="704" /> for which they pay from 5/- to 7/- a week.  That is a fact.  It was a crime the day on which that Act was passed. It makes dreadfully difficult the restoration of decent living conditions for agricultural workers because if cottages are to be provided under the same conditions as those that obtained under the old scheme then in another ten or 20 years you will have the same scandalous transactions again.  The cottages will be sold to butchers, bakers, and candle-stick-makers who will thereupon become landlords.  What is happening is that the real agricultural workers are tenement tenants in these cottages and are obliged to pay three times the total rent which the occupiers themselves are paying for the houses.</P>
    <P>The last thing that I want to say is this.  I believe that intangibles can be of great consequence in life.  An atmosphere has grown up in this country of looking on farmers as &ldquo;yobs&rdquo;, and on agricultural workers as being, by nature, hewers of wood and drawers of water to be left at the kitchen door and in no circumstances to go with their dirty boots about the house.  I think that we have begun to change that.  I think that we have begun to realise in this country that the farmers, and the men who work with them, carry the community on their backs.  I think that we have begun to realise in this country that while we bear no grudge against industrialists or professional people we expect them to remember that we support them all, and that in our presence they should at least uncover.  Gratitude is, of course, a rare virtue that we do not expect, but a due recognition of what is due we must exact.  It is very necessary that our people should come back to a realisation that every section of the community is entitled to its inalienable rights and that these will be protected, but that the means to that end are provided by those who live on the land; and that the day is gone when slippery-tongued frauds can sell the agricultural community the dummy that there is something patriotic in living on the land and allowing the racketeers to grind the blood out of their bodies to the strains of &ldquo;A Nation Once Again&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I went to Pallaskenry last Sunday <Col N="705" /> and there saw a splendid agricultural college, to which farmers' sons went to learn their craft; but I thought it strangely typical of the detestable and fraudulent attitude to agriculture which has grown up in this country, that the scientific teachers in that school are not recognised as teachers at all.  If they were secondary teachers in any diocesan college, they would have pensions, capitation grants, rights and privileges, all set out, immutable as the laws of the Medes and Persians. But if you should be such a fool, instead of taking a pass B.A., as to take a Baccalaureate of Agricultural Science, think yourself lucky if you are spoken of as a teacher at all.  You have no pension, no status, no recognition of your existence&mdash;&ldquo;Instructor&rdquo;, if you want to be polite: &ldquo;man about the place&rdquo;, if you want to speak the truth &mdash;that is the attitude.  I look forward with satisfaction to putting an end to that.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the day when we can prevail upon the agricultural community to want, and to get, the same standard of education as any other section of the community.  I want to see the agricultural worker having the same standard in the community as the apprenticed craftsman who is recognised by the masters of his trade to be a master craftsman.  I want farmers to have the appropriate qualifications to the responsibilities they undertake on the land.  I do not want every ten-acre farmer to be a Bachelor of Agricultural Science&mdash;it would be daft to hope he would, and inappropriate to ask him to be so&mdash;but he can have a secondary education in agriculture which will stand him in just as good stead as the secondary education will stand his brother in good stead when he goes to serve his apprenticeship in the local shop.</P>
    <P>Any man who wants to take responsibility for wide acres is a fool if he does not equip himself with the scientific knowledge to extract from the land the best it is capable of yielding and at the same time preserve the land and hand it on a little better than he got it, to whoever may be there.  That is the test of good agriculture, not the man who enriches himself by mining <Col N="706" /> his land, but the man who gets from his land a good living for himself and his family and, when his time comes to pass on his trust, leaves the subject thereof a little better than he got it.</P>
    <P>I do not think you can leave the agricultural worker dissociated from the whole problem of agriculture.  It is fantastic to conceive that agriculture as a whole can improve without the worker marching with it.  Yes, that is my purpose, to secure for the agricultural worker the same status and conditions as are enjoyed by the industrial worker who is protected by tariffs which the agricultural worker has to pay.  The time has gone when the Government, representing the people as a whole, have a right to bleed one section of the community in order to fatten the other.  If both sides share the benefits, then I am for as many benefits as our Government can get for our people; but there will be no more fatlings living on lean farmers.  If it means that all have got to come down to a medium rotundity, that is fair enough; but if one section of the community wants to be fat, we will be fat altogether or not at all.</P>
    <P>Do not let us end on a note that would suggest a grudging or a greedy spirit.  I believe there is nothing more remote from the agricultural community than that.  It is not that we grudge our successful neighbour his prosperity. Anyone living in rural Ireland and watching the returned Yank, shining from the top of his head to the sole of his foot, and showing his diamonds&mdash; or what he calls diamonds&mdash;will dream that his prosperity is grudged by the average countryman to his more fortunate brother.  But it is only when a farmer's life-blood is squeezed out of him, in order to provide villas and motor cars and luxury, for exploiters who come from the far corners of the earth to suck that man's subsistence and then flit away when there is nothing more to suck, that you have resentment, cold and bitter, amongst our people for the rule of law that could permit it.</P>
    <P>It will never happen again.  In that assurance, I look forward with confidence to an equitable division of the reward we hope agriculture is going to have, not in the dim and distant future <Col N="707" /> but within the next four years.  For every step that agriculture rises, there is a solemn obligation, in justice, on the farmers who share in it, to pass on their full share to the men who work for them.  I do not doubt they will, and I will pass no laws to make them do it, because if they fail me in that, then I am a fool who was never fit for the position that I occupy.  But if they do not, then I suggest that I am vindicated in the belief that co-operation with the farmers is better than the compulsion that was born of the slave mind that first employed it.</P>

      <P>Senators have followed this debate with great interest. As has been stated from both sides of the House the question is a difficult one.  For that reason, I think it should not be settled in an offhand way, seeing that there are issues involved which bear on social questions, economic questions, and the relationship between employers and employees.  If the motion was passed in its present form which is admittedly rather loose, the question might not receive the attention it requires.  For that reason I hope it will not be pressed.  The Minister has stressed some of the difficulties that confront us.  Quite clearly the Minister is not inclined to accept the motion, and before we commit ourselves to it the Government, as well as the Minister, should have the opportunity of considering the different aspects more fully.  The Seanad has only touched the surface of the question.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to share the views of those who think that this motion deserves more consideration.  I have a feeling that if the House were to press it, it would be awkward even for the proposer as well as some of his colleagues.  This proposal seems to me to be utterly impracticable.  If it could not be arranged that there would be a substitute for a labourer who went on holidays, people in towns and cities would be considerably inconvenienced. I am sure that Senator Burke's colleague would find it annoying if left without milk for breakfast on Sundays. That is just one of the hardships that might occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> Another question that occurs to me is this: would the proposal include smallholders and small farmers?  Who would pay them while on annual leave?  If a smallholder was given annual leave with pay, or a half-holiday, who will pay him?  I have no doubt that everybody is in sympathy with the claims of the agricultural worker, but I am not inclined to accept the view that he is in the condition represented here to-day.  In comparison with other rural workers he is better off than the average worker.  The Minister may be aware of people working in yards or stores for £4 weekly, but there are people in rural Ireland who are not earning even 55/- a week.  There are employers with two labourers who themselves are not getting 55/- weekly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the fault of the employer, but the fault of the system which operates here.  Every section, from the top down, is being kept by the agricultural community.  When he has all overheads paid the agricultural employer has nothing left for himself. There is one other reason why I oppose this motion.  For years the agricultural community has been hampered and hindered as regards output and production by Government interference. I had hopes that that was at an end.  If there is a suggestion now that, as a substitute for compulsory tillage, we are going to have compulsory holidays, I do not think that will be an improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is admitted that the prosperity of the country depends on a prosperous agriculture.  That applies to-day in highly industrialised countries like America and Britain.  How much more would it apply here?  Last week there was talk in this House about increased production.  Is this the way to bring about increased production?  Have the sponsors of the motion considered the time that will be lost to production if the motion were adopted?  There is one way to improve the lot of the agricultural worker and it is clear that it can be improved, that is, by giving a better income and better standard to his employer.  The market is there now, we are told, but the market is not enough.  There must be greater <Col N="709" /> output per man-hour and that is the only way to get it.</P>
    <P>I come from the same county as the Minister&mdash;his neighbours are my neighbours.  It is not by any means a serious question in our part of the country, but I honestly believe, from the agricultural labourers I know, that there is no real demand for it.  I have never heard one of them talk about it or ask for it, and I doubt if they would be very grateful for getting it because the position is this, that if the farmer is compelled to give them a week's holiday in the year, he will give it, but, as I think any agricultural labourer will agree, he has more than a week's holiday with pay now.  I doubt very much, although I do not question the intentions or sincerity of the sponsors of this motion, if they are doing a service to the agricultural labourer by putting forward this suggestion.</P>
    <P>Whatever the Minister may have in mind with regard to the improvement of the position of these people&mdash;he appears to take a considerable interest in them, and, judging by the statements quoted by Senator Burke, he has taken them very much to his heart&mdash;it might be just as well to wait and see.  If the Minister has sense, he will not jeer, nor will anybody else, at the harmonious relations existing between the farmer and his worker.  They are things which should not be sold cheaply and with which nobody in this country should interfere, because the day you drive a wedge between the farmer and his workers, you are doing a serious injustice to this nation.  Allow the good relations which have always existed to continue and you are doing a good day's work for the farmers, for their workers and for the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I was unable to be present for the whole of this debate, but the motion before the House asks for at least one week's annual holiday with pay and leave of absence with pay on all Church holydays, through legislation.  I think that, if the House were to pass this motion, it would be doing one of the greatest disservices ever done with regard to Irish agriculture and the interest of the farmer and his workers.  Those of us <Col N="710" /> who know Irish life know that harmonious relations exist between the farmer and his worker and that there is always co-operation between them as to when they will take their holidays.</P>
      <P>It has been brought to my notice to-day that if there is a very wet season and if a particular Church holyday were a day favourable for making hay, on the basis of this proposal, not alone will the farmer be under an obligation to his employees, but it will be an offence for both the employer and the employee to engage in making that hay or saving the harvest on that day.  It is one of the many things in respect of which we should not propose legislation. There is always co-operation between the employer of labour and his employees, and particularly agricultural employees, and they arrange between themselves, in that old-fashioned Irish way, when they will take their holidays, and, if needs be, to work after hours in the national interest.  I did not intend to contribute to this debate on the relations between workers and employers because the position is quite clear to every person who comes from rural Ireland that, if we are to recommend to the Government the passing of legislation to make it compulsory on the farmer to give his worker a holiday on a particular day, so that it will be unlawful to do on that day any of the necessary things&mdash;milking the cows, delivering the milk or any of the other things which must be done &mdash;we are going too far, to say the very least of it.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister did not continue to grace the House with his presence so that he might hear some of the replies to his address.  There is no man who has entered the political life, and particularly the agricultural life, of this country in recent years who has done more to drive a wedge between the farmer and the agricultural worker than the Minister.  We have had statements from him in recent weeks deploring the remuneration which agricultural workers receive and telling our farmers that they are not adopting the correct method of farming, that they must become more mechanised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does that mean?  If we are to <Col N="711" /> go in for the mechanisation of farming, it means one thing&mdash;the more machinery you employ, the less labour you employ, and the less labour you employ, the less urgent becomes this question of holidays for agricultural workers.  When I was quite a young boy, more years ago now than I should care to admit, a period of a day and a half was allocated in my particular trade to the making of a panelled door.  Three quarters of an hour is now allocated to that job in the most up-to-date workshops in this or any other city.  It means that fewer craftsmen are employed and if we are to have this mechanisation, this slaughter of horses which the Minister proposes to carry out, it means that there must be fewer agricultural workers employed to give the same production.  Otherwise the Minister's advice is nullified.</P>
    <P>He also protests about our cottage purchase scheme and he told us here that bakers, plumbers, carpenters, and other tradesmen, as a result of this scheme being put into operation, were in a position to purchase cottages erected for the agricultural workers.  I am surprised at the Minister making a statement of that kind because the least I would expect from a man occupying his most important position is that he should know what the definition of an agricultural worker is.  The definition of an agricultural worker is any person who is engaged at any trade or handicraft, provided he does not employ anybody other than members of his own family.</P>

      <P>The Minister went up this &ldquo;bóithrín&rdquo; of tariffs and displayed his opposition to the policy and <Col N="713" /> writings of Arthur Griffith on which Sinn Féin was founded.  I have sympathy with the proposal here in this resolution but the Minister was so opposed to this policy in the past that we could not expect much less from him than that he should oppose this policy to-day.

If we balance one against the other, both arms, the industrial and the agricultural, we must discuss both.  We were told by Arthur Griffith, whose writings brought us all into the Sinn Féin movement, that we must build up our agriculture and also build up secondary industries. That is the gospel for which we on this side of the House stand but, of course, it would be too much to expect that Mr. Dillon would accept that policy.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to suggest to the House that before we come to a serious decision on a very important matter of this kind that we should first consider whether the agricultural community of this country can afford to give their employees one week's annual holidays and leave of absence on Church holydays.  I do not know why there is a difference of wording there.  We must examine the whole agricultural output.  We must see whether agricultural output is such as will enable the employers of labour to give holidays and give the other demands set forth on this motion.  I have tried to put before the House my view that, regardless of the fact whether we examine this matter, we are not competent to do so.  We would have to go into Committee and examine the output of each agricultural farm, particularly in the creamery districts. We have very mixed farming in the country.  Various proposals were put forward in this House from time to time by people representing various aspects of farming and we know from these that we cannot have a hard and fast rule in a matter of this kind.  If we are going to pass this resolution here this evening what is going to be the position of the people supplying our creameries in Kerry and Limerick and what is going to happen the supplies of butter for our towns and cities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is going to be the position if every farmer engaged in production in this country is compelled by legislation to give, at a particular time of the year, holidays to his employees and also to <Col N="715" /> give each Church holyday to every person employed by him.  Remember this, whether it is a Church holyday, Good Friday or Christmas Day, the cows have got to be milked and the milk has got to be delivered to the creamery.  If by legislation you compel the farmers to continue production and at the same time put them in the position that they have to substitute men for the employees who are on holidays, where are you going to get to?</P>
    <P>I know rural Ireland as well as most members of this House.  I know the good relations that exist between the farmers and their employees.  In my part of the country, it is quite usual for the farmer to take a week off in Salthill or Lisdoonvarna and when he comes back he always allows his worker off to do the same thing.  There is co-operation and that interest in their employment&mdash;it is not his&mdash;it is looked upon as theirs.  We are going to drive a wedge into the harmony that exists.  I would support this resolution wholeheartedly if it were held out as a suggestion to farmers that they should give holidays to each of their employees, but that is not the suggestion.  It is much more serious than that.  Two years ago we had a very bad harvest and the people of our towns and cities were organised to save the harvest.  How would it look if, in that particular period, as a result of legislation, the employees of the farmer were debarred from taking part in that national work, as they would be if this motion were passed?  I know there is sympathy, understanding and co-operation in rural Ireland to-day between the farmers and their labourers and it would be a very bad thing if we were to pass legislation or encourage the passing of legislation that would drive a wedge between the farmer and his labourers.</P>
    <P>I hope in the next week or two to have an opportunity to refer to one other matter that the Minister mentioned. I have been told that I should not travel up the same bóithrín, even though it may be surrounded with roses.  He indicated to the Seanad that because of some recent events the farmers of this country are now placed <Col N="716" /> in a position that they were never in before, that they are going to have for the next four years a guaranteed market.  Who ever suggested that that market was taken from them or should be taken from them?  I do not know whether I should continue on this line or not.  I would like to hold it over for another occasion when I hope we will have an opportunity of elaborating it but I would say that there is no farmer that I have met or no man in Ireland to-day who believes that statement of the Minister, who believes that the recent agreement has secured for the Irish farmer or the Irish industrialist something that was not there and could not be got without any negotiations or without any Cabinet meeting in London.</P>

      <P>I welcome any move which places the rural community in the same position and gives them the same advantages as are enjoyed by people living in urban areas.  I welcome the motion but I would like to put in a reservation.  While I welcome the motion and the idea of a week's annual holiday with pay, I am inclined to agree with Senator Hawkins that I do not like it being brought about by legislation.  I would prefer that we would go along in the old way and pay our workers on Church holydays and, when the position improves, that we would be able to arrange for an annual holiday with pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two things involved in an annual holiday with pay.  Some farmers may be in the fortunate position that they can adjust their farm programme so as to allow one man off for a week and another man off in a subsequent week.  With the small farmer, of course, it is very much more difficult.  I do think that we want to consider very carefully the impact that this annual holiday with pay will have on the rest of the community.  In the long run, the consumer will have to pay for it except in so far as economy in other directions can allow the cost of the final product to remain <Col N="717" /> as it is.  Probably, at first the farmer will have to stand the added cost but ultimately he will have to pass it on to the consumer.  That brings about a dangerous situation.  You can adjust the prices of foodstuffs that are consumed at home but the price levels of exports is to a large extent determined by others.  Our exports must remain profitable.  Otherwise we will be in a difficult position as regards imports.  I utter that word of warning because we are going to face a time, probably, of falling prices.  That is why I want a reservation on the subject of the introduction of a holiday with pay.  I feel that it is something that we should aim to achieve in the years to come but I am not altogether convinced that we should bring it in just now.  I do not believe that it is right to bring it in suddenly in a time of scarcity here and world scarcity and I do not believe it is wise to bring it in, in a period of falling prices.</P>
    <P>I want the idea of holidays with pay to be a success.  I do not want it jeopardised by other conditions that have no relation to the question of whether one can give holidays or one cannot.  I want the thing tried out and I want it to succeed.  I suggest that it is, possibly, unwise to do it immediately, and I certainly do not like it to be done by legislation.  I think that in the case of a new thing or, rather a much-wanted improvement, to apply it to the whole country would be very difficult.  It would be better for each production area to evolve its own method rather than have a uniform scheme for the whole country.</P>
    <P>In the part of the country that I come from, I think that holidays with pay would not be impossible.  Some of us do it already.  I can see that that would be very much more difficult in the dairying districts as they are set up to-day.  Possibly, alterations might make the proposal more feasible there. I would suggest, if it would meet with the approval of the proposer and the seconder of the motion, that, in the interim and to show at any rate that we farmers were anxious to put our workers on a basis similar to that <Col N="718" /> which those in industry enjoy, we might add a phrase to the motion saying that if the worker was not particularly anxious for holidays he might prefer to have an extra week's pay instead or, alternatively, that if some farmers are so circumstanced that they could not give the holiday, they would add a week's pay until such time as they could give the holiday.</P>
    <P>What I have suggested is not the same thing as the motion before us, but it might get us out of a difficulty. I feel that there are farms on which it would be exceedingly difficult to arrange matters so that every worker could be let off for one week in the year.  There are many areas where there is no additional labour available. I suggest that, possibly my alternative might be a way out of the difficulty.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear it said that there are regions in the country where the Church holydays are not given to the men, and that the men are not paid for Church holydays.  I have never found that.  In every county that I have been in it seems to me that they observe the Church holydays.  Somebody, of course, has to work on those days just as they have to work on Sundays. There is a sort of give and take about it, but the work is, naturally, cut down to a minimum.  As a farmer, I may say that all the Church holydays, except one, fit in with the farm programme. There is one which is sometimes a little awkward in a bad year, as has been pointed out, and that is the 15th August.  I have often seen men come in to work on that day.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I would urge that consideration should be given to this motion. Everything that we can do to put our agricultural operatives on a basis comparable to that of other workers should be done as soon as possible.  I feel that this problem may have to be regionalised. In certain areas certain courses of action may be possible.  In certain areas the problem may prove more difficult than in others, and, therefore, the problem must be studied according to the agricultural economy of the area.  Let it be made quite clear that we should try, as far as possible, to devise means of carrying out the two things suggested in this motion.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to rise at this late hour to intervene in the debate.  I was so carried away by the Minister's remarks that I had almost decided not to rise at all, but on further consideration of some of the things that were said here to-day and of the Minister's remarks I feel that it may not be a waste of time perhaps if I refer to some of the inconsistencies in the debate, as well as to some of the remarks made by the Minister himself.  I approve of this motion to give a week's holidays with pay to agricultural workers.  As a town dweller, I feel incompetent to express any opinion as to what the results of such a scheme would be on the community as a whole.  Having listened to the remarks made here to-day, there seems to be complete agreement that it is desirable to keep the personal relations between the farmer and his employee as strong as they always have been.  There seems to be complete agreement that there are a number of good employers who give their workers the Church holydays off with pay, and who also allow their workers to have a week's holidays in the year with pay.</P>
      <P>Like the Minister, I was struck by the air of unreality&mdash;having listened to a series of debates in this House on our economic position.  We have all been led to believe, and I think we agree, that agriculture is our basic industry. We have all been led to believe, and do believe, that on increased production from our basic industry depends our future prosperity.  On the other hand, we know well that we are faced to-day with the serious problem of emigration, and that the whole decline in our population over the last 60 years with the acute decline in the last ten years, has been borne entirely by the rural areas.  The towns of Ireland, and in particular the City of Dublin, have grown out of all proportion to the size of the country so that we have an unbalanced community, a top heavy community, with more than one quarter of our population living in one city alone, and far more than half the population living, under urban conditions, on the backs of the rural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Emigration to England and other countries is largely due to the unattractive <Col N="720" /> conditions in rural areas and there can be no increase in production until that trend is stopped.  It is illogical to try to prevent any legislation which might entice the rural community to stay in rural Ireland.  The real attraction in England and in the cities is not the city lights and amusements, but the often mistaken belief that there is employment there with some guarantee of continuity, with certain known and fixed hours, and rates of wages which include a week or a fortnight's holiday with pay, when the worker can return to his own part of the country.  Were those conditions not included, a great number of people would hesitate to leave the rural areas &mdash;if they knew they could not come home again at their employer's expense. That is an influencing factor in weighing up whether one will go abroad to seek employment or not.</P>
    <P>I have roughly calculated what one week's pay, £2 15s. Od., would mean over a year.  Would that extra 1/- a week which it represents mean a real difference in the cost of agricultural produce to the consumer in the city? If not, where is the argument which says that we must weigh up the effect of such holidays on the cost of agricultural produce?  Again, there is no suggestion that the holidays should be taken at a specified time, or that a man would be precluded from taking part in the harvest because of legislation which would compel him to have a holiday at a certain time.  Any suggestion of the kind is misleading the House.</P>
    <P>I would have preferred to see Senators come here prepared to say they believed the agricultural workers were entitled to their week's holiday. If we are not afraid to admit the facts, what is the difficulty about making it law?  The Minister's statement has left us in confusion.  The essence of his remarks was the building up of a sense of dignity and responsibility amongst the agricultural community and, as part of that building up process, he stressed the importance of a sense of security.  He said it does not in the slightest impair his relations with his employee, in other occupations, that he knows his rights by law, and that it <Col N="721" /> did not embitter those good relationships that have always existed between employer and employee.  Yet he refuses to accept the same principle, to achieve the sense of dignity and security he speaks of.  Again, at the end of his speech, he left us with an appeal to the farmers to share with their workers the prosperity which he promised them over the next few years. He left it to them not to fail in this, in other words, to provide the week's holiday with pay; and he as much as told us he would not accept this motion.  In opening, he told us he knew the Labour Party had pushed this motion because they knew he would accept it and they wanted to get all the kudos for the victory.  I am so confused by both points of view that I feel it is difficult to put the resolution at all.</P>
    <P>There is a sociological value in a week's holiday.  All sociologists who have surveyed the institutions which have built up England&mdash;one of the few Parliamentary democracies left in Europe to-day&mdash;have come to the conclusion that the real strengh of its free institutions is the freedom enjoyed by the average man, the family life and the family tradition.  Many of them have stressed, in their surveys, the tradition of the family holiday, a week in the year taken together, or a few days when a man can spend his time with his family.  I doubt if the agricultural wage of £2 15s. would allow the Irish agricultural worker to go to the equivalent of Margate or Brighton, but it would at least allow him to spend a few days with his family, on such excursions as he might desire, and he would look forward to that in the course of the year.  I would be delighted to see the industrialist who would have the courage to say here that the workers are not entitled to a week's holidays.  Many farmers have agreed with the principle, but no one has the courage to say so.  If they are so entitled, I cannot understand why it should be such a bogey that the extra 1/- a week prevents it being made law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODwyer" hpid="Mr. O'Dwyer Mr. O'Dwyer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has dealt very fairly with this Resolution in a proper spirit.  We are all agreed that <Col N="722" /> there is a good case for it and also for a weekly half-holiday, if it would really change the lot of the agricultural workers.  While there is an unanswerable argument for putting them in the same position as their brothers in the town, we must face the realities.  There is a great difference between urban and rural conditions of employment.  The city workers generally work for big firms or wealthy shopkeepers, people who have plenty of capital and who can pass the cost on to others.  The farmer generally cannot pass on the extra cost to the customer.</P>
      <P>On large farms, where machinery is employed, it is an easy matter to pay a man a very good wage comparable with industry and give him all the amenities of holidays and so on, but on a small farm the employed worker is working for a man scarcely better off than himself, a man who has to keep his own children working on the land without any wages.  That is the great difficulty and I agree with the Minister that it would not be well to hurry this matter.  While agreeing that holidays will come in the course of time, this is not the time to hurry them.  The danger is that, if you impose by law a weekly half-holiday and the other holidays proposed in the motion, you will create great additional unemployment, because those small farmers who are almost as poor as the workers themselves will be inclined to do with less labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our part of the country, Limerick and part of Tipperary, the dairying districts, have been the greatest employers of labour, more so than the tillage districts, and I know that for years back the tendency has been to let go dairy cows and to turn the land into grazing.  The tillage policy for the past five or six years has changed that, but, with the disappearance of the tillage regulations in a year or two, the same danger will arise.  If we impose additional conditions on the employment of labour, the danger, as I say, is &mdash;and it is well that we should face it &mdash;that we will create wholesale unemployment. It will be remembered that, when some years ago, the former Minister for Industry and Commerce brought in the Bill to give holidays with pay in the towns, he explained <Col N="723" /> that he could not extend it to agriculture because of the overwhelming number of small holdings.  That difficulty is there to-day.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in the Minister's hopes of improving conditions through the use of machinery to such an extent that these holidays and other advantages may accrue to the agricultural worker in a short time, but there is a limit to the employment of machinery.  On large farms, without doubt, machinery can be used to an almost unlimited extent, but, on the smaller farms, there is a limit.  In our particular district, the co-operative society purchased machinery during the emergency and it certainly did a great deal of work in the matter of production. It would have been impossible to produce one quarter of the crops in that locality without the employment of this machinery.  But that machinery will probably be dispensed with next year.</P>
    <P>There is no means that I can see by which that machinery can be used on the ordinary farm of 40 or 50 acres. Machinery must be employed for milking cows on all the farms of that size, but here again is a problem because the employment of machinery on these farms will automatically cut out much more than half the workers at present employed.  We have to face that difficulty.  It is a very difficult problem.  We are all agreed that it would be a very good thing that anything which could be done for the agricultural worker should be done if only to keep him on the land but we must be aware lest we take any rash step, and instead, drive them from the land, by reducing their employment.</P>
    <P>I might point out that there are many other ways of improving the condition of agricultural workers.  The trouble with these workers is that they have only sporadic employment.  They have to depend on work on the roads and public schemes for a living more than on the land and I think it would be a good policy if industries were started all over the country, because, in these circumstances, some members of a family might be employed in the local factory, while others worked on <Col N="724" /> the land.  I notice that, wherever there is a local industry, it makes for an improvement in the living conditions of the workers for miles around.  In addition, there are many industries which could be encouraged for the benefit of these workers, cottage industries such as fowl raising and pig rearing. The rural worker generally has a cottage and an acre of land, and, with that acre of land properly employed and with these cottage industries, his condition could be vastly improved and he would be enabled to secure an income independent altogether of his outside labour.  There is no reason why every agricultural worker should not have a cow and the same facilities for purchasing a cow as exist in the case of farmers.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the cottage purchase scheme and to the great harm which the previous Government did by introducing that scheme.  I was very interested in cottage purchase at the time, and, in justice to the late Government, I should like to say that the reason they brought in that Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The reason that cottage purchase Bill was brought in was that the Government of the time felt that it was right that the agricultural worker should have some claim to his home and acre of ground and the same feeling of possession as the farmer under the Land Purchase Acts.  That was the reason for bringing in that Act which we find is being abused to-day. I agree with the Minister that it is well not to rush this matter because there is a danger that to do so might do more harm than good, but it is quite possible that the matter may be settled between bodies representing both workers and farmers.  If that were possible, it would be much better, but, in the present situation, until such time as <Col N="725" /> there is an improvement in agricultural conditions generally and until such time as we can see our way more clearly, it would be well not to press the matter unduly.  I suggest to the mover of the motion that, having got the opinion of the House&mdash;and I assure him that we are all very sympathetic indeed with the idea behind the motion &mdash;it would be well if he withdrew the motion for the present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a townsman, I do not intend to say much on this motion. I do not know anything about agriculture, but I should like to comment on the inconsistency of the Minister's statements and the hypocrisy of much that has been said here this evening. The Minister opened by saying that this was a free country and that there should be freedom to negotiate conditions of work as between employee and employer; but the fact is, as many of us in industry appreciate, that, prior to the introduction of the 1936 Holidays Act, the number of industrial workers getting any kind of holidays with pay was comparatively small and that until that legislation was brought in, nothing was done about it.  The unions were not in a position to force the pace and get these holidays.  The Minister says now that it is better to rectify the position between the employer and employee.  We have had nothing here to-night from the Minister and the people who spoke against the motion but sympathy for the farm worker.  The worker generally gets plenty of sympathy but does not get much assistance, except what assistance he secures for himself and I feel that the problem of giving holidays with pay in agriculture is just the same problem as existed before industry generally got holidays with pay and it is no argument to say that the matter will be settled in the near future.  This matter, I believe, will not be settled, unless legislation is brought in to compel farmers to give these holidays with pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to expose the hypocrisy in many of the statements here to-night about our being all in sympathy with the farm labourer&mdash;the most degraded worker in the country.  It has come to <Col N="726" /> be accepted that he must, of necessity, be the lowest paid worker and that has been the mentality in this country for a long number of years&mdash;that the farm labourer, the hardest worked man, and, as the Minister said, one of the most skilled men, must of necessity be a slave, the lowest paid and the hardest worked of all workers.  That is what we are up against.</P>
    <P>There is no use in talking about the farmer who employs one man.  The same position obtains in industry. There are plenty of employers employing only one man.  They have to give him his holidays, and, if they have work to do, they employ somebody else.  Much of agricultural employment is casual and there is always available surplus labour, if a man has to get holidays.  This is the first time I heard the Minister talk and I was very disappointed in him because he showed a certain inconsistency&mdash;I will not put it any more strongly.  He gave us a glowing picture of what a splendid fellow the farmer was, but he is not prepared to do anything about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to intervene only very briefly, because we are all anxious to see this motion concluded to-night. As there is less than one-third of the House present it seems to me that we would serve no useful purpose by prolonging the discussion.  May I, however, put to the House one consideration? Sooner or later this country must make up its mind to do something for the farm worker and put him on the same basis as every other worker or there will be no farm workers left very soon.  I remember in a part of the country with which I am very familiar when there were 16 agricultural workers employed on farms there. That was 40 years ago.  Not one farm labourer exists there to-day.  People there have gone out of pig production and people have got out of milch cows. They have got away from what was the traditional agricultural practice of the district for the reason that there is nobody to do the work.  I think the Minister made the case very clear that there is no hope of maintaining the traditional agricultural policy of this country if the farm labourer is <Col N="727" /> expected to work seven days a week of 54 hours for a wage of 55/- while his brother in a garage round the corner can get £4 for a 44-hour week.</P>
      <P>The people are not going to remain in rural Ireland under those conditions and we have got to make up our minds sooner or later that what is proposed in this motion will be accepted as part of our national policy.  If we do not agriculture is threatened with extinction, that is, the agricultural tradition with which we are familiar.  A number of people raised the objection that if you introduce legislation you are going to destroy the harmony that exists between farmer and worker, but this cry has been raised over a period of 100 years whenever anybody proposed to do anything for the submerged classes.  Many of us remember the introduction of the Health Act in 1911 when fashionable ladies in Dublin refused to be stamp-lickers for Lloyd George.  Their real objection, of course was that they did not want to pay insurance for their domestic servants. Now they are prepared to pay domestic servants £4 per week and they cannot get them.  This thing brings its own punishment and if we are wise we will get away from all this humbugging about the calamities that the legislative proposal outlined here will bring on rural life.  This legislation has got to come and I have no doubt that it will come very rapidly. I do not intend to deal with the many problems that have been posed here by those who are expressing sympathy with the agricultural worker whilst strenuously opposing any attempt to improve his conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subject is too wide.  Things like the cottage purchase scheme were mentioned here, but they have no bearing whatever on the motion, and I do not wish to discuss them.  What I do intend to do is to make an appeal to Senator Burke not to press this motion to a division.  He has got a good discussion on the matter.  He has got a sympathetic hearing and this is not the last day, I hope, on which the House will be sitting.  There will be other opportunities for discussing <Col N="728" /> this problem, probably on a wider basis, and I am making this appeal to him, particularly in view of the fact that the Minister has sent a circular to the committees of agriculture asking for guidance as to whether or not they are in favour of legislation dealing with these topics.  I gather from him that he has had replies from only five or six, or probably ten committees of agriculture and that he has sent a reminder to the committees that have not replied.  I assume, therefore, that sooner or later the Minister will have replies to his circular regarding these proposals and that when those replies are available he will enunciate Government policy in relation to these problems.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke will still have an opportunity of raising the matter again.  If he withdraws the motion now it will not prejudice him under any rules or orders from raising the matter again if he wishes to do so.  I would like to pass one further comment. While I do not think it will be described as objectionable for Senator Burke and the Labour Party to use this motion as a vehicle of propaganda, I think it is only fair to say that that is far from what is in Senator Burke's mind.  I know what is in Senator Burke's mind regarding this subject, for a number of years.  It should be remembered that he is a farmer and that he is making his appeal as a farmer and an employer.</P>

      <P>I am not satisfied.  When people criticise Senator Burke for doing propaganda on behalf of an organisation of agricultural workers, they mistake the whole position.

    <Col N="729" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can say what I have to say in not more than two minutes.  I do not want this debate to end without giving a personal view. I have been convinced, and I think my father and grandfather before me were convinced, that both from the humane, practical and economic point of view it is a good thing to provide a reasonable length of holiday for employees. I believe that the farming community will discover that as a matter of practical politics, apart altogether from the question of the relations between workers and farmers.  I believe that with a week's holiday generally adopted after a short time there would be no loss of production and there might even be increased production.  I do not think that this is one of the things which you can unduly force by immediate legislation, but it is a thing which you can seal, after you have got a certain distance, by legislation in order to make it work.  If, 20 years ago, you had introduced into industry such as there was here, a forced holiday, it is doubtful if it would have worked.  We had reached a stage in which we had at least a very considerable number of persons, commonly called employers, in favour of the principle, who wanted to work it and who were glad to see legislation, but who were in difficulties unless it could be made law.  I believe that before very long, with debates of this kind, with debates in the country, the matter being discussed, we will reach a stage in which a sufficient number of the members of the farming community will have accepted the principle to make it practicable to introduce legislation.  It will have to be quite different legislation from that which dealt with industry.  It will have to take into consideration special periods.  It may have to provide that the holidays may not be taken at certain times, but all these are details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the wise way would be for the Senator to withdraw the motion.  I agree with Senator Duffy that the debate may have done good.  There may have to be other debates but, before very long, we will definitely have the view accepted that this is something which must come and we <Col N="730" /> should endeavour to get a general feeling of consent and then it will not be something pushed from above but something people will do because they believe, first, that it is right and, secondly, that it has an economic value and will spring out of the whole community and farming generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the remarks made by Senator Duffy and other Senators, I do not propose to press this motion to a division.  I think that, under all the circumstances, it is better to withdraw it.  At the same time, I think the debate has been very useful and helpful, and that it has done good.  I believe the time will soon come when we will be able to get these better conditions for agricultural workers which have been advocated in this resolution.</P>
      <P>I would like, however, to reply very briefly to a few of the points raised by some Senators, because I think they misunderstood our intentions in this resolution to some extent.  Several Senators mentioned that they thought our proposals would bring about a great reduction in production.  I agree with Senator Douglas and other Senators that it would not, in reality, reduce production, and that eventually production would be increased, because many workers would be more enthusiastic about increasing production if they felt they were getting a fair deal.  At the moment, quite a number of agricultural workers get a week off, but without pay, to cut turf for themselves, so that, by giving them a week on pay, it would not mean any less work done, but would mean that they were getting £2 15s. Od. more.  Surely no person would seriously suggest that it would injure the agricultural industry if each man were to get £2 15s. Od. a year more, or 1/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Church holydays, I would like to make it clear that I am well aware that a good many farmers give their workers Church holydays with pay.  My point is that every worker should have it.  If it is the case that 80 or 90 per cent. of farm workers get Church holydays with pay, I am glad to hear it, and I hope it will <Col N="731" /> not be very long until 100 per cent. of them get it.  I have not heard complaints in my county, but I am told that in some other counties they do not get it.  The workers on the farm on which I work all get, and have got for a number of years, Church holydays with pay, but that does not mean that the cows are left unmilked as some Senators have suggested.  We take the work in turn.  Obviously, somebody has to do the absolutely essential work on Church holydays, as on Sundays. Our system is that a man who does not work at all on a Church holyday gets his day's pay, and the man who works for 2 hours gets paid for a day and a half.  In other words, he gets overtime rate for the work he does.  With regard to the six days' annual holiday, on our farm every worker gets that, and some of them spend it on cutting turf for their own use.  There is no friction about it.  They do not all want the days off at the one time.  Several Senators have suggested that our proposal would bring about inharmonious relations.  I think it would have the opposite effect.  If it were fully understood what were the respective rights on each side, it would bring about better relations.  I would like every worker to be independent, and not to have to beg for a few days' holidays.  On our farm there is no friction about it.  We discuss the matter to decide which days would suit each worker, and as far as possible we facilitate each other.  All the workers, moreover, are anxious to facilitate production on the farm, and no worker has ever asked to take a holiday at harvest time.  Some take it in June, some prefer to take three days at one time and three days at another time.  Everything works perfectly harmoniously.</P>
    <P>I would like, very briefly, to refer to one other matter with regard to which there was a little misunderstanding. Senator Séamus O'Farrell asked why do we not ask for exactly the same number of holidays as industrial workers get by way of annual holiday, and why do we ask for Church holydays instead of bank holidays.  There are ten Church holydays, which with six days' annual leave would make 16 days.  Many industrial <Col N="732" /> workers, I take it, get 12 days' annual leave and six bank holidays, that is, 18 days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Six days and six bank holidays.  They only get 12 days, by law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBurke" hpid="Mr. R.M. Burke Mr. R.M. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that. They are only legally entitled to 12 days, but some of them do get two weeks' annual leave.  If we get ten Church holydays and six ordinary days, that would be a total of only two days less than 18.  The ideal to aim at is that every worker should ultimately get at least 18 days' holidays a year, including either Church holydays or bank holidays.  I do not think that would be very unreasonable.</P>

      <P>The question was also asked: &ldquo;Who was to pay for holidays for the farmer with the small holding?&rdquo;  The obvious answer is that he should get a sufficient income from his land to enable him to take a week's holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="733" /> I think that most of the other points were answered by other speakers, and that there is no need for me to delay the House any longer, except to say once again, for the sake of emphasis, that I believe the motion has been well worth while, because the principal object of it was to try to persuade the majority of the people to give to agricultural workers as good conditions as urban workers get.  For generations they have been worse off.  I think the time has come now when everybody who wants a just and Christian social order should try to improve the conditions of agricultural workers.  As the Minister has said, however, this is a democratic country, and, therefore, we cannot bring about these reforms until the majority agree to them.  Therefore, those who believe in these reforms should keep on advocating them, and thus try to persuade the people who are still in opposition, so that the majority will eventually agree to them, and then they will become law.</P>
