      <P>As I think Senators are aware, we are expecting to receive from the Dáil this evening the Social Welfare (Reciprocal Arrangements) Bill, which was introduced in the Dáil yesterday and which, it is expected, will go through all stages in that House this evening.  I have received representations from the Minister for Social Services that the Bill is of extreme urgency and must be law, if possible, by the 5th July.  The Minister requests that in the circumstances the Seanad might be agreeable to let him have all the stages of the Bill this evening in the Seanad.  He tells me that the reason for the urgency is that the new British scheme of social insurance is coming into operation on that date and in order to preserve continuity of national health insurance for our nationals and save possible hardship, it is necessary that the Minister should be in a position to enter into new arrangements as from that date.  I understand that the House will be agreeable to meet the Minister's wishes in this respect and, accordingly, we are circulating a Supplementary Order Paper for the Bill and for an earlier signature motion which will be necessary.</P>

      <P>Baineann Alt a h-aon anseo le cáin ioncaim agus is é brí an Ailt seo an cháin ioncaim a mhéadú do réir réal sa phunt.  Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil aon mhaith anois a iarraidh ar an Aire cuimhniú ar faoiseamh éigin a thabhairt don phobal i geás cháin ioncaim.  Nuair a bhí an Dara Léamh ar siúl againn, do chuir roinnt Sheanadóirí i gcoinne an ráta cánach ioncaim.  Cuid de chairde an Aire, is iad ba threise a bhí ina choinne.</P>
      <P>Nuair a bhí an tAire ag caint, an lá deireannach, rinne sé aon tagairt amháin do cháin ioncaim&mdash;chomh maith agus is cuimhin liom&mdash;agus is é an tagairt é sin ná go raibh sé ag méadú an ráta de bhrí go raibh sé beartaithe ag an Aire Airgeadais a bhí ann roimhe. Is fíor é gur bheartaigh an tAire Airgeadais a bhí ann roimhe an cháin ioncaim a mhéadú réal i mbliana, ach na fátha a bhí aige leis an cháin ioncaim a mhéadú, níl siad ann anois, mar tá a lán de na scéimeanna a bhí beartaithe ag an Rialtas a bhí ann agus gur theastaigh an t-airgead breise ina gcóir, ar lár.  Cheapfadh duine nach bhfuil gá leis an mbreis cánach seo anois, mar gheall air sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>D'fhéadfadh an tAire a rá go bhfuil údar aige an bhreis airgid seo d'fháil. Má chruthaíonn sé go bhfuil an t-údar sin ann, ní bheimíd mí-shásta.  Dúirt cuid dá chairde go bhfuil aicme áirithe ann agus go bhfuil tuilleadh airgid le fáil uathu-san.  Má théann an tAire ar an slí sin, ní bheidh aon locht air. Mura maith leis an cháin ioncaim a laghdú go díreach, d'iarrfhainn air smaoineamh ar ar féidir leis faoiseamh a thabhairt do na daoine a bhfuil an faoiseamh ag teastáil&mdash;agus ag teastáil go géar&mdash;uathu.  Níl aon amhras nach bhfuil an costas maireachtála imithe i méid, agus níl aon mhaith bheith ag caint thairis sin.  Tá costas a lán de na riachtanaisí sa ghnáththeaghlach, imithe i méid.  Is é an rud a mholfainn don Aire ná smaoineamh ar na daoine ar féidir leo breis chánach d'íoc agus an bhreis sin a bhaint díobh.  Ach na daoine a bhfuil faoiseamh ag teastáil uathu, ba cheart go bhfaighdís é.  Is é an tslí a mholfainn don Aire an faoiseamh sin a thabhairt dóibh ná an liúntas pearsanta d'ardú agus go háirithe i gcásanna <Col N="331" /> daoine pósta, daoine a bhfuil muirín orthu.</P>
    <P>Rinne an tAire féin argóint ar a shon so go minic cheana.  Má bhí brí leis an argóint ag an am sin, is láidre go mór fós an argóint seo indiu, mar gheall ar an gcostas maireachtála a bheith imithe suas.  D'iarrfainn air cuimhniú, in éindigh leis an liúntas pearsanta a mhéadú, ar an mcladh a rinne an Seanadóir Ó Briain an lá deireannach.  Is é an rud é sin, go dtabharfadh sé a thuilleadh faoisimh mar gheall ar ioncam tuillte.  Ba cheart dó, i gcás ioncaim tuillte, breis a thabhairt do na daoine ar an slí sin, mar a mhínigh an Seanadóir Ó Briain. Is léir dúinn ar fad é, an fhaid atá ar dhaoine cáin icncaim d'íoc ar an mbealach atá siad á íoc, táimid ag cur cúl nó srian le méadú ioncaim náisiúnta. Ba mhaith liom go dtabharfadh an tAire aird speisialta ar na rudaí seo &mdash;an liúntas pearsanta a mhéadú&mdash; agus tuilleadh faoisimh a thabhairt do dhaoine mar gheall ar an ioncam tuillte.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a iarraidh air, freisin, tuilleadh faoisimh a thabhairt do dhaoine, agus is é an tslí a bhféadfad sé é a dhéanamh, ná faoiseamh a thabhairt tríd an liúntas le h-aghaidh lucht scoile a mhéadú.  Rinne ar tAire argóint ar a shon sin cheana; agus ní gá dhomsa ach é a lua arseo.</P>
    <P>I gcás na bpointí eile, má bhí brí leis na h-argóintí sin ins an am atá caite, is mó an bhrí atá leo faoi láthair, mar gheall ar an méadú aiá tagaithe ar gach costas agus go mór-mór ar chostaisí a bhaineann le gasúir scoile.</P>
    <P>Mar phointe dheireannach, ba mhaith liom iarraidh ar an Aire an bhféadfadh sé an liúntas linbh a mhéadú.  Tá 2s. 6d. don pháiste le fáil ag na daoine i gcásanna áirithe.  Níl acn amhras nach bhfuil an costas maidir le páistí imithe suas go mór agus ba cheart don Aire féachaint an féidir leis faciseamh a thabhairt do na dacine trí na liúntaisí leanaí le go mbeidh cúiteamh acu sna hathruithe atá tagaithe ar an gcostas maireachtála.  Nilimid in aghaidh ardú ar an gcáin ioncaim, má chruthaíonn sé go bhfuil sé riachtanach, ach ní mheasaim go bhfuil sé riachtanach, go mór mór mar gheall ar a oiread san de <Col N="332" /> na scéimeanna a bhí ar bun ag an Rialtas deiridh a bheith leagaithe ar lár.  Más féidir an chabhair sin a thabhairt do dhaoine, ba cheart go bhfaighidis é mar gheall ar an mí-ádh atá orthu de bharr costas maireachtála bheith imithe suas leis na 3 nó 4 mí atá caite.</P>

      <P>The Minister in presenting this proposal to increase income-tax to the House gave as one of his reasons or excuses that it was forecast by the former Minister in the Supplementary Budget of last November but in the statement presented to the House last night the Minister claimed to have made certain savings which he estimated as being in the region of £6,000,000.  He put before the House his reason for increasing income-tax to 7/-, which will bring him in £670,000 this year, and at the same time claimed that he has saved the taxpayers the sum of £6,000,000.  I find it hard to reconcile both statements.  It is true, of course, that the former Minister forecast that for the coming year income-tax would be increased but that was based on the assumption that the policy and programme that were then prepared would be put into operation. We see that programme curtailed in the many respects it has been curtailed, but it is not necessary to go into that at this stage.</P>

      <P>On the Second Reading I asked the Minister for more detailed information as to what the savings were to be under the various headings. We got a long, varied statement last night from the Minister but we got no positive declaration of policy, and the Minister tried to present the case to the House that the former Minister forecast that it would be necessary to increase income-tax in order to maintain services as they were then proposed to be maintained and extended.  But quite a number of these services have been put in abeyance since then.</P>

      <P>Like what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the saving of £85,000 on mineral exploration which the Minister referred to last night.  I am sure our friends on the Government Benches who, during the short and strenuous period of the election campaign, were so vocal in condemning the then Government for their lack of interest and lack of foresight in connection with our mineral resources, must have listened with mixed feelings to the Minister last night, in particular when he said that the exploration of the mineral resources of Avoca is now complete and that to develop them on the lines of the recommendations of those who carried out the research would entail expenditure in the region of £1,000,000; that he felt there was no private enterprise prepared to invest that £1,000,000 and that, as far as he and his Government were concerned, he would not recommend such expenditure. They are few, of course, but still they are there.  Those representatives that we have here of the Clann na Poblachta Party must have heard the glad tidings and must have taken it to heart.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question before the House, namely, income-tax, the Minister, in what one might describe as inexcusable form, presented to the House last night the proposition that, because the former Minister for Finance proposed to increase income-tax, he could not do otherwise.  At the same time, his suggestion to the House that by increasing income-tax and taking from those who pay income-tax an additional £670,000 a year, he is reducing the cost of living, or reducing taxation, is beyond my imagination and beyond the imagination of income-tax payers in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make two points in reference to this section.  In regard to the point that has been made by Senator Hawkins concerning the discontinuance of the grant for mineral exploration, I would like to recall to the House that last year we had a very extended discussion on this subject and I think the Senator will recall that I opposed the expenditure of public money on exploration of <Col N="334" /> mineral resources if, when the resources were discovered, they were to be exploited by private capitalists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>If this continues, we will be very far away from income-tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is made that there is no justification for imposing in this Finance Bill the additional 6d. by way of income-tax which was provided for in the Supplementary Budget last year.  Senator Hawkins made a point, which might be regarded perhaps as a good point, that the additional taxation should not be levied unless it were used in a particular way. I think he felt that some of us here were placed at a disadvantage because this expenditure was discontinued. Personally, I am in favour of the expenditure of such moneys as may be needed for the purpose of exploration, if that exploration is intended to enable the State to develop its resources in the interest of the community but I am opposed to the spending of public money on purposes of exploration which are merely going to facilitate the gentlemen who want to get in on the ground floor to make 6, 10 or 20 per cent. profit on the industry which springs from this exploration.</P>
      <P>I made that point last year in opposition to the Bill then promoted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the last Government.  I repeat it now.  I have not changed my mind about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I want to raise strictly in <Col N="335" /> relation to this section is the level at which surtax is imposed.  Sub-section (2) of Section 1 provides that surtax for the year beginning 6th April shall be charged in respect of the income of any individual the total of which from all sources exceeds £1,500.  I am satisfied that that is a reasonable proposal but I think the Minister should go further and provide a new method and a new rate of surtax where the income from all sources exceeds, let us say, £10,000 a year.  When I hear people complaining about the level at which taxation is imposed here on wealthy classes, I am utterly dumbfounded.  I read a statement the other day showing that a person in Great Britain having an income of £15,000 a year has left in his pocket, after the taxes are paid, the sum of £6,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>How much would he have here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>He has considerably more, at least double what he has in Great Britain.  Taxation here in respect of the poorer sections of the community is more pressing than in Great Britain but very much more favourable to those with very large incomes. We mentioned last night, incidentally, the fact that a person who buys his house, if it is subject to income-tax, pays taxation in respect of the property, not at the value of the property, but at that value inflated by 25 per cent.  It may be reasonable to increase for taxation purposes the valuation of property, if it is house property which was built, say, 50 years ago, but it is utterly unjust that the valuation of a house built in 1946 or 1947 should be increased by 25 per cent. for income-tax purposes.  I mentioned this point last year.  I made a plea for revision of this method of levying income-tax on property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quote two cases in a small town in County Dublin.  One was an old property, a house built 60 to 80 years ago, containing 12 rooms.  The poor law valuation was £4 10s. 0d.  Another house, constructed in 1942 or 1943, contained five rooms.  The poor law valuation was £20.  In both cases the valuation is increased by 25 per cent. for the <Col N="336" /> purpose of income-tax.  I consider that to be wholly wrong.  I cannot imagine any Minister for Finance justifying it, except as a temporary expedient.  It was a temporary expedient eight or ten years ago when first instituted.  The then Minister for Finance followed up that imposition by introducing a Valuation Bill but found that the Bill did not prove popular amongst the supporters of his Party.  The Bill was dropped and the expedient continued, to the detriment of very large numbers of people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the case that there are huge numbers of working-class people who, during the last three or four years particularly, have come under the income-tax code and who previously did not come under it.  I gave a calculation on the Finance Bill of last year showing where people had been brought in who previously were not income-tax payers&mdash;carpenters, plumbers, tradesmen of various kinds. Not only were a number of them brought in for the first time under the income-tax code in respect of their incomes, but they were also brought in in respect of the houses which they had to buy because there are no houses for letting.  There are thousands of shop assistants and clerks in this city who have to go to banks, loan societies and insurance societies&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>They did apply in the past and Senator Hearne knows, probably better than I do, that there are thousands of such people in this city who have bought their houses out of loans given to them by insurance societies, loan societies or banks.  They <Col N="338" /> have now become unwilling owners of house property and are very much affected by the income-tax which is levied on their property.  My suggestion is that a remission should be made in their cases, and that the amount which is lost to the Exchequer by making a remission should be recovered by increasing substantially the surtax on incomes of over, let us say, £4,000 or £5,000 a year.  That would be one way of getting some of the excess profits which were remitted under other sections of legislation over the last few years.</P>
      <P>I am not putting down an amendment to the section at this stage, and no other member of the Seanad has put down an amendment to it.  I did put down amendments last year.  I suggest that what is being said here on this occasion must be taken into account when the Finance Bill for next year is being framed.  I hope that the Minister for Finance will have regard to these hardships to which attention has been directed and to the other sources for increased revenue which I have just mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to take part in this debate on income-tax, but in view of the remarks made by the last two speakers it seems to me that if we are going to be perfectly honest about it we ought to face the facts.  The fact is that we are having a 7/- income-tax and that we are all sharing responsibility for it.  It was proposed by the late Government. Provision was made that, from 1st April, income-tax should be deducted at the rate of 7/- in the £.  That clearly indicated that the last Government were in favour of accepting this proposal.  We are supporting it with a considerable amount of reluctance. I think that to debate this question from the Party point of view is going to achieve very little.</P>

    <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with Senator Duffy with regard to the five-fourths impost.  I have opposed that on every possible occasion.  I am satisfied that not only is it a bad form of tax, but that it is peculiarly inequitable because it does not operate at all fairly.  The way it works out is fundamentally bad.  I never had the <Col N="339" /> slightest hope that either from the late Government or the present Government are we going to get any substantial change in the method of the collection of income-tax which, I think, is inequitable.  A Budget is always based on the existing method of taxation, and until some Minister is prepared to have a revision of the whole matter, a thing which I have again and again advocated, I see no hope of securing a remedy for that by way of amendment to a Finance Bill.  It is practically impossible to make changes, even though you convince the Minister, largely for the reason that before one Budget is finished the officials are virtually engaged in preparing the next Budget, and the figures on which a Budget is based are part of the income-tax law as it stands.  It would probably take a year or two to make any kind of amendments in the income-tax laws. Those amendments would have to be so devised that if you gave benefits in order to make the tax equitable in certain directions you would have to make it much heavier in other directions in order to get the same yield.</P>
    <P>I think that an income-tax of 7/- is too high, particularly on married people with incomes of £500 or £600 a year.  The first £100, after the marriage allowance, is paid at half-rate, and the rest is liable to the full rate of 7/-.  A friend of mine, part of whose business is to supervise returns for a very large company with a very large number of employees, a good many of whom received increases under an award not very long ago, told me he was amazed when he realised the number of them who now have to pay income-tax because of the increased pay they are receiving.  Even though people make demands for bigger increases, they find that, when they get them, they go in income-tax.  I do not think that any of these matters can be remedied in this Budget.  It is a matter that would require a great deal of consideration.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Hawkins that a Revaluation Bill would be the simple thing that he thinks.  Personally, although it may not be perfect in every respect, I think the time has come <Col N="340" /> when a revaluation of the City of Dublin will have to be faced.  You could not solve that problem by changing the five-fourths impost.  The present position is very inequitable.  It is particularly hard on business people.  Even where moderate improvements are carried out, there is a whole revaluation of the premises.  I would again urge on the Minister, as soon as he gets settled, to consider seriously the appointment of a committee which, I think, would have to meet for about a year, to take evidence from all sources with regard to what seem to be the inequities in the operation of income-tax.</P>

      <P>Income-tax is assessed by one section of the Department of the Revenue Commissioners, but the whole paraphernalia of the Department is used in collecting it.  Surtax is collected by an entirely different Department. I suggest that one big economy could be effected if income-tax and surtax were collected by the same section instead of having the duplication there is at present.  At present we have the system of collecting income-tax by collectors.  I think it would be very much more simple if the collection were undertaken by the inspectors or officials of the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to refer briefly to a number of the points which have been raised.  Senator Duffy raised a point about the person who has an investment income of £10,000 a year.  That is taxed to the extent of 50 per cent. of it.  If the Senator thinks that is not enough we can discuss it further on the appropriate section of the Bill on some other occasion.  Senator Hawkins astonished me by saying that revaluation was a simple matter.  It is so simple that a Bill that was introduced about 1938 or 1939 was left stewing for eight or nine years because the people in charge would not face up to the difficulties, and after four months' experience of office the present Government is expected to deal with that very difficult matter immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the suggestion made by Senator Duffy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care where the suggestion comes from.  I am stating the facts.  The Bill was brought in and it was left there because of the difficulty of carrying it out.  Senator Hawkins professes to be unable to reconcile the claim I make that taxation has been reduced with the fact that income-tax is increased.  He would be in the same difficulty suppose I cut the bill of £70,000,000 by £35,000,000 and put on one tax to raise a new £20,000. The Senator would still have the same difficulty.  I make the claim that taxation generally has been reduced.  There was a gap of £7,750,000, and that gap has been bridged by one tax of a major type bringing in £900,000 and by my taking advantage of the situation which my predecessor left in regard to the increase of sixpence in the rate of income-tax.  There is no doubt that the last Minister did forecast that. Speaking on the 15th October, 1947, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In next year's Budget it is proposed to raise the standard rate of income-tax by 6d. in the £ and a Resolution will now be introduced to make the increase effective as regards deductions of tax for the period from 6th April, 1948, until the date of the Budget.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Therefore, that increase was clearly outlined and I am accepting it.  I have been asked to give alleviation particularly to married people.  That is a kind of alleviation that I would like to give.  One of the difficulties that we have to face is that over a period in office Fianna Fáil so operated that the purchasing value of the £ declined from say 20/- when they came in in 1932.  My calculation of the decline used to be 10/- at the end of the war. Certain Fianna Fáil Deputies since they went into opposition have convinced me that the pound is now worth 8/-.  That is their present valuation. That works hard upon a number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A claim has been made with regard to personal allowances.  The remissions that we have made, more or less with subsistence in the background, have greatly altered to the detriment of the taxpayer.  We are all familiar with the view expressed in the phrase <Col N="342" /> that &ldquo;a fool can start a forest fire in five counties, but that it takes years to put it out.&rdquo;  We are dealing with the whole destruction caused over 16 years of government, and it is not possible to do the whole thing in four months.  We have taken people in a certain order of priority&mdash;widows and orphans, old age pensioners, and certain civil servants in the lower grades.  We will come up along the line and reach the personal allowance, which possibly affects the middle-class more than any other, but everything cannot be done in four months.</P>
    <P>As regards the cost of living and its effect on the married man, I would like to point out that the present rates of allowance for married people were fixed in the 1947 Budget, and there was no alleviation given to those people when it came to October although the pivot upon which the October Budget turned was that the cost of living had increased enormously.  Notwithstanding that, the old points in regard to allowances for married people were still allowed to remain.  At the moment I do not find it possible to do anything for those people.  The other argument, as far as I could understand it, was that my predecessor forecast a 6d. increase in income-tax in the light of certain projects that were going to be carried out and have been now dropped. I have queried this in Dáil Éireann and I have queried it here, and the only answer I got was that £85,000 was to be spent on mineral deposits.</P>

He said that colleagues of mine in the inter-Party Government would welcome a phrase used by me yesterday that the Avoca situation now reached a stage where it could be developed.  I made no such statement.  I stated that certain information had been received on which a decision would have to be taken.  Such a decision involves three big issues (a) are there enough minerals <Col N="344" /> there that can be got out; (b) can they be got out at an economic price, and (c) when they have been got out can they be sold at an economic price?  If there are affirmative answers given to all these questions then this development will cost £1,250,000.</P>

Méadaíonn an cháin seo ar &ldquo;phetrol&rdquo; an costas maireachtála ar a lán daoine. Má tá daoine ann atá i ndon an cháin d'íoc, agus nach bhfuil an gluaisteán riachtanach dóibh ina gcuid gnóthaí, bain an cháin amach orthu go cinnte. Más dóigh leis an Aire go bhfuil daoine ag úsáid a gcarranna an iomarca le dul chuig na coimhlint mhadraí nó ag rásaí eile baineadh sé an cháin amach orthu.  Ach tá daoine ann agus tá an carr riachtannach dóibh, agus cuireann an cháin seo as dóibh go mór. Mealladh cuid de na múinteoirí scoile chun cuidiú le Fine Gael&mdash;mar níl ann ach iad&mdash;le gealltanais go bhfaighdís buntáistí nach raibh le fáil acu faoi Fhianna Fáil.  Mealladh iad le lear mór airgid a chaitheamh le Fianna Fáil a bhualadh.  Ar comhlíonadh an gealladh?  Do hardaíodh a gcostas maireachtála orthú agus hardaíodh an costas taistil orthu go háirithe. Ar an gcaoi chéanna tá a lán dochtuírí, sagart agus seirbhíseach poiblí agus cuireann an cháin seo as dóibh. Gealladh faoiseamh áirithe do roinnt feilméaraí.  Is maith linn é sin.  Ach táimid ag iarraidh cabhair éigin anois do dhaoine eile a bhfuil an chabhair uathu go géar.  Gearr an cháin ar thuartóirí, nó &ldquo;tourists&rdquo; mar tugtar orthu agus gearr í ar lucht an phléisiúir más rud é go gcaithfidh tú í a ghearradh. Ach tá an ceart chun faoisimh ag na haicmí atá luaite agam.

    </Speaker>

      <Col N="346" /> Is cinnte go n-ardóidh an cháin na costais ar lucht gnótha, ar dhéantóirí agus ar sheirbhísí iompair paisnéirí. Tá daoine ar an taobh eile thall ar cuma leo faoi seo.  Níl fhics acu céard tá siad a rá.  Abair nach bhfuil cead ag, abair, Córas Iompair Éireann, na táillí d'árdú.

    <P>Déarfaidh an tAire go mbeadh sé deachair slí a cheapadh leis an bhfaoiseamh d'iarr mé do na dochtúirí, na sagairt agus na múinteoirí a chur ar fáil.

    <P>Ar ndóigh mar dúirt mé cheana, ní ceart an cháin seo a bheith i gceist beag ná mór go háirithe ó gheall an tAire go laghdóadh sé costais maireachtála na ndaoine agus fós ó tá stop curtha aige leis an oiread sin de na dea-oibreacha a bhí ar bun ag Rialtas Fhianna Fáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not put down an amendment to this section or the following section, as I accept this tax as part of the Budget.  However, I regard it as a tax which is open to very considerable objection.  If it were a tax on petrol to be used in private cars, although I use a private car myself, I would not think it should be seriously opposed under present circumstances. The Minister seemed to be under the impression that this would not cause an increase in the cost of production and in that impression he is quite wrong.  It could always be argued that you cannot have production without transportation and distribution and obviously a tax on petrol will increase the cost.  The Minister was probably specifically referring to the more direct cost of production.  When you had a high cost of oil under the old Government, it was undoubtedly a factor in the cost of production, but since 1946 quite a few manufacturers, after consultation <Col N="347" /> with the then Government, and having regard to the various difficulties, have gone over to fuel oil for the purpose of running their factories. The increased tax in their case is unquestionably a direct increase in the cost of production.  I was informed by one fair-sized company, which has always done an export trade and which about two years ago went on to fuel oil and found it reasonably satisfactory, that it would cost them about £2,000. I am accepting this as an undesirable tax in a Budget which is too high.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has been able to make arrangements which will reduce the hardships on the agricultural community, but I would not like him to have the idea that the continuation of the tax on fuel oil, either light or heavy, which is used for running plant, is not an increase in the cost of production.  When this is being reconsidered, if it is found desirable to keep the tax on petrol, I hope the Minister will consider some easement in the case of manufacturers.  I hope it will be more serious in a year's time than it is now.  At the moment, it is very difficult to do any export trade, as most of our manufacturers cannot export to England and it is difficult to get into other markets.  I hope that in 12 months' time it will be possible to increase the export trade after this year.  In the case of textiles, a market margin of a farthing per yard in the cost of production might make all the difference.</P>
      <P>I am not trying to exaggerate this point, but so many Deputies in the Dáil drew attention to the difficulties of farmers that I thought it right that the Bill should not pass through this House without my drawing attention to the fact that in the case of manufacturers who use petrol for plant it is definitely an increase in the cost of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the various occasions when the Minister has made statements in this House or in the other House or in public, he has appealed to the producers and distributors to reduce costs and lower prices, but at the same time he thinks it well to place on distributors a sum of £910,000.  He <Col N="348" /> has stated that there were times in recent history when the tax on petrol and oils was much greater than it is now, but surely that is a poor excuse when an appeal is being made to reduce costs of production and distribution.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Buachalla has already made an appeal for the teachers, doctors and other professional people who of necessity have a car and use petrol and oil not for pleasure purposes, but as part of their business. The increased cost to those people will increase their cost of living.  In the Dáil, the Minister promised to make a small concession in relation to tractors and some other agricultural implements.  That is not sufficient. Our milk and vegetables are delivered in most parts of the country now to the market in motor vehicles, so this increase means an increase to the consumer.</P>
      <P>Last night, the Minister informed us that an inquiry was about to be held into the state of Córas Iompair Eireann. I wonder if the Minister could give us a figure for the increased cost of those oils to that company.  Such a big transport concern must be gravely concerned about this additional taxation. If the services are to be maintained, surely they must be permitted to increase their charges?  If the policy of the present Government is not to allow the company to increase charges and pass the taxation on to the public, the Government may hold on the one hand that they are refusing to give that permission to Córas Iompair Eireann but, in the long run, the public will have to pay, since the nation as a whole are the guarantors for Córas Iompair Eireann.  It is a narrow policy on the part of the Government not to try to do everything possible to maintain these services.  Then, if it is by an action of the Government that the increased charges have brought about such a condition of affairs as to make the cost of transport greater on the company, they should be allowed to recoup themselves from the people who use the transport, rather than from the nation as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Orpen</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a slight misunderstanding as to the coneam <Col N="349" /> cession the Minister has said he will investigate as regards agricultural tractors.  A tax on fuel may be easy to collect and it may be necessary, as it is all canalised coming in, and one can see a justification for making that tax in the short time the Minister has had to deal with the Budget.  In essence, however, it is a bad tax, especially on the agricultural community, where it falls early in the stage of production and therefore has the psychological effect of impeding production.  The Minister has to get the money and agriculture must pay its share, but I would rather see agriculture taxed on its output rather than at the early stage of the productive machine.  The Minister undertook to investigate the concession&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Captain Orpen Captain Orpen">
      <NameTxt>Captain Orpen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in regard to registered tractors.  I understand the Minister is granting a remission for unregistered tractors, which form a small part in the effective agricultural community, being the ones that legally cannot cross the road.  I take it that the 5/- licence one is a registered tractor which can cross the road and move about from field to field, but is limited to purely tillage work.  The £6 licence tractor is really the one that nowadays has increased substantially. Quite a large number of the recent tractors are entirely petrol driven. There are some 1,500 Fergusons in operation and I think about 500 on order.  Taking the average figure for the hours worked per year of a tractor, the survey shows about 800 to 1,000 hours.  At, say, .75 of a gallon per hour full load&mdash;or call it half a gallon on the average&mdash;that means he is paying a tax of £15 additionally. While that is not so serious, it is not the £15 that matters nearly so much as the fact that he is paying that tax before the crop is sold, which has a bad psychological effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another reason why I dislike taxes on fuel.  I think it should be the job of the engineer to design a tractor or any prime mover, but unfortunately we have makeshift appliances designed jointly by the engineer and Revenue Commissioners. <Col N="350" /> I do not think that idea is sound.  Let us call one type of tractor the &ldquo;tax evasion tractor&rdquo;, the one that runs on T.V.O., with all its attendant idle running and additional repairs.  That is forced on us by the Revenue Commissioners. The Minister should give consideration to the difficulties of the agricultural community in buying these makeshift appliances and might consider the possibility of collecting their taxes off the sale of the final product&mdash; from exports, if possible, as it is a canalised method.  I, as a farmer, do not like to see a tax falling on any part of the productive machine until the goods have been produced.  Once you have the goods, then a levy on exports may be a way of doing it&mdash;I do not know, as I am not a taxing authority &mdash;but I do not like to be forced to use machines designed by engineers and the Revenue Commissioners jointly.</P>

It is not alone an easy tax to collect but it is a fair form of taxation.  I do not believe the statement made by those who contend that this tax is going to increase either production or distribution costs.  I know that the average motor car&mdash;even the very worst car on the road&mdash;will do about 20 miles to the gallon, so that the tax cannot mean any more than one farthing a mile and that means a farthing a mile on its haul, whether passengers or goods.  I should like to see the shopkeeper who can justify to me putting up his price for delivery of goods by a penny or twopence, when it merely costs him one farthing a mile to haul the goods of 20 or 30 householders for delivery, although one firm in the city has already, with a certain amount of glee, <Col N="351" /> announced that this tax will give them an excuse for making a delivery charge. Some of the people who make statements of this kind that this is a tax on industry are inclined to exaggerate.</P>
      <P>I am not quite clear as to what Senator Orpen meant when he said that the tax is a tax on the wrong end and that the farmer has to pay the tax before he produces his crop.  The tax is paid only in very small instalments; it is paid as you buy the gallon of petrol and not in a lump sum.  I know that the Minister promised in the other House to make a remission in respect of the use of Ferguson tractors.  Had he not made that concession, we would have asked for it &mdash;I would have asked for it here&mdash;because I think that a machine designed purely for production purposes ought not to be taxed, but a machine which is mainly used for amusement, as most of the motor cars in this country are, ought to bear a certain amount of taxation.</P>
      <P>Apart from the people I have referred to who have third and fourth-hand cars, worn-out cars&mdash;and they are mostly the farmers and poorer sections of the community&mdash;anybody who has bought a car recently, or has put in a request for a car, is getting a car which will produce far more miles to the gallon than ever in the past, so that, if petrol is a little dearer, transport is cheapened by a more efficient machine.  One other point is that many of the people who are protesting most loudly about having to pay 5d. extra for a gallon of petrol cheerfully, to my knowledge, paid 2/6d. for a petrol coupon during the war and said nothing about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Farrell has dealt with the main point which weighed with us when investigation was made as to what taxes would have to be imposed to bring in the required revenue.  It was well known that there was a very big and very lucrative black market in petrol.  People were willing to pay, and were paying, and we thought we might as well get some part of that money.  It will not be so easy to black market petrol and the revenue will <Col N="352" /> get some of what would otherwise have gone into other hands.</P>
      <P>Senator Douglas set the ball rolling on this matter by speaking of a tax on heavy fuel oil used by manufacturers and he went so far as to tell me about some friend of his who told him that the tax would mean £2,000.  I do not know that can happen because fuel oil used by manufacturers is not taxed at all.  I can only assume that the Senator's friend must have been an excess profit gatherer who was giving it back by way of conscience money.</P>
      <P>Senator Hawkins asked me about Córas Iompair Éireann.  I do not pretend that my figures are absolutely accurate.  We felt that the tax might cost Córas Iompair Éireann £100,000 or £120,000 in the year and we had their situation very definitely before us, but, on the other hand, we knew that there had been a remission to Córas Iompair Éireann of the duty which ordinarily would have been charged against them in respect of certain buses which they were importing, and our calculation was that, as far as this year was concerned, the reduction which we had made in their favour&mdash;what otherwise would have been some revenue accruing to the State&mdash;came within measurable distance of equalling the tax, so that Córas Iompair Éireann ought not to be any worse off, for the year, in any event, and that remission lasts only for a year.  This tax may last longer; I am not saying it will, but it may have to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general complaint which Córas Iompair Éireann make is that their revenue is being eaten into by people who use their own method of haulage &mdash;the private individual in his own car who eats into the passenger receipts, or the private haulier who hauls goods in opposition to them, in certain limited ways, and who eats into their freight receipts.  We felt that we did not unduly disturb the rather precarious position of Córas Iompair Éireann, whereas we were definitely disturbing the position of their rivals, so that, so far as that is concerned, Córas Iompair Éireann ought not to have any real cause for complaint.  In the case of the Great Northern Railway, they also are getting the remission in connection with buses <Col N="353" /> imported, so that we have at least met their case in some degree.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins says I am increasing the cost of transport and that that means an increase in the cost of production. Senator Ó Buachalla asks for a remission in connection with people like teachers, doctors and other selected people.  I do not like to fall back again on arguments about what was done in the past, but I am amazed that these considerations did not occur to the Senators who are now so eloquent about them.  Between 1941 and 1946, when this tax was imposed, it was 1d. higher.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the agricultural aspect of the matter, Senator O'Farrell has referred to the promise made in Dáil Eireann.  I think Senator Orpen will find his point entirely met.  I am <Col N="354" /> not sure if it is, and, if not, I should like to hear what else there is, although we do not want to deplete the revenue derived from the tax.  The remissions given are from the month of August and relate to various agricultural tractors and agricultural engines, so long as the machines are in operation for agricultural purposes and so long as they are of certain descriptions. The first group consists of tractors used solely on the farm and not liable to excise duty&mdash;the tractor which works only on land and does not go out on a road.  There is then the tractor which is liable to the 5/- tax&mdash;the tractor which is ordinarily used on land, but occasionally crosses the road to an adjoining farm, a tractor which carries its own gear and equipment, and also may carry farm implements and whatever is required for the purpose of the vehicle or the use to which the vehicle is to be put.  There are, thirdly, the tractors liable to the £6 and the £10 tax.  These are used for haulage in connection with agriculture, and I am giving the remission in the case of these also.  Finally, there are stationary engines, so long as they are used solely on a farm for power and light.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy asked what was the number of T.V.O. tractors and petrol tractors.  I cannot say that these figures are precise, but the information we have is that there are about 2,500 petrol driven tractors and 7,500 tractors using T.V.O.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that the reason for the reduction in the tax on wine was that when the tax was higher the yield of revenue decreased, and he was reducing the tax so that the revenue would increase.  That may be all very well from the Minister's point of view, but there is another aspect which I should like to mention. Social reformers and many others are much perturbed by the increased and excessive drinking among young women and girls.  It has become a sort of scandal throughout the country, and it is notorious that women of that calibre generally drink wine.  I am a teetotaller and I am not too sure about these things, but I have seen young girls at dances, respectable girls, the daughters of respectable people, lying drunk, absolutely incapable, under tables.  Apparently it is considered <Col N="356" /> respectable for a lady to drink wine rather than something else.  I feel this effort of the Minister to increase drinking so that the yield from the tax will be greater is a retrograde step, and I personally want to protest against it. There was enough drinking in the country&mdash;too much of it many of us think&mdash;without encouraging an increase in drink by giving further facilities.  I suggest the Minister should seriously consider the propriety of reducing the tax on wine for the purpose of getting an increased yield without regard to the effect of that tax on the drinking propensities of the women of this country.</P>

      <P>Senator Colgan may be an authority on drinking women but my opinion is that these young women about whom he expresses so much anxiety, would as soon drink dirty water as wine.  What they drink is gin&mdash;gin and it, gin and tonic, and so on.  So, far from encouraging intemperance by reducing this tax, I think the Minister is rather encouraging the drinking of a milder form of intoxicant than that normally drunk by young women who drink too much.  In any case, I should think it would be an exceedingly bad principle of finance that, in order to reform certain wayward young women who must constitute an exceedingly small minority of the community, everyone who wants to drink wine instead of beer should have to pay a special tax.  I do not think there would be any justification for establishing our financial system on the basis of a few ill-conducted young women whom Senator Colgan seems to have in mind.</P>

      <P>We are all aware that this reduction in taxation on wine has been forced on the Minister, first because of election promises and, secondly, because of support received from a particular section.  This particular section were not satisfied at the removal of the duties imposed by the Supplementary Budget of last November. Those of us who read the daily papers can remember seeing a very elaborate publicity campaign carried on.  This campaign resulted in the provision contained in Section 5 of this Bill, making a reduction in the wine tax.</P>
      <P>As to whether there will be more or less wine drunk as a result of this reduction, the Minister himself has informed us that he proposes or hopes to get something like £250,000 increased revenue.  While the Minister is appealing to our people at home to lay up on the purchase of what might be called luxury goods, he is making available to the wine importers of this country sufficient finance to purchase the wines to enable this tax to be gathered.  I put it that that is the most serious aspect of this provision.</P>
      <P>There are other organisations, I am sure, that will look after the moral effects of the encouragement this will give to increased wine drinking.  It is very difficult, I am sure, for the Minister to convince this House and the public that he is sincere, that he is honest, in his appeal for more saving.  He has told us last night that he is going to engage in a widespread national savings appeal, an appeal to our people to purchase less in order that prices may come down.  I am, sure he would be anxious that, if purchases must be made, they should be purchases of commodities and food and drink manufactured and produced in this country. He has been coerced, he has been forced, as a result of a mighty and influential organisation, and as a result of a campaign that was carried on, to make available foreign exchange that could very well be put to better use in getting fertilisers and other things for the farmer that I am sure Senator Baxter would like should be got.</P>

Taking him on the argument he has presented to the House, one would believe that the Senator was an ascetic sort of person who, like his leader, believed that the doom was at hand and that we should all prepare as quickly as possible for the last journey. He has told the whole world about the dangers of war abroad and the catastrophies that are coming upon us and the doom that is to descend upon us. Most of his followers seem to be obsessed with the same idea.  Yet, for all that, the Senator is quite a genial person.

      <P>&ldquo;Coerced&rdquo; is even stronger, I think, than &ldquo;intimidation.&rdquo; He said the Minister was coerced by this powerful organisation. What is wrong with the Senator and his Party, and especially their leaders, is that they failed to realise that <Col N="359" /> reason enters into men's decisions in this world.  The Minister and his colleagues are susceptible to public opinion, and it was because the Fianna Fáil Party have lost touch with public opinion that they are where they are now.  Had they been more responsive, they might have held on, if only by the skin of their teeth.  They failed.  Let them not lament too loudly or too long.  Let them be warned by their experience now.  Let the Minister be warned by it, because if he follows their line, he will be where they are and they will be back here.  It is terribly important to be responsive to public opinion.  We all know that public opinion rebelled against this decision of Deputy Aiken and his colleagues, and would rebel again to-morrow if the same taxation were imposed by this Minister.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Senator made any case at all.  He wants to pretend that some powerful organisation influenced the Minister, the organisation of publicans, as if there were no organisation in the country backing any politicians except those people.  These people were brought together, they were crushed together, by Fianna Fáil and if they burst out, having been long suffering and patient, it was only public opinion expressing itself in a way in which we were glad to see it express itself.  The people had been bullied and intimidated and silenced so long, we were beginning to despair that there would ever be a future for the country or that the people would be brave enough to speak out against Fianna Fáil.  They did, and that is why you are where you are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by Senator Colgan, and answered to a great extent by Senator O'Farrell, was one that was urged early when these matters were being considered.  There was quite an amount of representation made to us that a lot of people who used to drink wine, not too heavily and with not too much danger to themselves, had been turned, on account of the price of wine, to drinking whiskey, and it was represented that that was very bad and one had to agree that it <Col N="360" /> was.  I do not say that that was what swayed in this, but it was useful to hear that at the time this reduction in tax was being considered.  I do not suppose I will ever be lucky enough to have this type of tax offered to me again.  By reducing a tax, I get £250,000 extra revenue.  It is not often that can be done.  It is done because the imposition of the tax was done in such a rushed way and so stupidly that it failed to bring in what it was expected to bring in.  I can reduce the amount that is being charged for these various types of wine and still get increased revenue.</P>
      <P>The question of allocation of currency to buyers is of no importance at this point, because, again, owing to the way in which the tax was levied before, wine was not sold and the stocks for which my predecessors gave currency, that was required for fertiliser, are now in the country, and since the wine is taken off my shoulders I will have a little more currency to spare for fertilisers, if available. I will not have to spend it on wine.</P>

There will not be very much in the way of foreign currency required and any required will be, in the main, French currency, and that is an easy currency.  I am told that this is contradictory because of my view on savings.  The savings that I want and that I ask the people to make are by withholding spending on goods that are in short supply.  If all rush in, prices go up.  I do not care how many rush in to buy wine, because it will not add to the cost of living and the quicker stocks are exhausted the quicker I will get the revenue.</P>

      <P>I would give the Senator an example.  Clothes are a factor in the cost of living and I would give the people the advice that they should refrain from spending on clothes in so far as they can.  Once the tourist influx has gone, about the autumn months, I think that clothes will be cheaper.  I suggest that those who can afford to do so should refrain from spending on clothes the recent increases in money that they have got, until buying is better.</P>

      <P>I understand that, on the Finance Bill, it was not considered relevant to discuss the matters which the Senator has discussed.  However, since he has discussed them, I feel that I am entitled to reply.  There can be many views held as to the many types of taxation.  Some people may say they would like modifications on foodstuffs, while others would like them on other things which are an incentive to the worker to give better work.  We took that second view and in taking that view we were swayed, as Senator Baxter said, by the force of public opinion.  Everywhere we went, the different Parties that formed the present Government&mdash;not one of them more than another&mdash;felt the same sway of public opinion, dead against the taxes imposed in the Supplementary Budget of October.  Being responsible to public opinion, as expressed to us, we made certain promises with regard to these matters and we carried them out.  I am told that the cost of living is up and the Senator instances meat and butter.  I have not raised the cost of meat and I doubt if it has been <Col N="365" /> raised.  I have not raised the cost of butter and I doubt if it has been raised.  Then we come to margarine and oatmeal.  I let the Senator have that.</P>
      <P>I said, when he was not here yesterday, that the margarine was on a very definite ration and it cannot impose a big tax on single households.  The entire increase in the cost-of-living index figure by the new taxes or the shelving of the subsidy on these two matters will have an effect on the new figure of .04 of a point.  If you take the old figure, it is less than .05 of a point.  That is the whole change in the index figure under the Budget proposals. Apart from the index figure, I understand the cost of living was affected by the cost of tobacco and drink, two things the workers do enjoy and regard as near necessaries.  They are certainly now classified as incentives to people to work, and the lack of them is preventing better production from being secured in England.  Thrown into the balance against it, we have these increases in respect of margarine and oatmeal, such as they are; and the Senator may make as much out of that as he can.  He is not going to weigh that in the balance against the remission of £6,000,000 in other things. There is no change other than in respect of margarine and oatmeal in whatever provision is made for subsidies. Particularly, in regard to foodstuffs, the subsidies are still there. Will the Senator remember that, if his Party were still in power, they would be now operating taxes on beer and tobacco?  Probably, there would not be the saving I have made in margarine and oatmeal, but they would have to find £2,750,000 extra&mdash;and will the Senator tell me where they could have got it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators can call attention to the extreme scarcity that has arisen since the reduction in prices, particularly of cigarettes.  I have received complaints from all parts of the country from merchants and consumers that they find it impossible to get supplies of cigarettes since the reduction in prices.  That state of affairs can have come about either through a curtailment of the purchase of tobacco leaf, a reduction in the amount of tobacco released from bond, or an intensification of the black market.  I think the latter is the cause of the complaint. The Minister and the Government should have it investigated.  There is a considerable scarcity of tobacco and cigarettes and if it has not been brought about by curtailment in the purchase of leaf, in the amount of tobacco released from bond, or being manufactured, then there is only one source causing the scarcity and that is, owing to the big difference in price that prevails here compared with the Six Counties, a number of people are engaged in blackmarketing activities.  I appreciate the difficulty of overcoming a market of that kind.  As a matter of fact I heard a few weeks ago that such activities are now so water-tight that no Government and no official can do anything about it.  I suggest to the Minister, and through the Minister to those engaged in the manufacture of cigarettes in Éire for which the Government provides facilities in the shape of dollars to purchase leaf&mdash;and these dollars are very precious now&mdash;that it is not fair that we should be called upon to make <Col N="368" /> sacrifices while others engage in what must be the very remunerative business of taking tobacco and cigarettes across the Border.  I suggest that the Minister might ask cigarette manufacturers to have their names stamped on their products, as is done in the case of tobacco.  They might have the words &ldquo;Manufactured in Éire&rdquo; stamped on cigarettes so that when they enter the Six Counties it would be illegal to offer them for sale.  If there is not some control it will be impossible to end the activities in the blackmarketing of cigarettes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>In a general way I wish to support what Senator Hawkins said. It is quite true that it is very difficult to obtain supplies of cigarettes.  As the Senator knows, this is not the first time that it has happened.  For years while his Party was in power this traffic was going on.  Blackmarketing is not a new device and did not suddenly take shape since the change of Government.  Those of us who live in Border counties know what has been going on.  Complaints are made everywhere that when cigarettes reach some traders the smokers do not get them.  I have no suggestion to make as to how this difficulty can be overcome but, as Senator Hawkins said, a water-tight organisation has been built up over a number of years, and those connected with it have grown more prosperous.  The exasperation of the smoking public to-day is at boiling point.  I do not know if that is the position all over but, in parts that I am acquainted with, people have a very definite grievance.  I do not know if the stamping of manufacturers' names on cigarettes would have any effect, seeing that it would be easy to sell cigarettes without offering them publicly. I do not know that that suggestion would be a solution.  Perhaps the Minister's fertile imagination could suggest a plan to circumvent those who are doing such an injustice to the community. The matter is one of importance, because whether the reduction in prices has been any factor in affecting the dimension of the black market that market is there and was there before the price went down.  It has now, I think, developed more vigour than <Col N="369" /> it had shown for some time.  I am afraid that will remain as long as there is a difference of 2d. or 3d. a packet between our cigarettes and the cigarettes across the border.  They have money to spend and burn there, and they are quite prepared to burn it in cigarette smoking and to pay the people who build up the organisation which passes on the goods to them.  If we have ended the cattle smuggling, perhaps the Minister and his colleagues would try to end the smuggling in cigarettes by some sort of bargain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCrea</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who is engaged in business I have experience in the sale of cigarettes and tobacco.  In the first instance, owing to the scarcity of tobacco during the war, quite a number of people went on to cigarettes.  These people may go back to tobacco again now that it is available. At the present time the manufacturers are supplying a quota of 110 per cent. of cigarettes based on sales in a specified year.  I think that the scarcity of cigarettes is due not so much to the black market as to the fact that so many young people, and particularly girls, are now smoking them.  The demand for them is so great at the present time that instead of the present quota you would want one of 500 per cent.  We have plenty of tobacco lying on our hands, but everyone seems to be turning to the cigarettes.  In my experience that is the reason for the scarcity.  When you get your quota of cigarettes, which is expected to last you four or five weeks, they would be gone in a week if you were to put them on the shelves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a question addressed to me in the Dáil to-day on this very point.  In the reply that was given there was a certain amount of statistical information which would appear to bear out what Senator McCrea has said.  The quantity cleared up to the 1st June runs to 116 per cent. of what was cleared in the corresponding period of 1940.  There is certainly not any deficiency in the quantity of tobacco that is going out from the manufacturers.  The suggestion made is that it is not getting into the hands of the smokers in the country.  I would <Col N="370" /> be glad if the Senators who raised it could let me have a summary of the complaints they have received from the areas spoken of.</P>
      <P>The question that was addressed to me came from a Deputy in Mayo.  I do not know why this smuggling should have hit the West more than any other part of the country.  There are very definite precautions taken.  I know that one cannot defeat the black market entirely&mdash;but these precautions are taken, and manufacturers are very careful about those to whom they send out manufactured goods.  The traders who are in receipt of quotas are very definitely all the time under investigation, and if complaints come in that traders in particular areas are not supplying their usual customers we can take these up with the manufacturers. They are working in the closest cooperation. They will remove a quota from a trader if they find that he is not distributing it in the ordinary way. That is the best we can do.</P>
      <P>Very special attention is being paid to the border counties.  That is recognised as being more or less the danger spot.  The precautions taken there are more intensive than elsewhere.  If Senators or their friends will let my officials have complaints we can have them attended to.  If we get any substantial complaint that may put us on the track of people who are trying to get rid of tobacco across the border. One must not neglect the fact that at the present moment we have a big number of tourists in the country who are eating into the tobacco stocks that are there for our own people.  They are, to a certain extent, a necessary evil.</P>

      <P>I do not know the relevancy of what the Senator has been saying.  The licensing provision in Section 9 has not, I think, anything at all to do with it.  The assertion is now repeated that the cost of living has been advanced as regards certain things that have been done in the case of sugar.  I have not interfered with the cost of sugar.  It is still being sold at the subsidised level.  I am giving a certain amount off the ration and I am charging more for that.  If people do not want it they need not buy it.  I do not consider that that is adding to the cost of living.  This sugar that is now being released is for jam making, and has nothing to do with the sugar ration.

      <P>The Minister, of <Col N="372" /> course, is correct when he says he is not interfering and that the subsidy is still being maintained on sugar that is on the ration. The point I made before and which I want to repeat here on this Bill is that if we have a supply of sugar sufficient to enable us to give to the catering establishments in this country an increase of 100 per cent., and to give extra sugar to any or every individual who merely makes application for it to his or her grocer's shop, provided they are prepared to pay the cost price of it, namely, 7½d. a pound, we should put it on the ration.  Sugar, it will be agreed, is a very essential commodity of food, especially for our young people, and that being so we are depriving them of it by not making it available to them at the subsidised price.  What we are actually doing is selling this supply of sugar that we have in hands to those who are prepared and able to pay 7½d. per pound for it, regardless of whether it is for catering or jam-making.  Senators will remember a discussion we had in this House a few years ago when the former Minister for Industry and Commerce gave an extra supply of sugar to people who had fruit of their own or who bought it for the purpose of making that fruit into jam.</P>

      <P>I have here an advertisement issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It sets out that there is 100 per cent. increase on the normal supplies of sugar and an increase of 33? per cent. in supplies of tea for catering establishments in this country.  There is a further announcement by the Department of Industry and Commerce in relation to sugar for jam making.  The Minister will admit that he would have put all this sugar on the ration were it not for the fact that there is a subsidy involved, and that it would entail an expenditure of an additional £300,000, which, he says, he is saving by withdrawing the subsidy from sugar.  The point is that our people down the country, the people with large young growing families for whom Senator Baxter nearly cried on one occasion here when telling us the reasons why those people should have extra sugar, are to be denied it because they cannot afford to pay 7½d. a lb., but the tourists, who were so harmful to the country only a few months ago, are now to get all they want.  In fact, it was proposed that a tax should be put on them to keep them out, to keep them from coming in here and eating the food that should be reserved for the Irish people.  Now the position is that in order that they may have all the tea and sugar they require the Minister has withdrawn the subsidies and is selling them sugar at 7½d. per pound, butter, 3/3 per pound.</P>

      <P>If he was serious in this matter he would appreciate the Minister's position.  He is complaining of the Minister's decision to give this 14 lb. of sugar extra for jam making. I do not think there is any case for complaint about this matter at all. When the previous Minister went about doing this one year what happened? How many people made dishonest declarations in order to get the sugar? Is that what the Senator wants the Minister to continue?  Does he want the present Minister to carry on that humbugging?  The ration is not being reduced from what Fianna Fáil made it and if the people want to make jam why not give them the sugar and let them make it?  There is a considerable amount of fruit in the country this year.  Is it to go to loss?  We have currants and gooseberries and lots of other fruit in our gardens and I do not know what the Senator is trying to come at in his remarks unless he really wants to hold up the House.  Perhaps his objection is that this decision is going to sweeten public opinion.</P>

      <P>In my opinion this sugar rearrangement is one of the best things that the Minister has done, one of the fairest things he has done, notwithstanding the criticism.  I did my best to try and agree with Senator Hawkins, but the more he protested the more I liked the new arrangement. He referred to what happened a few years ago when sugar was given, presumably, for making jam.  At that time you filled up an application for sugar and all the time there was a possibility that an inspector would call to see if you really had fruit.  In some cases an inspector did call.  I know that my own wife applied for sugar and a sergeant of the Garda called and asked if she had a garden and if she had fruit, and could he see it.  He saw the fruit and certified she was an honest person, possibly more honest than he thought, because she actually made jam.  I think the present arrangement is far better, because anyone who wants to get extra sugar can get it.  I dislike class distinction, and I do not think that persons <Col N="375" /> with gardens and fruit should get sugar to make jam while persons with no gardens get none.  People can buy fruit for jam making.  Even in Dublin they can go to the markets where there is a surplus of fruit, particularly of soft fruit, and buy it for jam making.  A great many of the women in Dublin have come from the country and they know how to make jam, because they had gardens before coming to Dublin. This provision enables every family to make jam, if they want it, and it enables every other family which does not want to make jam but who want to get a small store of sugar, to get a stone of sugar.  I think Senator Hawkins was wrong when he said that anybody with a ration card could get the stone of sugar.  I think it applies only to every householder and there are special ration books specially marked for the heads of households, and I assume that it is on these that the sugar will be given.</P>

Reference was made to the fact that hotels are now getting sugar and tea at what, I suppose, is the market price, not the subsidised price.  I heard it said here that that also was going to increase the cost of living. Apparently the people who are protesting to-day against the tourists coming in and getting sugar were weeping yesterday because the tourists who come in may have to pay a little more for the sugar in their tea.  As a matter of fact, they will not.</P>

I know, and some of the Senators will bear me out in this, that it is much decenter for the owner of a hotel or restaurant to be able to go to the market and buy the sugar he requires for <Col N="376" /> his customers even at a few halfpence a lb. more than the ordinary householder has to pay, than to be forced to do, as he has been doing for the past few years, that is, go into the black market.  I was speaking a few days ago to the owner of one of the biggest hotels in the country, and he said that, in order to keep his business afloat for the past few years, he was forced to go into the black market to buy sugar. He said that he could not keep his hotel going if he did not do so and he had to pay as much as £1 per stone for the sugar.  He added: &ldquo;Thank God, we can now buy the sugar, even if it is 7½d. per lb.&rdquo;  The difference, if there is any, ought to bring down the prices, because if he could pay £1 per stone for sugar three or six months ago and serve meals at what he was charging, when he gets his sugar for 7½d., logic suggests to me that this method of the Minister should have the effect of bringing prices down, even in restaurants.</P>

We must remember that there is a great number of poor families who cannot afford to buy a stone of sugar at once and these people would share in the advantage if the ration were increased by ¼ lb.

Paragraph (2) specifies the rate of duties payable on the cost of admission to any entertainment, other than an entertainment which consists wholly or partly of a cinematographic exhibition.  That would seem to me as indicating that the duty is payable on any entertainment which is entirely a personal performance. In paragraph (5), it is stated:&mdash;</P>

      <P>As in the case of many other sections, this section is an implementation of election promises. The various Parties composing the Government promised that, together with reducing the price of beer, they would remit the entertainments tax.  I have no objection to that, but the provision in this section goes much further than that.  Previous to this certain allowances were made in the case of cinematograph shows where there was any personal performance, where a part of the entertainment was a dramatic or personal performance. Now that has been eliminated and the <Col N="379" /> only theatres removed from taxation are the three theatres here in Dublin. The Minister put forward the view that, as a result of the increase in the entertainment duty imposed by the Supplementary Budget last year, there was growing up throughout the country a certain evasion of the tax. That might be so, but there had grown up, side by side with that, something that should be encouraged.  In various cinemas throughout the country local entertainers, artistes of various kinds, were being employed.  That helped to encourage local talent and it gave employment.  In future, as a result of the implementation of this section, that will be no longer possible.  The Minister should give some concession, particularly in rural Ireland, whereby the tax would be enforced only in relation to the larger cinemas, if that is desired.</P>
      <P>We hear a lot about the flight from the land and rural depopulation.  If we are to keep our people content they must be given entertainment to suit their tastes and there is nothing as good as encouraging local talent in every way.  The step that had been taken in that direction, whether the intention was to evade the duty or not, was welcome.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of this matter.  In rural Ireland there is quite a number of small halls.  There is on the market a 16 millimetre film.  The Minister proposes to impose the same entertainment tax on admission to a show which is not only entertaining, but educative, as he imposes in respect of the ordinary film.  I made a suggestion here last year, speaking on the question of the cinema entertainment tax, and I put it to the Minister now. There is a tax per foot of film entering the country.  That tax is the same irrespective of the value of the film. There could be much relief, particularly in relation to the 16 millimetre film, if we investigated the question of imposing a tax, not in relation to the length of the film, but in relation to the value of the film.  I put that suggestion to the Minister in the hope that he will accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the matter of rural cinemas I made a plea to the Minister last night which I ask him to consider now in reference to this section, that is, that cinemas with a seating accommodation of 300 or under might be allowed to maintain the position which existed in 1946 which, I understand to be, that the tax on a 1/7 seat was 6d, the tax on a 1/4 seat was 4½d. and the tax on a 1/- seat was 3d.</P>
      <P>I would put this case to the Minister, that those cinemas are small in number. They fill a need in the rural community and no loss of revenue, or a very minute loss of revenue, would be suffered by giving this small exemption.  As I am instructed, the general overheads of a cinema such as this that only runs one show by night, are very much the same as the overheads of cinemas running two and sometimes three shows per day and the position is that the overhead increases from 1946 or 1945 to the present day are nearly double and are likely to increase.  Those overhead increases can be borne more easily by the bigger cinemas than by the small. If the Minister allows that concession in the case of the small cinema, I do not think he will suffer any great loss of revenue and it will give a real benefit to the members of the rural community living in small towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the case made by Senator Sweetman. I made such a case here on another occasion.  I have no idea of the number of small cinemas which we can speak of as rural cinemas, but I imagine the total revenue obtained from them must be unimportant relative to the taxation that is taken from cinemas as a whole.  In many of these cinemas the halls are small and can only accommodate small numbers and, as Senator Sweetman says, the cost of the hire of the film is probably as high in the case of cinemas having one performance daily as it is where there are three performances, because <Col N="381" /> the film has to be retained overnight. If there were a remission of taxation, to some extent it would enable cinema owners to provide better and more expensive films and thereby give better shows.  From the point of view of assisting rural life and making it more acceptable for young people who want the sort of thing they can see on the films, I believe it would be well worth the Minister's while to explore the possibilities.  It is a question the country will have to concentrate on&mdash;how are we to provide people in the country districts with the kind of thing they seek in the towns and cities?  There is a psychology about the desire to get out of the country.  They are searching for something, but quite definitely some of the things they go in search of are the pleasures and joys and satisfaction and, perhaps, comfort of cinemas with the variety of entertainment that they give.  I believe that a remission of taxation in this case would be very acceptable.  It would not be a very large sum and it would do something to brighten rural life.</P>

      <P>Apart from the merits of this question, it would seem to me that if Senators want the Minister to make any particular concession or remission they should adopt the ordinary procedure and put down a recommendation.  On a point of order, it seems to me, with all due respect, that there is a tremendous amount of time wasted here when Senators get up and suggest to the Minister this remission and that remission, this alteration and that alteration, while they could have gone through the ordinary formula of putting down recommendations that he might consider and accept.  I cannot see how the Minister can agree to some of these things.  It is not for the Minister to put down recommendations on the Committee Stage.

      <P>A point has been made that apart from the remission of the tax in rural areas it is possible to get a remission of the full tax by having performances, mainly of a personal nature.  Eleven places in the whole country went in for that. They thought it was a good thing to give personal performances, even to the extent of putting them on more than half the programme.  Incidentally, Galway was not one of these places. There was never a personal performance in Galway until what I call the evasion period started.  There was a time after the Supplementary Budget when cinemas all over the country discovered the easy method of evading taxation.  I discussed this matter at length in the Dáil and I gave merely a summary here.  The situation was this, to have two hours' cinema show and to open two hours and five minutes ahead of the cinema and to have a girl playing the piano or someone playing an accordion.  That lasted for two hours and five minutes and then the cinema started.  There was no one in the auditorium or there might be a few stragglers.</P>

      <P>No cinema in Galway qualified for remission of the tax.  They did not put on wholly or mainly a personal performance.  When I look at the places where there were cinemas with personal performances it is quite clear that no great employment was given.  There was one each in Lucan, Navan, Kilcullen and Kildare. Limerick and Drogheda were the only ones of any substance in the way of cinemas that got a remission of tax by having the performances wholly personal.  In regard to the point <Col N="383" /> raised by Senator Bigger, I find it difficult to reconcile the two clauses, but I am sure it will be easy to administer them.  As there will be an adjournment now I will have to consider whether the section ought not to be amended by including within the brackets in sub-section (2) words which will catch entertainments which consist wholly of personal performances.</P>

      <P>The Cathaoirleach announced that the Social Welfare (Reciprocal Arrangements) Bill would be passed in the Dáil to-day.  It has been passed and an arrangement has now been made that when the Seanad resumes at 7 p.m. it will take the Social Welfare Bill, of which the Tánaiste is in charge.  It has also been suggested that we should take the Trade Union Bill, which made a brief passage through the Dáil and for which the Minister is waiting.  We might deal with these small items and then resume this section of the Finance Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express at the outset my deep appreciation of the kindness and courtesy which the Seanad has extended to me by agreeing to take this Bill at short notice.  I assure you that it is only the urgency of the matter that induced me to ask the Seanad to depart from its usual code of procedure, but I feel sure that, when the main objects of the Bill are explained to the House, the members will realise the necessity for expedition in this matter and will be anxious to accelerate the passage of the Bill through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" /> The main purpose of the Bill is set out in Section 2, which provides that the object of the Bill is to enable the making of reciprocal arrangements covering the field of national insurance, unemployment insurance, widows' and orphans' pensions insurance and insurance arising out of the injuries sustained by workmen in the course of or arising out of their employment.  That is the main purpose of the Bill which, as you realise, on its face is clearly an enabling Bill designed to facilitate arrangements towards the end envisaged in Section 2.</P>
    <P>The need for reciprocal arrangements arises very largely in relation to Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  In Great Britain and Northern Ireland a comprehensive code of social services comes into operation on Monday next, 5th July, and that comprehensive code of social services covers a wide field of insurance, wider than anything we have so far attempted here.  The necessity for this Bill arises out of the fact that the reciprocal arrangement which we have at present in respect of reciprocity in the field of national health insurance lapses on the coming into operation of the new British Bill, and must be renewed specifically under this Bill to enable us to continue the arrangement under the new British National Health Insurance Act.</P>
    <P>Our desire in the past, and the desire enshrined in this Bill, is to enable us to achieve reciprocity in the field of social insurance so far as that objective is attainable.  But, as the members will realise, reciprocity in the main can only take place in respect of services which are substantially comparable. In other words, we can achieve reciprocity in respect of services in this country which provide benefits substantially comparable with the benefits which are provided in the country with which we desire to enter into the reciprocal arrangements.</P>
    <P>We have had, up to now, reciprocity in the field of national health insurance and the desire expressed in this Bill is to continue these reciprocal arrangements, not merely as they existed in the past, but in a wider form. It has been possible, as a result of discussions with the British authorities, to <Col N="385" /> contemplate a somewhat wider measure of reciprocity in respect of the national health insurance field.  A formal agreement with the British and Northern Ireland administrations on that matter has not yet been completed, but I have strong hopes that, within the next few days, it will be possible to achieve a formal agreement which will not only maintain our existing reciprocal arrangements with these two areas but will widen the extent of the reciprocity contemplated under the proposed agreement.  Discussions have already taken place with the British Government or representatives of the British administrations covering not only the field of national health insurance but wider aspects of reciprocity. We have discussed with the British Government this reciprocity in the field of unemployment insurance, workmen's compensation and in the field of widows' and orphans' pensions.  So far as unemployment insurance reciprocity is concerned, difficulties have presented themselves in the matter of negotiating a satisfactory agreement. Talks took place with representatives of the British and Northern Ireland administrations last year, and talks took place in Dublin and London this year, and whilst we have carried on the discussions to a fairly advanced stage it has not yet been possible to achieve formal reciprocal agreement with the two administrations.</P>
    <P>We are hoping that the British authorities will recognise the merits of the claim which we put up on behalf of insured contributors normally resident in Ireland but at present employed in Great Britain.  If we can get as full a recognition as we think the merits of our case entitle us to, then it should be possible to reach a relatively satisfactory agreement with the British authoritites in that respect.  Any such agreement, as the House will quickly recognise, will safeguard the interests of insured contributors and provide for them benefit in circumstances which might otherwise be lost.  If we fail to achieve reciprocity in this field&mdash;we have had, of course, no reciprocity in respect of unemployment insurance in the past&mdash;but if we achieve this reciprocity now it will be the first time that it has been possible to do so, and <Col N="386" /> I hope our further discussions with the British Administration will enable us to achieve a relatively satisfactory measure of reciprocity to the advantage of Irish insured contributors at present employed in Great Britain and who may subsequently return to employment here.</P>
    <P>In the sphere of widows' and orphans' pensions we have had no reciprocity in the past, and the dissimilarity between our widows' and orphans' legislation and the widows' and orphans' legislation in operation in Great Britain is such that I fear it might not be possible to reach any reciprocal agreement with the British authorities in respect of widows' and orphans' pensions until such time as we can evolve here a scheme substantially comparable to the scheme in operation in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  We hope to achieve a substantial measure of similarity when we proceed to the introduction of our comprehensive scheme of social services next year.</P>
    <P>In the realm of workmen's compensation the position has been equally unsatisfactory. There has been no reciprocal arrangements in the past and there are no reciprocal arrangements to-day, and the position in the future may be even more difficult than it is to-day. As from Monday next, the British scheme will pass under State control and will be on an insurance basis whereas, as the House is aware, our workmen's compensation legislation is a privately administered affair in the hands of insurance companies.  There is a wide dissimilarity between the two types of insurance provided, (a) in Britain and (b) here, and whilst it might not be possible, because of these dissimilarities, to introduce reciprocal arrangements until such time as we get our comprehensive social legislation, I am still not without hope that it may be possible to reach some measure of reciprocal agreement so far as the procedural elements in workmen's compensation are concerned.  In the meantime, anything that can be done to advance the principle of reciprocal arrangements covering widows' and orphans' pensions and workmen's compensation will be availed of once this Bill has been passed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="387" /> I feel sure that this Bill will commend itself to all sides of the House as an effort to take reciprocity in the sphere of social insurance a step further, and that these reciprocal arrangements will obviate the hiatus which arises from time to time where workers contributing in one country return either to their home or to employment in another country.  I have no doubt that the House will desire that these arrangements should be carried into operation at the earliest possible opportunity, and that the enactment of this measure will equip the Department of Social Welfare with the necessary powers to enable steps to be taken expeditiously to implement, first the agreement with the British authorities in the sphere of national health insurance, and secondly to permit us to carry on negotiations for reciprocal arrangements in the other fields as well.  I, therefore, desire to recommend the Bill to the House, and trust that the House will lend its cooperation in expediting its passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a word in relation to this Bill.  I am concerned very much with the provisions for reciprocal arrangements covering unemployment insurance.  As I have raised that matter on a number of occasions in relation to the international obligations of Great Britain, I might now take the opportunity of referring to the matter once again.  My view of Article 3 of the Unemployment Convention which was made at Washington in 1919, places upon the British administration the obligation to grant to persons, other than their own nationals, the same rights under unemployment insurance legislation as are given to their own nationals.  The difficulty is not really so much a British one as a Northern Ireland difficulty.  Most unusual legislation was enacted in Northern Ireland over a period of years for the purpose of depriving citizens of this state of the right to claim unemployment insurance or, in fact, to enter into unemployment insurance at the moment in the territory of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a number of years, it will be recalled, the legislation in Northern Ireland <Col N="388" /> permitted citizens of this State to pay contributions into the unemployment fund but deprived them of any right to get benefit or a return of any kind in respect of these contributions once they became unemployed, even in Northern Ireland.  Now, if the reciprocal arrangements provided for in this Bill will enable the Minister to overcome that difficulty and to ensure that unemployment insurance will be placed, in a relation to reciprocity, on the same basis as health insurance I think the situation generally will be regarded as satisfactory.  At the moment it is most unsatisfactory and has been so for a great number of years.</P>
    <P>This question was, in fact, the subject of discussion at certain commissions of the International Labour Organisation in Geneva on a number of occasions.  The obligation which the 1939 convention placed on Britain was frequently adverted to and only by the casting vote of the chairman of the commission on one occasion was the subject prevented from going before the International Labour Conference. I do not think the British people felt happy about it.  I understand that in recent years the matter has not been reverted to and that it has been allowed to fall into disuse.  However, the laws of Great Britain have changed considerably in relation to unemployment insurance as they have changed in relation to all insurance and that may make it more difficult for us to get a reciprocal arrangement.  But there can be no objection to giving the power of making such an arrangement to get accommodation with the authorities in Britain and in Northern Ireland on this matter.  One other matter I would like to refer to is the question of workmen's compensation.</P>
    <P>Here again there are two very different codes as between this country and Great Britain, because in Great Britain the old system of workmen's compensation has been placed on an insurance basis.  Roughly what it means is that if a man is incapacitated by accident the question of whether he is entitled to compensation does not really arise at all, for the reason that if he does not get compensation he gets sickness benefit or some other benefit. <Col N="389" /> A great hardship arises at times in relation to people who are injured and claim health insurance benefit.  It is a matter entirely for the health insurance to say whether they will pay or not, but I do not want to discuss this matter now because it is not quite in the sphere of this Bill.  But it is a matter that will, I am sure, receive attention when discussions are proceeding with Britain because of the far more satisfactory and more generous arrangements which are in operation in Great Britain for people incapacitated or injured through accident in the course of their employment.  As one of the members of this House who usually protests against taking all the stages of a Bill at the first bite, I must say quite frankly that I think it would be unwise to offer any resistance to the proposal made by the Minister here. No matter how much we may exert ourselves we cannot get the Bill through before Monday, which is the day on which the British Act comes in and the day on which the existing reciprocal arrangement ceases.  We can hardly take the responsibility of depriving people who may be entitled to benefits under the British Act of these benefits by our refusal to accede to the request of the Minister.  I understand that the Dáil gave all the stages of this Bill to-day so that it could come before us this evening. That being so, I hope that this House will follow the example of the Dáil and give all the stages of the Bill to-night.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to say, as the Minister said, when introducing the Bill, that it is not a measure on which there can, be a great deal of discussion.  It is a Bill on which there is general agreement, an enabling Bill to carry on the position as it is for the present.  We, on this side of the House, are prepared to co-operate in giving the Bill an early passage and to support the Minister in any discussions or undertakings he may be obliged to give in his attempt to solve this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to endorse what has been said by Senator Hawkins and also to congratulate the Minister on his first visit to this House either as a Minister or in any other capacity that we know of.  It is rather <Col N="390" /> auspicious that he comes along with a Bill that every member of the House can and must approve of.  Having said that I now come to what, perhaps, may be a &ldquo;fly in the ointment&rdquo;.  I think he could have brought us the Bill sooner and that we should not be asked to rush through all the stages.  As Senator Hayes said, no matter what Government or Party we belong to we do not like to be asked to do this and I do not like to see this Government following their predecessors' bad habits.  We are usually told that we will defeat the purposes of a Bill unless we put it through and, of course, we always give way.  Senator Hawkins therefore is just in the same position in which I and others were not very long ago.  The Minister, I am sure, will have other Bills just as valuable and important and I hope that he will not put us in the position again of having to put all stages through on the one day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words on this Bill before it has passed all its stages.  It has been suggested here that the scale of workmen's compensation in Britain is very much better than it is in this country.  I would like to say, as the representative of what the Minister might call private enterprise, as the representative of an Irish assurance company, that the insurance companies here pay as much as the law of this country compels an employer to pay and I think that the new system which has been initiated in England has not proved itself yet. It must be remembered that we can always pay more compensation if the legislation says so, but I do not think any system can give the injured workman better services than he is getting to-day from ordinary insurance business. They have protected the employers to the extent that the legislature lays down and I am rather a little concerned to find on the passage of this Bill through the House that a discussion was going to be opened up on this subject.  However, I do not propose to delay the passage of this Bill further than Senator Duffy has already delayed it.</P>

Senator Duffy referred to his having raised this matter at the International Labour Conference.  I was associated with him in that on at least one occasion at the International Labour Conference, and I am glad now that the Minister has taken steps to get a reciprocal arrangement.  I wish him every success.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it is due to my ignorance, but I have some misgivings about this Bill, and possibly an explanation by the Minister may remove them.  I can see the urgency for an arrangement about national health insurance, but I hope that we are not giving the Minister a blank cheque in connection with the other matter.  I do not want to question the Minister's use of a blank cheque, but I do hope that reciprocity does not mean that we have to go <i>pari-passu</i> with the British in this matter.  It seems to me that it would be much better if we had a free hand to devise our own social services and, for that reason, I sincerely hope that this does not mean that we have to go <i>pari-passu</i> with the British in all our social services.  We ought to approach this matter from the point of view of our own interests and our own resources and from the point of view of what effect it is going to have on employment and our whole social system.  Our problems are quite different from Britain's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take the points made by Senator Mrs. Concannon first? The Senator is anxious not to give me a blank cheque.  I am not really asking the House for a blank cheque. All I am asking the House to do is to give me powers, which, I assure the House, will be utilised for the purpose of getting the maximum benefit for Irish workers who, through reasons of economic necessity or otherwise, find it necessary to work outside the area of jurisdiction of this State.  If Senator Mrs. Concannon does give me a blank cheque in this matter, I want to assure her and the House that I will try to <Col N="392" /> fill it in a way that will be to the advantage of insured Irish contributors.</P>
      <P>Senator Mrs. Concannon suggests that we should devise our own social services.  We have done that in the past, and this is portion of it.  We propose to do it more comprehensively in the future, but this Bill, I should explain, is limited to endeavouring to make arrangements with the British and Northern Ireland administrations whereby we can get credit from these administrations for contributions paid by our workers while employed in the area of jurisdiction of these two administrations. Unless we make these reciprocal arrangements, our workers will be liable to contribute for benefits under the British and Northern Ireland Act and will not be entitled to any benefit if they return here.  If, however, we make these reciprocal arrangements, then at least portion of the contributions which they will have paid in Britain will follow them on their return to this country and will be available, to the extent of our agreements, as benefits for them in circumstances which would entitle them to draw benefits under our normal legislation. In other words, we are asking these two administrations to give us what we consider to be a reasonable proportion of the contributions paid by Irish workers, when employed outside this country.  These contributions, so received, will be available, either individually or collectively, for the group of insured workers in respect of whom the reciprocal arrangements are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Duffy raised the very wide question of Britain's liability for Northern Ireland under International Labour Conventions.  That is a very wide subject, and, as negotiations are proceeding with the British and Northern Ireland Governments on the whole question of insurance reciprocity, I do not think it would be wise or profitable to enter into discussions on that subject this evening.  I think it better that these negotiations should continue in an atmosphere which gives hope of an ultimate settlement, rather than that at this stage we should commit ourselves to declarations which may only impede us at a later stage in <Col N="393" /> getting what, I hope, will be a relatively satisfactory agreement.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas said that, while he agrees with the principle of the Bill, the Bill should have been introduced sooner.  I would normally agree with the Senator's views in that respect, and I can assure the House that it was no fault of my Department or mine that the Bill was not brought in sooner.  But before we could ask for a Bill to make reciprocal arrangements, we had to be sure that there was a prospect of being able to make the arrangements.  It is only recently, and very recently, that we looked like concluding the negotiations with the British Administration, and when it became evident that we were likely to do a deal with them on this question of reciprocity in the field of national health insurance, it became necessary to draft a Bill.  If we were not able to make this arrangement with the British and to make it in a way which gives hope of its becoming effective on 5th July, we could postpone the Bill until August or September, or until next year.  It is the fact that an agreement appears to be in sight and that we are anxious to maintain the continuity of the existing reciprocal arrangements which makes this Bill rather urgent.  I hope, however, that I shall not be a transgressor in the matter of asking the Seanad to pass Bills hastily in future.  I am grateful to the House for their sympathetic understanding of the position.</P>

      <P>This is just a simple Bill.  Its purpose is to extend for 12 months the provisions of Section 2 of the Trade Union Act, 1947.  That section of the 1947 Act continued the power which was given to the Minister under the 1941 Act to authorise the acceptance, in certain cases and due to the abnormal circumstances of the time, of a lower sum by way of deposit than was laid down in the original Act.  As Senators are probably aware, in order to obtain a negotiating licence, trade unions, whether of employees or employers, had to make and maintain a deposit of anything from £1,000 to £10,000.  It was foreseen in 1941 that, owing to abnormal circumstances, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for certain trade unions to make and maintain the full deposit, and the Minister was given power to authorise a reduced sum up to a maximum of 75 per cent. It is thought desirable that that should be continued for another 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Denis Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I spoke about the burden the stamp duty imposes on various people who want to purchase property, farms or businesses. I would like to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister and perhaps he will be able to give us the official view.  There is now a 5 per cent. stamp duty on the purchase of any property of any sort in this country.  It is a deterrent to very many people, particularly to farmers who may want to buy farms for their sons that the State comes in and takes 5 per cent.  The same is true of anyone who wants to buy a business.  It is the people who work and who want to do things who, in my opinion, are the true patriots, and I do not think the Government ought to put a premium on their initiative or ability. The tax is defeating itself at the moment.  When a tax fails to bring in the amount of revenue it was designed to bring in, then, I think, it becomes a bad tax.  We had an example of that in the case of wines and spirits for the last few months and I believe the same is happening in regard to this tax.  It might be well if the Minister made a virtue of necessity and reduced the tax very considerably.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is an exemption section simply.  If there is any agreement or conveyance or anything of the description set out in the section which results in the transfer of property to a Minister of State then there is not to be any stamp duty payable on it.  It is a simple section. Previously when a Minister took over property on behalf of the State he paid the duty and got the money refunded out of the Contingency Fund.  It was only a passage of money from one pocket to another.  Senator Burke is on the question of stamp duty.  The 5 per cent. stamp duty has not failed as a revenue producer.  It is getting revenue.  The 25 per cent. stamp duty, from the point of view of revenue, is almost entirely a failure.  There are only a few thousand pounds coming in from that but it means that certain sales of property have been stopped, whether the effect of the tax or not, I do not know, but these sales are no longer taking place.  As far as the 5 per cent stamp duty is concerned, revenue is coming in and, apart from that&mdash;again, whether it is the effect of the duty or not, I cannot say; it has not been running long enough for any considered judgment to be passed on it &mdash;the fact of the matter is that house property is experiencing a bit of a slump at the moment.  Sales are coming down and more and more sellers are finding it necessary to pay the tax. That being the tendency at the moment I think it would be bad to stop that. I think we should let that tendency develop.  If the sellers pay the tax, from the purchasers' point of view, that is all to the good and, with the decrease in the value of house property at the moment, even with the 5 per cent., and even if it is paid by the purchaser, there is less being paid than there was before.  In addition, the State are getting a considerable amount of revenue.  I was asked to remit this tax of 5 per cent.  It would cost at least £300,000 in the year, and I cannot <Col N="397" /> afford that at the moment but, if the tendency is there, I think we should accentuate it.</P>

      <P>I am intrigued at the manner in which items in relation to the Post Office Saving Bank are dealt with.  I happened to be looking through some Statutory Rules and Orders recently, and I came across one made last year by the previous Minister for Finance, by which he reduced the rate of interest from 2½ per cent., which I think was fixed about 25 years ago, to 2 per cent.  That was done by an Order made by the Minister.  I cannot understand why it was necessary to put this provision in this Bill.  It seems to me that all he required to do was to revoke the Order made by <Col N="399" /> his predecessor.  Why it is done differently now has intrigued me, but I am not discussing the merits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably this could have been done by Order.  The situation was that the 2½ per cent. was provided in 1861 by statute, and when the change was made it was made by statute.  We thought it better to revert to that procedure and to give an opportunity of having the matter discussed. Presumably it could have been done earlier.  Senators will realise why this move is made.  In the finance statement I indicated that there was an encashment in 1947 of £220,000.  In 1946 there was an increase of £3? million in deposits.  There was a net increase for many years before that. Withdrawals exceeded deposits for the first time in 1947, and some people question if the rate of interest had much to do with that.</P>
      <P>I do not know if people are so meticulous about the rate of interest that they thought so much of the decrease.  It had an unsettling effect. People took the line that money was not regarded as having any great value or likely to retain it, and that there was a move against savings.  We want to show the opposite tendency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Some two years ago the then Minister for Finance introduced what was known as the Transition Development Fund.  The object was to recoup local authorities additional charges arising out of works they undertook, compared with the liability that they might have incurred if such works had not been deferred while awaiting a reduction in costs of various items.  A sum of about £5,000,000 was set aside for the purpose, but because of the slowness with which materials came along&mdash;which was not anticipated when the fund was initiated&mdash;there was not much demand on the fund by local authorities.  Apart from the demands made by such authorities, many of them had plans prepared for schemes that they were about to start, on the assumption that, together with the subsidy they would receive for housing, they would get a contribution from this fund which would enable houses to be let at what might be considered reasonable rents.  The Minister may say the last Government proposed to terminate this fund in December 1948 and he proposes to leave it to March of 1949.  If general housing development is to be undertaken, when materials become available, the Minister should extend the date so as to give local authorities some encouragement.  The Minister for Local Government has visited various counties and consulted various authorities on housing, but they seem to be as wise after the visit as before it.  We have here a fund out of which they were to be recouped the additional cost of undertaking the work at the present time.  There is provision here for the closing of that fund.  On the other hand, we see the increased rate of interest on local loans and we are told that the increase will not affect housing.  How does the Minister propose to segregate housing activities from the provision of water, sewerage and so on, so that the amount in one part of a loan will be at one rate of interest and the amount in another part will be at another rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said last night, in reply to Senator Fitzsimons, that it would not be any burden on housing, as there would be an increased subsidy to make <Col N="401" /> up the difference.  If the Minister is serious and appreciates that it is necessary to make up the difference, why put the ratepayers in every county to the expense of raising money at a high rate of interest when after 12 months a scheme is completed they will be recouped the amount spent on housing out of a particular fund?  When does the Minister propose to bring about this increase in the rate of interest? What is the principle enshrined?  What headline does he propose to set?</P>
    <P>There is also a provision for local authorities to make loans to private individuals for the erection of houses under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  Local authorities borrowed this money more often than not from the Local Loans Fund.  If the rate of interest is to be increased the local authority must, in turn, increase the rate to the borrower to whom the Minister has referred as the white-collar worker, for whom no other housing provision is made.  This proposal to increase the interest rate will make it more difficult for those people to erect houses for themselves.</P>
    <P>One does not like to attribute everything to the change of Government, but it must have had certain effects, since the banks have already stopped loans for house purchase and so also have the majority of building organisations. The Minister should clarify the position of local loans.  Despite his intervention on the Second Stage, I have seen this evening in a local paper from Galway, which I am sure does not exaggerate, that the secretary of Galway Corporation read a communication received from the Department of Local Government setting out that, as a result of the increased rate of interest in local loans, it will be necessary to increase the rents of houses at present about to be finished.  Senator Burke could vouch for this, as far as Clonmel Corporation is concerned, that the same type of circular was read there.  Despite the visits of the Minister for Local Government, despite the urge to proceed as quickly as possible, there is such a misunderstanding between the Departments of Local Government and Finance <Col N="402" /> in this connection that the position demands immediate clarification.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBurke" hpid="Mr. R.M. Burke Mr. R.M. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>One other matter requires clarification, with regard to the rate of interest on local loans under the Small Dwellings Act.  Many people received with pleasure the announcement recently made that loans to local authorities for building labourers' cottages would still be at 2½ per cent. and would not be increased.  However, there seems to be uncertainty as to what the rate of interest is to be for farmers with small holdings who wish to borrow money under the Small Dwellings Act, that is, those farmers who are not eligible for cottages under the ordinary labourers' cottages schemes.  I believe that many of those small farmers, especially in the west of Ireland, are just as badly off as any agricultural labourer.  They think it would be unfair that they should be charged a higher rate of interest than for the houses built for agricultural labourers.  I hope that is not the case, but it deserves clarification.  If money is to be lent for the building of labourers' cottages at 2½ per cent., then these small farmers should have the same advantage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know where the misunderstanding can possibly be.  Speaking in the Dáil on the Financial Resolution on the 4th May&mdash; the reference is at column 1055 of the Dáil Reports&mdash;I said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As the rate of 2½ per cent. now involves loss to the Exchequer I have decided that for advances made from to-morrow onwards from the Exchequer and the Local Loans Fund to State organisations and local authorities the rate of interest will be 3¼ per cent. per annum.  It is proposed to alleviate the effect of this increase in the case of housing schemes of local authorities.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The alleviation goes the full 100 per cent. increase.  Where there is any misunderstanding I do not know.  I will have to look at the circulars that have been sent out.  I am quite clear what is happening.  I am making nothing out of this; in fact, I am losing.  I am asked what is the principle.  The <Col N="403" /> principle is that the State should not be asked to lend money at a lower rate than that at which it can borrow. The 2½ per cent. was always notional. The Minister for Finance who preceded me, in one year said that he was going to look to the public to subscribe to an issue at a maximum of 2½ per cent., and on the basis that they could get the money at that rate they made these changes with regard to the Local Loans Fund.  But he never did get the money and never ventured to ask the public to give him money at that rate.  It was always a notion.  The best rate that could be got was 3 per cent.&mdash;the rate at which money was borrowed recently. I am merely holding to what the position has been&mdash;that the State ought not be asked to lend to other people at a lower rate than that at which it can borrow.  So far as local authority housing is concerned, there will be no difference.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, that matter is under consideration at the moment.  Certain changes are being suggested, but the final decisions have not yet been taken. I cannot anticipate what the decision of the Government will be on that point.  With regard to the Transition Development Fund, which is really the only matter that is relevant to this section, all that the section does is that it postpones the date for the winding up of the fund.  Speaking on that on the Financial Resolution on the 4th May, I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is proposed to defer the winding up of the fund until the end of the current financial year and provision will be made accordingly in the coming Finance Bill.  In the meantime, consideration will be given to the extent to which charges now accepted as a liability on the fund should be transferred to ordinary Votes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That consideration is still going on.</P>

It will probably cost £10,000 now.  In connection with such schemes, it is customary for the local authority to borrow the money from the Local Loans Fund.

      <P>The Minister for Local Government has been urging local authorities to do certain development work on housing schemes by direct labour.  In view of all the circumstances, I am in favour of such development by direct labour, but ordinarily all that work would be included in the building contract.  I do not want the position to arise whereby the Department of Finance could come along and <Col N="405" /> say that such work was not housing, and that, therefore, the rate of interest on the money required for it was to be at the rate of 3¼ per cent.  I do not want to have them saying that there will be no alleviation in respect of that, and that the local authority will have to bear the extra ¾ per cent.  Such work is part and parcel of the housing scheme.  If we attempt to do that work by direct labour then I think we ought not to be fobbed off by the Department of Finance and told that we will have to pay the extra ¾ per cent. If that is going to be the position the local authority will refuse to do this work by direct labour.  All the work will then be set out in the contract documents and tenders will be invited.</P>

I want to enter a reservation against any enlargement of what I said. I am not going to have development schemes run in as housing schemes.  I will stand by what I said.

      <P>Last night I went to the trouble of looking up some of my books and I found one fairly good example about increased costs.  This was a piece of work that used to be done by a tradesman in 1938.  He did 30 yards in a day.  In 1948 the output, instead of being 30 yards, was only 18 yards. Wages have been very considerably increased since 1938.  The actual cost of a yard of work in 1938, as compared <Col N="406" /> with a yard of the same type of work in 1948, has increased 3.45 times over the 1938 figure.  Senators may find it hard to believe that.  It seems almost incredible.  I did not believe it myself until I worked it out.  Senator Fitzsimons last night mentioned a fact which is well known to every member of a local authority, namely, that in 1938 we used to be able to get houses built for an all-in sum of £300.  Now we get tenders from various people for building the same type of house at £1,000, £1,100 and there was an extreme case where the figure was £1,400.</P>

Every thinking person will agree with him but there is a third aspect to the matter and it is that there is something more that responsible trade union <Col N="407" /> leaders will have to inculcate into the minds of their members and that is this question of the reduction of output, unless the whole lot of us are riding for a fall.  A man was no worse off when laying three squares of flooring in 1938 than in 1948 when he only lays two squares.  There is no justification for that.

      <P>I do not like to enter into this interesting conflict that has arisen between Senator Hearne and the Minister.  I want to go back to the point I was dealing with a few minutes ago, and that is to the definition of development in regard to houses under the housing loan.  I do not want to feel that what the Minister has said implies that the housing authority must divide its loan into two or three parts for the purposes of finding out exactly the portion to be spent on the actual building of the house as distinct from the amounts spent on road-making, the provision of sewerage and water.  I do not think the local authority should be asked to do that. I do not think they will do it.  Well, I suppose it could be done if insisted upon, but let us keep this in mind: if the Minister is going to charge 3¼ per cent. for a loan to a local authority for making roads as distinct from the actual building and also for the provision of water and sewerage he is going to add 15/- per cent. to the cost of the house.  Senator Hearne knows more about this matter than I do, but I assume that if a house is costing £1,000 it is only reasonable to attribute £150 or £200 of this sum to the cost of road-making and the provision of water and sewerage.  I am only guessing now.  I remember houses being built on the Malahide Road about 20 years ago. They were not built by a local authority, they were built by a utility society, and the contract did not provide for a wall at the end of the gardens.  The persons who got possession of the houses soon discovered that there was only a piece of wire running at the end of the gardens, which was <Col N="408" /> not effective in keeping out trespass. They decided to build a dividing wall at the end of their property, and if I remember rightly the cost of building a nine-inch wall was £15 per house.  If that was so, I think that the cost of putting in water and sewerage and roads is going to represent about £150 of the total cost of the house which is £1,000.</P>
      <P>If the Minister's reservation means he is going to divide the rate, it means he is going to add 15 per cent. to the cost of the house.  I think he should reflect on the effect this is going to have on rural housing and town housing too.  It is the psychological effect I fear most.  You will find local authorities starting a row and there is going to be a conflict between the council in Longford and the Custom House and the Department of Finance and between all three the people are going to be left without their houses and the Minister will have to come along eventually and help out of public funds.  If the houses are built and the people who occupy them cannot afford to pay the economic rent the Minister will be obliged, in the long run to come in by a side wind and relieve them and that will cost the Exchequer more than the relief suggested here.  I hope that the Minister will not close his mind to the plea I am making now.</P>

      <P>I am pleased that my remarks have drawn from the Minister a clarification of the position, a clarification which I feel sure the local authorities will not be too pleased to hear, because he has clarified the position as I was putting it.  Senator Duffy, I am pleased to see, agrees that if the rate of interest is going to be divided between the different types of work involved in the erection of houses, we are going to have a very unsatisfactory state of affairs existing as between the local authority and the central authority.  You simply cannot segregate the development work in connection with the house from the entire building operation.  If a local authority decides to go ahead with the housing scheme they raise a loan and proceed with the development work.  If this loan is going to cost them a higher <Col N="409" /> rate of interest than the actual loan for the building of the house the final costs are going to go up.  I submit to the Minister that all the activities of the local authorities for which loans are necessary have more or less the same urgency and importance as housing. If a loan is for the purpose of providing a water scheme in an already built-up area or a playground or for the purpose of providing any of the other social services the local authorities have to provide it should be available at the cheapest possible rate of interest.  I have no less important persons supporting this argument than the present Taoiseach and the present Minister for Education.  This time last year a motion was introduced in the Dáil by Mr. Costello and Deputy Mulcahy asking the then Government to set up a housing public utility corporation or a national housing authority financed by State funds. I do not want to weary the House by going through it&mdash;it is a very lengthy motion&mdash;but they suggested that advances should be at a rate of interest not exceeding 1¼ per cent.  It was the view of the present Taoiseach 12 months ago and of his colleagues who now form the Government that the question of housing was of such national importance that money should be provided by the Exchequer at no greater rate than 1¾ per cent.  Now we have the Minister for Finance telling us that, because builders have made such huge profits, they should oblige local authorities by making a sacrifice, in order that houses might be erected at the same cost and should make up the difference between the new rate of interest in the Budget and the old rate of 2½ per cent.</P>

      <P>It was said of a judge long ago that he explained what seemed so clear so clearly that it seemed confused.  I am apparently in that condition.  I said in the Dáil that it is proposed to alleviate the effect of the increase in the case of housing schemes by local authorities.  I say that the alleviation is the full 100 per cent., and I am sticking by that.  My mind was drawn to the danger, when I heard people who are very strong on the local authority side beginning to talk about what they called development schemes, which might be entirely sewage disposal schemes or water supply schemes, that they might be run in under them.  They will not be. Senator Duffy asked me whether the supply of water to a housing scheme or whatever is done with regard to sanitation is included.  I should think it would be, and I know very well that when this goes back to the Government my colleague in the Department of Local Government will bite the national ear for all he is worth and will probably insist that this phrase of mine be interpreted entirely in favour of the local authority.  I do not know what confusion arises about the matter.  I do not want to have what is really a development scheme of the sewage disposal or water supply type run in under the guise of a housing scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think builders ought to be asked to make a contribution, and in saying that I am not referring to Senator Hearne personally.  I have under my eye builders and building material suppliers and a range of profits from 1937-38.  There was one phenomenal year when they soared to such a point that they declined immediately, but I am leaving that year out.  There is an upward line all along the whole period &mdash;an increase in 1943-44 over 1942-43; an increase in 1944-45 over the year before; in 1945-46, another increase; in 1946-47, a further increase; and in 1947-48, an increase again.  If I could get builders' profits back to the <Col N="411" /> amounts they were taking as profits about the year 1944-45, and if they would remit the profits over and above, the difference of ¾ per cent. in the interest rate does not matter.</P>

      <P>Before we pass away from the very interesting discussion we have had on this Bill, it might be as well for me to refer to some few remarks made by various speakers.  We had an appeal from Senator Baxter and other Senators from the Government side for co-operation.  We had an appeal for the adoption by those of us on this side of a different approach to measures introduced into this House from that which we seemingly had. This appeal for co-operation and for the acceptance, as being in good faith, by us of every measure and proposal brought in by the Government is made, on the one hand, while the Minister introducing the Bill both here and in the other House saw fit to level the old charges of corruption and all that goes with them against this Party.  We had trotted out here last night the same <Col N="412" /> type of thing as the Minister trotted out in the Dáil.  It was suggested that, while this Party was in power, there was political corruption and jobbery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">

      <P>The Fifth Stage is not a time for going back over the debate on the various stages.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to dwell at any length on this matter, but I want to say that, if the Party opposite want co-operation and want the spirit which existed in this House to continue to exist here, it would be well if the Minister and some of his colleagues who come to the House from time to time, would refrain from giving utterance to the statements to which they frequently give utterance in the other House.  I suggest again that if the Minister believes in that statement of his, that there was this corruption and bribery while this Party was in power, he and his colleagues have now at their disposal all the files and all the ways and means of having an investigation carried out, and the sooner that investigation <Col N="413" /> is carried out the better for the political life of the country.  I want to put another aspect before the House. As I said on the Second Stage, this Bill arises out of the Budget, and it is very hard to speak to one without having some relation to the other.  I was surprised during the Second Reading and the Committee Stage at the attitude of those members who I assume to be representing labour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>And the little they made of any remarks that were addressed to the question of increased prices or to what the Minister referred to as the adjustment in subsidies.  I think it was Senator Baxter or Senator Duffy or Senator O'Farrell who passed slightly over the increase on oatmeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>When a member of this House takes a matter of this kind so slightly as to say he never saw oatmeal and does not know what it is, we know that man is not serious, or we hope he is not.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>But the increase brought about by the adjustment in subsidy is no less than 3/- per stone and surely that is something to be considered and something in which the labour people in particular ought to be interested.  Despite all the protests made by Senator Seamus O'Farrell as to the meagreness of these increases and the little effect they will have on the cost of living, I am sure that when the labour people go before the Labour Court to demand increases of wages, these are the very arguments they will use to sustain their claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also asked the Minister on Second Reading&mdash;and so far I have not got a reply&mdash;as to what particular works were going to be put in abeyance as a result of the savings in the Board of Works, in the Department of Education <Col N="414" /> and in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It is only reasonable that, if provision is made in a Book of Estimates for the expenditure of a certain sum of money and decision is taken afterwards not to expend that money, the House should know on what items the saving is proposed to be made.  Since this saving was announced, we have received notification from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that he proposes to increase postal rates, which will have the effect of levying a further £200,000 on the public.  Here again I am sure Senator Seamus O'Farrell and Senator Duffy will tell us that that is not going to increase the cost of living, that it will not have the effect of imposing additional charges.</P>

      <P>We were discussing the advisability of the extension of time for the Transition Development Fund and the Minister pointed out to us that in his opinion there was no necessity for the maintenance of this fund after a particular date.  On Section 15 I pointed out the advisability of extending this fund over a period of years.  We had a prolonged and interesting discussion on the rate of interest. Senator Duffy I think joined with us in asking the Minister to have a uniform rate of interest for all purposes to local authorities.</P>

      <P>In regard to income-tax and surtax, I did not put down amendments on the Committee Stage, as I felt that in the circumstances they could not be accepted.  I was not in a position to prepare an alternative scheme to reimburse the Exchequer for any relief that would be given to certain sections of the community on whose behalf I made an appeal on the Second Reading and on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it is difficult to discuss the subject of a section unless there is an amendment, since nothing can happen but an exchange of views.  However, I hope these exchanges of views are not entirely fruitless and I make this last appeal, before the Bill leaves this House, that when the Minister is preparing his matter for the Budget next year he will have regard to the position of people with small incomes who are obliged to buy their own houses because they cannot rent houses and who are adversely affected by the levying of income-tax on five-fourths of the valuation.  That is one of the greatest hardships on people with small incomes.  It is ethically unsound, having regard to the fact that a house 60 or 100 years old is also subject to tax <Col N="420" /> on five-fourths of its valuation.  A house with 12 rooms is £4 10s. 0d., while a house with five or six rooms is £20. In both cases the occupier is called upon to pay income-tax on five-fourths of the valuation.  I think that is unjust and unsound, and that it is absolutely unfair as between different sections of the community.  I urge the Minister to take the matter into account when he is preparing his Budget for next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been provoked by Senator Hawkins to stand up in defence of myself.  I shall try to confine myself to what is in the Bill, but in doing so I have a protest to make, The Senator accused me of approving of a tax on oatmeal.  I did not refer to oatmeal because oatmeal is not in the Bill, and neither did I mention it yesterday.  If oatmeal were in the Bill, and if it were possible to discuss it and to increase the price of it, I would say that it was not such a calamity because unfortunately a great many people in this country, like Senator Duffy, appear to have an abhorrence of oatmeal. Senator Duffy goes even further than Dr. Johnson.  At times, when he is speaking, the Senator reminds me of Dr. Johnson.  Dr. Johnson once described oatmeal as &ldquo;food for horses in Scotland and for men in England&rdquo;. Probably Senator Duffy also holds that opinion.  I think it is a good food for men in this country.  I would be prepared to encourage the eating of oatmeal here.  I do not think, however, that a little difference in price is going to get any more people to eat it than are doing so at present.  So much for oatmeal.</P>
      <P>I have been described as one of the people here who represent labour. There is nothing in the Bill, that I know of, about labour.  I do not know if I do represent labour.  Neither do I know if Senator Duffy represents labour.  I do not know if Senator Orpen represents the farmers, because while this is supposed to be a vocational chamber, in actual fact, apart from those who are nominated by the Taoiseach, the members of this House were elected by political Parties.</P>

      <P>Senator Duffy made an irrelevant point about the small income group who are charged on the five-fourths basis.  That is one of the hidden bits of taxation left to me by my predecessors.  I would like to attack it, but it certainly cannot be done now.  The only other matter was about oatmeal.  The whole change in the oatmeal subsidy brings in this year about £50,000.  According to Senator Hawkins, it is 3/- a stone.  According to my calculation, that means that there must be 330,000 stones making up the £50,000 that I am getting.  That means one-tenth of a stone of oatmeal per head of the population.  It is not so much.</P>

      <P>There are three motions on the Order Paper which have been submitted by members of the House. If it is the feeling of members late at night, when Government business is disposed of, that the House should adjourn, I think the House itself ought to make some arrangements to place private members' business high up on the Order Paper so that it will be attended to.  I hope that we are not going to follow the example of the Dáil where they have 15 or 20 motions on the Order Paper with no opportunity to discuss them.  This House has a better opportunity of dealing with private members' motions than the Dáil has. I would urge that this matter should be considered, with a view to having proper arrangements made at an early date for dealing with private members' motions before they become too numerous on the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>I think the House might adjourn <i>sine die</i> on the understanding that the next business to come before us will occupy a day's sitting. We will probably then have the Appropriation Bill.  We may, of course, have to meet earlier for some other purpose, and in that event will have quite considerable time for the discussion of these motions.  I agree with what Senator Duffy has said about dealing with these motions, but I do not think the House ought to meet specifically for that purpose only.</P>
