      <P>I would like to refer to remarks made last evening, particularly those by my learned colleague, Senator Duffy.  Both Senator Duffy and Senator Hayes attributed to me one of many qualifications that I do not labour under&mdash;that is, being overworked and being a constant reader of the <i>Irish Press.</i>  I have no apology to make to this House or to the public for my contribution in establishing the <i>Irish Press.</i>  I was one of those who, in the very early days, did what I could in that respect.</P>

      <P>Here is a proposal to enable the Minister for Finance to mortgage the future of the Road Fund This matter was first introduced in 1926 and the first step to implement the proposal was by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government which, in 1926, passed legislation to mortgage the future of the Road Tax Fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Much as I dislike to question the rights of the Chairman, I have a right and privilege on which I am going to insist.  On the Final Stage of the Bill, the question before the House is that the Bill be referred to the Dáil for final consideration.  I propose here and now that it should not be referred to the Dáil, that it is not a Bill which should be referred to the Dáil for final consideration, and I set that out on the following grounds.  An Assembly of this kind should not empower the Minister to mortgage the future of this fund to this extent.  The Bill proposes to take off general taxation something to which the people are justly entitled to make their contribution, that is, the roads of this country which were put into a condition of disrepair, not in the interest of any section in particular.  I am not one who is a proud owner of a motor vehicle of any kind, but I am sure Senators who are in that position and who make their annual contribution to the Road Taxation Fund must demand from the present Government and any future Government their just rights.  They are contributors to a fund to build up the roads to enable them to carry on their various activities, whether for business or pleasure.  The Bill proposes to mortgage the future of the fund.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister just one very serious question.  What is the annual contribution from that fund? We are giving the Minister in this Bill power to advance to our local authorities £3,210,000.  I am sure the Minister will agree that the figure of £5,000,000 is more or less misleading, as the fund has been mortgaged already to the extent of £2,000,000.  By whom has it been mortgaged?  How has the money been spent?  It has been mortgaged by and during the term of office of the régime we have here at present.  It does not matter whether you call it Fine Gael or Cumann na nGaedheal&mdash; it is the same régime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Duffy, quoting from the <i>Irish Press</i>, said last night that a raid had been made on this fund.  No raid has been possible.  What is really done and what is proposed in this Bill <Col N="738" /> is not a raid on the fund, but a mortgage on the future of the fund.  That is one of the things to which we in this House should not be a party.</P>
    <P>During the emergency the people in towns and cities were dependent on rural Ireland for their food and fuel&mdash; dependent on the workers for whom we were proposing last night a week or a fortnight's holidays.  The roads of the country were torn up and got into a state of disrepair during that period because of three things: first, the lack of materials; secondly, the employment of our people on the production of the things essential to the maintenance of the position we occupied at that time; and thirdly, the need to maintain our people in the cities and towns.  I do not propose to go over again the quotations which I gave last night, but we have it on the authority of the Taoiseach, who quoted from a minute of a Cabinet meeting held by the Fianna Fáil Government, that it was their intention that a sum of about £2,500,000 would be made available to the local authorities to enable them to put our roads back into the state of repair in which they were before the emergency.</P>
    <P>The Minister may, and I am sure will, say that there was no definite decision at that meeting, but he told us a very interesting story last night. He told us that, while that Fianna Fáil Cabinet meeting was being held, at which the Government were considering what might be done to maintain and improve the roads, another meeting was being held, and that, as a result of that other meeting, held behind closed doors, and the bargain entered into at that meeting, we have to-day the present state of affairs.  I pride myself on having drawn the statement from the Minister that, as far back as 13th February, negotiations were entered into and decisions made as to what was to be the composition of the future Government, by the present Cabinet.  I assume that, as a result of that discussion behind closed doors, there was an allocation of Ministries&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>

I accept the ruling of the Chair on this occasion with reluctance, and, as I say, I give notice that I propose to raise the question of the rights of a member of the House. We have been put here not by the people of the country but because of undertakings entered into, as I now understand, not on 18th February, but on 13th February.  We have that definite statement that the present Government was set up, not on 18th February, but on 13th February.</P>

The proposal before the House is that this Bill be returned to the Dáil, and I propose to put before the House a few reasons why it should not be returned to the Dáil and why the House should not pass it.  I propose to put forward reasons sufficient to influence you, Sir, into allowing me to continue my speech.  Have Senators seriously addressed their minds to the question which the Bill raises?  We are mortgaging the future of a fund over which we have no control.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not.  This is the first time I have mentioned that we make provision in this Bill for something which is not before the House.  We are empowering the Minister to mortgage the future of the Road Fund to the extent of £3,210,000. I have asked the Minister to give us a statement as to the annual contribution to the Road Fund and as to the number of years covered by this mortgage. We know that, from 1926 to 1931, this system of drawing from the fund continued, and that, on the advent of a Fianna Fáil Government, when it was proposed to engage in road development on an extensive scale, there was no fund, because it had already been mortgaged.  Senator Duffy told us about the raids on the funds in various <Col N="742" /> years.  I remind Senator Duffy that during the régime of Fianna Fáil all the moneys drawn from this fund were utilised, not for the relief of taxation, as he put forward last night, but for the development of our roads, our main and county roads and on our employment schemes, and I am sure that Senator Duffy will admit, when he reads over his statement, that the statement he made was misleading, that the people who supplied him with the information misled him, because whatever moneys from the Road Fund were utilised by the former Government were utilised not for the relief of general taxation but for the improvement and development of our roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to deal with the points made by Senator Hawkins. I am concerned with one matter, <Col N="743" /> with the rate of interest at which these advances will be made by the Exchequer to the Road Fund.  That is a very important matter because, as I understand it, the actual advances which will be made under this Bill will amount to about £2,790,000.  Already a sum of £210,000 is available by way of advances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure is £3,210,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the total amount that can be advanced under the Bill.  If the Minister is prepared to make those advances at the rate of one per cent it would cost the Road Fund about £85,000.  In other words, they can get £3,000,000 now for capital development, for the remaking and rebuilding of roads at less than £100,000 per year, if the Minister makes it available at one per cent.  That is considerably less than the sums withdrawn from the Road Fund by the previous Government for Exchequer purposes.</P>

We gave him 24 hours from last night in which to prepare his brief, and I was hoping that he would read the speeches of Deputy Aiken, a former Minister for Finance, and of Mr. Séan T. O'Kelly, the President, also a former Minister for Finance.  Each of them made statements in which they asserted they were taking money from the Road Fund for specific purposes and they gave the purposes.  In 1936-37, £100,000 was taken by way of advances from the Road Fund and put to this Exchequer Extra Receipt for Vote 73 for unemployment schemes but not necessarily for roads.  I do not deny that the money was spent on roads, but I do not know how it was spent.  All I know is that the money was assigned to the <Col N="744" /> Minister for Finance and put into the Exchequer Extra Receipt for Vote 73. In 1937-38 the Minister for Finance again withdrew £100,000 and put this money into the Exchequer Extra Receipt for Vote 69 which has also to do with relief schemes or some kind of employment schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving Senator Hawkins the facts.  These are facts as set out by the Minister for Finance when asking Dáil Eireann to approve of a motion for his taking £100,000 from the Road Fund and attributed in various ways to the relief of taxation. There was no pretence from that day onward that the Minister was raiding the Road Fund for the purposes of using the money for anything in relation to unemployment or in relation to relief schemes.  In 1939 the then Minister for Finance took £150,000 for the general purposes of the Exchequer, as stated by himself.  Senators can read the Budget speech, in which it was admitted by the Minister that this money was taken out because there was no opportunity of using it then and that it was taken away to relieve general taxation.  In 1940-41 he again took £100,000, not to build roads or for the purposes of repairing bog roads, but for the relief of taxation, in order to relieve the income-tax and the surtax payers.  These were the people who got the relief.  In each of the subsequent years, 1941-42, 1942-43, 1943-44 and 1944-45, £100,000 was taken away from the Road Fund for the purposes of general taxation.  Nothing was taken away in the years 1945-46 and 1946-47, but the former Minister for Finance, Mr. Aiken, took away £200,000 in 1947-48 for the purposes of the Exchequer.  I am addressing a question to the Minister for Finance in relation to the rate of interest because if the Minister can give these advances to the Road Fund at a rate of even 2 per cent., it would cost the Road Fund less than the raids made upon it by his predecessor for the purposes of general taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hawkins disagrees, but there is no use in his pretending, by shaking his head, that those are not the facts. <Col N="745" /> They are the facts and they are incontrovertible. It is not because I want to contradict or correct Senator Hawkins that I am giving these facts, but merely for the purpose of getting some assurance from the Minister for Finance that advances given under this Bill for the purpose of the Road Fund will be advances at a reasonable rate of interest and to ensure that the Road Fund is not going to be saddled with paying high rates of interest to the Exchequer.  I am not concerned with refuting Senator Hawkins' charges. Most of them were made because he did not take the trouble to check the facts.  Certainly I would not accuse the Senator of misleading the House knowingly, but he did attempt to mislead the House without making himself conversant with the facts.  I think that what I have said here cannot be challenged.  I am not making these assertions for the purpose of challenging what has been said by Senator Hawkins, but for the specific purpose of ensuring that the Exchequer is not going to make a profit at the expense of the Road Fund.  In other words, that this £3,000,00 will be advanced at a normal rate of interest and will not impose an undue or unfair burden on the Road Fund.</P>

      <P>There is an aspect of this Bill that I have not heard satisfactorily discussed yet and that is the aspect of motor taxation.  I wonder can the Minister assure us of the policy of the Government in regard to motor taxation as a consequence of this Bill. Quite recently we motorists have suffered a very considerable increase in the annual taxation of cars.  It has been very excessive on some of us, particularly those of us who have old cars, with the problem of their disposal.  It has also affected those who do not own cars because industries and businesses who have lorries have imposed a minimum delivery charge which many think was not justified.  I would like to know if, as a consequence of this Bill, there will be further taxation.  That is very important for people with secondhand cars in particular.  I hope that the Minister will consider returning taxation to its ordinary level.</P>

      <P>If I may answer the last speaker first, this Bill has nothing to do with road taxation of motor vehicles and what is being drawn from the Road Fund this year is on the basis of existing taxation which we are carrying on.  I am not prophesying in regard to the future.  I do not know what the cost of making the roads in the future is likely to be and I do not know the rate at which cars will come on the road or what new registrations will be like.  But the Road Fund looks pretty healthy at the moment.  Because of the great relief, however, that this will mean for local areas it will be a big burden on the fund.  The periods of repayment or the interest payment periods have not yet been decided but there is no prospect of advances at less than I per cent. or anything like it.</P>

      <P>The loan rate of the Department is 3¼ per cent., and that is the point at which the State can borrow.  I would like to remind Senators that local authorities are now getting 65 per cent. of all their own charges from the Central Fund, whereas pre-war local authorities were aided only to the extent of 19 per cent. To-day local authorities are getting an enormous subvention.  With regard to the controversy between Senator Duffy and Senator Hawkins, as far as my information goes, I must side with Senator Duffy.  The moneys that were drawn out of the Road Fund were drawn for the purposes of the general Exchequer, a total of £900,000.  In only two years the money was appropriated to employment schemes, but I must say it was a peculiar device if it was spent on roads, because the money was drawn from the Road Fund, which was for the purposes of maintaining the roads and devoted to employment schemes which included a certain amount of road work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.  It was used for unemployment schemes and these may have included some road work, but even leaving out those two years a sum of £900,000 was raided out of this fund for general Exchequer purposes, for the relief of taxation.  I do not regard this as an evil.  It is ridiculous to suggest that in 1932 the Road Fund was so mortgaged that there was no money available for expenditure on the roads.  I have not the full records of the previous years before the critical year of 1932, but I do know it would look as if from 1926 to 1932 there was no requirement as to the repayment of advances.  All that was asked for was the payment of interest.</P>
      <P>The first funding operation, as far as I can make out, took place in the year 1933, but it is completely ludicrous, and, of course, the statement was made without any basis of fact, to say that there was no money in the Road Fund, that it was all mortgaged for the repayment of advances.  The thing simply could not happen.  In any event, there is no evidence that it did happen.  All the evidence is to the contrary.</P>
      <P>If the rate of interest was 3¼ per cent., and if the annuity period was ten years, then, on a borrowing of £3,000,000, the annuity would be in the region of £360,000&mdash;something short of that.  On a £2,250,000 borrowing it would be about £250,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Before formally moving the motion, I would like to express the pleasure I think most of us feel at the first appearance in this House of the Minister for External Affairs and to bid him welcome.  I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Eireann directs the attention of the Government to the <Col N="748" /> resolutions in favour of a United Europe which were passed at the Congress of Europe at The Hague and requests the Minister for External Affairs to make a statement.</P>
    <P>I move this resolution because I believe that the attention of the Government and of the people of Ireland should be drawn to the movement towards European unity which is gaining substantial support amongst members of all political Parties except the Communists in the States of Western Europe.</P>
    <P>For years our people were insular in their outlook and only a small minority took a real interest in international affairs.  During the war we were prevented by the censorship from reading any news which the powers that be thought might interfere with our neutrality, and, generally speaking, the Government during that period discouraged too much interest or curiosity on the part of the man in the street in what was taking place in Europe.</P>
    <P>A change took place after the end of the war, and I think I am correct in stating that there is now much more interest in European affairs than there has been for a long time.  By sending food to those parts of Europe which were suffering acutely as a result of the war we recognised in a practical way that we had a special duty towards other countries in the continent of which we form a part.  Our participation in the Marshall Plan and in the councils of the 16 nations is another indication of the fact that we are vitally interested in the rehabilitation of Europe.</P>
    <P>Can the peace of the world be maintained if Europe remains divided into political and economic units?  Can any European nation stand alone against the dangers with which it is threatened? Can a divided Europe maintain principles of democracy, the belief in individual freedom and the faith in human brotherhood and the ultimate equality of man in the sight of God which is essential to our Christian tradition?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> The advocates of a United Europe believe that the answer to all these questions is in the negative, and they further believe that the spread of Communism can only be checked if the countries in Europe who believe in the principles of freedom will unite in an effective way to combat it.</P>
    <P>The Congress of Europe which met at The Hague from May 7th-10th, was arranged by a number of nongovernmental organisations who had for some years been advocating the principle of European unity.  It was, therefore, strictly unofficial and the members of the conference consisted of persons who had accepted invitations as individuals and not as delegates from their respective countries.  They met as co-Europeans.  In spite of its unofficial character it was probably one of the most remarkable and most representative international gatherings ever held.  I see from one report of the conference that there were 16 ex-Prime Ministers.  I am not particularly well up in ex-Prime Ministers, and I only counted seven.  They were Mr. Churchill of Great Britain, Messrs. Paul Remadier, Edouard Daladier and Paul Reynaud of France, Paul van Zeeland of Belgium, Senor Negrin of Spain, and Knud Kristensen of Denmark. In addition there were many ex-Ministers and other well-known personages, but the unique character of the conference lay less in the number of prominent men and women who attended, than in the fact that all the various political colours in Europe except Communist red, took part in a spirit of co-operation aiming at one common objective.  Ireland was represented by five, two from the Six Counties&mdash;Mr. Fred Thompson, M.P., Deputy Speaker of the Northern Parliament, and Archdeacon Hannon. Senator Miss Butler, Professor Tierney and I attended, and we were very glad of the opportunity of co-operating with our colleagues from the North on a question of common interest.</P>
    <P>I would like also, if I would be allowed, to say that everyone who attended the congress at The Hague was enormously impressed by the welcome we received from the Dutch <Col N="750" /> Government and the Dutch people and with the very generous hospitality which was given to everyone.  I think it is only right that I should put that on record on behalf of those of us who attended from this country.</P>
    <P>The main work of the conference was done by three committees&mdash;political, economic and cultural.  Senator Miss Butler attended the economic committee, Prof. Tierney the cultural committee, and I attended the political committee.  These three committees submitted resolutions which, after some minor amendments had been made, were adopted by the whole conference. It is to these resolutions that I wish to draw the attention of the Seanad, but before reading them I ought to explain that they should be taken as expressing the views of the conference in very general terms.  As one of the leading speakers pointed out, the conference was not passing legislation, and it would have been quite impracticable in a four-day conference to have drafted any resolution which would be unanimously agreed to in every detail by 800 persons.</P>
    <P>I propose to read the three resolutions as I feel that they are of sufficient importance to be on the records of the House.</P>
    <P>I will take the political resolution first:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The ravages wrought by six years of war and by the occupation, the diminution of world food production, the destruction of industrial capacity, the creation of huge debts, the maintenance of military expenditure out of all proportion to the resources of the people, the shifting of economic power, the rancours left by war, the progressive evils of nationalism and the absence, despite the work of the United Nations Organisation, of an international authority sufficiently strong to provide law and order, constitute an unprecedented menace to the well-being and the security of the peoples of Europe and threaten them with ruin.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the principles and objectives set out in the Political Report submitted by the International <Col N="751" /> Committee of the Movements for European Unity:</P>
    <P Just="Center">THE CONGRESS</P>
    <P>(1) Recognises that it is the urgent duty of the nations of Europe to create an economic and political union in order to assure security and social progress.</P>
    <P>(2) Notes with approval the recent steps which have been taken by some European Governments in the direction of economic and political co-operation, but believes that in the present emergency the organisations created are by themselves insufficient to provide any lasting remedy.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SOVEREIGN RIGHTS.</P>
    <P>(3) Declares that the time has come when the European nations must transfer and merge some portion of their sovereign rights so as to secure common political and economic action for the integration and proper development of their common resources.</P>
    <P>(4) Considers that any union or federation of Europe should be designed to protect the security of its constituent peoples, should be free from outside control, and should not be directed against any other nation.</P>
    <P>(5) Assigns to a united Europe the immediate task of establishing progressively a democratic social system, the aim of which shall be to free men from all types of slavery and economic insecurity, just as political democracy aims at protecting them against the exercise of arbitrary power.</P>
    <P>(6) Affirms that the integration of Germany in a united or federated Europe alone provides a solution to both the economic and political aspects of the German problem.</P>
    <P>(7) Declares that the union or federation must assist in assuring the economic, political and cultural advancement of the populations of the overseas territories associated with it, without prejudice to the <Col N="752" /> special ties which now link these territories to European countries.</P>
    <P Just="Center">EUROPEAN ASSEMBLY.</P>
    <P>(8) Demands the convening, as a matter of real urgency, of a European Assembly chosen by the Parliaments of the participating nations, from among their members and others, designed</P>
    <P>(a) to stimulate and give expression to European public opinion;</P>
    <P>(b) to advise upon immediate practical measures designed progressively to bring about the necessary economic and political union of Europe;</P>
    <P>(c) to examine the juridical and constitutional implications arising out of the creation of such a union or federation and their economic and social consequences;</P>
    <P>(d) to prepare the necessary plans for the above purposes.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CHARTER OF HUMAN RIGHTS.</P>
    <P>(9) Considers that the resultant union or federation should be open to all European nations democratically governed and which undertake to respect a Charter of Human Rights.</P>
    <P>(10)  Resolves that a commission should be set up to undertake immediately the double task of drafting such a charter and of laying down standards to which a State must conform if it is to deserve the name of a democracy.</P>
    <P>(11) Declares that in no circumstances shall a State be entitled to be called a democracy unless it does, in fact as well as in law, guarantee to its citizens liberty of thought, assembly and expression, as well as the right to form a political opposition.</P>
    <P>(12) Requests that this commission should report within three months on its labours.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SUPREME COURT.</P>
    <P>(13) Is convinced that in the interests of human values and <Col N="753" /> human liberty, the Assembly should make proposals for the establishment of a court of justice with adequate sanctions for the implementation of this charter, and to this end any citizen of the associated countries shall have redress before the court, at any time and with the least possible delay, of any violation of his rights as formulated in the charter.</P>
    <P Just="Center">WORLD UNITY.</P>
    <P>(14) Declares that the creation of a united Europe is an essential element in the creation of a united world.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The most important part of this resolution which I have just read is the suggestion that a European Assembly should be convened as soon as possible and that it should be chosen by the Parliaments of the countries of Europe who are willing to participate.  It would be the function of this Assembly to consider what practical measures can be taken towards political and economic unity in Europe.  It would, presumably, be for such an Assembly to recommend the extent to which the European nations must transfer a portion of their sovereign rights in order to make a federated union of Europe possible.</P>
    <P>This seems to me to be the crux of the whole problem.  Without some surrender of sovereignty no real federation is possible.  United action could conceivably take place by agreement from time to time, but it would be always liable to fail in time of emergency if every nation maintained its absolute sovereign rights.  If I had been asked a few years ago if there was any possibility of the larger and more powerful nations being willing to surrender a portion of their sovereignty for the sake of unity or security, I would have answered emphatically &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  After attending the Congress of Europe at The Hague, I am by no means so sure that this is impossible.  To see and hear leading statesmen from large and powerful countries like England and France openly and vigorously advocating the surrender by their own <Col N="754" /> nations of a portion of their sovereign powers was to me an event of striking importance.  Smaller nations, however strong their national outlook and feelings may be, have always known they could only exercise their full sovereign powers with discretion and to some extent with an eye on their powerful neighbours.  It is, therefore, not so surprising that the motions in favour of a Federal Europe are strong in countries like Belgium and Holland.  Small nations are not likely to show any real unwillingness to surrender a portion of their sovereignty if and when they are perfectly satisfied that an equal surrender is being made at the same time by more powerful nations.</P>
    <P>Personally, I am of the opinion that the time is ripe for the creation of a European Assembly, provided that it does not attempt too much.  The powers delegated to it should be confined to matters on which a common interest is fully recognised by the peoples of the democratic States of Europe, and they should be the minimum necessary to make united action practicable in a time of emergency. I may be wrong, but I feel that the worst enemies of a united Europe are those persons who want to attempt too much and who fail to recognise that national feeling is a genuine thing in the hearts of the people in many countries and should not be confused with the flag waving which often denotes only a superficial or spurious nationalism.  I believe that a healthy and honest nationalism is as necessary to internationalism as a high standard of individual character is essential to a good society.</P>
    <P>There were some people at the Congress of Europe who would like to see a federated Europe in which the individual States would have no more power than that exercised by States in the American Union.  Even if this be desirable, and I do not think it is, it could only come about very gradually and as the result of a complete change of attitude on the part of the people generally.</P>
    <P>By all means let us learn that we are Europeans with many interests in common, but to do this it is quite <Col N="755" /> unnecessary to forget that we are Irish, French, Dutch or Belgians and so on.</P>
    <P>One of the most difficult problems to be solved in any scheme however moderate of federation will be that of representation in a European Parliament. When Monsieur Reynaud of France proposed in the Political Committee that a European Assembly should be summoned at once with one elected member for every 1,000,000 inhabitants, it was at once opposed by the smaller nations.  I took no part in the Committee as I felt it was better to be there as an observer, but when the proposal was put forward in all seriousness then I thought it better to put down my name.  Long before my name was reached the proposal was vigorously opposed by several speakers on behalf of the smaller nations.  A Belgian representative suggested that there would have to be two Chambers in a European Parliament, one Chamber elected on the basis of population and the other with an equal number of representatives from each nation whether large or small.  This obviously appealed to representatives of the smaller nations, but it is by no means certain that it would find favour with larger states.  It would take up too much of the time of the House for me to deal with the proposals for a Charter of Human Rights or with the right of individuals to appeal on the interpretation of such a charter to a Supreme Court, but I may say that I do not see how you can ever have any measure of federation unless you had some such provision.  I think a Supreme Court would be essential.</P>
    <P>The economic and social resolution proposed by the Economic Committee was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Europe is now confronted by a great crisis and a great opportunity. Its old economic system has been shattered by the war.  Thanks to the generous assistance of the United States of America there is a unique opportunity to build a new and better Europe if Europeans work together under a common plan to develop the economic strength of the <Col N="756" /> Continent.  There is no hope of recovery if each country simply strives to rebuild its national economy by the old methods.  Under modern conditions Europe can only achieve the standard of living which it ought to enjoy if its industrial and natural resources are developed on continental lines.  But progress in this direction will only be achieved if it is accompanied at every step by a parallel policy of ever-closer political union.  Europe must unite if it is to regain and surpass its former prosperity and reassert its economic independence.</P>
    <P>The exigencies of modern economic development must be reconciled with the integrity of human personality. In any economic organisation such as we envisage it must be decided where the responsibility rests; and in order to avoid any tendency towards totalitarianism and to safeguard the economic independence of the individual, the workers and their representative organisations should be closely associated with the setting up and development of the economy of united Europe.</P>
    <P Just="Center">THE CONGRESS</P>
    <P>(1)  Recognises that no attempt to rebuild the economy of Europe upon the basis of rigidly-divided national sovereignty can prove successful.</P>
    <P>(2)  Affirms the urgent need for an economic union in Europe.</P>
    <P>(3)  Declares that this union must maintain and progressively adjust the economic ties which at present link the countries of Europe with the Dominions and associated States or dependent territories overseas.</P>
    <P>(4)  Welcomes the initial measures taken by certain Governments towards closer economic co-operation, or towards regional groupings; and expresses the hope that the work of the conference of the 16 nations will lead to conclusions favourable to the success of European union.</P>
    <P Just="Center">IMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATIONS.</P>
    <P>(5)  Urges all the Governments concerned forthwith to proclaim their <Col N="757" /> determination to promote economic union and to put into effect the immediate economic measures required.</P>
    <P>These should include measures designed:</P>
    <P>(a)  TRADE.</P>
    <P>(i)  To remove step by step and, as soon as possible, finally abolish the obstacles to trade within the union which result from quotas and import or export prohibitions.</P>
    <P>(ii)  To reduce and, wherever possible, completely eliminate customs duties between the member States.</P>
    <P>(b)  CURRENCY.</P>
    <P>(i)  To restore budgetary equilibrium which is a first essential for the stability of currencies in each country and to reduce by all available means&mdash;including monetary policy&mdash;the disparities of prices and wages which are incompatible with the freedom of the exchanges.</P>
    <P>(ii)  To take early steps to establish multilateral clearings, or through the adjustment of exchange values, to set up areas within which the exchange of goods shall not be handicapped by currency controls.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Thus to pave the way for the free convertibility of currencies and the gradual restoration of freedom of trade among the countries of Europe.</P>
    <P>(c)  PRODUCTION.</P>
    <P>(i)  To promote a common programme for the development of agricultural resources and the provision of the necessary equipment, in order to provide Europe with the highest possible nutritional standard.</P>
    <P>(ii)  To encourage technical or regional industrial specialisation and the renewal and modernisation of the technical means of production.</P>
    <P>(iii)  To plan and carry into effect a co-ordinated programme of development for the basic industries of the whole area.  This should <Col N="758" /> include the production and fair distribution of the coal resources of united Europe as well as the expansion of its electric power and the co-ordination and rationalisation of communications.</P>
    <P>(iv)  And in general to draw up an overall production programme utilising the resources and equipment of European countries in conformity with the needs of their peoples.</P>
    <P>(d)  LABOUR.</P>
    <P>(i)  To raise to the greatest possible extent the standard of living of the populations of Europe in particular by all the above measures which are designed to increase production, and to invite the professional, economic and social organisations of the various countries to study together ways and means of increasing production still further and rationalising distribution while improving social conditions and ensuring a fair distribution of the product of economic activity.</P>
    <P>(ii)  To promote the mobility of labour to the maximum possible extent, while assuring to migrant workers and their families the standard of wages, social security, living conditions, and conditions of employment prevailing in the country to which they come.</P>
    <P>(iii)  To co-ordinate their economic policies so as to secure full employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not propose to read the whole of this resolution, which goes on to claim that there should be ultimate objectives which are</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  the free circulation of capital;</P>
    <P>(b)  the unification of currencies;</P>
    <P>(c)  the co-ordination of budgetary and credit policy;</P>
    <P>(d)  a full customs union, involving the abolition of all barriers to the movement of goods; and</P>
    <P>(e)  the co-ordination of social legislation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="759" /> This is a somewhat complicated resolution and is possibly difficult to follow when read, but I believe that the ideals set forth in it will meet with considerable approval in this country amongst those who may read it.  It provides material for much thought and if discussed in this House it would probably take several days.</P>
    <P>It will be noticed that the resolution sets out what are described as &ldquo;first methods&rdquo; and &ldquo;ultimate objectives.&rdquo; While I am in general sympathy with these objectives, I am by no means convinced that it is possible or necessary to abolish all quota or tariff restrictions on trade.  That these can be reduced substantially, as part of a united effort, I have no doubt, but the smaller nations who will form an important part of any federated Europe will have to see that there is enough work for the people who desire to remain in their own countries.  I feel that it will be a long time before the smaller nations can afford to surrender their rights to afford some measure of protection to native industry. Therefore, while I am in sympathy with the ideal of the resolution, I am sceptical of the proposal for a full customs union as an ultimate objective.</P>
    <P>The cultural resolution was of considerable importance, as practically all the European universities were represented at the congress&mdash;and Professor Tierney was very much in his element. I had intended to read the cultural resolution, but as it has taken a certain amount of time to read the others, I think it may not be necessary, since it does not deal so fundamentally with the question of European union.  My own feeling is that, if there is to be any scheme or any measure of federal Europe the vital thing is that, while there should be the greatest possible interchange on a cultural level, there should be no attempt of any kind to suggest that the national culture of any nation could be interfered with or is at all likely to be interfered with.  It seems to me that the essence of workability of any scheme must be the full recognition of national characteristics and <Col N="760" /> that every nation must develop and maintain its own characteristics&mdash;at any rate, in so far as it believes in them.  I believe in unity, but I have no belief whatever in uniformity.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say that I believe this movement towards European unity cannot be ignored.  It is based partly on high idealism and partly on fear of what may happen to democratic Europe if war breaks out before some measure of unity has been achieved.  Although the objective is a united Europe, it is perfectly clear that at the present time the only practicable proposal is a federation of the Western European nations who still believe in democratic principles and who could conceivably agree to a charter of human rights.  If any Government in Europe would be prepared to take the first step and would propose the summoning of a European Assembly, as suggested in the political resolution, I believe it would receive widespread support in most if not all the Western European nations.  An all-Party delegation was received by the Prime Minister in Great Britain a short time ago.  Mr. Attlee promised to examine, with the Foreign Secretary, Mr. Bevin, the detailed proposals in the resolutions and, in particular, the proposal for the convening of a European Assembly.  So far, he has not announced the result of this examination and, personally, I do not expect that he will do so until the present tension in relation to Germany has eased, as we all hope it will.</P>
    <P>I do not for a moment suggest that our Government should take any action, but I do commend these resolutions to members of the Oireachtas as well worthy of study.  I commend the movement to the Government as something which it should watch with sympathetic interest.  More than that, I do not suggest.  I believe these resolutions deal with matters of the utmost possible public importance and that what is done ultimately in relation to them may have a very considerable bearing on the future peace of Europe and of the world, in which we are all very much interested.  As the main object of the resolution is to make it <Col N="761" /> possible for the Minister for External Affairs to make a statement and as I want to leave an opportunity of speaking to other members of the House, I have tried to make my remarks as brief as possible, consistent with giving the essence of what is in the resolution.</P>

      <P>Before we proceed to discuss this matter, I want to make a suggestion.  I should like to congratulate Senator Douglas on his very exhaustive report of the proceedings at this conference, but, at the same time, I feel that Senators should have these resolutions in printed form before discussing them.  I make the suggestion that we should postpone the discussion and not request the Minister to make a statement straight away, until Senators have all the resolutions before them and time to study them in all their implications.  I feel that it is an unfair advantage to take of the Minister when the world is in such a state of chaos and confusion.  Mr. Attlee's name has been mentioned, and he and his advisers have not come to any decision yet on these matters.  I suggest that we postpone the discussion until we have the full information before us, because none of us can memorise all these resolutions that have been read out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EleanorButler" hpid="Miss Butler Miss Butler">
      <NameTxt>Miss Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pleasure in seconding this resolution.  I do so for two reasons: first, that I believe, having been present at the Congress of Europe, that a United States of Europe, beginning perhaps with a Union of Western Europe, is well within the bounds of possibility within the next few years and is no longer a Utopian dream.  It can no longer be dismissed as a Utopian ideal when one realises that 760 people came together, representing every political Party in Europe, except the Communist Party, representing every creed and every nationality, high dignitaries of churches, including the representative of the Vatican, ex-Prime Ministers and other statesmen, poets, writers and scholars of every denomination who, if not officially representing Governments in power, cannot be dismissed and of whom it cannot be said <Col N="762" /> that they do not represent a very strong and definite voice in Europe.</P>
      <P>Because I believe western union as a first step towards a united Europe is well within the bounds of possibility within the next few years, I think the time has come when the Government of Ireland should make known to the people of Ireland the existence and strength of such a movement on the Continent and should consider what steps they would be prepared to take if they were suddenly faced with the question of making the decision.  I believe that it is possible, in the present troubled state of the world, that they may be called upon at quite short notice to make a decision. Therefore, I feel that the sooner the whole question is discussed in Parliament and made known to the country as a whole the better.</P>
      <P>Senator Douglas has outlined to the House the work of the congress and the scope of its resolutions.  Over 20 nations were represented, from Iceland to Greece, from Finland to Portugal. Exiled representatives of States which were not represented because of their Communist views were present and all were agreed that the salvation of Europe and the only hope for the future of Europe lay in agreement upon a united Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second reason I support the motion is that those who took part in the conference and who were inspired by the discussions there and the amount of co-operation between such varying points of view pledged themselves to make known to their respective Governments what had happened. None of the Press reports I saw when I returned from The Hague gave any clear indication of the atmosphere of that conference.  Points were stressed in accordance with the policies of newspapers and very little of the actual discussion that went on appeared in the reports.  I refer, of course, to the British and Irish newspapers&mdash;I saw only one American newspaper and that did not seem to have any grasp of the trend of discussion. The most impressive feature of the conference was the amount of agreement between the varying points <Col N="763" /> of view.  There was, of course, a tremendous amount of difference as to the ways and means of bringing into effect a united Europe, but there was this unifying point between them all, a common belief in democracy, a hatred of injustice and a common Christian tradition which they were all prepared to recognise as being the basis of a way of life which we all share.  No one, I hope, would deny that Ireland shares these beliefs and considers herself part of that common tradition.</P>
    <P>There have been only two traditions of civilisation, as we know it, in Western Europe, one, the classical, and the other the Christian.  It is a matter for argument and for historical difference of opinion as to how far we were affected by the classical tradition, but there is no argument as to our participation in the Christian civilisation.  We have our strong links through the Christian Church with Europe, and in the past we undoubtedly played our part through our contribution to the Christianisation of other countries and the general building up of the civilisation which followed.  Our history has been a troubled one&mdash;one of continuous struggle for freedom, but always linked with movements which were taking place in the world outside, and the movements which produced our patriots and our poets were more directly connected with European movements than, perhaps, with even our own internal struggles.  Even the Flight of the Earls, the 1798 Rebellion, and the rebellions of 1830 and 1848, were but offshoots of a wider European movement.  It is only within recent years that the thoughts of our people have been turned inwards and our minds allowed to dwell exclusively upon our own grievances.  It may be entirely coincidental that, in this inward process, the majority of our people have become more apathetic and take less interest in political affairs, and, I may even say, in the interests of their own country, than ever before.</P>
    <P>But there is a far more serious thought, that is, the danger to the Irish people of losing their judgment of what really matters&mdash;in other words, their <Col N="764" /> sense of values&mdash;the danger of becoming a nation, which, in an age when all admit that civilisation, as we know it, freedom, justice, the rule of law and democracy are all doomed to perish, unless a united stand is made, is incapable of deciding to play its part because of an internal grievance, incapable of deciding what the primary issue of our times is, incapable of visioning not only possibilities which such European co-operation could open for Europe as a whole, but the possibilities it offers to all those who believe in democracy and freedom of the hope of a third alternative, a middle course for Europe, a European solution based on a common Christian tradition and a common cultural tradition.</P>
    <P>In accepting our part in the European recovery plan, we have accepted, like all the other 16 countries, certain ties and a certain common policy with the rest of Europe.  In accepting these common ties and common policies with the rest of Europe, we have to a certain extent created a tie with the United States.  I am not in any way criticising this state of affairs.  I am merely making the point that we have, in certain respects and in common with the rest of Europe, tied ourselves to the United States economically over a period, the duration of which we do not definitely know at the moment. This common tie with the rest of Europe made it, in my opinion, more necessary than ever before for European countries to get together and to discuss together how they can maintain their political freedom, how they can find a European solution of their own problems politically.  There is nothing new in this idea of a united Europe.  It is one which has been considered through the ages.</P>
    <P>The resolutions which were put forward were merely put forward as a basis of discussion so that there would be something there if it was decided to send representatives to the Assembly on which to start a discussion.  The resolutions have already been dealt with by Senator Douglas and I do not propose to discuss them or to repeat them, but there are a few points that I would like to emphasise.  As regards <Col N="765" /> the political resolutions, I would like to emphasise the fact that it was considered the urgent duty of the nations of Europe to create an economic and political union.  Senator Douglas referred to the third resolution.  It declares that the time has come when European nations must transfer and merge some portion of their sovereign rights.  I would like to see that statement reading that the time has come for European nations to exercise generally a certain portion of their sovereign rights, without any question of transferring or merging them.  I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fourth resolution, which says that Congress</P>
    <P>&ldquo;considers that any union or federation of Europe should be designed to protect the security of its constituent peoples, should be free from outside control and should not be directed against any other nation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that with that spirit and approach only will Europe find its own solution to-day.  As regards the other resolutions under the political heading, I can sympathise with Senator Anthony, who feels that without having the text before us and having time to study it there would be no point in discussing them in detail. There is only one other point on the political resolution to which I would like to refer and that is resolution No. 9.  It suggests that the congress considers that the resultant union or federation should be open to all European nations democratically governed.  The door is open to every country in Europe which is democratically governed and willing to undertake and respect the charter of human rights.  Surely a nation such as Ireland, which cherishes so much the value of human rights, would be prepared to make some contribution to a commission to be set up to undertake the drawing up of this charter.  Senator Douglas has already referred to the influences which the smaller nations can exercise and did exercise in the drawing up of the resolutions on determining the basis of representation on a European Assembly, if such were ever to come into existence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> I personally took part in the economic committee and perhaps I should say a few words on this subject. Of all the Press reports those relating to the economic committee were most misleading.  The first difficulty that arose was whether it was more urgent to set up an economic committee of United Europe or whether economic steps should follow the political steps. It was felt very strongly by European countries that the structural changes necessary for the setting up of a political organisation would of necessity be slow and that the urgency of the present situation demanded the immediate setting up of some sort of economic committee or council.  It was clearly recognised that any attempt to bolster up the <i>status quo</i> or any attempt to return to the conditions of 1939 would not in any way meet the present European situation.  It was clearly obvious that any economic council would have to be free from outside control.  In this connection I feel it is only right to mention that it was pointed out that in view of the Marshall Plan and the debt which many countries owed to America some form of co-operation with America should be maintained in the setting up of such an economic committee.  This point was put forward by Norway, the only country that supported this point of view.  It was immediately pointed out by other nations that this would defeat the real object of an independent European movement.  Countries, while thanking God for what America had done for many of them, pointed out that we were gathered there at The Hague for the purposes of finding a third alternative to the two blocks that have unfortunately crystallised in Europe to-day.  In admitting America directly to the economic council they would prejudice the possibility of finding this third alternative.  There is one other point in connection with the economic council, and that is that at a later stage of the conference when the resolutions of this economic committee were presented to the Congress as a whole, the American observer stated the views of the American Congress, and in doing so, discussed the question of Marshall Aid and how it <Col N="767" /> affected the proposals for a European movement for unity.  He was frank enough to admit America's reasons for aiding Europe as being roughly half and half between the desire to keep American industry going and prevent a possible slump and of maintaining the way of life which every American values and which every American believes would be endangered if Western Europe were to collapse.  That frank admission in that statement that America views the proposals for a united Europe with approval was of immense interest to those present.</P>
    <P>One other point of information he gave the congress was that recently an economic survey of Europe had been made and that potentially, taking the boundaries of Europe as in 1939, Europe was as rich in raw materials as the United States of America and the Soviet Union of Russia, that because of its internal divisions, because of its national frontiers, all this potential strength was dissipated and ineffective as a force in the world.</P>
    <P>Some people might wonder why the conference was held at all if it was unofficial. It was because&mdash;this is my personal view&mdash;certain steps had been taken and so much had been done that those who represent the movement for a united Europe felt that it would be of benefit to bring together all the support possible, to give all the publicity possible to the movement.</P>
    <P>As early as 1940 a definite step towards a united Europe was made when Britain offered joint citizenship to France.  In 1943 General Smuts, speaking in the South African Parliament, suggested that the time had come when, in addition to her position as the centre of the Commonwealth, Great Britain should work more closely with like-minded democracies in Europe.  In 1947, the Anglo-French Treaty was made, the Treaty of Dunkirk, which provided, not only for mutual defence, but for economic consolidation. Earlier an Anglo-French Economic Committee had been set up. In 1947 the Benelux Customs Union was formed and during the same period numerous measures and discussions <Col N="768" /> of colonial co-operation were taking place.  Discussions were also held between European Colonial Powers in respect of their overseas territories.</P>
    <P>The greatest impetus towards this movement for a united Europe came in June, 1947, with Mr. Marshall's suggestion, and, later, with the 16 nations participating in the Marshall Plan.  It should be remembered that this offer was made to the whole of Europe, including Russia.  The Paris Conference of September and the second conference of April, 1948, brought the moves for a united Europe stages further, but what was needed was a parallel and a complementary political move in Western Europe.  The first definite step towards this was, I think, Mr. Bevin's speech in January of this year, when he expressed his opinion that the time was ripe for the consolidation of Europe and emphasised that Western Europe must not only be concerned with Europe as a geographical conception.  He stated that Europe had extended its influence throughout the world and that the organisation of Europe must be economically supported, and, therefore, the closest possible collaboration must be maintained with the Commonwealth and the overseas territories of the European countries, France, Holland, etc.  He went on to point out that the other two great world Powers, the United States of America and Soviet Russia, had tremendous resources and that if Western Europe was to achieve its balance of payments and to get a world equilibrium it was absolutely essential that the Western European countries should plan together in developing these tremendous resources.  He suggested a regional organisation which would later fit into a world pattern.</P>
    <P>These views were welcomed by M. Bidault, and M. Spaak of Belgium, but by France in particular.  M. Bidault went on to suggest that perhaps Great Britain and France together might make an approach to the Benelux group to see how much further the matter could be taken.  Various discussions followed, and in March, 1948, the Brussels Treaty was signed.  The congress, of course, followed all this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="769" /> That is roughly the position to date. There is nothing in the whole course of events to show us that there is the slightest doubt but that within a period of a few years a united or at least a Western Europe will be a <i>fait accompli.</i> The real reason for this resolution is that fact, that we are going to have to make a decision and perhaps make that decision quite quickly, that our people should be prepared and that the real issues of our day should be put before them.</P>
    <P>To my mind, the real issue to-day is how to project on a world scale an answering ideology to warring ideologies; how to create an organism which will save democracy and make it a living force.  I feel that we have passed out of the phase of the rights of small nations.  I feel that the world organisations such as the League of Nations, which heretofore were based upon this slogan of the rights of small nations, failed because of the very rights which they tried to maintain and protect, for such rights, when translated into terms of economics, only meant that each country claimed the inviolable right to produce and export as much as it could and to keep out as much as possible its neighbour's goods by tariffs and quotas, and so on. Surely, we as a nation are capable of seeing the wider issues of providing the world with a new ideology, even of seeing the benefits which it might bring to our own country, even of seeing the possibility of the constitutional position&mdash;that unreal position which we all resent so much, our own particular grievance&mdash;collapse like a pack of cards.  The resolutions for a united Europe, which would include the abolition of Customs barriers and European passports, I feel would even abolish the artificial border.  If that were done, what is left?  It even eliminates the necessity of having to make up our minds whether we are or are not in the Commonwealth, and whether we go in or stay out.  With all this out of the way, what is left?  Surely, then, our own grievance and our own particular question should not be made a bargaining issue.  Surely, our people can at least be given an opportunity to play their rightful part in the European <Col N="770" /> group to which they so rightly belong.</P>
    <P>I feel, however, that I should like to go a little further than Senator Douglas has gone.  He stressed the point that he did not want to make any suggestion to the Government as to action.  Neither do I wish to make any suggestion as to what action should be taken, but I think, at least, the two possibilities open to the country should be placed before the country.  One is to signify to the other countries that took part in the congress of Europe our agreement with the resolutions as set out as a basis for discussion and for the setting up of an Assembly and to make known our willingness to send our representatives to such an Assembly, or, alternatively, if we feel that we would like to be more concrete, if we feel that we can clearly say that the future of Europe depends upon a united Europe, to signify our willingness to take our responsibility with the existing movement, with the Benelux countries, with the countries that have signed the Brussels agreement.  These are the possibilities open to us.</P>
    <P>The general aims of the Brussels treaty are defined as:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To reaffirm their faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the other ideals proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations;</P>
    <P>To fortify and preserve the principles of democracy, personal freedom and political liberty, the constitutional traditions and the rule of law, which are their common heritage;</P>
    <P>To strengthen, with these aims in view, the economic, social and cultural ties by which they are already united;</P>
    <P>To co-operate loyally and to co-ordinate their efforts to create in Western Europe a firm basis for European economic recovery;</P>
    <P>To afford assistance to each other, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, in maintaining international peace and security and in resisting any policy of aggression;</P>
    <P>To take such steps as may be held <Col N="771" /> to be necessary in the event of a renewal by Germany of a policy of aggression;</P>
    <P>To associate progressively in the pursuance of these aims other States inspired by the same ideals and animated by the like determination.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I feel that these aims are applicable to the Irish people.  I am not suggesting that legal action should be taken.  I am merely suggesting that it should be made known that the feeling is that we stand not alone for a civilised Europe but for an endeavour to do our part in that respect.</P>

      <P>This motion requests the Minister for External Affairs to make a statement.  I suggest that if the Minister is agreeable to do so, the Minister might make a statement now and, afterwards, should any Senator wish to continue the debate he may do so.  It would appear to me, however, that any prolonged debate should not be held just now.

In future, if Senators have a matter of such serious import for the Seanad that they must prepare papers on it, and read those papers in the House, there ought to be some decision by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that such papers be circulated a reasonable time before they are read or, at least, that they might have copies of them in their hands when they are being read.</P>

      <P>It would be possible to discuss the motion at great length. Economic co-operation is possible, but if lurking at the back of this suggestion was the idea of economic integration, there was an obvious fallacy in that.  If economic integration of Europe was proposed, what it amounted to then was an attempt to solve the problem by enlarging it. Unfortunately, at the back of these very idealistic and excellent ideas were the dangers of their being exploited by certain sinister and more realistic <Col N="773" /> forces in the background, such as international finance.</P>

      <P>The wording of this motion is surprising, but I recognise that the formula suggested by the Committee of Procedure and Privileges was to prevent this House having a head-on collision with the Constitution, so that if the Agreement was recognised we could not call the Minister to account. That does not arise here.  As to the formula, it looks as if the Government needed the Seanad to draw attention to the fact that there was a European crisis and that a certain resolution in favour of a united Europe was passed. Therefore, it must be known that a congress was held and that a resolution in favour of a united Europe was passed.  If the Minister is going to make a statement I think it should be made by him in the first instance in the other House.  It is a matter of very great importance.  What Deputy Séan MacBride said during the last general election did not concern anybody except, perhaps himself, and it would be different if it was what the Minister for External Affairs said because, in this particular instance, he would be expressing the opinion not only of people here but of unfortunate people over the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, what the Minister for External Affairs says should not be rushed.  The Minister should not be rushed into making a statement on this question in this House.  I have not had time to get opinions on this question, but I think the Dáil and the Seanad <Col N="774" /> should have an opportunity of expressing their views before the Minister for External Affairs makes a statement. To my mind, for the Minister to make a statement at this particular time, except a most colourless statement, would be only just a waste of time.  I think the Minister would be well advised if the House did not pass the resolution in that form.  The Minister would then be absolved of any want of courtesy to us if he decided not to make a statement.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons why the Minister should not make a statement at this time.  One is that which he himself gave in Paris and which he rather hinted at in the Dáil when introducing his Estimate, namely, that a united Ireland must take precedence for us over a united Europe.  I think that, before we even consider joining what is called united Europe, we should like to know what is meant by the term and what nations will compose united Europe.  I believe myself that we could have a splendid united Europe if we could have the Pope at the head of it and Spain a member of it.  But what we have at present can hardly be called a united Europe.  It may be a union of certain nations in Europe, but that is all there is to it.  However, according to the statement of the Minister himself, and what we have listened to, all the nations would be asked to sacrifice some of their sovereign rights.  He said that himself in his opening statement in the Dáil.  He seemed to be rather enamoured himself of the idea of a united Europe.  He spoke very sympathetically about it, but he did not commit himself.  He said we ought to be thinking about it.  I suppose it is no harm to do that, but before we commit ourselves we ought to know what part of our sovereign rights we would have to sacrifice and who would be at the head of united Europe. There would have to be some direction.  I suppose it would have to be governed in some particular way. From what we have already heard, some of those who are responsible for the congresses of Europe are not such as to inspire confidence in us.  We <Col N="775" /> would like to have some information on all this before the Minister makes a statement.</P>
    <P>I am sure we are all very grateful to the two Senators who at their own expense went to the congress as observers&mdash;unofficial observers.  I do not think that the practice of people going as unofficial observers is very desirable.  Two very important people, two nominated Senators, went there. They had been chosen as members of this House out of the whole Irish people for their outstanding ability, for their service to the nation and for the quality of the contributions which they could make to our discussions here.  Senator Duffy on one occasion questioned the right of nominated Senators.  He may have changed his opinion on that since.</P>

      <P>Nominated Senators have a particular status.  When they go to a congress as unofficial observers, come back and report to the House as to what was done there, that may give an air of officialdom to what they do.  It is a thing which, in my opinion, we should be on our guard against.  If we are to take any part in a united Europe it should be only after a full discussion when we know what a united Europe means and if a united Ireland had been achieved&mdash; after we know what a united Europe stands for and what advantages we are to gain from it, and after we know what sacrifices we must make for it: it is only when we are clear about these things that we should do anything definite.  The Minister has told us that it is time to be thinking of these things.  It is no harm to be thinking of them, but I am of opinion that it would be imprudent at this particular point to commit ourselves to any course of action.</P>

      <P>It has been suggested that we cannot discuss this matter because we have not the details of the motion in front of us.  I think that even if we have not the details, certain principles have emerged which can be <Col N="776" /> discussed.  For example, I think that lurking in the background of these very idealistic and otherwise excellent proposals there were certain dangers.  For example, if in addition to the economic co-operation which we are to have under the European recovery programme, there is to be any suggestion at the back of these proposals of European integration as opposed to co-operation, then I think that what we are doing is to attempt the obvious fallacy of solving a problem by enlarging it.  These idealistic proposals of greater and greater spheres of union, economic as well as political, are regarded by certain sinister and more realistic forces in the background as an opportunity for the extension of their own domination.  These are the forces of international finance.  Senator Mrs. Concannon asked who would be in charge of united Europe.  I can tell her right away, that, under the present international financial interests, it will be Wall Street.  Years ago I fought out this issue of a world state in the columns of the <i>English Weekly</i> with Mr. H.G. Wells.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion set down by Senator Douglas and Senator Miss Butler is framed in the form of words which was devised by the Committee on Procedure for the purpose of enabling the Minister to make a statement on a matter about which the House would not be, so to speak, politically divided.  Senator Mrs. Concannon is, I think, aware of that. Whatever sinister influences may be at work in Europe, I can assure Senator Ireland that this motion was framed in the particular manner which was devised by the Committee on Procedure unanimously some years ago for the purpose of enabling a Minister to make a statement on a matter of public importance.  This is a matter of public importance, namely, this congress of Europe, and the fact that it did come together and did succeed in reaching a particular measure of agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that Senator Ireland is right when he says that these congresses and parliamentary conferences&mdash;I have <Col N="777" /> attended quite a number of them&mdash; have a natural tendency to go in for generalisations and abstractions, but, at the same time, it is a good thing that a great number of people from different countries, when a particular difficulty exixts, should come together and be able to agree on certain things; that they should stir up each delegation in its own particular country to discussion and to a knowledge of the problems of Europe.</P>
    <P>I do not think that you can dispose of the discussion of these problems simply by saying that there are sinister influences at work without naming these influences.  One of the influences which is quite sinister and quite open is Communism, as it is directed from Moscow.  We all know that there may be other sinister influences, too, but, as far as we are concerned, the important matter for us is that we must be interested in the affairs of Europe.  It is absolutely essential for us.  We cannot hide our heads in the sand and cannot by any formula that we may devise prevent ourselves from being interested in Europe, because it is a matter of importance for us, for our children and for our survival.  It might also be a matter on which we might all agree.  On this question of external affairs, Senator Mrs. Concannon's speech with regard to the importance of a statement by a Minister for External Affairs is one with which I am in complete agreement.  I liked the opening part of Senator Miss Butler's speech.  It is not in the last 25 years that we have begun to play a part in international affairs. We have always done that, but we are now confronted with a world which is getting very much smaller, and we can play that part as an organised internationally recognised State and the Minister for External Affairs is the personification of our institutions in that regard.  For that reason, it is interesting to allow the Minister to make a statement.  I have confidence that if he, or, indeed, any Minister for External Affairs, expresses his willingness to speak, he will not make a statement which he may feel would do harm.  Senator Mrs. Concannon may <Col N="778" /> rest assured that the Minister would not come here at all if he had not thought that there were things he could say which would be useful and not harmful.</P>
    <P>We were once on the fringe of the world, ar imeall an domhain, and we are now in the middle of it, and we must perforce be interested in what happens in Europe and America. Senator Miss Butler was right when she said that the movements with which we deal in our histories and which we regard as native movements can be traced to a larger outside influence, repercussions of things happening in Europe.  In the 18th century we had a very keen appreciation of what was happening in Europe.  Poets who did not know any English, and sometimes had no French, had a very keen and clear understanding of what was happening outside, of the alliances and wars in Europe, in connection with the Stuart dynasty and the restoration of the Stuarts.  In the 19th century we had intimate acquaintance with the United States of America and it is only in comparatively recent times that we have become isolationist and to a certain degree pharisaical, and say we are not like other people.  That is not a Christain attitude.  We should remember that we have been favoured in a great many ways, but that we are Europeans, a very new State and a very old nation.  We have knowledge of the United States of America which probably no people all across Europe could rival.  For that reason, we should be able to understand the problems both of Europe and of America and make a connection between them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>And of Britain.  In our history we were never really isolationists and we have missionary and labour connections with many countries.  We were never out for conquest or isolation.  We have a rôle to play and we should play it, partly because it is essential for our physical safety and partly because as a Christian <Col N="779" /> people we should be interested in the maintenance of our own traditions.</P>
      <P>I do not think there has been in these resolutions any suggestion of economic integration, but rather of economic co-operation.  The Congress of Europe was influenced by fear, it was made urgent by fear, but although the necessities are urgent you cannot force people to do certain things. Above all, I think Senator Mrs. Concannon is wrong when she thinks that before we do anything we must wait for an ideal set of conditions to emerge and must know who is in charge of this and that and what their history and their motives are.  Certainly, we must get information, but we know there is a problem and if we wait for ideal conditions we wait until the problem solves itself.  If there were ideal conditions across Europe, there would be no problem.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Douglas in his remark that European unity does not mean European uniformity.  Apparently there was no suggestion at the congress that there should be a dull uniformity imposed on Europe, but rather that there should be intelligent use of the economic resources and political powers of Europe, perhaps an abandonment of a certain part of political sovereignty for certain economic and cultural aims.  There is a differentiation of culture, based upon a fundamental similarity that makes a united interest, and there is no suggestion that that should be abandoned. People like Senator Mrs. Concannon and myself who are interested in the preservation of our own traditions must recognise that we can have no national traditions at all if certain schemes of government do not survive. If the European Christian way of life does not survive, our traditions go by the board more hopelessly and more certainly than ever was the case under British domination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The big countries are of great importance, but so are small countries. You have France and Britain, Germany and Spain, and you need these people without necessarily agreeing with their rulers.  You do not have to impose upon everybody else the system which <Col N="780" /> suits us.  There has been some talk of abandoning political sovereignty.  In our history, extreme nationalism is quite a new thing, dependent on the spread of the English language and not known at all in Irish.  This was a country which had a spiritual, a literary and a linguistic unity without political unity, without having in modern times what we call a State with modern concepts of political sovereignty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not unique, surely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It was unique in that it lasted longer here than anywhere else.  There is no need for me to go into the history of France, with four languages in one particular era.  Those of us interested in parliamentary government and political sovereignty realise, especially since the first world war, that those things are not remedies for economic evils and may even aggravate the differences between nations. So we are rather disillusioned on that matter; we have found that these things are not the all-important solutions of problems, as at one moment we thought they were.  Therefore, for international purposes and for the preservation of our own traditions, we, like other countries, might be willing to surrender some of that political sovereignty.</P>
      <P>With regard to a European Assembly, it ought, I think, to have very limited powers.  For myself, I always felt that possibly a European Assembly might reproduce the faults of national parliaments in exaggerated form.  Perhaps the greatest enemies, therefore, of any progress are, as has been said, those who want to do too much and to do it too quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have advantages here in our knowledge of Europe, in our knowledge of the United States of America and in the fact that we are a small country, with no aims, except the solution of the problem of the unity of the country, to be achieved.  We have the advantage of being a very old nation and a very new State, based upon political principles.  Strange to say, we have <Col N="781" /> another advantage which is not often adverted to, that, by and large, we have less political asperity in this country than in most countries, although there are people who probably would not believe that and do not understand it, but if we keep jealously apart and if we have any foolish idea that, by making declarations to ourselves or by ignoring what in happening in Europe and America, we can be a blooming oasis in a desert of ruin, we are being very foolish.  It is, therefore, well worth while for the House&mdash;this House has more time than the other House and ought to have at least as good debating power with regard to a matter of this kind; whether it has or not is a matter I will not go into&mdash;to discuss these matters, and I think we ought to hear the Minister without forcing him to say anything he does not want to say. This discussion is the type of discussion which is very appropriate for this House, but if we could do anything to awaken in this House and in the country generally an intelligent interest in external affairs, in all that they mean and their great importance for us, we would have done a very good day's work, and, for that reason, the mover and seconder are to be congratulated.</P>

      <P>Is rud amhain é an Pápa a bheith ag caint, agus rud eile a lán de dhaoine den tsórt seo bheith ag caint.  Tá súil agam nach gceapann an Seanadóir go bhfuil mé ag déanamh aon tagairt phearsanta dó san.  Tá mé ag caint ar na rúin mar luadh annseo iad.  Rinneadh tagairt sa gcéad rún don dainséar atá ag baint le náisiúntacht.  Ní dóigh liom gurb é an náisiúntacht an trioblóid, beag nó mór.  Má scrúdaítear an scéal, bhéarfar faoi deara nach iad na náisiúin atá dílis dá náisiúntacht is ciontach leis an trioblóid ach na náisiú in ar beag leo an náisiúntacht.</P>
      <P>Níor mhaith liom go múchfaí náisiúntacht, agus go dtí go dtaispéanfar dhom, pé ar bith córas a ceapadh, nach múchfaí é, ní bheinn i bhfábhar gluaiseacht a mar seo. Sin é atá ar bun ag an Rúis, deireadh a chur le náisiúntacht.  B'uafásach an rud, is doigh liom, a leithéid a dhéanamh.  Ba mhillteach an chailliúnt é, is cuma cén chaoi a mbreathnófaí air.  Cuimhnigh ar chomh bunúsach agus tá an náisiúntacht.  Brathann sé ar an tíreolaíocht, ar an aoráid, ar chineadh, agus ar thraidisiún na mílte blian.  Ba bhoichte de go mór an saol dá múchtaí an náisiúntacht.  Tá sé ar fad riachtanach má tá saol ceart iomlán le bheith ag an domhan.  Go dti go mbeinn cinnte nach múchfar, nach scriosfar, agus nach millfear na náisiúian, nó aon chuid de na deáthréithe a bhaineas le náisiún, ní dóigh liom go mba cheart dúinn a bheith páirteach i ngluaiseacht den tsórt seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rinneadh tagairt don riachtanas atá ann go n-aontófai airgeadra an domhain, i dtreo is nach mbeidh difríocht idir na tíortha sa deireadh maidir leis an gceist sin.  Níl a fhios agam cén tuairim atá ag an Aire, nó ag an Aire Tionscail agus Tráchtála, nóag an Rialtas, maidir leis an mBanc i leith Téarnaimh agus Socruithe <Col N="788" /> Eadarnáisiúnta.  Níl fhios agam chor ar bith an é an tuairim. atá ag na daoine seo gur amhlaidh atá teipthe glan ar an ngluaiseacht sin, nach bhfuil aon mhaith bheith ag súil leis bheith ar bun a tiluilleadh, mar go bhfuil, teipthe air.  Sin cuid de na ceisteanna a bheadh ag déanamh buartha dhom i dtaobh an scéil seo.</P>
    <P>Thairis sin, níl le rá agam ach an méid seo, go mba cheart dúinn a bheith buíoch den tSeanadóir Dubhghlais agus den tSeanadóir De Butléir mar gheall ar an trioblóid agus an strómh a chuireadar orthu fhéin ráiteas a thabhairt dúinn ar a gcuid imeachtaí i gcéin.  Mholadar Rialtas na hísiltíre faoi a fhéile a bhí an Rialtas sin leo. Táimid ar fad ar aon intinn go bhfuil buíochas ag dul dóibh as ucht chomh fial agus a bhí siad.</P>
    <P>Níl mise i gcoinne baint a bheith ag Éire le cúrsaí na hEorpa.  Bhí baint againn leo le fada agus beidh baint againn leo fós.  Go deimhin, níor mhiste, b'fheidir, don Aire smaoineadh air seo: an chumhacht atá ag Éireannaigh ar fud an domhain, dá bhféadfaí eagar a chur orthu.  Cáil, clú agus traidisiún na hÉireann, is. leis an tsíocháin atáclaonadh acu, más féidir síocháin a thabhairt don domhan, tríd an ngléas seo, nó tríd an bpolitiocht, má théann go dtí sin. Tá timpeall 20,000,000&mdash;do réir na figiúiri&mdash;idir Ghaeil a rugadh in Éirinn agus Gaeil de shaghasanna eile ann. Ceann de na bearta is mó a d'fhéadfaimís a dhéanamh, ar mhaithe le síocháin idirnáisiúnta sa Euroip agus ar fud an domhain, is ea teachtairí a chur amach uainn féin, idir an radio, nó trí na scoláirí is cáiliúla da bhfuil againn, ar litríocht, ar phéintéireacht, agus ar gach aon ghné dar gcultúr&mdash; chun léachtaí a thabhairt ar na prionsabail atá againn i dtaobh saoirse agus ceartas na ndaoine.  Innseoimid a dhílse agus táimíd do na prionsabail sin, agus do phrionsabail na hEaglaise, go bhfuil furmhór mhuintir na hÉireann páirteach léithi.</P>
    <P>Tugadh an tAire an ráiteas, más mian leis é thabhairt, ach tá súil agam, má thugann sé ráiteas anois ar an scéal seo, gur ráiteas é atá ceapthatar éis dó dul i gcomhairle lena chomhAirí, go mór mór leis an Taoiseach, an <Col N="789" /> tAire Tionscail agus Tráchtála, an tAire Oideachais agus an tAire Leasa Shóisialaigh.  Thairis sin, bheinn ar aon intinn leis an Seanadóir Uí Choncheannainn gurb é an rud ab fhearr dó gan aon ráiteas do dhéanamh ach fanacht go bhfuighidh sé deis an scéal d'iniúchadh go cruinn, agus ansin ba cheart dó an ráiteas a thabhairt uaidh i nDáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Mrs. Concannon that it is not fair to ask the Minister for External Affairs to make any statement on a motion of this kind.  I assumed, when I read the motion by Senator Douglas on the Order Paper, that he merely wanted the House to know what took place at The Hague.  Now he not only wants that but he wants to commit the Government to the resolutions already proposed at The Hague.  In other words, he wants to commit us to something we know nothing about.  There is no Constitution and no form of Government or anything else before us and we are merely wasting time talking in the air. I want to repeat that I do not think that any Minister should be asked to speak on this motion.  Evidently someone is very anxious to abandon part of the very limited freedom that we have got.  If there is talk of that why not join the American Union?  I suggest that if we are going into any group we should not go into a bankrupt group but into a progressive group that is going somewhere.  I do not know whether the Minister is going to say anything.  Personally, I think he can do no more than give us, in the words of Yeats, &ldquo;a few polite, meaningless words.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am going to make a speech as short as the one to which we have just listened.  I want to go on record as expressing my own regret that the Minister has not got an opportunity of making the statement which obviously he was prepared to make and I think I am entitled to protest at the way in which this apparently simple and innocuous motion was put before the House.  Like Senator Anthony, I am at a disadvantage. Without being discourteous to a lady, I think that Senator Miss Butler, <Col N="790" /> in seconding this motion, made statements that would have been best left unsaid.  They were at least highly controversial and they did not help the calm consideration of this motion. There is no reason why these documents should not have been circulated to every member of the House in good time.  As Senator McCartan has anticipated me in saying, we are being asked to give a blank cheque to a whole series of things, a whole series of resolutions, some of them very full of merit and others probably very full of danger.  We have to admit that great forces are at work in the world to-day. It may be the wise thing for us to harness ourselves to these forces as an alternative to being crushed by them. I do not know.  I am one of those who wonder whether it is wise to have a Minister called upon to make a statement that may not be politic at this venture.  All sorts of matters have been brought into this debate, but I have no intention of going into them at any great length.  I want to say this, that the suggestion of economic co-operation may be a suggestion of the economic obliteration of small nations. We were entitled to far more consideration in regard to this motion, and I want to be recorded as saying that.  I feel that the Minister is entitled to a little more consideration by the proposer and seconder of this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Séamus O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hayes attempted to justify the form of this resolution on the ground that it had been used before.  The fact that it has been used to-day is condemnation <Col N="791" /> of it and a sufficient reason for not using it again.  It has not conveyed any information to the House: it has kept us in complete darkness as if that were intended.  It merely gave Senator Douglas and Senator Miss Butler an opportunity of making a lengthy and interesting statement, and it then demanded that the Minister, in reply, should make a statement.  It made no provision whatever for the members of this House expressing their opinions or of having any opinions. There was ample time to circulate the resolutions proposed at this congress if it was desired that we should have an intelligent debate on it.  I do not see how we could have an intelligent debate when it was sprung on us in this manner.  Although a lot has been said on the motion, in my opinion enough has not been said.  It is not clear to me who selected or who sent the delegates to this congress, whether they were handpicked by somebody or whether they were appointed or not to go there.  Three persons, a couple of them having the honour of being Senators, evidently considered themselves entitled to go, under their own steam, as has been stated, to this congress. Were they entitled to go to any congress anywhere and to commit this nation, even by implication, to some policy which the nation itself had not the opportunity of considering, and which, if it had the opportunity of considering, would probably not approve of?  If Senator Miss Butler and Senator Douglas and their colleague had a right to go to this congress, I do not think they went as observers.  I think they themselves stated they went as delegates, and delegates alone have the right to put down motions.  Delegates for whom?</P>

      <P>If they went as far as The Hague this time, what of the next occasion?  Supposing they change their outlook and became far more humanitarian and far more citizens of the world, could they not go to the other side of the &ldquo;Iron Curtain&rdquo; to-morrow and commit us to <Col N="792" /> some other policy?  I think that is highly unlikely, but miracles do happen.  We are being asked to enter into a united Western Europe and that we should forget everything, join hands and work together; forget our boundaries and forget our grievances, and the irony of all this is that the Senator who proposed this is the Senator who the other day approved of another Senator's motion that we should stop looking for the unity of Ireland and leave the North as it is at present, and that if we do go courting here we should court her with very soft words.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment, I was referring to a proposal that we ought to have a united Europe and I was pointing out what seems to me to be an inconsistency in the same people, or some of the same people, who advocate that policy for us now, in, very recently, being opposed to what I at least consider would be a policy leading to unity in this nation.  I think we should set our own house in order before we begin to regulate the affairs of Europe. I do not see how we can now consent to surrender any further portion of our sovereignty for the sake of a united Europe when our right to a united Ireland is still being disputed and when we have to go there, not as the representatives of a nation but as the representatives of part of a nation.</P>
      <P>I happened accidentally to use the word &ldquo;motion.&rdquo;  I said a motion was made the other night that we ought to go rather slowly and calmly about this proposal for unity in Ireland.  I did not say a motion was put on the Order Paper.  I said a motion and, like better men than I, when in difficulties, and when I was told that I had used the wrong word or a word in a wrong sense, I took the opportunity of the interval to look up a dictionary.  I have newly-acquired knowledge as a result of my short research.  I find that one meaning of motion is to offer a proposal and surely a proposal was offered, although not necessarily a proposal of marriage.  What was proposed the other night is a sort of permanent divorce.  Another interesting discovery that I made was that angular velocity is <i>direct</i> when it is from west to east&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I will just finish the sentence&mdash;it is retrograde from east to west.  I am wondering whether the motion before us to-night in the form of a suggestion or proposal &mdash;for there is surely a motion before us to-night&mdash;is a retrograde motion or not and whether it comes from east to west or from west to east.  Let the proposers solve that.  Since we are discussing motions I suppose I can mention that one of Newton's three laws of motion was that to every action there was an equal contrary reaction and that is why you have discussions in a place like this.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult for a newcomer like myself in the Seanad to manage to make a speech when there are so many back-seat drivers in the House. I try to obey the Chair, but very often the Chair is ignored, and there are at least two or three back-seat drivers who are always telling me where I get off and telling the Cathaoirleach where he ought to make me get off.  I wish we had not so many back-seat drivers in the House.</P>
      <P>I will go back to the original notes I had before I was interrupted.  I pointed out a month ago that it is implied that if we approved of this Congress of Europe, if we took part in it, if we became portion of it, that we must surrender part of our sovereign rights and that, if we do not, we cease to deserve the name of a democracy. That, if not the exact wording, is the suggestion that was made by the proposer of the motion.  He also said it would involve a customs union.  I am not prepared at the moment, and without hearing more cogent reasons than have been advocated, to approve of a customs union of Europe which would, I believe, have the effect of wiping out whatever small industries we have and wiping them out after all the difficulty and sacrifice that we had in building them up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not say that there is anything sinister in the motion or that there was anything sinister in the proposal that the Minister should make a statement on it, but I do think it strange that the Minister was to be asked to make a statement and that, had the original <Col N="795" /> plan as suggested here to-night been followed, there would have been no opportunity for Senators to intervene. How could we possibly decide whether we approved of any motion or any statement that the Minister for External Affairs might make until we had heard all the arguments on both sides, for and against?  The Minister was expected to make a statement after hearing an <i>ex-parte</i> statement from, as far as I can gather, two self-appointed delegates, who had no authority from anybody that I am aware of in this country to go and commit this country to anything, in Europe or anywhere else.</P>
    <P>There is nothing sinister in it, but the whole thing was so badly stage managed that, when a motion of this kind is brought up before consultation, we should get in advance such information as we require to enable us to form a judgment on it.  If the Minister decided to approve of this European Congress, and if he, in a statement to-night, went as far as to commit this nation to it, the most dangerous position might arise, because some of the implications of membership of that body would involve a complete alteraton of sections of our Constitution. Some of the things we are asked to do to me seem to be unconstitutional, and what is unconstitutional is, I believe, undesirable and inadvisable. Nobody intends to go any further than this has gone, beyond getting a pious expression of opinion.  There might be astuter people behind this than the delegates from this country realise.  I fear there is a possibility that we might be brought in by the back door for the next European war.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdmundSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to agree with Senator O'Farrell on this question, as I feel that the Minister, if he makes a statement, as he has been asked to, should confine himself to the very narrow, and, I regret to say, in my view, harmless limits of this motion.  If the Minister is going to take that view, and do nothing more, I would sit down immediately. But the debate at this stage seems to have gone beyond the narrow and what I call harmless limits of this motion <Col N="796" /> into a discussion, led by Senator Hayes, on our position in relation to Europe and the European position in relation to us.  I agree with some of the idealistic discussion on the great part played by Ireland in European affairs and on the historical part it played.</P>
      <P>Though nothing has been circulated to me in my position as a Senator, I know a little about this European Congress, and I wish to go on record as saying this, that if Ireland had a historical position in Europe, and if we represent anything in Europe, there is a nation in Europe that represents a great deal more, one that is the bones and blood of Europe, and that is the Spanish nation.  That nation was not represented at a congress which proposed to be a congress for the unity of Europe.  As I am informed&mdash;and I will be corrected by the Minister if I am wrong&mdash;Senor Negri represented Spain at that congress.  He was, I think, at one time Prime Minister of Spain during the civil war.  He represented a certain side in that ghastly catastrophe that overtook Spain.  He is now in exile from his country.  There is a Spanish Government, there is a Spanish people, but they had not any representatives at this congress.  I say if we lend support to a congress such as that however noble its motives, we lend ourselves to something that certainly is not furthering the cause of unity in Europe.</P>
      <P>If there is cause for unity in Western Europe we must know to what object we are progressing.  I do not know what this congress intends to do or what unity it proposes to effect.  There was once a unity in Europe, a unity under the flag of Christendom.  That unity is gone.  We are all perfectly aware that Europe is split into two camps, split on what idealistic grounds I cannot say.  We have had pious aspirations read out in the motion that people who have a democratic form of Government will meet together.  Is it democratic in Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, France, Britain, Greece, Spain?  Where is democracy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We practise a form of democracy here that I say is Christian.  I say that <Col N="797" /> it is just but I will not insult it by calling it democracy.  Every Government in Europe might at the moment call itself democratic.  The words fall freely from the lips of Governments and so-called democracies in the West. They are supposed to be opposed to the Fascists.  Whether they are or not we do not know.  What I want to go on record is this, that while the great Christian nation of Spain and ourselves are excluded from the conference of Europe we cannot lend our name to any congress, however benevolent, and however idealistic, until that question has been solved, and there is a real approach to unity.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not cover too large a field.  If he does cover a large field I urge upon him to say that we in this country stand for a Christian ideal, a real democratic ideal which is based on the Christian ideal and that we as such are not satisfied that a congress which meets together and excludes one and one only, the Spanish nation, is not really a European congress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my views to those of Senator Sweetman and to say that I entirely agree with him.  I think we should have on record what he said regarding the boycott of Spain by this congress as something of which Irish opinion does not approve.  Like Senator Sweetman I am in favour of the motion if it is confined to having a statement from the Minister.</P>
      <P>Towards the end of the 19th century many of the things which are now the subject of discussion were, to a very large extent, realised under the system of free trade.  There was mobility of labour and very great mobility of goods and a common standard of value.  There was a common currency as long as the nations were on the gold standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results at The Hague were unquestionably good.  Every thinking person will approve of the objectives in the economic field.  There is a much better chance of obtaining some of the objectives if steps are taken by individual members of the European <Col N="798" /> community.  I cannot help feeling that there is very great chance of attaining concrete results through bi-lateral agreements between nations.  The Benelux countries are a very good example of that.  Even there, enormous difficulties had to be surmounted even between friendly nations.  A more realistic approach to these matters can, I think, be made by having agreements on concrete subjects between friendly neighbouring States.  I cannot help feeling that the Minister perhaps has done more to forward the cause of European unity by the recent Anglo-Irish Agreement, which is now being discussed in another place, than by anything that he may say regarding the larger objectives of the motion before the House.</P>

      <P>I think Senator S. O'Farrell mentioned a short time ago that there was a danger that we might be brought by the back door into the next European war.  I do not think any Senator made a suggestion of that kind.  I believe however that we should be extremely careful to try and avoid any such entanglement.  I think, moreover, that it is very undesirable that people in any country should talk about the next war as if it was something that was bound to take place.  I believe that all of us, and especially those of us in a Christian country, should do everything in our power to prevent another war ever taking place.  Naturally, a small country like Ireland cannot do a great deal, but I think it is our duty to do everything we can to prevent a war, and to bring about the establishment of conditions which would, we hope, help to maintain peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes mentioned this evening that this motion should help to awaken interest throughout the country in international affairs.  I think that is very desirable, because I believe there are, unfortunately, a large number of people in Ireland who seem to think, because we are a small nation, and because of our place on the map, that it is not worth our while taking any interest in external affairs.  There are many people who appear to be completely apathetic with regard to affairs <Col N="799" /> outside our own country.  I believe that it is in our own interest to take notice of what is going on in Europe and the whole world, and that it is also our duty to try and do our share, as a nation, to preserve peace and to co-operate, as far as possible, with other nations in that respect.</P>
    <P>Again, I believe that not only in this country but in many other countries, there are still many people who talk far too lightly about war, as if it were a fine, heroic thing.  I do not think there is any need in this House to speak of the moral evils of war.  I am sure every Senator realises these evils to the full. The material evils, however, are greater than they have ever been at any time in the history of the world. Many people have said that if there was another world war the whole of our civilisation might be destroyed and that all that would be left would be people suffering from starvation and poverty and ruined cities and towns. I think that, on both moral and material grounds, we should do everything in our power to promote European and world co-operation and to prevent war.</P>
    <P>I agree with those Senators who have said that we should naturally be very careful in our actions.  I believe that we should especially give particular attention to the economic proposals which have been mentioned here to-day&mdash;such things as the promotion and the development of the agricultural resources of Europe&mdash;so as to supply a higher nutritional standard. Things of that kind deserve our immediate attention.  Again, it was mentioned that one of the matters that should be aimed at was to raise, to the greatest possible extent, the standard of living of the populations of Europe and of the whole world, and to ensure the fair distribution of all the products of economic activity.  I believe that the maldistribution of these products has been one of the great causes of war in the past.  If we had a fair distribution of the results of economic activity throughout the world that would be one way of helping to prevent war in the future.</P>
    <P>I think that attention should also be paid to statements made by such an <Col N="800" /> authority on food questions as Sir John Boyd Orr.  He has given certain figures with regard to possible food production in the future.  I should like to draw attention to one statement by him which is mentioned in Senator George O'Brien's book, <i>The Phantom of Plenty</i>, in which he estimates that if everybody in the world is to be provided with a diet capable of maintaining a healthy working efficiency food production would need to be doubled within the next 25 years, an extremely unlikely achievement, he says.  He has also said on another occasion that if large amounts of the resources of the world are spent on preparations for war, and on armaments and the like, there will not be the necessary increase in the production of food, and, as a result, millions of people may be reduced to an appallingly low standard of living, if not to actual starvation, in the future.  I believe, therefore, that it is our duty as a Christian nation to try, as far as possible, to co-operate with other nations with a view to preventing war and with a view to building up gradually throughout the world a more just social order based on the Christian principles which we profess.</P>

      <P>My intervention will be very brief.  My reason for rising really is to insist that it is the duty of this House to debate any matter or any subject which, in the opinion of the Chair, is suitable for debate, and that it is utterly foolish for people to get up here and profess that we ought not to debate this or debate that.  Now, with all due respect to Senator Mrs. Concannon, I want to make it clear to the House that we have as much right to debate any matter relating to external or internal affairs as Dáil Eireann has.  We should not be in the Constitution unless we have that right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to have it accepted that, if a proper motion is put on the Order Paper, this House is entitled to debate it.  No objection has come from the Government or from the Minister that the Government or the Minister would be embarrassed by submitting <Col N="801" /> this motion which, after all, is one inviting the Minister to make a statement. It would be open to the Minister to say he would not make a statement, and if he told us it would be embarrassing, we would not press the motion any further.</P>
      <P>Differences of opinion have arisen here on, for instance, the basic question of the Parliament of Europe.  If that is implemented, it will naturally involve the surrender of portion of the sovereignty of every country involved. I gathered from Senator Douglas that there was a feeling amongst the British and the Belgians in favour of such surrender, but may I recall to the House that the persons who met at The Hague were individuals, representing nobody.  Mr. Winston Churchill is a very representative British politician, but he has no influence with the British Government at present, and I think his words would not be accepted anywhere in the world as representing the point of view of the British Government. Senator Douglas, Senator Miss Butler and Professor Tierney were equally representative, in the sense that they are well known people with a certain standing in this country and entitled to express certain views as reflecting the emotions of elements in the country with which they are connected.  But let us go no further: they were not appointed by anybody.  Mr. Winston Churchill and his colleagues from the Labour Party or the Conservative Party were not appointed by anybody to attend the conference.  At the Labour Party Conference at Scarborough, Dr. Dalton, who replied to a motion in relation to this conference, on behalf of the executive of the Labour Party, threw cold water on it and said he had no interest in it.  In fact, he challenged the bona fides of some of the prominent people who took part, including Churchill and Van Zeeland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not concerned with that, but with the fact that a number of representative people, with a sense of responsibility not merely to their own country, but to humanity, have been meeting in order to find a way out of a shocking mess.  They propounded certain proposals and we are asking <Col N="802" /> the Minister to say what the Government thinks of them.  We go no further, and the House is expressing no view at all in relation to these proposals made at The Hague.  Unfortunately, many of the individual Senators who have expressed views, have not bothered to find out what was done at The Hague or the character and purpose of the conference held there.  That is very unfortunate, but I suppose the same thing will happen in other countries&mdash;enthusiastic people will express their views enthusiastically, without bothering to relate them to the facts.</P>
    <P>The bitter fact is that no one can tell whether there is going to be a war in Europe to-morrow or not.  Any information we have from those in close touch with European affairs would lead us to believe that a war may happen at any moment.  Whether we like it or not, such a tragedy is going to govern our lives and create fear, suspicion and dread as long as it lasts.  Some people would like to line us up already on one side in the conflict. What will interest us very much is whether the Government have made up their minds that it will be possible to keep away from that war if it breaks out and whether they think it desirable that that should be done. We remember that, prior to the last war, there was a great deal of conflict in the public mind as to what our attitude should be, and some prominent people committed themselves to the view that we could not keep outside the conflict which was coming and committed themselves to the further proposition that we would have to line up with the British.  That view was expressed in Dáil Éireann on the 29th April, 1938.  It is desirable that we should consider now what is to be our attitude in the event of an even more devastating war being launched on the European Continent.  Whether we are in the war or out of it, we are going to be sufferers.  Men, women and children here will suffer hardship, privation, hunger and death if there is a European war on the gigantic scale which is postulated in this conflict which is dividing Europe.</P>
    <P>These are matters of fundamental <Col N="803" /> importance, and I am submitting that the mover and seconder of this motion have done a great service to our Parliament and people by raising them and allowing us to discuss the issues, so that we may, calmly and after deliberation, reach agreement as to our proposals in the event of such a terrible catastrophe being forced upon us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride) Seán MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want at the outset to express my gratitude for having been given the opportunity and the privilege of addressing this House.  I was very glad to come here, as indeed I would be very glad to come here at any time to discuss any question relating to my Department.  I feel often as if the Department of External Affairs were a small Department lost in a corner, one which did not affect the lives of the people very much and one in which the people in the Dáil or in the Seanad, or outside, had little or no interest. That is a pity, as the more discussion we can have on what is happening outside this country, the better.  Unfortunately, the tendency has been to preclude us from remaining in a state of isolation.  That is unfortunate.  If we could put back the hands of the clock 100 years, the world would be better off, possibly, but we cannot do that. Methods of communication&mdash;the cinema, wireless, newspapers and aeroplanes&mdash;have made isolation impossible. Whether we like it or not, we are gradually being forced more and more into the stream of world events.  I do not want that to be misconstrued as suggesting in any way that we are being forced necessarily into any alliances, into taking any sides in any war, but, generally speaking, I think we have reached the stage where we must realise that we are right in the stream of world events, that we must know something about world events, because otherwise we will not be able to withstand the impact of outside forces on our life here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know what we want to maintain. As many Senators have said, we have our own Christian way of life and that is what we want to maintain here, but, <Col N="804" /> in order to be able to maintain that, we must not bury our heads in the sand and refuse to look to other countries to find out what is happening there. More and more, the tendency will be to make it necessary for us to be more alive to what goes on outside, what goes on in Europe and what goes on in America, because remember this throughout: by reason not merely of our geographical position but by reason of the vast amount of emigration which there has been in the past, we are in a position to play a special role in Europe and America.  We are in a position to act, as it were, as a link between Europe and America on many occasions, and I have found on a few occasions that we have been of certain use in that direction.  We know the mentality of the people of Europe better possibly than the Americans know it, and, inversely, the mentality and outlook of Americans possibly better than the continentals know it because of the close links we have both with Europe and America.</P>
    <P>I have appealed in the other House on more than one occasion for a cooler and a more deliberate attitude in relation to all matters relating to external affairs.  It is not always easy to get it in the other House.  I do not know why. Possibly because of the rush of business and possibly because more publicity is focussed on the proceedings of the other House, discussions are inclined to become embittered and not to be constructive.  I was very pleasantly surprised here by the constructiveness and the temper of the discussion on this question and it is of considerable help.  Let these Senators who thought that this motion was unwise bear this in mind, that the functions of a Minister&mdash;it does not matter what Government he belongs to&mdash;is to try to find out what the people are thinking, to find out what you are thinking and what the Dáil is thinking. He has no way of finding that out, unless you speak your minds and discuss various problems from time to time, so that it is a help to us.  Never think that you will be boring us or taking too much time in discussing matters concerning external affairs here.  In the Dáil, it is harder to get <Col N="805" /> a discussion because there is more work and there is not the same deliberative atmosphere.  I was very grateful indeed for the solicitude shown by members of the House as to whether this would embarrass me.  I wish some of the T.D.s who put down questions would exercise 1 per cent. of that solicitude at times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>For the very reason which some of the Senators on that side of the House have given in relation to my having to make a statement to-day.  Very often, questions may be very awkward from an external affairs point of view.</P>
      <P>I want to make one point quite clear, before coming down to a discussion of this proposal for a united states of Europe or a federal Europe.  I am not very familiar with the practice of this House, but the resolution, as I understood it, was one directing the attention of the Government to these proposals.  It was not recommending the proposals and not condemning them.  It merely directs the attention of the Government to them, which, I think, was to enable a discussion in the House to take place and to enable the House to consider the matter, and, if it thought fit, to pass a resolution so that the Government would consider it.  I felt that it would give this House an opportunity to express its views freely, irrespective of Party issues.  I felt that I could also come here and speak without the authority of the Government on this matter, discuss it quite freely with you, so that we could know the way our minds were running and so that the Seanad could have the benefit of any information I might be able to give it in relation to these matters before coming to a decision.  Therefore, I want to make it quite clear that, in anything I say here, I am speaking on my own, without the authority of the Government and without in any way committing the Government to any proposals contained in this resolution or to the proposal for the formation of a united states of Europe put forward at The Hague.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="806" /> As I understand the position, it is this: There have been in Europe, since before the last war, a number of movements in support of creating federal states of Europe.  They never amounted to very much until after the recent war. After that war, some more movements sprang up.  I think there are five altogether, with different names.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>There are six at least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Six, I understand from Senator Douglas.  Some had their origin in France, some in Switzerland, some in the Netherlands, where, I think, there are two different organisations, and some in Italy&mdash;all striving more or less for the same kind of thing, trying to find a way out, trying to find a solution.  They finally organised this convention at The Hague.  Some of the people who went there went as delegates from some of these organisations; some, I think, went as delegates from trade unions and other organisations; but, I think that most of them went there as individuals.  From our point of view, it was possibly not a very good augury that the convention should have been presided over by Mr. Churchill, whose name was never very popular here.  That possibly did not give it a good send-off here, but I do not think that is a thing that should matter.  The problem, I think, which gave rise to these proposals was this. An attempt was made after the 1914-1918 war to create a League of Nations. It failed.  I was going to say it resulted in the next war, but I think that, probably, would be unfair to the League of Nations.  It certainly failed in its purpose.  After this war you had another attempt made to create another kind of League of Nations and, so far, it does not seem to be very successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not, but then, what is going to be done?  If we have learned anything from the war just ended I think we have learned three things.  We have learned that the last war was the most destructive war in the history of mankind and we have learned that the next war will obliterate, <Col N="807" /> completely, the countries through which it will pass.  Secondly, we have learned that this veneer that we call civilisation and in which we take so much pride is as thin as tissue paper, and will crack as easily as during the last war.  Who, ten years ago would have thought it possible that any civilised Government would consider the extermination of human beings just for the sake of exterminating them?  Yet, it came to be regarded practically as standard practice during this war.  Thirdly, we have learned that the economic structure of Europe and, I take it, of the world generally is an extremely inefficient machine that goes out of order very easily.  If there is any lesson to learn from these things it is these facts which point to this one result, that the next war is going to mean the utter destruction of the civilisation we have known, the utter destruction of the world we have known.  Are we going to sit back and do nothing about it?  Is the world to await its doom, is Europe to await its doom and are we to await our doom without doing anything about it?  Are we just to sit by and let it happen?  Is that our duty as civilised human beings?  As a member of organised society should we not search and grope day in and day out for some method of avoiding the destruction of civilisation? As I understand it what happened is this: several groups of people throughout the world got together in organisations, some coloured with tinges of a political kind but others not coloured by political tinges at all.  They got together for the purpose of seeking some way out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of what.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Senator has been listening to what I have been saying.  These people came together seeking a way out of avoiding utter destruction.  The possibility of creating a federated states of Europe may be a remote one; it may be impracticable; it may not work; but surely it is better to try to do something than to do nothing. Federations have worked before and they have worked very well in some cases and there is no reason why they <Col N="808" /> should not work in the case of Europe. You have the federation of America and you have federations in Europe itself, in Italy, in Germany.  The federation of Canada is more or less simple but nevertheless you have two distinct languages there.  Apart from close-bonded federations you have loose federations.  I do not know whether members of this House have followed developments on the American Continent over the last 40 or 50 years.  The Pan American Union which includes all the States on the American Continent has greatly tightened up their relationship and it is practically now a federation.  Only this year they have entered into a defensive military alliance.  Therefore the question of a federated States of Europe is not quite so impossible as it may appear at first sight.  It is certainly better to try some remedy than to try no remedy and it is purely on this basis that I ask the Seanad to consider the matter.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, many dangers and difficulties.  First of all, if it is to be a solution it has got to include all the States of Europe and it must be organised in such a way that you are not merely creating a bigger and better machine for another war.  You have got to link it up successfully with America and it will have to be linked up with the East.  These may sound grandiose plans but they may be much easier to accomplish than to face another war. Now for the question of sovereignty. This is always a very relevant problem. Whenever a country enters into an agreement with another country it limits its sovereignty.  You cannot enter into an agreement with another country without limiting your sovereignty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>If you mean to keep it.  In the same way an individual who enters into a contract with another individual limits his freedom of action by that much.  I think that very few people in the world would mind surrendering a part of their national sovereignty if by doing that they could avoid utter destruction and the possibility of war. But, that is a matter for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make this quite <Col N="809" /> clear: I am not suggesting that this House should in any way adopt the resolution put forward at The Hague. I can see many, many difficulties, many things with which I would not agree, many things that possibly go too far in it.  I think, as Senator Douglas said, you might have to go fairly slow on it but, at least, it is a step and it is worth consideration and worth examining, and I think it is well that this House should examine it, even possibly adjourn the discussion and resume it later.  I think it would be well, if the Seanad passed this resolution, that the Government should consider these matters also and discuss them.  There are certain essentials, of course, that would have to be maintained.  You would have, in the first instance, to ensure that the rights and interests of the small countries would be protected. You would have to have a human charter or a democratic charter of some kind or another to which the countries would have to give strict adherence. Possibly, many of our countrymen in the Six Counties might feel they had some safeguard if there were some minimum rights guaranteed to all human beings.</P>
    <P>Another reason for which I was glad this discussion took place is this&mdash;and it is a thing that surprised me&mdash;from the beginning to end of this debate I heard no reference made at all to the organisation for European Economic Co-operation.  There has been very little attention paid to it in Ireland although it is to a large extent probably the first step towards a federated states of Europe in the economic realm.  With the permission of the House, I propose to say a few words on the O.E.E.C. It has been generally referred to as being part of the Marshall Plan or European Recovery Programme.  In fact, it was born out of the Marshall Plan but it is a separate and distinct activity.</P>
    <P>Apart from making available to Europe certain vast sums for recovery purposes, the Americans stipulated that Europe should get together on its own and by itself for the purpose of organising economic co-operation. That had nothing at all to do with the actual allocation of funds that America <Col N="810" /> was giving to Europe.  A committee was formed representative of 16 European nations for the purpose of evolving an organisation which would enable the maximum amount of economic co-operation in Europe.  It worked for some six months and finally produced a convention that was signed last April in Paris.  It has nothing to do with what you might call the American side of the Marshall Plan. It is entirely an independent organisation created in Europe to which 16 nations and three military Governments to cover Germany and Trieste all belong.  It has its own constitution. A treaty was signed by the 16 countries setting up its organisation.  If members of the Seanad are going to consider this matter further or if any documents are being circulated, I think it would be well if with the resolutions that were read out by Senator Douglas and Senator Miss Butler a copy of this convention should be circulated.  There are, I think, ample supplies of it in the Library here and it could be circulated to members of the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it has been circulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>It probably has been circulated.  It largely provides for what the economic resolution passed at The Hague calls for.  I am not going to read many passages from it, but I could read one or two.  For instance. in the preamble, which is a long preamble setting out the purposes of the convention, it is set out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...determined to combine their economic strength to these ends, to join together to make the fullest collective use of their individual capacities and potentialities, to increase their production, develop and modernise their industrial and agricultural equipment, expand their commerce, reduce progressively barriers to trade among themselves, promote full employment and restore or maintain the stability of their economies and general confidence in their national currencies...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It goes on setting out the various objectives.  Then Article 2 provides:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The contracting parties will, both individually and collectively, promote <Col N="811" /> with vigour the development of production, through efficient use of the resources at their command, whether in their metropolitan or overseas territories, and by the progressive modernisation of equipment and techniques, in such manner as may best assist the accomplishment of the joint recovery programme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This organisation formally came into existence last April after a considerable amount of preliminary spade work. It is controlled and governed by a council of 16 representatives of which Ireland is one.  That council meets from time to time and should in effect, if it performs its function, become the economic Government of Western Europe.  In so far as it is possible to secure complete co-operation, it should on all matters upon which there is agreement be an economic Government for Western Europe.  Sovereignty is safeguarded by provisions that make it essential that all decisions should be unanimous save in matters in which a country has no direct interest.  So far, that has worked reasonably well.  There has been very little difficulty in getting agreement on most matters that have come up.  No doubt, problems will arise in future in which it will not be possible to get full agreement but I think that this organisation does provide a basis from which the experiment of a federation of European States can start off.  I would like if more attention could be given to it, that people would know more about it, would know what it provides for, would know its powers and would take more interest in its activities.  There are several committees functioning whole time.  We have representatives on practically all these committees.  A committee is dealing with food and another with agriculture, the chairman of which is our nominee. I think these committees have functions dealing with the compilation of statistics and showing estimated production for the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>Likewise, one deals with statistics showing estimated requirements to ensure that goods will flow from one country to another, and that there will be no hold up owing to currency restrictions or trade plans.  If <Col N="812" /> they do the work they are intended to do it will certainly be useful.  I will quote officially from a speech that I made in Paris setting out the aim as we saw it.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The aim should be, not merely to return to the economic standards that prevailed before 1939, but to envisage a new concept based upon real co-operation.  Following upon the destruction of Europe we are perhaps all inclined to yearn for a return to the conditions which existed before the war.  That is not sufficient.  The organisation of human society, and indeed human needs themselves, are never static.  We must not allow our nostalgia for a return to economic stability to blind us to the defects that existed before 1939.  We must accordingly evolve a new approach that will take cognisance of past defects on the one hand and that will ensure for the people whom we represent the best standard of life that modern science and development can assure.  The motive of economic domination or rivalry must never again be permitted.  The aim must be to secure a standard of life for the 240,000,000 people we represent here that will assure to them, and to each of them that economic security and well-being so essential to a democratic mode of life based upon the liberty and dignity of the individual.  In order to succeed we must be prepared to approach European economic recovery with the same energy and the same resourcefulness as if it were a military operation upon which the fate of our nations depended.</P>
    <P>The enemies are hunger, poverty and economic insecurity.  Let us then be prepared to mobilise our resources on the same scale as if this were a war&mdash;but with the knowledge that in this war we are not planning for destruction but for the economic well-being and liberty of the people of Europe.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say if that document is available in the library?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  It is a White Paper dealing with the European <Col N="813" /> Recovery Programme.  I think that is one useful purpose that a debate of this kind serves, that it enables members of the Seanad and the Dáil to focus their minds and their attention on what actually has been done.  At The Hague it seemed as if some of the drafters of the resolutions might have overlooked the existence of O.E.E.C. or might have thought that it had other functions. There was a discussion recently in Paris as to the progress that was being made by O.E.E.C. and some countries, including ours, felt that as much progress was not being made there was a danger that it would sink to the level of just another international organisation, producing a mass of documentation and statistics without achieving anything.  Certain steps were taken that will ensure that it will become more active in future.  In the preliminary stages there was a considerable amount of research and building up work to be done.  There is a staff of 1,000 now, recruited and trained to do this work.  A step has certainly been taken.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether I need refer in detail to matters raised by Senators. Some Senators suggested that we could not debate anything about Europe until we had secured the unity of our own country.  That is a matter we have to discuss.  It is only by playing our full share in Europe that we will succeed in achieving the unity of our own country in the final analysis, and not by sulking in the corner.  I think we will probably gain a good deal by what has already been done.  We should never miss the opportunity of making our viewpoint known in these matters.</P>

    <P>I have at meetings of the O.E.E.C. repeatedly drawn attention to the fact that we were placed in a particular difficulty by reason of the fact that our country had been artificially divided against the wishes of the majority of its inhabitants.  The more often that is stated and understood by the people of Europe and the world generally, the better.  We cannot do these things if we stay sulking in a corner.  I should like to thank members of the Seanad for having given me the privilege of discussing this matter with them and to assure them that I will be pleased <Col N="814" /> at any time to come and discuss it with them.</P>
    <P>I should have mentioned at the outset that, as far as Senator Douglas and Senator Miss Butler are concerned, before they went to The Hague they very properly came to me to know whether I considered it would put me in any embarrassing position if they went there.  I said no, that this was a free country, and that Senators, and members of the public, were entitled to travel where they liked, provided they were not engaging in any activities which would endanger the State. I told them that I should like to hear their views when they came back.  They gave me their views on their return. As to this motion, Senator Douglas and Senator Miss Butler asked me some time ago whether I would object to its being put down, or if I would mind discussing it in the Seanad.  I told them that I would not object as the more discussion there was the better.</P>

      <P>I would be tempted to say a great deal following this debate but, if I spoke at length, I would only take away from what I feel was a very valuable speech from the Minister for External Affairs.  I want to thank him particularly for his closing remarks.  I felt that there might be a certain amount of misapprehension about the form of the motion.  That form was adopted before, in order to make it possible, without having a division, to invite the Minister to speak on an important public matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think either in the case of this or any other Minister, or this or any other Government, a responsible Senator would put down a motion of this kind without first ascertaining if the Minister would consider it embarrassing. All that could happen, otherwise, would be that nothing would be achieved.  I was surprised at some of the remarks made during the debate. Some Senators seemed puzzled as to how five Irish delegates got to The Hague.  I thought I made it perfectly clear that the five Irish delegates were invited in their individual capacity and did not claim or pretend that they represented this country.  They could <Col N="815" /> not, even if they tried, commit this country in any respect.  It never entered my head that anyone would think otherwise until I listened to the debate.</P>
    <P>I think a few persons were delegates in the sense that they represented one of the six committees that joined to call the conference.  There was one very eminent person present who was a delegate in the sense that he was a personal representative.  It was the policy of the Vatican that they had carefully inquired into the nature of the conference. His Holiness decided, as a matter of policy, to send a representative. He took part, and as far as I can gather, he was generally welcomed there.</P>
    <P>I wanted to avoid details.  There are a few points which, I think, I should mention.  There was a reference as to whether the basis was Christian.  I am not sure whether it was Senator Ó Buachalla or Senator S. O'Farrell who raised that point.  I do not want that there should be any misunderstanding. I am sure there were persons there who would be inclined to be agnostic in their views and who possibly would not accept what I believe to be the Christian point of view.  I can say without the slightest hesitancy that the conference was dominated by the Christian point of view.  In fact, it was one of the things which impressed me, and I think it impressed others too. Professor Tierney mentioned it to me. We shared a room and we saw a good deal of each other.  A striking thing about the conference was that even in the cultural committee, where there was quite a number of professors, those who stood for what I shall call the Christian point of view dominated that committee.  Now there was, if you like, a very slight compromise.  As the matter has been raised I do not want any false pretences.  I did not read in my opening the cultural resolution because it would take up too much of the time of the House.  The basis of it reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Believing that European union is no longer a Utopian idea but has become a necessity, and that it can only be established on a lasting basis <Col N="816" /> if it is founded upon a genuine and living unity;</P>
    <P>Believing that this true unity even in the midst of our national ideological and religious differences, is to be found in the common heritage of Christian and other spiritual and cultural values and our common loyalty to the fundamental rights of man, especially freedom of thought and expression&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am not going to take up the time of the House in dealing further with that. In reply to a point made by the Minister, in the economic resolution, one of the points mentioned specifically was that it</P>
    <P>&ldquo;welcomes the initial measures taken by certain Governments towards closer economic co-operation, or towards regional groupings; and expresses the hope that the work of the conference of the 16 nations will lead to conclusions favourable to the success of European union.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have brought forward this motion because I am still convinced, as I have been for the last 25 years, that the people of this country should discuss openly and freely, and should take an intelligent interest in the affairs of the world.  I believe it is their duty to do so, and that it will be to their benefit to do so, because I believe that the distinction between external and internal affairs is becoming extremely small. There was a time when you could talk of foreign affairs and home affairs as if they had no relation to each other. That, as the Minister has pointed out, is disappearing very fast.</P>
    <P>About 25 years ago I moved a resolution in this House asking, which was not successful, for a committee of both Houses on External Affairs.  I still believe it would have been a good thing if we had had that committee.  I think this is a matter that should be kept out of Party politics, and that the existence of a committee of that kind would have helped.  When I say that it should be kept out of politics I do not mean that it is not important in itself.  I think it is all important.  To my mind, next to the importance of maintaining Christian conviction in the hearts of men, the next most important <Col N="817" /> thing is to keep out of war.  I believe that the struggle mainly is between Christianity and war, and I believe that it is the duty of every person, no matter what his religious convictions or politics, diligently to seek where even in the tiniest little degree he can do anything to prevent any next war, not simply because, as the Minister has pointed out, it will be disastrous and a holocaust, but because the very nature of war itself destroys all the best in Christian feeling, and makes a decent livelihood for the individual almost impossible.</P>
    <P>The evils of Europe to-day on which the anti-Christian and the Communist movements are thriying, are in my opinion, a direct result of the last war, and, if you like, of the wars that occurred before it.  I am not sure whether European union, which I think should be on slow lines, is going to be achieved or not.  I think it may. Five or six years ago I looked on it as impossible, not because I thought nations like ours could not welcome it but because I did not believe that the big nations would look at it for a moment.  I am beginning to change my mind now.  People are beginning to discover the danger, and out of that danger it is possible that there could be a sufficient measure of unity, greater even than that which is taking place at the moment, to enable joint action to be taken in the case of an emergency, whether the emergency be a war or of another character.</P>
    <P>There was something unreal about our discussions here.  If Senators would go and spend a fortnight in one of the European countries that was overrun during the war they would see that there is nothing unreal about it. A Dutchman said to me that they would be prepared to give up 25 per cent. of their sovereignty rather than lose it all.  What is going to happen if there is a war immediately?  There is the real fear that there will not be very much left for the ordinary common people.  There is very little left at the moment, but what would be left if there was another war?  Hence it is worth trying to get a measure of unity. Whether the proposals from the Hague are practical in all respects or not, I do <Col N="818" /> not know.  Some of them I am sceptical about.  I think it was well worth while having that congress.  I am sure it was an important thing that men and women of practical experience who are prominent in their own countries should have come together and should have put together proposals for discussion. I am sorry that there has been no machinery by which resolutions of that kind could be circulated in this House by the staff.  It would have suited me, but there are difficulties.  Nevertheless, I would suggest that the Standing Orders Committee might consider in the autumn whether, within certain restrictions, it would be possible for documents to be sent around, if approved by the Chairman, in connection with resolutions to be brought before the House.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Minister for a very valuable speech and particularly for supporting the idea I have held for many years, that debates of this kind do good and that we need not be afraid of the speeches of one or two people who may be irresponsible.  In the main, discussion of European affairs, tempered with responsibility, will do good and this House has a better opportunity for that than the Dáil, where there is direct control of the Executive and where it is much more difficult to discuss these matters without apparently committing the Government.  In view of the attitude taken by the Minister, I hope the House will pass the resolution.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann is of opinion that in the public interest traffic regulations should be so framed as to require the driver of a mechanically propelled vehicle when passing along <Col N="819" /> an urban thoroughfare and other built-up areas to slow down to a prescribed limit of speed.</P>
    <P>Senators may be disposed to criticise this motion on the ground that it lacks definitiveness.  I want to disarm that criticism by saying that it is left indefinite so that we may discuss the problem without committing the House, if the motion is adopted, to a particular speed limit or a particular set of regulations.  If there is general agreement regarding a speed limit, we might ask the Minister, or we might ourselves determine, what a reasonable speed limit would be.</P>
    <P>The frequency of accidents on public highways is causing uneasiness in many quarters.  In recent times, a growing proportion of the accidents have been fatal and it is hard to pass through a week without reading of a fatal accident caused by a motor vehicle in Dublin. The position may not be as bad in other parts of the country, but we read of accidents in Athlone, Cork and Limerick.  There seems to be a growing volume of fatal accidents.  It may be a straining of the English language to refer to these incidents as &ldquo;accidents&rdquo;, as in many cases they are inevitable, arising out of the conditions under which mechanically-propelled vehicles are used on the road.  We have the careless driver, the driver who is intoxicated and the driver who has no regard for the welfare of the public or of animals, or even of passengers in his own car.  These are hardly accidents at all, but incidents arising out of a criminal disregard for the public interest. In speaking of mechanically-propelled vehicles, I wish to include not only motor-cars, buses and lorries but all those other types of vehicles used on the highway.  One may ask what remedy there is for this serious situation.  If all the killings and injuries were due only to excessive speed, the matter would be simple, but they are not.</P>
    <P>Excessive speed plays a big part in the category of incidents which lead to these deaths and injuries on the public road, but there are other types of carelessness&mdash;I have already referred to some of them&mdash;so that our job is to try <Col N="820" /> to eliminate from the public highway the reckless driver, the drunken driver and the speed merchant.  The alternative is the building of a chain of motor roads, if we are prepared to face the task of building special motor roads, as they have done in some parts of the United States, and allow the drivers of vehicles to fly along at any speed they like.  That is one solution&mdash;keep the public off these highways and designate them, as we designate the railways, for a particular kind of traffic. Hardly any problem will then arise, except in the case of the deliberately unscrupulous or drunken driver.</P>

      <P>He cannot, because he will be &ldquo;hooshed&rdquo; on, whether he likes it or not.  The construction of a chain of motor roads will be a very slow and a very expensive undertaking, and, pending the provision of that network, we must take whatever precautions are open to us to save life and limb on the highways we have.</P>
      <P>I might perhaps be permitted to refer to one or two incidents which happened quite recently for the purpose of drawing attention to the kind of thing that is happening and to which this resolution is directed.  I do not propose to mention any case and I do not want the House to think that I have any particular case or any individual in mind.  Unfortunately, on a previous occasion, when I was referring to the misuse of the highways by motorists, it was thought that I had in mind some individual who happened to be involved in legal proceedings some few days previously.  That was not so, but I cannot avoid referring to statements in the public Press for the purpose of drawing attention to what is involved in the resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer first to a case which was being tried recently before one of the metropolitan justices.  One of the witnesses in that case said that he was working on a particular road on the evening of the incident and saw a motor coming from the direction of the city at a very fast rate.  Another witness in that case said that the car was in the centre of the road and a man <Col N="821" /> was sitting in it.  When he got out of the car, he was unsteady on his feet. Another witness said that he was standing with his wife about 50 yards from where the accident occurred.  The car was travelling as fast as he had ever seen a car travel and it was the excessive speed that drew his attention to it.  I do not want to comment on the case, beyond drawing attention to the evidence that, when the man got out of the car, he was unsteady on his feet and to the fact that witnesses testified that the car was being driven at a very fast rate.</P>
    <P>Another case occurred quite recently in which a man lost his life through his own fault.  At the inquest, the coroner said there was no doubt that the deceased had been speeding at the time, that it was a blind and dangerous corner and that every effort should be made to prevent a recurrence of that type of accident.  That was an accident due to speeding&mdash;wild and careless use of a vehicle by a gentleman who probably was not familiar with the topography of the area over which he was travelling.</P>
    <P>A number of local authorities have been agitated by the constant recurrence of these accidents, so-called, and with these deaths within their functional areas, and they have been trying to take action to prevent them.  Travelling to Longford a week ago, I noticed at the approach to the town a big notice stating &ldquo;Speed limit 15 miles per hour&rdquo;.  I am informed that there is no such speed limit and no lawful authority for the erection of that notice outside Longford; but it does, however, betray the anxiety of the local authority in Longford to try to restrict the speed of vehicles passing through their town, a very praiseworthy attempt to prevent the accidents and the killings which are becoming so common elsewhere.  There is, however, no means of enforcing that speed limit and anybody who knows the law will pass by at 30, 40 or 50 miles per hour and pay no attention to it.</P>
    <P>As a result of a recent incident in Dún Laoghaire, I notice, in a Press report on 6th July last, this paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A motion was passed at the monthly meeting of Dún Laoghaire <Col N="822" /> Council requesting the Government to permit local authorities, in the interests of public safety, to impose speed limits where they deemed it desirable to do so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a request directed to the Government that local authorities be permitted to impose speed limits.  I do not know whether that is a good solution. I think there is a lot to be said for permitting a local authority to determine these matters for itself, but there will be a lack of uniformity.  You go into one town and find a notice, which may not be conspicuous, fixing a speed limit of 15 miles per hour, and, in the next town or village a few miles away, a limit of 35 miles per hour may have been fixed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely.  I am merely raising the question so that members might consider whether it is desirable that local authorities should fix a speed limit for their own functional area, or whether the State should take power, through the Minister for Local Government or the Commissioner of the Garda, to fix a speed limit which would be uniform.  My own view is that the speed limit, if there is to be a speed limit, cannot be uniform.  For instance, at certain times of the day, no vehicle can safely pass Trinity College gate at a greater speed than three or four miles per hour, and one is lucky if one can get from the corner of Grafton Street to the Pillar in half-an-hour at certain times; but you can permit a greater speed out at Blackrock or Merrion gates, although there again there is need for a speed limit, because it is a built-up area and people cross the road.  It is a thoroughfare used by children going to school and there are four or five places of public worship along that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is always the danger of some person with some defect in hearing or with defective sight, some old person, walking out in front of a vehicle and paying the penalty, unless great care is exercised.  When the 1933 Traffic Act was going through the Dáil there was a considerable amount of discussion on this question of a speed limit and <Col N="823" /> where limits of speed were being fixed in respect of certain vehicles, such as single and double-deck buses and so on, heavy vehicles.  The Minister at that time, and I am speaking entirely from memory, took the view that it was better not to fix a speed limit so that if any person was charged with an offence he could not plead that he was not exceeding the speed limit.  That case was made 15 years ago.  The local authorities, the Garda and the Government Departments concerned have had 15 years in which to study this question and I would be glad to know whether they are satisfied that there is no need for a speed limit now in respect of the ordinary motor-car.  The procedure, I understand, if you want to fix a speed limit, is rather involved. I notice in the morning papers of the 4th August a notice by the Secretary of the Department of Local Government that an inspector of the Department has been appointed to inquire, at the Town Hall, Bray, into the request of the Bray Urban District Council to have an Order made under Section 48 of the Road Traffic Act, 1933, prescribing a speed limit of 20 miles per hour for mechanically-propelled vehicles on all roads in the urban district of Bray.</P>
    <P>This is a case in which the local authority is proceeding, unlike the case of Longford, on orthodox lines.  It is having an inquiry so that the Minister may prescribe a limit of speed.  As I understand it, the position is that in the case of light vehicles there is no limit whatever unless it is prescribed by the Minister following a local inquiry.  Section 46 of the Act of 1933 prescribes speed limits for certain classes of motor vehicles but no speed is prescribed for light motor vehicles and that perhaps includes motor cycles as well as motor cars.  The section prescribes a speed limit of 20 miles per hour for double-deck buses and 25 miles per hour for single-deck buses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty-five miles per hour anywhere?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think that is the position.  Of course, they travel at 40 miles per hour.  Section 48 of the Act provides for the making of a special speed limit applicable to any specified <Col N="824" /> road or to all the roads in any specified area which may operate at all times or for specified hours on specified occasions. Special speed limits may be prescribed by the Minister after he has held a public inquiry but such regulations, however, cannot be made by the Minister except on the application of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána or on the application of a local authority in whose functional area is situated the road or roads to which such regulations relate.  The matter of speed limits, I think, is obviously in a chaotic condition.  Most people are anxious that something should be done to ensure the safety of the thoroughfare for every type of user whether pedestrian or a person driving his cattle to the fair or a person driving his donkey and cart to the market or a cyclist.  It is a matter about which some differences of opinion will arise as to the method of approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the speed limit the best method and if so what speed limit?  I have already intimated that I do not think that a uniform speed limit is possible. I have already indicated that the best people to prescribe what the best speed limit should be are the local authorities. They may want different speed limits for different parts of their areas. For instance, you do not require to limit the speed of vehicles between Sandycove and Dalkey to the same extent as when passing through Dún Laoghaire and the same applies to the City of Dublin, to Cork and to Limerick and to all other functional areas. In my opinion the speed limit is a subject which might be discussed properly between the local authority and the Garda authorities.  If both bodies are authorised to prescribe a speed limit which would eventually require the sanction of the Minister they will arrive at a sensible arrangement appropriate to the area and appropriate to the kind of vehicles passing through that area or locality.  One other observation I would like to make: if there is to be a speed limit there should be very severe penalties for those who violate it, just as there should be very severe penalties for those found guilty of other traffic offences.  I have seen cases which seem to me to be of very little importance, where persons <Col N="825" /> had not their licence displayed or where they overlooked some unimportant regulation of the Traffic Act and they were fined £5 or £10.  I have also seen instances of persons driving carelessly or driving a car or lorry or bus while under the influence of drink and killing someone.  They are charged with manslaughter, acquitted and pay no penalty whatever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>If a man is acquitted you can do nothing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but these are problems.  We know these things are happening.  We know that people drive cars at 50 or 60 miles per hour in densely populated areas and even drive cars under the influence of drink. We also know that there are business houses within ten or 15 miles from Dublin that live on the traffic they ob-obtain between 10.30 p.m. and 12 midnight, because hundreds of cars leave this city and visit these refreshment houses and spend an hour and a half there. Do not we know that practically every person returning to the city from these refreshment houses is under the influence of drink?  He may or he may not be incapable of driving a car.  That is a matter about which there can be a good deal of doubt.  Some people can contain a good deal of drink without being incapable of driving a car.  Some people cannot contain any drink without being incapable of driving a car. My complaint is that what appear to be serious offences involving loss of life, by some means or other, seem to go unpunished.  The answer may be that they are found not guilty.  If the law is such that a person who has injured another or has taken a life on the highway can go unpunished then that law needs to be amended drastically.  One of the safeguards by which you can amend the law is to fix a limit of speed. If the limit of speed within five miles of the borough boundary, say, between Santry and Swords, is 20 miles an hour and somebody is driving at the rate of 40 miles an hour and there is an accident, whether the accident is due to his negligence or not, as determined by the courts, he is at least guilty of driving in excess of the speed limit.  I <Col N="826" /> think it is an essential safeguard and one to which we should have recourse.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to go into this matter at great detail.  Every Senator is conscious of the need for tightening up the regulations.  There may be a different approach from different sections of the House to the problem with which we are confronted but I think everybody admits that there is a problem and everybody admits that something must be done to remedy the evils to which I have drawn attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EleanorButler" hpid="Miss Butler Miss Butler">
      <NameTxt>Miss Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to second this motion, not so much because I think the motion to establish a speed limit in built-up areas will solve our traffic problem or even reduce very considerably the number of accidents as because I think it is important that it should be known that this House is aware of the serious situation that exists and the extent to which traffic has got out of control, especially in the City of Dublin.</P>
      <P>A speed limit such as is suggested in the motion applies only to the built-up areas and in the built-up areas I venture to say the necessity is greatest in and around the City of Dublin.  At the same time I do not want to suggest that it would not be beneficial in many country towns and villages.  In fact I regard it as absolutely essential that motorists should be compelled to slow down as they pass through towns and villages.</P>
      <P>I regard the traffic problem as a three-fold problem&mdash;a problem of control, a psychological problem, and a physical problem, by which I mean the planning and lay-out of the roads and all that goes with it.  This question of the speed limit touches on all three aspects of the problem.  There is first of all the question of control.  In order to implement the speed limit, we would have to have adequate signs and warnings at the entry to every town.  We would have to have a considerable amount of supervision in the early years in order to catch people who were breaking the regulations.  What is far more important, and what Senator Duffy has already referred to, is that we would have to have the necessary powers to enforce substantial penalties when the culprits were caught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> In the Dublin Corporation I have been on committees that have discussed this problem with the Garda authorities and I have also discussed the matter unofficially with members of the Garda who are responsible for carrying out traffic control.  They are of the opinion that a speed limit will be of immense value but they feel very strongly that, under present conditions, the value of the penalty would be lost by the fact that it is almost impossible to apply the penalty within a reasonable period of time.  All offenders under the Road Traffic Acts pass through the ordinary District Courts. Often the cases are held up for months and by the time the culprit is brought to court he has forgotten the offence or the prosecuting Garda has not the same keen idea of the degree of the offence.  There is not the same effect as immediate action would have.  I would suggest that unless means are adopted by which the penalty under such a regulation could be enforced quickly a great deal of its effect would be lost.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that that is the only traffic control that has to be looked into.  The fact that a speed limit is imposed on mechanically propelled vehicles would convince pedestrians, who are often just as much to blame as drivers and riders, that there was some consideration for them.  They would not feel, as they do at the moment, that they are the forgotten section of the community and that mechanical vehicles have the exclusive use of the roads.  Of course, in law that is not the case but it is the idea that the pedestrian has, that he is not entitled to any consideration.  It would also mean that there would be some degree of usefulness in pedestrian crossings which at the moment are of very little use to pedestrians from a safety point of view.  If there is no speed limit, it is very doubtful whether a car can slow down quickly enough at a pedestrian crossing to allow the pedestrian to cross in safety.</P>
    <P>The speed limit concerns the psychological approach to our traffic problem. Far too little thought has been given to this aspect of the problem.  By far <Col N="828" /> the greatest number of accidents and the greatest amount of confusion and congestion is caused by lack of road manners.  That can only be initiated in the very young.  The introduction of the speed limit would act as a code. The fact that at the entry to every town there would be a large sign indicating that the speed limit was 20 or 30 miles an hour, as the case might be, would have a psychological effect. People would slow down automatically; they would take a little more care and be a little more on the look out for people stepping off the pavement.  The whole tempo of traffic would be slowed down.  From that point of view, the speed limit would be of immense value.</P>
    <P>There only remains the physical aspect of the problem, and by that I mean the general layout of the roads and the congestion caused by bad planning in towns and cities.  The speed limit would be difficult to enforce in a town that is badly laid out and on roads that are unsuited to traffic.  It would be difficult to arrive at a uniform speed limit that would be suitable to overcome all the difficulties that exist. Dublin, for instance, where the greatest problem exists from the point of view of congestion, is an old city.  It is congested in its centre and, except for certain streets, is unsuited to modern traffic.  Certain proposals have been made by the planning authorities for arterial roads, and for linked roads to take the heavy traffic, which could bye-pass the city.  If these proposals could be speeded up much of the congestion in the centre of the city would be disposed of.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the road plan for Dublin, which has been lodged in the Local Government Department for the last two years, and on which there has been no comment whatsoever so far, has been held up in this way.  This may seem irrelevant to the question of a speed limit, but I should like to point out that whenever the question of traffic is mentioned in the City of Dublin we are always told by the Garda authorities, and other responsible bodies, that there is no possibility of improving traffic conditions while certain congested areas are <Col N="829" /> allowed to exist.  We are told that as long as bridges across the Liffey are not constructed that we must accept the condition that we have in the centre of Dublin.  We are told that, as long as the widening of streets leading to the bridges is not proceeded with, there is no point in discussing other aspects of the traffic problem.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to that at all.  I merely mention it in passing because I feel that it will be an argument that will be put forward, and to emphasise the need there is for speeding up a decision from the Department of Local Government on road planning.  There are other reasons why it should be speeded up.  In the meantime all proposals for rebuilding must be decided on the basis that the plan submitted for the roads of Dublin will be accepted.  There is nothing else to go on.  Meantime, buildings are going up and repairs and reconstruction are going on.  If one street is widened by one, two or three feet that will involve the City of Dublin in immense sums by way of compensation.  This hold up in the road plan is made the excuse by the traffic authorities for taking no action.</P>
    <P>There is another matter concerning traffic congestion in the city and speed limits.  It is a ridiculous position that in this country anybody, the halt, the lame and the blind, can apply for a driving licence without providing any evidence that they are capable of driving. It may seem slightly ridiculous to refer to a speed limit at all when such a state of affairs exists&mdash;that we have no driving test in this country.</P>
    <P>There are many other things which would help in the safety of the roads such as more islands, the marking of separate lines for traffic and crossing lines for pedestrian traffic.  These will all be useless if we cannot instil into the people of the country a code of good manners on the road.  I feel, as regards speed, that the worst offenders are young men in their 'teens and their twenties.  I have been driving a car myself for about 14 years and while in no way trying to exonerate women drivers from the desire to speed, I have no hesitation in saying that the youths evidently find some excitement in driving <Col N="830" /> at a high speed.  They do not appear to have developed a great sense of responsibility.</P>
    <P>From my experience in other countries, I have come to the conclusion that a speed limit is essential.  Last year I took a car across England, to Holland, Denmark, Sweden and Germany. I drove through all the capitals of those countries and through many of the small towns and villages.  In not one single town or village through which I passed was there the absence of a speed limit.  In most cases it corresponded to the English 30 miles an hour.  I do not feel myself competent to express an opinion as to what would be a suitable speed limit in view of the vast strides which have been made in the design of cars.  It might be more dangerous to suggest 20 miles an hour than 50 miles for a certain type of car. That is a point on which only the expert can give us advice.  I feel, however, that a speed limit would be of immense value.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy referred to alternatives to apply in the built-up areas. I think that the argument that the people would not co-operate has been disproved by the reactions of the driving public to traffic lights.  When they were first suggested quite a number of people asked what was the good of having them, but experience has shown that they have been a success and are being obeyed.</P>
    <P>The only other objection that I could imagine anyone offering to the motion is the cost, but if you can improve the safety of the roads and save human lives that is not something that can be measured in terms of money.  We do feel obliged to spend money in trying to make our roads. safer.  I feel certain that the Government, and particularly the Department of Local Government, do want to make our roads better and safer.  I hope that the Department will do all in its power to hurry up planning legislation which would help to relieve congestion and would to a great degree solve our traffic problems in the cities and towns.</P>
    <P>In Dublin we have the oldest tradition of a planning authority in Europe. We had the Wide Streets Commissioners, a body which was set up in <Col N="831" /> 1754 for the express purpose of making our streets and laneways safe for vehicular and pedestrian traffic.  We know the magnificent work which these commissioners did.  Between 1754 and 1840, when they were abolished, they were responsible for the provision of our wide, open streets, for the wide and spacious bridges in our city and for one of the first circular roads in Europe which set a headline for other countries to follow.  Our Irish Parliament, all through its years of struggle for Irish independence, passed 16 Acts of Parliament over a number of years and gave large sums of money for the widening and improvement of the streets of Dublin.  I have much pleasure in seconding the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak on this motion as a responsible motorist with 40 years' driving experience.  I have had an equal number of years in the motor business.  I have, perhaps, a more intimate knowledge of the causes and results of motor accidents than any other member of the House.  While I would welcome a decision on the motion, I sincerely hope that the House will throw it out, because speed limits themselves will not eliminate accidents. They will not eliminate the drunken, reckless driver.  I want to say at once that the vast majority of motorists are responsible people and that they deprecate the road hog, the reckless and the drunken driver just as vehemently as Senator Duffy and Senator Miss Butler do.  Most accidents on the road can be attributed to causes other than speed.  The cyclists are to be seen in the city riding 12 abreast, so why seek to put the responsibility on the motorist?  Last night, between here and Sutton, I passed hundreds of cyclists without lights back or front, and I had to take care of them.  The compulsory dimming regulations will make it impossible to see cyclists six or eight yards ahead.  We want to see dangers eliminated, but we have a new bus terminus perpetuating one of the biggest bottle necks in the city.  Right angles anywhere are wrong, yet between here and Howth new roads have been built and right angles created. <Col N="832" /> Those are the dangers which cause the accidents.  The Killester colony, built some 20 years ago, has a series of right angles, and streams of traffic pouring on to a busy bus route.</P>
      <P>I am not hostile to the motives of Senators Duffy and Butler, but we have lived through speed limit regulations and, if statistics could be produced, they would show a greater percentage of road accidents than in proportion to the traffic.  The average motorist then was persecuted by stop-watch cops and there were fines if you were caught doing more than 20 miles an hour.  The only fine I got in my life was for scorching on a bicycle.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, what about straying cattle, donkeys and horses on all our main roads to Cork or Galway?  What about country crossroads, with high hedges which should not be there in this 20th century?  Why wait until someone buys the corner plot and builds right up to the edge of the road, making it impracticable to get rid of the danger?  We talk about road improvements. We all agree that anything that could save even one life should be given consideration.  Why not deal with those improvements now?  I came back recently from America and whilst in those busy cities I saw that, where secondary roads emerged on main thoroughfares, there were huge &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; notices and everybody, whether motorist or cyclist, had to come to a complete stop.  These are the wise precautions which have arisen from experience in eliminating accidents.</P>
      <P>I join in the statements on the leniency shown by many magistrates to the driver convicted of being in charge of a car while drunk.  A man should not be allowed to drive a vehicle when under the influence of drink and incapable of controlling a car.  It is hard to determine such intoxication, but where the evidence is overwhelmingly conclusive the penalty should be one to meet the offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding safety zones, take the one at Amiens Street station.  We motorists stop religiously there at the pedestrian crossing but in come the weaving cyclists in front of us and the pedestrians cannot cross.  That is the daily experience of people using the <Col N="833" /> streets.  We do not need a speed limit to reduce the number, of accidents. What about the psychological reaction on the motorist, who imagines that a maximum speed is his minimum?  The average motorist accommodates his speed to the road conditions, but there are times when six miles an hour is dangerous and if you tell people with a certain mentality that the speed limit is 15 they will imagine that they are within their legal rights at 15, no matter what the conditions are.  From my experience, I say that a new speed limit will achieve nothing, but will be a blistering nuisance on the vast majority of road users.</P>
    <P>Regarding the speed of motor buses, does anyone imagine that the public time schedules could be maintained if the prescribed limit were enforced? Apart from buses, take the long distance lorry.  We have many regulations available to the Gardaí already which are not being enforced.  One of them compels the motor lorry to have a driving mirror.  Many of the lorries on our roads to-day have no mirror at all and it is quite impossible for the driver to see overtaking traffic, but these are things which have, to my own knowledge, caused accidents, and within the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>Another thing which I know has, in itself, been the cause of many accidents is the fact that many of our roads are not properly cambered, and they are roads of recent creation or repair. When we talk about accidents on the roads, let us examine all the contributory causes and not concentrate our attention on something which is antediluvian and out of date.  Senator Butler referred to speed limits that still obtain in certain cities in Europe. I know other cities where there are no speed limits.  If it suits these cities to have them, it is probably because nobody has made a move to get rid of them.</P>
    <P>We should be very chary and hesitant about asking for the reimposition of a speed limit.  That, in itself, would do nothing.  I feel that this discussion and whatever publicity it may get will do the more important thing, that is, will focus the attention of the community generally on a lot of dangers <Col N="834" /> which we are maintaining and continuing to create, and which, in themselves, inevitably cause accidents.  I strongly urge on the sponsors of this motion to be satisfied with the discussion and the publicity it may get, and incidentally whatever I get myself, and not to press the motion.  Let the authorities be asked to use the powers they already have concerning some of the matters I have mentioned, which I feel sure every person in this House knows represent sound sense.</P>
    <P>You cannot go 20 miles out of any of our cities without being confronted by crossroads in a country where land at present is relatively cheap but where the view of the driver of a vehicle coming from a side road on to a main road is completely blocked by high hedges. Apart from these high hedges, why not immediately proceed to round off all these rectangular crossroads which in themselves have been the cause of more fatal accidents than any member of the House has any conception of?  I know of a very tragic incident involving a personal friend of mine at a crossroads, a crossroads which was nowhere near an urban area, and, incidentally, high speed was not in question.  It was simply a case of two vehicles converging at a country crossroads.  The driver of one vehicle lost his head, and, instead of turning away from the other vehicle, drove into it, with the result that the driver was killed and his sweetheart sitting behind him was maimed for life.  These are things which burn into a man's mind, but because they happened remote from any urban area and through causes which were in no way affected by speed, I again ask the sponsors of the motion not to press it because I am satisfied, from my own experience, that it would not achieve the objects it desires to achieve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBigger" hpid="Professor Bigger Professor Bigger">
      <NameTxt>Professor Bigger</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot claim quite Senator Summerfield's experience of motoring.  So far as I can recollect, I have been driving motor cars for 39 years, but even that short period, I think, entitles me to have some views on this matter.  I should like to say, in the first place, that with the underlying motives which caused the proposer and seconder to bring this motion <Col N="835" /> forward, I am in thorough agreement. I would favour anything which would tend, even in a small degree, to reduce the number of accidents, whether fatal or non-fatal and, if I were convinced that a speed limit would do that, I would agree to it.  I think it might be supplemented by other things which I shall mention, but, if there is to be a speed limit, it must be a reasonably practicable speed limit.  We are told that there are speed limits of 20 and 25 miles per hour for buses and we know that no bus driver could attempt to obey the law in that respect.  If you are going to provide for a speed limit of 25 miles per hour in Dublin, every motorist will laugh at it and disobey it, and our courts are not nearly large enough to hold all who will break that law.  The way to bring law into disrepute is to make it incapable of practical application.</P>
      <P>There are difficulties if one is to attempt to prescribe a speed limit. How is one to define &ldquo;urban thoroughfare&rdquo;, &ldquo;built-up area&rdquo; and that sort of thing?  The English definition, I believe, is a road or street lit by public lamps.  That would be quite impracticable here.  Parts of the Phænix Park are lit by lamps and are we to have the same speed limit there as in Grafton Street?  Again, are we to have the same speed limit throughout an urban area, say, in Grafton Street and in Morehampton Road?  You would have to have the very maximum permitted speed, a speed so high as to be quite useless in the dangerous areas, because, as somebody said, four or five miles an hour in College Green might be quite excessive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point is that, if you have a speed limit, it will be put forward as a defence, when an accident occurs, that the motor-car involved was travelling well below the maximum speed.  It may not be a legal defence, but it is going to carry weight, and there is going to be a tendency for the average rate of motorists' driving to be very close to that permitted speed.  Under certain conditions, as I say, I would favour the imposition of a speed limit.  One is that it would be reasonable, but the more important one is that it would be part <Col N="836" /> of a general policy.  I should be completely against the bringing into force of regulations imposing a speed limit and doing nothing else.  If we had a complete safety code, part of which prescribed a speed limit, I would agree with the reasonableness of it and attempt to obey it.</P>
    <P>There are, however, alternative, methods and practicable methods of reducing the number of accidents.  Two of the recent fatal accidents which occurred in the vicinity of Dublin occurred on stretches of roads where the motoring papers had predicted that an accident would occur.  The roads are badly constructed; they are wrongly cambered; and they are inviting an accident.  My son, who is a better motorist than I am, predicts that, in the near future, there will be a serious accident on the portion of the road at Loughlinstown Fever Hospital, on the hill where the road curves, because the camber there is wrong.  It may be recorded that it is predicted that there will be a serious accident. there and we will see whether it occurs. If one can predict by looking at a road that an accident will occur, surely the obvious precaution is to change the road.  It is not a question of any big process of rebuilding or replanning.  It is a question of correctly cambering the road.</P>
    <P>Senator Butler has referred to the question of education.  Every road user wants education.  A great many motorists want it; cyclists want it even more; and pedestrians also want it.  I was driving a couple of weeks ago in Sligo, following fairly slowly a small car.  The driver of the car gave the signal for me to pass and then turned to the right.  What can you do with people like that?  They are suicides, although, in that case, nothing happened. I was not driving myself and we were going slowly, so an accident was avoided; but I or my driver might very well have been blamed, if an accident had occurred.  That driver wanted education.  Cyclists want education even more.  They give no signals or they give wrong signals, while pedestrians just gander across the street without looking to the right or to the left to see whether traffic <Col N="837" /> is or is not coming.  The respect that the pedestrian has for the brakes of motor cars is beyond comprehension. Even Senator Summerfield's new car will not pull up as rapidly as some pedestrians think it should.</P>
    <P>I am thoroughly in favour of treating in the most severe way in the courts abuse of alcohol leading to accidents. As to overcrowding of cars&mdash;the baby Austin with four adults and seven children&mdash;no driver can drive a car safely in such conditions.  As to breaches of existing regulations&mdash;we have some very reasonable regulations.  We have traffic lights.  Senator Miss Butler, in her innocence, said that the cyclists obeyed these lights.  I follow a different road into town from Senator Summerfield.  Almost every day I cross Essex Bridge, approach the City Hall and turn left into Dame Street.  Six times out of seven the light is at red when I reach the City Hall.  I stop Every other motorist stops.  I have never seen a motorist jumping that light.  Every time I stop at that corner I am passed, not merely on the left, but on the right, by hordes of cyclists. I have scarcely ever seen a cyclist stop at that light.  The regulations are there.  Why do not the guards enforce them?  You have a safety device in the lights.  The lights are a thing that I respect even if I can see around the corner, even if I know there is not a single vehicle, pedestrian or cyclist within a quarter of a mile.  I think everyone should respect the red light, and until cyclists are made to respect them, by being fined, I do not see any great future for safety.</P>
    <P>In connection with how you are to deal with cyclists, my suggestion would be singularly unpopular.  It is, that every cyclist should have a number.  I would not enforce a big licence fee, say 1/- a year or something of that sort, but why should not a cyclist have a number?  Then he will know his number can be taken and that he can be prosecuted instead of accelerating rapidly and getting out of the way before he can be caught. That device is a very simply enforced one and would do a great deal to ensure greater safety.</P>
    <P>As to the suggestion that Senator <Col N="838" /> Summerfield made of having stops on roads approaching major roads, an increase of those is of the greatest importance and every stop signal should be treated with the utmost respect and any breach of that regulation should be heavily penalised.  It is no use having regulations unless you see that they are enforced.  One is entitled, if travelling on a main road, passing a junction at right angles to assume that nothing is going to come out on the main road.  If it does, it is the fault of that thing that comes out, if an accident occurs.</P>
    <P>There is one other suggestion which would do a great deal to obviate serious accidents.  The majority of the accidents the scene of which I have visited subsequent to the accident have been, not on right angle bends but on slow curves, often on a fairly narrow road.  On these, there is, in this country, practically no prohibition on passing.  If you had properly marked lines on the surface of the road, as there is in England, showing where passing is allowed and where passing is not allowed, it would be one of the cheapest safety devices.  A few men with whitewash in a bucket could put the marks on the road.  The places where the marks are to go would need a good deal of consideration.  That is a very cheaply applied remedy and would do a great deal to avoid danger.  You could do that on these dangerous curves, on pretty well cambered roads. In that way you would cut down very considerably the number of serious accidents.</P>
    <P>I could talk at considerable length on this question but I am sure other Senators want to talk.  I hope I have contributed a few suggestions.  I want to say again that, if speed limits are introduced in a reasonable and intelligent way as part of a general safety code, I would favour them.  Speed limits alone, without anything else, I would oppose completely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBurke" hpid="Mr. R.M. Burke Mr. R.M. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House by repeating the many useful suggestions which have already been made.  I counted over 30 suggestions made here this evening. The debate should do a great deal <Col N="839" /> of good and I entirely agree that all the contributory causes of accidents should be taken into consideration. I want to mention a few points that have not been referred to. First of all, there is the matter of small country towns.  If we were to have a speed limit in these towns, 20 miles an hour in some towns and 15 miles in others, might be considered reasonable, but on days when there is a fair in the town and when the town is full of animals, it might not be safe to travel at ten miles an hour.  If there is to be a speed limit it should be made clear that if a driver says he was not driving above the speed limit that fact should not exonerate him.  It should still be within the power of the Guards to prosecute a person for dangerous driving because, in certain circumstances, ten miles an hour, or even less, might be dangerous driving, especially in small country towns that have very narrow streets.</P>
      <P>I still believe that there is a lot to be said for a speed limit.  In many parts of Ireland considerable improvements have been carried out on the roads but I agree that enough has not been done yet.  In some cases we have widened the roads considerably and have widened corners and made curves instead of right-angle bends.  I have discussed this matter with a number of people, members of the Galway County Council, and others, and a good many of them have said to me that we spend thousands of pounds widening these roads and improving the corners and the result is that the motorist goes twice or three times as fast and the roads are just as dangerous as they were at the start. Therefore I think there is a very strong case for a speed limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point in favour of the speed limit is that some drivers are absentminded. I would not say that every driver going fast does it simply through selfishness.  A good deal of it is done through selfishness and thoughtlessness and bad manners but some may do it because of absent-mindedness.  If there were a speed limit and if they were continually reminded by notices <Col N="840" /> warning of the speed limit it would make them concentrate more and they would be more careful.  As Senator Miss Butler said, it would have a psychological effect.  If there is to be a speed limit, I believe it would be desirable to have uniformity to the extent that if there are two towns in different counties that are similar in every respect the speed limit should be the same in each.  I do not think it would be desirable to leave the matter entirely to a local authority because in one county they might have a speed limit ten miles an hour or five miles an hour lower than the speed limit in the adjoining county.  I suggest that the system should be to have officials of the Department who would travel the whole country and inspect the various towns and villages and decide what would be a reasonable speed limit for each.</P>
    <P>There is still a certain number of people&mdash;a very dangerous minority&mdash; who will go at tremendous speed.  In one part of County Galway a number of villagers came out when they knew a certain person was going to travel the road and were ready waiting with 50 sods of turf and threw them at the car while it was passing.  That shows the length to which people will go when they disapprove of speeding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, some of the sods hit the car.  It shows the length to which people will go when they are exasperated by speeding.  I would not like people to think that I was suggesting for a moment that all the blame should be put on the car drivers.  I do a great deal of cycling myself, and I entirely agree that a lot of the dangers are due to cyclists.  I think it is a most dangerous thing for three or four cyclists to ride abreast.  Senator Miss Butler mentioned a large number of European countries in which they have these speed limits.  That is a matter that we should give very serious consideration to.  If other countries have them there is probably a very good reason for that.  I hope that all the suggestions that have been put forward this evening will receive serious consideration <Col N="841" /> and that every contributory cause will be taken into consideration. We should not spare money in trying to save human lives and the enormous amount of human suffering that is caused every week as a result of road accidents.</P>

      <P>When I saw this motion I thought it was the usual type of harmless motion and would be debated like most others of the kind.  These motions do a considerable amount of good by focussing public opinion on the very important matter with which they deal.  I must say that I have been alarmed by the speeches I have listened to here to-night.  It is quite obvious that Senator Miss Butler has given a considerable amount of thought to this subject, and the same may be said of Senator Summerfield.  He spoke as a man who has had very considerable experience.  If one were to take seriously what Senator Duffy said, one would imagine that it was dangerous for anyone to walk on the roads of the country&mdash;that a motorist was likely to come along out of the blue, drive on top of him, turn around and drive back over him, and the motorist would be brought into court and that nothing would happen.  The Senator's suggestion was just fantastic.  If we ever arrive at the stage in this country where a man can have a genuine accident and, through no fault of his, kill something, and if when taken to Court is not acquitted honourably, it will be a very dangerous stage indeed.  It is obvious that Senator Duffy does not drive a car.  I would like to think that he does not take a drink either. It is obvious that he must be jealous of people who drive a car into the country.</P>

      <P>As Senator Honan has said, I have had plenty of experience on both sides of the counter.  I have driven a car for years and, like most people, I have had a few accidents from time to time.  I have not yet arrived at the stage where, I think, all the blame is to be put on the man driving the car.  There is a good deal to be said against the attitude of certain people who drive cars at ridiculous speeds.  Since the debate started I met a member of the House in the Lobby who asked me what I thought of it.  I said that I was amazed; that the Minister for Agriculture was going to do away with horses, that he was going to make it a crime punishable by death to use horses, and that Senator Duffy, obviously, was going to make the driving of a motor car a crime suitable for imprisonment.  I said that I supposed the only thing that we could do in these circumstances was to take to flying.</P>
      <P>My friend said that he was not taking any part in the debate.  He said that about 15 years ago he bought a secondhand car in which he took the wife and family for a drive to the County Meath.  When going around a bend on the road he took particular care that there would be no accident. He slowed down to ten or 12 miles an hour.  When he did so a racing cyclist bumped into him, smashed his bicycle, and had his face badly cut.  The cyclist was brought to court by the company representing the motorist and was fined £50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of accidents are caused not so much by speed as by bad driving.  In America, where they do things in a very efficient way, you can be prosecuted for going too slow in certain States.  Senator Summerfield indicated <Col N="843" /> some ways whereby a lot of accidents could be avoided.  In America, at a right angle turn to a main road, a car must come to a dead stop.  If you do that you cannot get up sufficient speed in a hurry to do very much damage.  This motion asks for the introduction of speed limits.</P>

      <P>I was under the impression that the commissioner had power to establish speed limits anywhere he liked.  If that is not so, then I think there ought to be some way of controlling traffic so that it can be made safe for people in built-up areas and in towns.  I refuse to believe that there is not already some regulation whereby the Guards can insist on certain speed limits.</P>

      <P>Suppose there is not any such power, will the Senator agree that there is a need to consider this motion seriously in relation to built-up areas?</P>

      <P>In the case of built-up areas and of country towns, I think that the whole situation should be considered seriously.  At the same time, I do not say that you can decide on a speed limit and have it efficiently controlled. Senator Summerfield suggested if that were to be done efficiently you would need to have Guards all over the country with stop watches in their hands.  I do not believe that would meet the situation. I believe that what you want is to focus public opinion on this question generally, and try to get the motoring public to realise their responsibilities and cyclists as well.</P>

      <Col N="844" /> There is one thing that needs urgent attention and that is the question of headlights.  I drove from Clonmel to Dublin last night and from my experience I can say that it is a miracle there are not many more accidents.  In connection with headlights, I believe there is a new invention on the market now, some type of a non-dazzle glass.  A man driving against headlights in present circumstances might as well pull something over his head, for he can see nothing.  You can only hope for the best.  Last night, I passed 20 or 30 cars coming in the opposite direction, and the only reason why there was not somebody killed was because there were no cyclists on the road. That is all known to the cyclists, but if a cyclist is brought up in court for not having a tail-light on his bicycle there is sympathy for him and the judge is considered a terrible man if he just fines him.  I suppose we have a tradition of law-breaking in the country, going back for centuries, and it is not easy to get us wittingly to accept any regulations.</P>
    <P>I believe that what we want is not so much any hard and fast laws as to the speed at which we should travel, but propaganda telling the people their duties and responsibilities.  We should not, at the same time, allow ourselves to run away with the idea that because a man happens to drive a car he has no sense of proportion.  The average man driving a car is afraid of his life that he will run on top of somebody. We have known people who had the misfortune to run people down, through no fault of their own, and they have been haunted for the rest of their lives by the memory of the occurrence.  I know that I am in mortal terror, when driving, that I might knock down some small kid.  What you want is to get people thinking on right lines, by means of pictures or something of that kind, rather than trying to regiment them.</P>
