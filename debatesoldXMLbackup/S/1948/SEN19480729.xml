      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the closing of the debate last night, I was referring to the statement of Senator Hawkins with regard to business and his description of the depression caused therein by remarks of mine.  I do not like to fall back on comparisons of an odious nature, but I would point out that the former Minister for Finance, when questioned in Dáil Eireann with regard to prices and their effect upon the cost of living, announced to the Dáil that the public had the remedy in their own hands&mdash;that, if they stopped buying for a bit, they would bring prices down. In any event, I have that in common with my predecessor&mdash;that we both had seen that very effect clearly enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hawkins is of the view that manufacturers have ceased to produce because of remarks which may tend to take purchasers out of the market for a while.  I have no evidence of that, although I asked my colleague in the Department of Industry and Commerce this morning if there was any evidence that would bear it out, but so far I cannot find the slightest trace of it.  I was somewhat confused by Senator Hawkins' further remark when he asked me to impose a price control. I do not know what is the difference between asking people to stop purchasing for a bit, so that the stress of competition would help to bring down prices, and enforcing a price control presumably at a lower level of prices <Col N="532" /> than now obtains.  Such price control Orders have, in the main, not been effective&mdash;they have helped to raise prices rather than restrict them because they have to be taken by and large and so have not led to the desired effect&mdash;but if Senator Hawkins meant to impose a price control which would bring down prices and if the bringing down of prices caused unemployment amongst manufacturers and those in the distributive trades, he is going to achieve the same result by a more devious course.</P>
    <P>I spent the morning investigating this mysterious client of Senator Hawkins who told him that he had paid 8/-extra for a pair of boots.  It has been said of some men that they are so stupid that they could not do business with a slot machine without being fooled.  I do not know who the Senator's friend is, but, as revealed in Dáil Eireann, the situation with regard to boots and shoes this year is that there is considerable unemployment in the boot manufacturing industry. Nearly 900 people were affected.  That was in the beginning of this year and was due to two things.  The first of these was that, somewhere in the early part of 1947, for a reason which I have not yet had explained to me, it was decided to remove to a great extent the quota Orders which were applicable to boots and shoes and also to relax the tariff conditions.  The result was that tremendous importations of boots and shoes swept into the country.  But that is not the whole story.  The ordinary demand for boots and shoes, taken on the years before 1942 and including that year, thus giving a representative average&mdash;amounted to 650,000 pairs.  In 1947, the home manufacturers produced two and a half times that amount and importations brought the amount available here for customers up to three times the annual demand.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, answering a question in the Dáil yesterday, said he had taken certain action already with regard to reimposing quotas and doing something with regard to tariffs, but that what he would do further about the industry would depend on how the industry would develop and particularly <Col N="533" /> on how it developed a balanced trade as between the heavy boot and shoe&mdash;what we call the agricultural boot&mdash;and the other types.  The situation in the country at the time Senator Hawkins' friend was asked, and apparently paid, 8/- more for a pair of boots was that the country was flooded with boots and shoes, and when, according to every known economic law, the prices should have gone down.</P>
    <P>I have also gone to the trouble to look up whatever cost of living index figures there are in relation to boots and shoes.  There is, of course, no segregation of the special type of boot about which the Senator spoke, but boots and shoes generally show no rise at all in price.  All I can do is to ask the Senator to go back to his friend and get the receipt for these boots from him, because I think he has a cause of complaint, if not a cause of action, against the man who robbed him of 8/- for his pair of boots.  It was sheer robbery in the conditions which existed either in the second half of last year or any part of this year.  I have not been able to investigate the matter of the fabric because it is not so easy to spot, but any information I have would tend to dispose of the point Senator Hawkins made with regard to the prices charged. The cost of living index figure shows no increase in respect of clothing and that is what one might have expected from the amount of apparel of different types for sale in the country at the moment. The only surprising thing to me is that the cost of living index figure has not shown a much steeper fall in respect of these items than is shown.</P>
    <P>The Senator also said that the trade agreement with France had neglected trade in the type of tweed made in the Gaeltacht.  No type of tweed whatever is excluded from the French agreement. It may be that certain French customers will not take the tweed made in the Gaeltacht.  I understand that it is single width and may be unsuited to the French market.  If the Senator insists that we should try to change French tastes and make the people there take a type of cloth they are not accustomed to, he is asking us to do a great deal.  The allegation is that those who made this agreement forgot <Col N="534" /> the Gaeltacht tweeds, or that, having remembered the character of the tweeds made in the Gaeltacht, neglected to come to the aid of these people.  The trade treaty is framed in general terms and there is no exclusion in it or in any documents concerning it.  If nothing is being done with regard to Gaeltacht tweeds, it is a matter for those who trade in France.  The other matters of a general and economic type to which Senator Hawkins referred, I want to leave over until the end of my remarks.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien raised the, to me, very attractive matter of the university finances.  I want to correct his figures before we go any further.  The sum of money set down in one Estimate for university education is £327,000, divided between a certain number of universities and university colleges, but there are other sums of money devoted to that purpose.  In the Vote for Agriculture, there is a certain additional sum and there is a further additional grant to University College, Cork, and these put another £60,000 on and bring the tot to £387,000.  That is the figure I should like to get prominently before this House and Dáil Eireann&mdash; that the entire subvention which this country makes to higher education is something under £400,000.</P>
    <P>As a matter of curiosity, I looked up the figures which I had always used for comparison purposes when in opposition and I want to present them to this House now.  About 1938 or 1939, the Vote for Civil Aviation and Meteorological Services first began to assume any kind of serious proportions, but even in 1939, the entire moneys spent by the State in respect of aviation of the civil type and services in connection with meteorology were somewhere in the region of £60,000.  The Vote for Aviation and Meteorological Services at this moment is £1,628,000, the subsidy to aviation alone being £600,000.  We give as a subsidy to aviation services 50 per cent. extra to what we provide for the whole of higher education.  When I add certain other moneys on a second Vote, it brings the civil aviation cost to £1,827,000.  I suggest to Senator O'Brien that arguments based on those <Col N="535" /> figures may be more effective when appealing to people who would not be appreciative of the arguments in regard to university education.  Most people agree with it in theory, but when asked to pay they retract from the first position.  If the country is able to afford £600,000 for aviation services, which are not likely ever to pay and have only a prestige value, it would not be too much to ask that the amount spent on university education be increased. I hope to put that point before my colleagues at a later stage to see if something better can be done for the universities.  The pressure on the Exchequer at present makes it unlikely that such a provision can take high priority, but it will be considered as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Certain arguments have been made regarding agricultural development, which is the policy of the Government to which I belong.  I am pleased to get statements from the side of the House from which I did not expect them, on dairying and dairy products being the pivotal point of agriculture. Senator Orpen yesterday said something about proceeding by way of trial and error, but that it may be possible to minimise the adverse effects of error by having some sort of thought beforehand.  Very little thought was devoted to the sweeping rush this country was made take into the side of agriculture other than dairy produce. We have spent the best part of 15 years on this system of trial and error &mdash;mainly error&mdash;and now have arrived at the position that a Government Commission has reported that this concentration on cereal growing is not a proper thing for peace time here.</P>
    <P>Spokesmen from the Fianna Fáil Party have put themselves on record here as accepting that aid will be given mainly to the dairying side of agriculture. When it comes to the question of how it ought to be provided, I find myself in difficulty.  There are plenty of facilities at the moment, though possibly not all that agriculturists will want; but when that question is posed, one has to look at the answer provided by agriculturists themselves. They are availing of banking facilities <Col N="536" /> and of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and if a case is made that those are not meeting the demand, or are meeting it in terms the farmers cannot afford, that can be looked into.  The case made that the amelioration of agriculture has to depend upon facilities at a very low rate of interest does not seem borne out by the evidence.  I understand that agriculture at the moment is being held up mainly through lack of fertilisers and of certain equipment which cannot be obtained, at least with the kind of resources we have.  That may be eased in the near future.</P>
    <P>I welcome what Senator Honan said regarding dairying, but I counter what he said regarding Aer Lingus and ask him to accept my positive assurance now that the Government has nothing whatever to do with the running of Aer Lingus.  There have been dismissals which are associated with Aer Lingus, in so far as Aer Lingus had built up part of their staff to serve a transatlantic service, and where the impact of Government has had some adverse effect.  With regard to the staff of Aer Lingus, the Government has nothing to do with it.  The decision to make substantial economies in staff was taken in December, 1947, but was stayed on request until the Government had a chance to see if there could be some gradual easement of the situation. The Senator will have noticed from statements in the papers that in any dismissals associated with Aerlinte, as opposed to Aer Lingus, certain terms better than in the contracts were offered to the employees; and the State is bearing the cost of that.  Aer Lingus is operating a service on its own and will be left to do so.  It will arrange the charges on passengers and so on, and the Board of Aer Lingus will develop that company as it thinks best.  The Government will have no impact upon that service whatever.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the Senator's argument about the amazing amount of good done to us by the Shannon Airport.  That is an exaggerated statement. There is a sort of &ldquo;Crewe Junction&rdquo; traffic growing at the Shannon.  No one would find any solid basis there for economic improvement. <Col N="537" /> It is a passing traffic and has not yet been of sufficient good to balance the financial disadvantages from having to erect and now maintain that airport.  I think the Senator would agree with me, having an intimate knowledge of that area, that the vast majority of people who come there do not stay more than a few hours.  A very small percentage spend enough time to get from the airport to Limerick.  If we could get more money and less advice from those who do come to the port, I would be better pleased.</P>
    <P>The question of the Tourist Board is <i>sub judice</i> at the moment and I do not care to go into it.  Senator Colgan says that it has upgraded prices without upgrading the services, and I think that is the case generally made.  However, it was set up before my time, it is still there, lingering on, and I would like to have a decision taken that would put it out of agony or give it a chance to look forward to the future. That decision cannot be made right away.  The Senator also complained that juries are called to the Four Courts in order to assist barristers to get paid on their briefs.  That is a complete misconception.  The brief over which a counsel would get his cheque would be out long before the jury would come into court.</P>
    <P>Senator Mrs. Concannon has referred to the huge sum in the Bill.  I am glad it is getting home to people&mdash;it is not the first time Senator Mrs. Concannon has made that type of observation&mdash; that the sums are huge, even staggering. Of course they are&mdash;far beyond the capacity of the people to meet.  There may be the excuse that they were forced up in critical and exceptional years, but as those years are passing by we are entitled to hope for the assistance of everyone in reducing those staggering figures.  In that connection, I would ask people to forbear from basing arguments upon such luxuries as the short-wave station, which apparently we were having built here, and which we would have to keep and incur certain expense in everyday transmissions, so that in the event of some war breaking out we would be able to have one last dying cry issued <Col N="538" /> from the station to the nations of the world.  It is not a very good argument on which to base a case for a short-wave station, in the face of the other matters to which I will refer briefly again.</P>
    <P>Valuations are not a matter for the Government.  There is a Valuation Department, the service of which is provided by the taxpayers.  Whenever there is a revaluation&mdash;in the absence of a general revaluation code, and that is not contemplated&mdash;the revaluations are made at the request of the particular local authority, which takes the initiative. Also, the complaint about the increased rates is a matter for the local authority.  Apparently, Galway decided to have it both ways and were not satisfied with raising the rate and letting the valuation alone.  It does not seem to be pretending about a small increase in the rate and getting more money through an increase in the valuation.  I would ask the Senator to apply to the local authority.  Someone else made a point that instructions should go out to these valuers to include a reference to neighbouring hereditaments or similar hereditaments, so that the valuation might proceed on the basis of equalising as between areas. There was always a resort open to an aggrieved person, to go to the courts, where a matter could be argued out before independent judiciary.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy mainly referred to more general economic problems, which I am keeping to the end.  He spoke of transport.  An inquiry is proceeding at the moment into transport&mdash;not merely the activities of Córas Iompair Éireann, but also the Great Northern Railway; and in so far as there is any other transport body which, so to speak, bears upon the activities of those two statutory organisations, that will also be brought inside the terms of reference, which are very wide.  Senator Duffy seems to expect that, before the inquiry proceeds any length, the Government should say whether they are going to maintain or abandon the railway system.  That is one of the objects of the inquiry&mdash;to assist the Government in determining what is to happen.  I do not think the Government ever will be faced with making a clear-cut determination that the railways <Col N="539" /> must be maintained to the exclusion of road services, or that they must be abandoned.  It seems that there will have to be some mixture, but the proper details of that are left to the commission.</P>
    <P>Senator Summerfield referred to the acquisition of real property by aliens. The only evidence I have is such as may be derived from the figures of the 25% tax on the transfer of property to non-nationals. The tax has not brought in £10,000.  There is either no property or very little property passing into the hands of aliens, or else there is complete evasion of the tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to what date does that figure refer to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last time that I saw the figure of £10,000 was about three weeks ago.  There is no revenue derived from the tax.  If the tax has been paid, and it should be paid, then there are very few cases of property passing out of the hands of nationals in this country into the hands of aliens.  If there is considerable evasion that is a matter that will have to be looked into.  I shall have it examined at once.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Callaghan used the phrase that he wanted the land drenched with phosphates, and said that farm improvement is a thing that should be aimed at.  I am not going to go into the details of that.  It was discussed in the Dáil.  I do not know what provision one could expect to be made for the betterment of agriculture that is not being made, or attempted at the moment.  I have seen in the case of trade treaties, negotiations and conferences and consultations with various Governments that the first thing that is raised is whether it is possible to get in certain fertilisers and particularly phosphates from outside countries. Every attempt is being made to improve the condition of farm lands as far as it can be done in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Meighan, who is backed up by Senator Lynch, spoke of Arigna. I do not know that any change has taken place with regard to Arigna since the 18th February when I entered office.  I understand that Córas Iompair <Col N="540" /> Éireann had made certain arrangements with regard to taking Arigna coal. Whether there has been any change I do not know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the principal coal mine in that area and they have reduced the quantity of coal that they had been taking by 100 tons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last Administration decided to bring in a large quantity of British coal.  That may have lessened the chance of Arigna getting the amount sold that used to be sold.  It is a point that I certainly will bring to the notice of the Minister for Industry and Commerce with a view to seeing whether Córas Iompair Éireann might not be brought to resume their old practice which appears to have been favourable to Arigna.  Both Senators also raised a point about an arrangement which they said was made between Arigna and the beet sugar factories.  Again I do not know if there has been any change in the last few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Senator mean that the Sugar Beet Company is not taking the same amount of Arigna fuel as before?  I would remind him that both Córas Iompair Éireann and the Beet Sugar Company are independent authorities.  They may have persuasion addressed to them, but that is about all that can be done. They are independent authorities, and I intend to leave them so.  It may be that I may make certain changes in some of these boards, but I think it is my duty to leave them alone until they are reconstituted in whole or in part. Once the boards are there they must be allowed to function in a completely independent fashion.  It would be a bad thing if the Government of the day decided to interfere with the day-to-day business activities of either Córas Iompair Éireann or a company like the Sugar Beet Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hawkins raised again the matter of loans or the servicing of loans on housing.  There was a 2½ per cent. rate associated with loans for housing but that was always notional as far as being the rate at which the State could borrow.  The loans were <Col N="541" /> given at 2½ per cent.  The new situation will be that if there is a higher interest rate struck for any moneys that are borrowed for the purposes of loans there will be an increase in the subsidy so that exactly the same result will be achieved as that which obtained previously. I do not suppose it matters to a person who is going to benefit under the various Housing Acts whether he gets the money by way of a reduction in the rate of interest or by way of an increased subsidy.  What he has to look at is the annual charge.  The annual charge will be exactly the same so that I do not know that anyone has reason to complain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>But surely if you have to pay a higher rate of interest than that charged originally over a longer term of years, it is not the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the annual charge is kept exactly the same, where is the difference?  Work it out on the basis of the annual charge over a certain number of years and give me the total and I will guarantee that the total will be the same, or that the annual charge will be the same.  I do not know how I could do better than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>But if you get a loan at 3¼ per cent. for a sewerage or water supply scheme, the tenants will have to pay an extra rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The laying on of water is regarded as part of a housing scheme in so far as that is carried by the expenses of the housing scheme.  If, however, there is a scheme to better the water supply of some little town, I do not know that it ought to be included as a housing scheme.  That would be something that would be considered as an independent activity &mdash;something additional so far as the houses already there are concerned. So far as improving the water supply of a town is concerned I think that ought to be charged for at the rate at which the Government itself is forced to borrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hearne is on a different matter.  He is dealing with the case where it is intended to improve a water supply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is being built as part of a housing scheme, then it is all a housing scheme from the point of view of getting amelioration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>Considerable numbers of houses are owned by urban authorities. These houses have never had a tap water supply, and a great many of them no sewerage system.  Now those of us who are members of local authorities desire to bring water to those houses and to provide a sewerage system for them.  Under the new dispensation work of that sort does not come under the term of a housing scheme according to the Minister. Therefore, the rate of interest charged on the loans that local authorities get for that purpose will be 3¼ per cent. The servicing of that loan will have to be met either by an increase in the rents or an increase in the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that if it has to be met by an increased rent the people are getting water that they were not getting before.  The Senator's point is that people who had no water laid on are going to get the service of water.  Why should they not pay for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>At 3¼ per cent. instead of 2½ per cent.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that make any enormous difference in the case of a water supply to houses already built? <Col N="543" /> I would be surprised to know that it would cause any great hardship.  A good deal of the increased cost could perhaps be met by having some alleviation in the charges of those who bring the water to the houses.</P>
      <P>Certain remarks of a general economic type were made in the debate.  Senator Duffy referred to the question of interest charges and the Electricity Supply Board.  On that I want to say that there is no stock exchange manipulation with regard to the Electricity Supply Board finances.  The burden imposed on the Electricity Supply Board is to remunerate the money put at its service at the rate at which&mdash;there may be some slight fraction over&mdash;the money had been borrowed from time to time.  The Senator also said that there was no necessity for interest rates at all.  That is a more general subject which we will have to leave over for another time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Séamus O'Farrell spoke about the taking over of a pagan system and that until we get rid of that the Government can go on making the same old objections and the same old excuses about obstacles being in the way and that we must come to the point where what he calls the property-less class in the community are put in a better position where they can maintain themselves.  As an ideal.  I agree with that.  It is not possible, however, simply to advance along that road in the period in which we find ourselves where the main danger is inflation.  Senator Douglas said that prices are now coming down in this country gradually.  I join in the hope that that is so and he added that materials are coming in more cheaply and that as a result there ought to be a decrease in prices.  When one joins these two points of view together, though they do not seem to be coherent, the biggest danger that I see facing the State at the moment&mdash;it is more than a danger; it is a nightmare to anybody associated with national finance&mdash;is that there is considerable pressure of an inflationary type here which is distorting the whole of our lives.  It has already been said to have a good deal of effect upon the lives of ordinary persons in the country.  But, even at the risk, and it is a risk, of <Col N="544" /> causing still further inflationary pressure, the present Government decided to alleviate some of the hardships under which even ordinary people labour.  There was quite a considerable advance in the wages paid to ordinary workers in the early months of this year.  There are other alleviations being given.  There is the alleviation which the Government itself is giving in remitting the very heavy duties imposed last year on beer and tobacco, two things which we regard as an incentive to the ordinary working man to persuade him to produce more. That is what we want.</P>
    <P>But all that is done at the risk of causing further inflation.  There are only two counters to that.  One is that there should be more goods produced because if there is more money flowing around it will have a certain impact on the small store of goods that is there.  We desire greater production from the workers.  We all desire to join with Senator O'Farrell in his point about the property-less man&mdash;that unless he gets an interest in the business he is working for, it is to be feared appeals to him to produce more goods will fall on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>In any event there is the danger of inflation.  The second counter is saving. I have appealed to people to save their money.  I make that appeal to them again in their own interest.  I think that their money will buy more later on.  I make it also in the interest of the nation&mdash;that they should not buy. By letting loose the purchasing power they now have in their own hands, they can cause an increase in the price of goods, and at the same time frustrate the efforts that are being made to put them in a better position.  What the Government did was that, instead of restricting wages, they decided to allow wages to be negotiated.  I think it has gone far enough.  I hope there will be no third round attempts.  I ask that in the interest of the workers. We think it better to allow people to have these savings because they can dispose of them freely if necessity arises instead of having them subjected to a good deal of hardship simply because they had needs and could not meet them out of the moneys in their hand. <Col N="545" /> We ask them to save.  They will have a fund out of which they can buy later and, if they accumulate a fund by saving, they will buy better later and they will buy more later and they will buy without danger to the State.</P>
    <P>I ask workers to have this before them when they are thinking of this, that they have a Government which has already shown that it is appreciative of the needs of the lower income groups of the community and that they are paying more attention to that side of the community than was ever paid before.  Certainly, attention has been more directed to meeting the needs of that class of the community than meeting the needs of those in the higher income groups.  I put that forward simply in an appeal, in this way, that it is an earnest of what we are at and that it should inspire confidence and should inspire this confidence, in particular, that if workers do save for us or refrain from spending, we will do what we can to see that what they have saved will at least have as much purchasing power in future as it has now.</P>
    <P>Do not forget that the pressure that there has been here has shown itself very definitely.  There has been a big flow of income into the hands of a very big number of people in the community and it has not been offset yet by increased production and it has not yet been offset by any savings.  The pressure that there was on the shops last year and the early part of this year resulted in the vast amount of importations that were demanded, helped by the action of the last Government in lifting the controls with regard to tariffs and quotas, which let in these enormous floods of goods all around the country.  That has its effect on our international balance of payments, and that is a very disturbing thing.  If that was a mere temporary disequilibrium in the balance of payments, one could neglect it.  There was a fair amount of restocking that had to be done.  People who had not bought, because they had not the money to spend, certain necessities or semi-luxuries, naturally broke out into a bit of an orgy of spending, and satisfied themselves, I hope, in 1947 and the early part of 1948.  If the <Col N="546" /> restocking period was over and there was not going to be the same pressure on the people from whom we buy in England or elsewhere, one could look forward to an easing of the international balance of payments situation but the signs are that it is not temporary.  It is persisting and, if it is persisting, then this country faces a very serious situation.  If that unbalance of payments continues, if it settles into a habit with us, it is a habit that we must break ourselves off very speedily or else we will find ourselves in a deplorable condition.</P>
    <P>There are these assets of ours abroad. Whether it was right to pile them up in the times they were piled up is a matter we can discuss later.  There is not much profit in discussing it now because it has been done, but, in the old days, this country lived at a certain standard of living by producing certain goods which we exported and getting goods in return.  We also financed ourselves to the tune of between £18 million and £20 million a year.  We got in goods to that extent over and above the goods we sent out because we had refrained from spending in earlier days and had investments and savings piled up.  The value of these savings has very much depreciated and import prices have gone very definitely against us.  If we are to continue to live at the standard of living which demands the old time £20 million of imports over and above what we export from this country, we will require every penny that we have of sterling assets at the increased amounts, and we are wasting those.  We are living beyond our means as far as the difference between the balance of payments shows and, unless we can correct that, we will soon come to the point where these reserves will be dissipated and weakened to the point that they will not give us the old reserve.  In that position, two things have to be done. We will have to make a tremendous effort to get extra exports from the country or else we definitely lower our standard of living in so far as that depends upon these importations.</P>
    <P>I should mention the point that, of course, if what we have abroad can only be brought home in the form of <Col N="547" /> capital goods that will lead to greater production, nobody is going to object. That is a most desirable situation. That is not occurring.  A very small percentage indeed of the importation of 1947 and the early part of 1948 represents capital goods and remember, all capital goods are not to be regarded as of value.  It is only such capital goods as will lead to a production that will offset the loss of income suffered when we surrender certain of the balances through purchases.  But, at the moment, the situation is quite a serious one.  The country is definitely living beyond its means.  We have achieved a standard of living which we are not earning for ourselves by what we make in this country and export.  There are two ways in which that can be met.  One is by refraining from purchasing at this moment when purchases are dear and the second is by getting greater production.</P>
    <P>All the efforts this Government can make will be bent towards getting greater production, such greater production as will result in a greater surplus of exportable goods.  If we cannot get that, the other alternative must be faced, that of limiting our purchases from England and elsewhere, with whatever that may mean in the decreasing of our standard of living.</P>
    <P>It has been said by a critic of the English situation that their situation is like holding what is called a welfare clinic on board a sinking ship and the commentator who said that wondered whether they would start first discussing social security and overtime for the process of drowning.  We are not exactly in such bad condition but we are getting close to it.  Nobody would say that in this country the ship is sinking but we are certainly waterlogged. I do not know whether it would be possible to get the situation righted very soon and without a considerable amount of difficulty for the population.  It can be asked then, in that connection, why is it that, while I am speaking here, they are discussing in the Dáil a very big measure of social welfare.  They are discussing it because again the priorities had such demand that they could not be refused.  The <Col N="548" /> difficulty of the case of old age pensioners, blind persons and widows and orphans has imposed itself on the conscience of most people associated with public life.  There is a danger in doing what has been done because there is going to be £2 million let loose and that is money that cannot be saved. That money is going to be spent. There must be a corresponding saving to make up for that increase in purchasing power which we felt must be given even though there are certain dangers attached to it but again that has been done as an indication to the people who are looking on anxiously on Government activity that the people who are not just able to help themselves are being put in the foreground for assistance.  When we do that, we do it with an appreciation of the dangers and we do it with a warning to the people who are not in that very derelict position that they must do their part by saving themselves and by persuading those whom they can to save also so that we will not get the cost of living raised both on us and the people whom we now set out to aid.</P>
    <P>Senator Summerfield said that some of these days our social services will be the admiration of the world.  I wish he would get off that perch. Our social services will never be that. We could not afford social services that would be the admiration of the world.  If we do have such social services we will have a cost imposed on the workers of this State that will beggar them.  In the end, social services are paid for by the workers of the community.  There is no big community of rich people here out of whose hat, so to speak, we could lift what we want to pay for social services and, if social services expand and expand, unless at the same time production expands, then the position will be that the worker may get an advance in his nominal wages but he will find that he has had no advance in his real wages.  I think it does no good to the community to have aspirations of the ambitious type that Senator Summerfield has voiced, as if they could be brought at any time within the bounds of reality.  We can have some social services here.  They may <Col N="549" /> be slight in comparison with what rich countries can afford.  We can have better social services if production goes up.  We cannot carry increased social services with our present very low rate of production.</P>
    <P>One of the worst features of our life, as the present Government found when we took up office on the 18th February, was the amazing drop there was in production.  Productivity had gone to a very low level.  Productivity has not advanced very much yet although there are signs that it may take up.  But I think we are meeting, not merely the impact of the difficulties of the war years but of the years from 1932 onwards.  This country did suffer very seriously under what was called the economic war.  It is still suffering in part from the results of that period and if Senator Hawkins tells me that we have been now five months in office, I say that I will have to be almost five years in office before a real change can be made in the situation, but the tracks can be laid and I think we are laying them.  I ask for assistance in progressing along the lines we are developing.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to Vote 54 which provides for salaries and expenses in connection with Gaeltacht Services, including housing grants and purchase and sale of homespuns.  There is an urgent necessity for the introduction of a new Gaeltacht Housing Bill.  It was the practice of previous Governments in the matter of housing in the Gaeltacht areas, where it is essential that the work already begun should proceed as rapidly as possible, to give grants on a larger scale than those given in urban and rural areas.  Last year, a Housing Bill was introduced in which provision was made for increased grants to persons building for themselves, to local authorities and to public utility societies, and I draw the Minister's attention to the need for the introduction of a Bill to increase these grants in respect of Gaeltacht housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's interpretation of the increase in the rate of <Col N="551" /> interest to local authorities, there seems to be a misunderstanding as between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government, under whose care housing comes.  Last week, the Minister for Local Government addressed a meeting of persons interested in housing in Tralee and he asked the local authorities to undertake a housing drive as speedily as possible. He visited the many sites, but when the question was asked, as naturally the question will be put by each local authority, as to what contribution they would get from the Central Fund the Minister was unable to reply.  He was unable to tell the local authorities the amount by which the present subsidy would be increased, or the particular works to which the increased loan charges would apply.  If we are to get on with the housing drive, the first thing to do is to see to it that the Minister for Local Government will be aware of the conditions under which he expects and asks local authorities to proceed and I ask the Minister to clarify the position as between his Department and the Department of Local Government.  Last week, a question was asked in the Dáil on much the same lines by a Deputy from Galway and the Minister was unable to provide the information sought.</P>
    <P>With regard to employment and emergency schemes, I drew attention in the course of my Second Reading speech to the fact that here again there were cuts in the Estimates of various amounts.  We find, in a statement by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister, that the sum provided for employment schemes this year is £1,250,000 and, of that, a sum of £766,000 is already allocated for schemes up to 31st March, which leaves £484,000 to be allocated for the various works carried out by the Office of Public Works.  I put it once more to the Minister that that is a very small contribution from the Central Fund to these schemes, if we are to make a serious effort to end the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister last night challenged me to produce the figures to show that unemployment exists.  The Minister <Col N="552" /> will have no objection to accepting the figures published in the <i>Irish Times.</i> According to the <i>Irish Times</i> of 9th July, the number of persons registered at the employment exchanges on 3rd July, was 45,514, the number registered in the corresponding period of last year being 39,000.  According to the <i>Irish Times</i> of 23rd of this month, the number of persons registered on 17th July, was 45,429, the number registered in the corresponding period last year being 38,000, showing an increase of 7,000 as between the two periods.  I think it was Senator Burke who suggested that quite a number of these people were not available for employment and he went further and said that they were unemployable.  If such is the case, these people are receiving unemployment assistance under false pretences but, so far as I am aware, knowing the rigour with which the conditions are enforced, there are very few people who succeed in drawing unemployment assistance, unless they are genuinely registered and available for employment at any place and at any time.</P>

      <P>Words fail me at that point.  I think the figures show an increase of about 6,000 or 7,000, depending on the period you take. Nearly 4,000 of these are people affected by the change made with regard to valuation.  I suppose the Seanad is aware that there was a time, if a person had a valuation of a certain amount, no matter what condition he was in, he could not register as unemployed and was disqualified from receiving unemployment assistance.  That was <Col N="554" /> changed and the particular maximum valuation doubled.  There are a vast number of people who come in as a result.  The calculation has been made in the Department of Social Welfare that something like 4,000 of the people who are newly on the register come from that class.  They are people who probably always were entitled to unemployment assistance, but who were disqualified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the points that is to be questioned, but they have not signed on as being unemployed turf workers, and they were asked to do so.  I have said already that nearly 900 people were disemployed entirely, or in part, as a result of the over-production of boots and shoes.  There have been strikes which had a considerable impact upon the unemployment situation&mdash;the cement strike and the repercussions it had on the building trade.  Nearly the whole of the 7,000 people can be accounted for as between those affected by the change in valuation, those affected by the cement strike, mainly building operatives and those in the cement industry itself, and those employed in footwear manufacture.  We are still looking for the unemployed turf workers.</P>
      <P>I cannot answer the Senator with regard to the Galway harbour development matter.  It is a matter which my Parliamentary Secretary has under consideration, but I will refer the Parliamentary Secretary to what the Senator has said and I hope he will have success in his efforts.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in his last statement, apologised for the increased number of unemployed, and pointed out the change in valuation and the numbers of people who had become eligible for unemployment assistance. I admit that that is so, but that was a concession given in order to pacify, if you wish, a number of families in the west of Ireland, in Kerry and in Donegal, who were not employed on national turf production by the county councils, but who were producing turf by their own family labour, and who, as a result of the dropping of the scheme, if not entitled to unemployment assistance, would be entitled to public assistance of one kind or another.  These people are not eligible for work on these schemes being carried out in substitution for the turf production work of county councils.  In order to be entitled to employment on these schemes, a man must have been employed originally by a county council on turf production.  These people now taken on the unemployed register were not employed by county councils but were producing turf by their own family labour.  While it is some excuse for the increase of 7,000 as shown by the figures for 17th July last, it is not right that it should be glossed over by stating that it is due to some change in the register.</P>

    <P>Last night we had a very harmful <Col N="556" /> speech from Senator J.T. O'Farrell on Partition&mdash;a lecture rather than a speech&mdash;so well prepared that I could see it was a typewritten document read to the House.  If it were a document that would be of benefit nationally and end this crime against the nation, we would welcome it.  It was a document that would not give such service, but which would do irreparable damage on this question.  It was suggested that those engaged in bringing Partition before the world should not refer to the partitioned area as the &ldquo;Six Counties&rdquo; but should refer to it under the title of an ancient portion of Ireland.</P>

I hold that it is the duty of every citizen to do, at every time and place, all he or she can to bring this great injustice before the people and help in any way, no matter how small, to solve this question.  I am sure there are very few people in this House or in Senator O'Farrell's organisation who agree with the sentiments he put forward last night.  There are those who take their lead from the <i>Irish Times</i> and who have suggested that this tour or the organisation of bringing before the nations of the world the question of Partition should not be carried on at the present time.  I have already pointed out in the last few weeks all the schemes that have been put in abeyance.  Senator O'Farrell suggests here that this question of Partition should be put in abeyance.</P>

      <P>We were told last night by Senator O'Farrell that this question of Partition should not be referred to.  There was reference to self-appointed leaders going through the country and outside the country on this question.  I hold&mdash;and I think many people will hold with me&mdash;that a great service has been rendered by Mr. de Valera in his tour abroad.  When this nation was striving for its very existence, for the freedom we have now, what was the first step the people in charge of our organisation took?  It was to send our ambassadors throughout the world to bring before the peoples of the world the claim of the Irish Nation to independence.  Is it not right, when making a last effort to secure complete freedom, that we should rally behind us the support of our people in every part of the world and particularly the people responsible for this injustice?  I wish to protest as strongly as I can against the statement made by Senator O'Farrell last night and I feel I have the majority of the members of the House on my side in doing so.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister leaves the House, I would appeal to him to make more clear the statements he has given us in reply <Col N="558" /> to the debate.  He talked about the need for more production and the necessity for deflation.  We all agree, at least in theory, with those sentiments, but it is not clear to some of us, and particularly to the ordinary wage earner, how he can help to bring about deflation and increase production.  I know the Minister referred to £2,000,000 extra which probably will be given in spending power to poorer sections of the community in contemplated legislation, but that cannot be regarded as making the inflationary position worse, because that £2,000,000 will go to the people whose purchasing power at present is entirely inadequate and it will not be spent on luxuries but on necessary goods of our own production. There will not be imported any expensive unessential things for the old age pensioners and widows and orphans, no matter how much you may increase their allowances.</P>
      <P>It is not clear to me what the ordinary worker can do to speed up production. What can the bus driver or conductor, the railway porter or shop assistant, the employee of the county council or the worker on the roads or sweeping the streets&mdash;what can they do to increase production?  At the same time, it is essential to increase production and that purchasing should be restricted and that purchasing power not expended should be laid aside and saved.  I agree with that, but if we reduce our purchases we are bound to cause unemployment in the distributive trades.  It is not that I am opposed to the principles the Minister has stated, but because in broad principle I agree with him, that I wish he would make it clear to the general public, who are no more informed on it than I am, what exactly he means and what we can do to assist in bringing about a position of deflation and increased production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He made one point with which I agree and which is long overdue&mdash; that the workers should be given added incentive to do their share for the improvement of industry as well as they did nationally, by giving them some share in the control of industry. It is not possible to give them the control quickly in every industry, <Col N="559" /> but at least the gesture should be made and the principle accepted.  I would ask the Minister, for the sake of achieving what he wishes and what we all hope to bring about, to make it clear what the ordinary citizen can do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise for a moment for the purpose of repudiating a flagrant attempt at misrepresentation of what I said yesterday, by Senator Hawkins.  He accused me of having notes.  If he went to the same trouble, it would considerably raise the standard of his contributions, and save a considerable amount of valuable time in this House.  We have had an unusual amount of repetition to an extent that is entirely unjustifiable where public time is concerned.</P>
      <P>My position has been misrepresented, because in a period of strife I try to preach the policy of peaceful approach. I did not condemn any action with other nations, but I suggested that we should in addition to all these things try to make a peaceful and friendly approach to the majority in Northern Ireland who object to the removal of the Border.  Is that a crime in these days, or does the Senator want war? I pointed out at the close of my speech that the present position had been brought about by force and that any attempt to solve it by force was equally doomed to failure.  I pointed out that we had an unanswerable case and that, therefore, there was no reason why we should become impatient or lose our tempers because the other side were not prepared to admit the soundness of the case.  Probably they believed in their case as we believed in ours; and men fight not necessarily for good causes but because they think they are good.  That surely is a statesmanlike approach to the question.</P>
      <P>I pointed out that exchanging representatives with Northern Ireland might be regarded as a recognition of the separate existence of that State, but I said that that was childish and was in line with the arguments that seemed to suggest that we were going to solve the problem by using the term &ldquo;Six Counties&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Northern Ireland.&rdquo; I said that the Border unfortunately was there.</P>

      <P>These are the general trend of my remarks and anyone who reads the Official Report, if he can take exception I am prepared to meet it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Séamus O'Farrell a few moments ago referred to increases in production as the policy of the Minister.  This is extremely important and there are some ways in which we can increase production which have not been referred to here recently.  In addition to matters of efficiency and the use of proper machinery and so on, I would like to mention what might be described as the psychological aspect of it.  By that I mean that there would be a much greater increase in production if every worker in the country could feel that by working harder he would really be doing good to the majority of the people.  There are some workers who are not actually doing what is usually called productive work, but who could feel that, by doing their work as efficiently as possible, they are benefiting the majority of the nation.  We must however face the fact that there are many workers who say&mdash;I have heard them: &ldquo;What is the use of work ing harder?  It merely means that some owner or capitalist will make a bigger profit and have more money to spend on luxuries and amusements.&rdquo;  Some of them say: &ldquo;If we work harder, we will not get an increase in wages or remuneration; it will simply mean that certain people will make a bigger profit.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="561" /> One remedy for that is for the workers to have a share in the control and a share in the profits of industry and agriculture.  Then they can feel that the harder and more efficiently they work the greater will be their income and the better it will be for themselves as well as for everybody else.  Some people may say that is a selfish outlook, but do not many owners of businesses work harder in order to increase their earnings?  I am not suggesting for a moment that that should be the only motive.  I would like to see a much higher motive than that in addition, that is to say, that every worker could feel that by working harder and more efficiently he was helping to bring about the improvements in social services to which the Minister referred.  I do not think anyone would disagree that that would be a motive based entirely on Christian principles.  If every worker could feel that by doing his work efficiently and thoroughly, old age pensioners would benefit as also would widows and orphans and the blind, then he could feel it was worth his while working harder.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that there are many low-paid workers who do not work hard.  I think there are many who probably do a very fair share of the work of the country at the present time.  Some of them in fact do more than their fair share.  I think it is very often the people in the higher income groups who take it easy, work shorter hours and do not do their fair share.  I would like to see everyone do their fair share and so raise the standard of living in the country, and especially the standard of living for the poorer sections of the community.  When I speak on this matter I am not just speaking from a theoretical point of view because for the past 15 years I have been a member of a farm in which the profits are shared and in which the management is shared.  I have worked and I still work on a co-operative farm on which every worker has a share in the management and in which he gets a share of the profits.  Therefore, it is our desire to do everything in our power to increase <Col N="562" /> production because it will benefit all concerned.  I believe there are many other firms that work on these principles, although I do not know of any other farm that works on that principle, but there are other business firms that do that.  They feel that it is in their own interest to do everything possible to increase production.  It is in their own interest to have more efficient machinery and more efficient methods because it will be better for all concerned. But if they felt that by working harder it would merely mean that some already rich man would become richer: that he could have more luxuries and more amusements, that would not be any great incentive to them.</P>
    <P>This country, as the Minister has pointed out, is spending more than its income at the present time.  I believe that situation should be remedied as far as possible.  I believe the best way it could be done would be by cutting down the import of expensive luxury goods.  That would not create hardship for any of the poorer sections of the community.  It is most exasperating for people with small incomes to be told that they cannot get any increase in their remuneration, while at the same time they can see other sections of the community with every luxury and amusement that money can buy, and with practically no limit to them.  Moreover, it is not those who work the hardest who have the most wealth in this country. Some of the wealthiest people are those, I believe, who do little or no work at all.  They have simply inherited large sums of capital from those who went before them.  Sometimes you will see young men at the age of 21 inheriting £50,000 or £100,000, and who can live on that without working at all.  People like them can have every luxury and amusement out of the unearned income which they derive from their investments.</P>

      <P>This question of production seems to be occupying the minds of everybody in the country. There is one aspect of it which, possibly, might not occur to Senators who are not farmers.  If I were to attempt to increase production, the first thing I would do would be to drain the waste land of Ireland and release for food production&mdash;this is the estimate of a layman&mdash;1½ million acres of land that at the moment are lying practically derelict.  The Minister's Department is primarily responsible in that connection. Only last week it was asked to make certain alterations in rural improvement and minor employment schemes.  The answer was far from satisfactory.  There may be good reasons why the answer should be so. The Minister may not be aware that, since the passing of the Arterial Drainage Act, local authorities have been prohibited from embarking on minor drainage schemes.  Under present legislation they cannot levy rates for the purpose of carrying out a minor drainage scheme.  As Senator Burke has said, we are told on every occasion at our Council meetings that such considerations must await the completion of the Arterial Drainage Scheme. I suggest to the Minister that he should put it up to the Government that they should amend local government legislation so as to empower local authorities where they deem it advisable, to levy rates for the carrying out of minor drainage schemes in their counties. If that were done I have no hesitation in saying that it would result in increased production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Co. Roscommon, it is practically true to say that the land belonging to 50 per cent. of the land holders is rendered useless by seasonal flooding.  That flooding continues up to the month of May and June in certain areas.  If the local authorities had the power they would carry out minor drainage schemes in those areas, and so that land would be made <Col N="564" /> available for the feeding of cattle&mdash; and good feeding it would be&mdash;for the raising of sheep and the production of crops.  That would help a long way. I agree with what Senator Burke said about profit sharing.  I am afraid that profit sharing, as far as the agricultural worker is concerned, would be very slight because profits in agriculture at the present time practically do not exist.  I think Senator Burke will agree that it has been the custom with farmers to more or less indirectly do a little profit sharing with their workers. When they have a successful harvest or have been successful in the sales of their cattle they allow their workers to benefit to some extent.  I think that the harmony that exists between the farmers and farm labourers might well be emulated by industrialists and their workers.</P>
    <P>What I am about to say may appear to be at variance with something which I said here before.  I do not think it wise and neither do I think it good citizenship, to try to centre the attention of certain people on the fact that certain other people have too much money.  If that idea were allowed to grow it could lead to a very serious situation in the country.  Every man has a legitimate right to what he earns and to what he owns, and any attempt to cast jealous eyes on it would not be good for the national interest.  I know that Senator Burke had no such intention, but I do say that it is a theory that is being discussed.  If there is so much spending of money by people who never earned it while others have not enough, we should not at the same time hold the mirror up too close. It would not be a good thing to do.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh do bheagán pointí a bhfuil dlúth-bhaint acu leis na Votaí a luaitear i Sceideal B agus do chuid de na pointí a luaigh an tAire le linn na hóráide a rinne sé ar an Dara Léamh.  Sa chéad dul síos caithfidh mé admháil go bhfuil roint sásaimh orm de bharr na dtuairimí a nochtaigh an tAire.  Ag an am gcéanna tá díomá orm mar gheall ar gur theip air aon léargas a thabhairt dúinn faoi cén chaoi a dtabharfadh <Col N="565" /> sé faoi na deacrachtaí atá ag cur as dúinn a leigheas.  Thaispeáin an tAire sa deireadh go dtuigeann sé go bhfuil mórán deacrachtaí le réiteach agus go bhfuil sé an-deacair teacht ar phlean sásúil i gcóir a réitithe.  Do bhéinn féin agus an tAire agus an Seanadóir Ó Briain ar aon intinn, cuid mhaith, i dtaoibh a lán pointí a bhaineann le géilleagair.  Dá mbeimís ag plé na gceisteanna ó thaoibh na teoirice amháin, ó thaoibh &ldquo;pure economics,&rdquo; bheimís cuid mhaith ar aon intinn. Ní bheadh aon torian ná ceangal orainn.  D'fhéadfaimís scód a scaoileadh lenár gcuid smaointí agus &ldquo;speculation.&rdquo; Ach is rud eile é, nuair a thagaimíd isteach anseo sa tSeanad, nó sa Dáil, agus féachaint le réiteach d'fháil ar cheisteanna géilleagar a bhéas ag cur as dúinn.  Obair an &ldquo;applied economist,&rdquo; agus obair an fhir pholaitíochta, ní h-ionann iad agus cúram an &ldquo;pure economist.&rdquo;  D'fhéadfaimís, i gcás &ldquo;pure economics,&rdquo; a rá ina leithéidí seo de chás, nó a leithéidí siúd de chás, go réiteódh fórsaí nádúrtha ceist áirithe le h-imeacht na h-aimsire, ach é d'fhágáil ag na fórsaí nádúrtha gan cur isteach orthu.  Tá sin ceart go leor, ach anseo sa tSeanad, nó sa Dáil, caithfimíd cuimhniú ar céard a tharlós idir an dá linn.  Má bristear daoine as obair, de bharr ceisteanna d'fhágáil ag fórsaí an nádúir, céard tá siad sin chun a dhéanamh idir an dá linn?</P>
      <P>Rinne mé tagairt do scéal an díomhaointis, agus d'fhiafruigh mé den Aire céard é an beartas a bhí aige lena réiteach.  Luaigh mé cás na tíre dó. Tá a lán daoine díomhaoin faoi láthair agus tá an uimhir sin ag dul i méid ó sheachtain go seachtain.

Céard tá na daoine seo a dul a dhéanamh, na daoine, an bárr binne, na daoine a briseadh as obair, na daoine gur mhaith linn iad a thabhairt thar n-ais abhaile?  Céard <Col N="566" /> tá siad a dul a dhéanamh?  Is é an rud atá ar intinn agam nuair chuirim an cheist ar an Aire, céard é an polasaí atá aige?  Déarfaidh sé liom go bhfuilimíd ag súil le breis táirgeadh ó thalmhaíocht. Tá a fhios agam an scéim a ceapadh ag an Rialtas a bhí ann le feabhas a chur ar thionscail na n-éanlaithe clóis.  Tá a fhios agam an polasaí a leagadh amach sa Pháipéar Bán i dtaobh talmhaíochta i gcoitinne, ach an gcreideann an tAire gur féidir linn uimhir daoine gan teora a chur thar n-ais arís i dtionscal na talmhíochta? Sin í an áit ina bhfuil an trioblóid.  Ní dóigh liom go gcreideann sé é sin.  Táimíd ábalta roinnt a chur thar n-ais arís ar an dtalamh agus an méid daoine atá ag plé leis an dtionscal sin a mhéadú, ach ní tada an uimhir daoine a bheimíd i ndan a chur thar n-ais sa tionscal sin, i gcomparáid leis an uimhir a mbeadh orthu fanacht taobh amuig den talmhaíocht.</P>
    <P>Cinnte, scéim na dréineála, d'fheabhsódh sé tionscal na talmhaíochta, ach ceann de na fáthanna bunaidh is mó a bhíonn leis na scéimeanna seo go léir, ní hé go gcuirfidh sé ar ár gcumas cúrsaí díomhaointais a réiteach, ach go gcuirfeadh sé ar ár gcumas caighdeán maireachtála na ndaoine faoin dtuaith a mhéadú.  Is ag an dtuaith is mó a bheas baint leis.  Níl mé sásta go bhfuil an caighdeán maireachtála faoin dtuaith ag an bhfeirmeoir nó ag an oibrí féin, chomh hard agus ba mhaith linn é bheith agus d'fhéadfadh sé bheith. Réitigh an scéal do na daoine atá faoin dtuaith agus réitíonn tú an scéal do na dreamanna eile.  Sin é an rud a bhí ar intinn agam nuair bhí mé ag iarraidh air go dtabharfadh sé léargas dúinn ar an polasaí géilleagair a bhí ar intinn aige do na blianta atá le teacht. Ó thaobh eile den scéal, b'fhéidir go mba cheart dom bheith sásta nár thug an tAire freagra ar na ceisteanna a chuir mé air maidir leis na rudaí seo. Do mheabhraigh mé an dainséar atá ann de bharr na deacrachta atá ann faoi láthair; rinne mé tagairt do chúrsaí cosanta; rinne mé tagairt do chúrsaí arbhair; do rinne mé tagairt do chúrsaí connaidh; agus do rinne mé tagairt do loingseoireacht agus uile.  Ní bhfuaireamar aon léargas ar na ceisteanna sin a thabharfadh <Col N="567" /> sásamh nó muinín dúinn gur thuig an Rialtas an chontúirt atá ann, agus go ndéanfaidís iarracht ar iad a réiteach.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir gur cúis sástachta dhom é nár thug an tAire freagra ar na ceisteanna sin.  Más amhlaidh a fágfar iad gan freagairt, tuigeann an tAire chomh deacair agus atá sé iad a fhreagairt, agus go bhfuil beagán níos mó ama ag teastáil uaidh chun machnamh ar na ceisteanna sin, agus polasaí éigin a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart dom bheith sásta&mdash;agus bheinn sásta&mdash;más é sin an míniú atá air.</P>
    <P>Thagair an tAire don dainséar atá ann mar gheall ar fhuíollach na n-íocaíccht nó &ldquo;balance of payments.&rdquo; Tá mé ar aon intinn leis an Aire agus ní fhéadfaimis bheith ró-dhian ag cur in iúl do mhuintir na hÉireann an dainséar atá ann.  Má leanaimid den cheannach isteach chomh tréan agus atáimid ag déanamh, ní féidir linn a chur in iúl do mhuintir na hÉireann an dainséar atá ann má tharlaíonn aon rud don maoin atá súncálta againn thar sáile.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom eolas d'fháil ar céard iad na rudaí atáimid ag tabhairt isteach nach ceart dúinn a thabhairt isteach.  Níl mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire freagra a thabhairt dom anois, mar ní dóig liom go mbeadh sé réasúnta.

Chuir sé sin in iúl dom go bhfuil sé ag machnamh ar an slí chéanna agus atá mé féin, le tamall anuas.  Na daoine seo a fuair ardú páighe le tamall, an amhlaidh gur iarratas mí-réasúnta a chuireadar isteach? Na daoine a fuair ardú páighe le tamall, dúirt an tAire nach ceart dóibh é a chaitheamh&mdash;go mba cheart dóibh é a shábháil.

Tá údarás ag an gCúirt gach gné den scéal a scrúdú agus daoine a chur faoi bhrí na mionn agus iad ag tabhairt fianaise.  Níl a fhios agam a ndearna an Chúirt Oibreachais a cuid oibre go mí-chúramach nuair shocraíodar go bhfaigheadh na hoibrithe an t-ardú páighe a fuaireadar ó am go ham.  Tá rud amháin cinnte i dtaobh lucht oibre&mdash;ní dheachaigh siad ar staile gan fáth.  Níl siad ag iarraidh ardú páighe mar gheall ar go bhfuil an costas maireachtála ag titim.  Bheadh a fhios ag an Aire an bhfuil an ceart acu nó nach bhfuil.  Chomh luath agus atá a aigne déanta suas aige ba cheart dó &ldquo;láí do thabhairt ar láí&rdquo; agus <Col N="569" /> nseacht dúinn cén chaoi díreach a bhfuil an scéal.</P>
    <P>Níl mé ach leath-shásta lena thagairt ghinearálta do na deacrachtaí.  Gheall an tAire go ndéanfadh sé féin agus an Rialtas gach gníomh i dtaobh na nithe seo.  Tá mise ag fanacht leis an ngníomh, pér bith gníomh é.  Cinnte, sin é an leigheas atá ar an scéal&mdash; feabhsú nó ardú nó méadú ar an dtáirgeadh. Níor innis an tAire dúinn cén chaoi a bhfaigheadh sé é sin amach. Dúirt sé gur ísligh sé luach na beorach, mar mhealladh do na hoibrithe chun breis oibre a dhéanamh.  Chomh fada agus a théann sé, is polasaí ionmholta é sin.  Dá mealladh ísliú ar an mbeoir, digh agus tobac daoine le níos mó oibre a dhéanamh, bhéimís lán-tsásta. Bhfuil an tAire sásta gur tharla sé sin? Má tá, ní dóigh liom go labhródh sé chomh díomách agus a labhair sé inniu, i dtaobh an titim atá le tabhairt faoi ndeara i gcúrsaí táirgthe.</P>
    <P>Nuair tá an tAire ag smaoineadh ar lucht bainte na móna, sílim go bhfuil dearmad beag á dhéanamh aige.  Má abrann an tAire nach bhfuil sé freagarthach ach ins na daoine a bhí ag obair faoi na comhairlí contae, tá cuid mhaith den cheart aige, b'fhéidir.  Má tá sé ag smaoineadh ar na figiúirí, d'fhéadfadh sé a rá: &ldquo;Tá rud éigin déanta agam, le foirithint a thabhairt dóibh.&rdquo;  Tá £1,900,000 a bhí geallta le caitheamh ar an dtionscal sin. Caitheadh an chúid is mó den airgead sna ceantracha chúnga.  Ní fhéadfadh tarraingt siar an airgid sin gan buille uafásach d'imirt ar na mílte daoine. Cuimhníodh an tAire, freisin ar an méid fear a bhí cláraithe mar oibrithe móna.  Ní shin í an cheist.  Bíonn na mílte eile fear agus bean agus buachaill agus cailín ag obair ar scéim na móna chomh maith.  Ní bhfaighidh na buachaillí agus na cailíní sin saothrú as obair na móna nó as dréináil páirceanna mar atá ar bun.</P>
    <P>Má tá £2 ag dul isteach i dteach sa Ghaeltacht, i gceantar cúng, cuir 5/-sa tseachtain leis sin agus deineann tú gar an-mhór don mháthair atá dá fháil.  Ardaigh é 10/-, nó 15/- go dtí £3, agus tá tú ag teacht go dtí rud éigin cosúil leis an réasúntacht.</P>
    <P>Ná ceapadh an tAire go bhfuilim <Col N="570" /> ag caint ar na rudaí seo, chun bheith ag lochtú, nó d'fhonn buntáiste phoiliticiúil a bhaint astu.  Nár lige Dia go ndéanfainn é sin.  Tá mé ag iarraidh a chur ina luí ar aigne an Aire chomh deacair agus tá na ceisteanna seo agus chomh mór agus a chaithfidh sé a aigne d'oscailt má tá sé chun réiteach a dhéanamh orthu.</P>
    <P>Is cuma liom pé acu labharfaidh an tAire anois nó nach labharfaidh.  Tá mé sásta leis an óráid a thug sé tráthnóna, go bhfuil a fhios aige go bhfuil na deacrachtaí ann agus go gcaithfear iad d'ionsaí.  Cén uair a gheobhfas sé an bealach ceart le hiad d'ionsaí, agus an mbeidh an misneach aige iad d'ionsaí?  Molaim an tAire ar chomh foighdeach agus a bhí sé.  Bhí an díospóireacht seo i bhfad níos faide i mbliana ná aon bhliain eile.  Tá súil agam nach mbeidh mórán de na ceisteanna seo a bhí ag déanamh buartha dhúinn le dhá lá ag déanamh buartha dhúinn an bhliain seo chugainn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdmundSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to draw attention or stress a little further a very interesting point made in passing by the Minister in which he says the dairy industry is the pivot of agricultural life.  He suggests that until he gets a detailed plan showing the necessity for capital for agriculture he is not prepared to entertain the idea, as the present facilities are probably adequate.</P>
      <P>I know the dairying industry fairly well.  I know that the average dairy farm which is generally a small farm, is quite incapable of borrowing either from banks or from the Agricultural Credit Corporation at the rates that are now in existence.  Professor Murphy, who carried out a most interesting experiment in West Cork many years ago, found that on farms between 170 and 200 acres, on the capital which such farms represented the highest rate of interest earned was something over 2¼ per cent.&mdash;not 2½ per cent.&mdash;and on the 50 to 60 acre farm, frequently no interest would be earned on the capital, or interest that was a fraction of 1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope at a more appropriate time to <Col N="571" /> put a detailed plan before the Minister seeing that he is holder of the purse strings, and to show that the whole basis of our agricultural industry was dependent on dairying.  I feel that if we can show the Minister that the dairying industry needs capital or capital goods&mdash;whichever the Minister is prepared to give either by providing milking machines, housing, artificials, or a system by means of grants for the better breeding of stock, I am satisfied that I could prove that there is great necessity for increasing the capital on every small dairy farm in the shape of capital goods.</P>
    <P>That being so, if the Minister accepts that view, the only difficulty arising is whether it would be a good investment. Naturally if he puts money into dairying the industry has to repay the money, or otherwise it would only be throwing it down a sink.  I am satisfied that given time and the inclination being there, I can show that it is only in the dairying industry the Minister is absolutely certain of getting back what he puts into it.  To put it very shortly, I might mention my reason for saying that.  The dairying industry is under-producing to a ludicrous extent.  The average milk yield in this country is something under 400 gallons per cow.  If the Minister, by a proposal that I shall put to him, raised that output of milk alone without raising any other output on the farm, he could be paid back any amount he loaned either in the shape of money or capital goods, within a short period, and do an enormous service, not only to the agricultural community but to the community in general.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister a question arising out of the provision in Section 2 of the Bill for opening a special account in the Central Bank in connection with Marshall Aid.  Could the Minister inform the House to what use he can put the accumulated funds in this account?  I have seen it stated in a newspaper that they can be used for the repayment of debt.  If that is so has the Minister considered the possibility of repaying part of the existing <Col N="572" /> debt out of this account, and borrowing new debt in order to finance capital projects?  This would make a programme of capital development possible without any increase in the gross debt. Finally, would the Minister inform the House what degree of freedom he will possess in relation to the operation of this account, and to what extent he will have to obtain the consent of the American Government to operate it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to Seantor O'Brien's query the amount raised has to be fixed.  We have not inquired from any number of countries as to the terms in which the money will be granted.  We have discussed the matter temporarily.  I promised Dáil Éireann that the terms of any loan will be brought before it as soon as possible when Senators will also get the information.  I am not in a position to answer any question now because an answer is not available. With regard to Senator Sweetman's remarks, I merely wish to say that there is no evidence that agriculture suffers from a deficiency of credit. There is evidence of Irish banks advancing money to farmers.  That must mean that some farmers are in a position to borrow from the banks and to get accommodation, and there is also the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
      <P>On the other side, Senator Sweetman might like enlightenment about moneys farmers have in the banks, which have increased very heavily, so that farming is not just the most derelict section of the community.  I do not want to emphasise that too much, lest the tax-gatherers might be attracted to take some of the proceeds from them. Senator O Buachalla has wandered&mdash; I am sorry&mdash;went over much ground. It seems to me to be nonsensical that the difficulties which Senator O Buachalla recognised as facing the country, should be made so much pother of. If all the workers on the list that Senator Hawkins referred to were turf workers&mdash;6,000 people&mdash;on a thing that had to be brought to an end, and that was going to be brought to an end no matter what Government was in power&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am told that I need not regard people with valuations between £2 and £4 as excluding turf workers.  Senator Hawkins puts that this way.  He says that these are people who used to cut turf for their own needs or for sale in the neighbourhood. Why can they not continue to do that?  I cannot understand that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Lack of policy? In the old days, before the increased supplies of turf were required, three and a half million tons of turf were cut and used by people in areas where it was never likely they were going to use anything else and where it is unlikely at the moment that they would use anything else.  I would have thought that the area the Senator comes from would be one of these areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>May I give the Minister an indication of the difficulty in assessing the extent of this problem? When the Order came out stopping the hand-won turf scheme, people asked me what were they to do.  I told them that they would be well advised to go on cutting turf and these people said: &ldquo;But what if the country, particularly Galway, that they supplied, <Col N="574" /> is to be inundated with coal?  What is going to happen then?&rdquo;  I had no answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>To that the Senator's answer should have been that, as well as having 3½ million tons of turf cut and consumed in this country, we used to use 2½ million tons of coal.  The best we have been able to get is 1½ million tons of coal and, when we got 2½ million tons of coal, there was no such inundation of coal as prevented the 3½ million tons of turf being cut and used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know who informed them otherwise because the first opportunity I got I gave these figures.  The 3½ million tons of turf that used to be cut, can still be cut and used.  There is a demand for it and certainly that demand has not been satisfied by the 1½ million tons of coal which is coming in.  I do not think that will percolate down very far, to the Midlands, let alone across to the West.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because they cannot sell the coal.  That is one of the things I was going to say.  Even the 1½ million tons of coal that has come in cannot be sold.  There is no great rush for coal.  I am personally fairly satisfied over that position, because, do not forget the enormous dumps between the Park and the 17 other places through the country, where there is a vast amount of fuel stored up.  In any event, 6,000 is the biggest tot of extra unemployed.  I can account for a considerable amount of that even if I have to think of the people between £2 and £4 valuation as displaced turf workers&mdash;say, between 3,000 and 3,500.  That is the <Col N="575" /> problem that has been magnified all over the country.</P>

I am asked about younger people and women, who may not be entitled to unemployment assistance. Will the Senator consider this?  Let me compare the situation disclosed in connection with boots and shoes.  The factories here produced in one year 2½ times what was required.  The importations brought that up to three times.  Would anybody ask me, because they were occupied in the boot factories, to continue production at three times what was the national demand?  What am I going to do with the boots.  Collect them and put them in the Park with the turf? What is the answer to that?</P>

      <P>The answer I gave is that this increased turf cutting was obviously only for an emergency period.  It was going to come to an end.  The end was clearly foreseen. In 1946 Deputy Lemass announced that the end was in sight.  I do not think I should be asked to keep young people in employment or to be supplying these big wages that they earned, to get something that Dublin does not want and that I cannot use otherwise.</P>

      <P>All that has happened is that the people who were cutting turf under the auspices of county councils for what was called the national pool of turf were told off and, mind you, a warning had been given about that very definitely.  I do not think it is reasonable to ask that they should be kept on and should be allowed to earn the moneys they were earning when there is no use for what they produce.  If any answer is made to me in connection with coal, there has not been any increase in the coal brought in.  We have made an arrangement with England recently in which we asked them to make supplies available for us.  We thought it a good thing to have the supplies available. We have not tied ourselves to take them and the situation will have to be further investigated.  I am thinking more of the vast amount of stuff that is stored in the Park and the other 17 places which we must try to get off-loaded at some reasonable rate.  I do ask those who are making so much&mdash;and I think they are making far too much&mdash; of this matter of the people who are displaced through the non-production of turf in the national pool, to face up to the problem of what is to be done with these people.  Surely it is not reasonable to say, go on cutting and cutting irrespective of what is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O Buachalla, while agreeing with me in certain matters, on a much wider range of matters than I thought possible, has criticised me, however, on the ground, to put it generally, that there is not a practical approach&mdash;<Col N="577" /> my economics may be good but my practical and applied economics are not so good.  I thought the present Government was marked by that, that it was being very practical.  We have entered into a number of trade agreements. We have sought others.  We are looking for every possible source of supply for what we think agriculture needs, fertiliser, in the main&mdash;and certain equipment otherwise.  We are getting E.R.P. moneys.  We will use these mainly for the benefit of agriculture. In so far as we can divert it to agriculture that will be done.  That will occupy a primary place.  Whether they are successful or not, the efforts that have been made to try to bring down the cost of living, to try to stop infilation going any further, to reduce inflationary pressures&mdash;surely these are all applications of economic theory? The Senator agrees apparently with the theory and thinks the danger I have pointed to does exist.  He should go further and assist us in these endeavours we are making to do whatever the Government can do, to get rid of the inflationary pressure, for instance, by reducing Government expenditure on unnecessary extravagant sort of things, and to try to reduce Government taxation, which undoubtedly has a bearing on the whole matter.  I suggest that these are things that the Senator might take into his consideration and see could he not further agree with me along the line of effort that has been made, apart from the theories in the background.</P>
    <P>Before I forget the matter&mdash;I did forget it already&mdash;I want to apologise to Senator J.T. O'Farrell for not having referred to his remarks about Partition.  I want to refer to that very very slightly because Senator Douglas said that he thought on the whole that any remark about Partition, either for or against, was likely to have a bad effect and I was going to take that as a counsel of wisdom.  Now that the matter has been raised, I want to say that I regard Senator J.T. O'Farrell's speech as as good a contribution in regard to Partition as I have listened to and I heard it and I am not going on any perversion of it.  I think <Col N="578" /> he is right in saying that you do not get any forrader with regard to Partition, at home or abroad, and I do not see why he should be criticised for pointing out that after 15 years not doing much about it, after all the tremendous efforts that were then made in a hurry to get American influence that, in the end, when one Party of three Parties looking for Presidential office in America tried to introduce as a platform, a very small phrase in regard to Partition, it was greeted with laughter, according to the correspondents. That is the best we have been able to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that it may be an unfortunate coincidence or sequence but, after this campaign from coast to coast, the only thing we got was a certain amount of laughter.  I do not think it was worth the effort and I do not think that sort of campaign is ever going to be worth that effort.  I also count it as a lamentable thing that when we might have looked for assistance from some of our own people in America interested on the political side, in relation, say, to the question of the aid we were getting through the European Recovery Plan, I do not think we got one person to present himself before either House of Congress in America to make a single sentence in our aid.  That is apparently what our influence has come to in the United States and what has brought about the change, we might sit down and consider and may get a better and more realistic approach to this whole matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Farrell says that it may be a good thing to have a friendly approach to the North.  It may be that the other approaches have been tried and found wanting and we will be driven back on that.  I do not think there will be much hope from that.  I think the other line to which Senator J.T. O'Farrell referred might offer better results&mdash;that we should try to get the things upon which events drive towards an accommodation, like <Col N="579" /> transport and like the development of the Erne, and a few things like that. If you could bring people together on things such as these, it might have a better effect than attempting to break down antagonisms.  I do not think antagonisms will be broken down by using a short wave station to propagate our point of view to other countries as against the people in the North of Ireland.  A case can be made in a dignified way, but I do not think that the plan which is apparently aimed at of having a scheme of perpetual nagging will get us anywhere.  While I say that I ask people to believe that I am as sincerely anxious to get rid of the Border as anyone here.</P>
    <P>Senator Seamus O'Farrell made me realise that I should have spoken in more detail about the matter that he referred to.  It is a matter which I would like to discuss later.  It is too big to bring in at the tail end of a debate on such a vast accumulation as one finds in an Appropriation Bill. Since the matter has been raised I would like to say a word on it.  I have been asked in what way workers can aid in respect of (a) saving, and (b) in respect of production.  They can aid to a great extent in respect of saving if they refrain from spending. There are, of course, certain parts of the community that cannot refrain because they have been deprived of certain things.  That being so, it makes it all the more necessary for others who can afford to refrain from spending to do their part.  Senator O Buachalla used a phrase about wages&mdash;that if an appeal can be made that people should refrain from spending, the fact that they are able to do so is rather a criticism of the wages they were getting and that if they can save they do not need wages. If that means that wages are to cover necessities only I do not think that, in modern times, one could regard the matter from that angle.  The Senator also asked about imports.  It is possible to restrict imports and, therefore, to restrict and control the purchasing power of the community by simply stopping imports or by prohibiting <Col N="580" /> imports of a particular type.  That is one of the matters that could be approached, possibly there could be a selection of certain classes of goods that the community could do well without.  You could either have a complete prohibition, or very heavy restrictions on those allowed in.  I would rather have the restriction operated in a different way and that is through the consumer's choice&mdash; by getting people to hold over spending. I think that would be the better way.</P>
    <P>Senator S. O'Farrell also asked how can workers help to increase production. They can help in either of two ways, positively or negatively. That raises a more difficult point.  It may be said that because the bus driver and the corporation cleaner are not actively engaged in production that they cannot have a direct and immediate effect on it.  If they do not add to disturbances either by strikes or a go-slow process they can bring down the costs associated with their particular work to a point consistent with getting good wages themselves and giving good service to the community.  When I was talking earlier about production, I was thinking mainly of workers either in agriculture or in manufacturing industry and to some degree also of those engaged in the distributing and retail trades.  They can all help.  I am asked to deal with what the workers can do. The employers can do a great deal also, but I am dealing with workers. There is the avoidance of strikes and disputes, for one thing, and the avoidance of restrictive practices, if there are such, and it has been alleged that there are.  I do not know.  It is not a matter for my Department, but I know it has been said, with regard to apprenticeship conditions, that certain restrictions imposed by the trade unions might very well in these days open up a field for effort with a view to seeing whether these practices with regard to apprentices might not be eased so that more skilled and trained men might be brought in.</P>
    <P>I would say, now that the second round advance towards wages is over, that there should be no attempt to have a third round attack on wages <Col N="581" /> except for very special classes who have not got the advantages which other people have got or because of special conditions attaching to the industry in which they work.  Certainly, no such further advance should be requested unless it is accompanied by something that is almost certain to lead to greater productivity.  Finally, there is the matter of giving an honest day's work for an honest day's pay. I am not asserting that that is not being done.  I do not know whether it is being done over the whole field of industry.  The claim is made that it is not.</P>

      <P>That was completely bad management.  I do not know whether the workers gained overtime pay or not, but it was a case in which if any attention had been paid to demand the management should have called a halt.</P>
      <P>I did read in the newspapers recently that there was a dispute about builder's operatives and their pay.  The director of the Federation of Builders gave certain evidence&mdash;how far it was countered I do not know&mdash;but he did say that output in this country was at the best 15 per cent. lower than the 1939 output, and in some cases was 50 per cent. below the old 1939 output. That was the statement that was given from the employers' side.</P>

      <P>The explanation that was given to me for that was that the material which the men have now to handle is entirely different from the materials they handled in pre-war times.  They have to handle a different class of timber&mdash;material of a very inferior kind and, therefore, their output was necessarily restricted.</P>

      <P>In dealing with this matter I am leaving myself open to many objections, but I am merely answering the case put to me.  There are quite a number of ways in which I suggest workers could increase production <Col N="582" /> and bring it up to the old level. I do not know how it is going to be achieved.  There are many schemes all over the world.  There is an amount of literature already developed on what are called various plans for a sharing in production.  Any number of these are successfully working in America and England.  Anything that would let the worker see how much he depends on the industry and how much he will be better off by an improvement in that industry will be an enlightenment to him and anything that may lead to increased production is good. While there is no general plan, various industries are accepting the idea and I would welcome anything that would further those schemes.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested in an economic journal in England that what was made in an industry should be split up and shown in an account year after year.  The suggestion was that it should be statutorily obligatory on companies to publish sheets showing all the gross profit during the year, how much was due to raw materials and fixed overheads, how much to workers, how much to reserves and provision for new machinery and plant, how much goes in dividends, and how much to the State in taxes.  If that picture were exposed to workers in industry from time to time and if they were allowed to get an increased share in the product, there would be a material improvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We could get plans worked out on that basis.  There has been complaint that I have emphasised in speeches what the employer can do.  May I say, with regard to restrictive practices, it is fairly well known that workers in an industry will not make the pace too hot for certain employees working with them, because they are guided by the pace the younger men might set. It is not unknown amongst employers that some employers will not go in for unfriendly price cutting, because Michael &ldquo;X&rdquo; may go out of production if there were unfriendly competition. <Col N="583" /> There are restrictive practices on both sides and they must be got rid of for the benefit of the community.  It is too big a problem for me to deal with on the Appropriation Bill, but I hope I have given Senator Seamus O'Farrell some satisfaction.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That a Select Committee, to be nominated by the Committee of Selection, be appointed to consider every Statutory Rule, Order or Regulation laid, or laid in draft, before Seanad Éireann in pursuance of a statutory requirement with a view to determining whether the special attention of the Seanad should be drawn to it on any of the following grounds:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  that it imposes a charge on the public revenues or contains provisions requiring payments to be made to the Exchequer or any Government Department or to any local or public authority in consideration of any licence or consent, or of any services to be rendered, or prescribes the amount of any such charge or payments;</P>
      <P>(ii)  that it is made in pursuance of any enactment containing specific provisions excluding it from challenge in the Courts, either at all times or after the expiration of a specified period;</P>
      <P>(iii)  that it appears to make some unusual or unexpected use of the powers conferred by the Statute under which it is made;</P>
      <P>(iv)  that it purports to give retrospective effect to a Regulation, Rule or Order where the parent Statute confers no express authority so to provide;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> (v)  that there appears to have been unjustifiable delay in the publication or in the laying of it before the House;</P>
    <P>(vi)  that for any special reason, its form or purport calls for elucidation.</P>
    <P>(2)  That the Select Committee shall:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  consist of nine members of whom three shall form a quorum;</P>
    <P>(b)  have power to sit notwithstanding any adjournment of the Seanad and to report from time to time;</P>
    <P>(c)  have power to require any Government Department concerned to submit a memorandum explaining any Rule, Order, Regulation or Draft which may be under their consideration or to depute a representative to appear before them as a Witness for the purpose of explaining any such Rule, Order, Regulation or Draft.</P>
    <P>(3)  That it shall be the duty of the Committee before reporting that the special attention of the Seanad should be drawn to any Rule, Order, Regulation or Draft to afford to any Government Department concerned therewith an opportunity of furnishing orally or in writing such explanations as the Department may think fit and the Committee shall have power to report to the House, from time to time, any memoranda submitted or other evidence given to them by any Government Department in explanation of any Rule, Order, Regulation or Draft.</P>
    <P>(4)  And it shall be the duty of the Clerk of Seanad Éireann to provide for the Committee clerical or such other assistance and facilities as they may require.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Motion is to enable a committee to be set up for the object set out in the motion.  It is a matter entirely for the House, as to whether they desire this committee established and as to the manner in which it will be constituted.  If the House agrees to the motion the committee which will be set up under it will be required <Col N="586" /> to consider whether Orders which are laid on the Table are in conformity with the statutory instrument which authorised the making of such Orders. The committee will also have the function of preventing abuses creeping in, where statutory authority is used to make Orders which may emanate from a Government Department or from some subsidiary body.  There is a number of these statutory authorities with power to make by-laws, rules and regulations and, in the course of this Debate, we will, probably, have an opportunity of looking at some of them, and judging the manner in which the authority transmitted by the Oireachtas is interpreted by the rule-making body.</P>
    <P>There will be a further duty placed on the committee.  It will be expected to bring to the notice of the public obscure regulations which, otherwise, might never come to the knowledge of the public at all.  There have been instances in the past, in which regulations and orders made under statutory authority were not available to the public, even instances where considerable public interest and public welfare were concerned.</P>
    <P>I should say that, although I have been endeavouring to till this field for a long time, I am not by any means a pioneer in this field.  This House was asked on a number of occasions during the past 25 years to set up some machinery charged with the duty of following up the manner in which delegated legislation was operated in this State.  I think Senator Douglas was associated on one occasion with a proposal of the kind, and I know that the late Senator William Magennis expressed concern on this subject more than once in this House.</P>
    <P>The first instance I find, however, of a proposal to set up a committee or body charged with the duty of keeping tab on subsidiary legislation&mdash;that is rules, orders and regulations&mdash;was the late Senator Colonel Maurice Moore who at an early stage in the life of the Seanad, was desirous that a committee should be set up, perhaps not on the lines now proposed, but a committee which would keep the House informed <Col N="587" /> with regard to the manner in which subsidiary legislation was operating.</P>
    <P>When I raised this question a little over a year ago Senators, I think, were concerned about two or three points to which, perhaps, I might now be permitted to refer.  For instance, a question was raised by some Senator whether in fact this was not the kind of job which should be referred to a Joint Committee representing both Houses.  I took the line then, and I take the line now that the Seanad has a duty imposed on itself, irrespective of what Dáil Éireann may do in these matters.  Further than that, the Seanad in the nature of things has more time in which to perform the duties which would be imposed on this committee than members of Dáil Éireann have.</P>
    <P>We had an experience a couple of weeks ago where the Dáil found it necessary to extend the hours of sitting, very considerably in order to get through the consideration of the estimates before the end of July.  The Dáil also has functions in connection with finance which do not concern us at all.  Our responsibility in regard to finance is very limited and the number of hours that we are expected to give to the consideration of financial matters is very few indeed compared with the period devoted to their examination by the Dáil.  It seems to me, therefore, there is a good reason why the Seanad should accept this responsibility for itself without asking for the co-operation of the Dáil.  Furthermore, we have no guarantee that the Dáil if so invited would co-operate with us in setting up a joint committee.  They might consider it preferable to have a committee of Dáil Éireann.  As you know there are committees of Dáil Éireann for various purposes; there is, for example, a committee in connection with public accounts.  We are not asked to co-operate in these committees set up by the Dáil from time to time and I imagine that they might reasonably tell us that this is a matter for ourselves.</P>
    <P>The fact that there is no Minister in attendance here this evening and that there was no Minister here on the last occasion on which we discussed a <Col N="588" /> matter of this kind is an indication that the Government regard this matter as being the concern of the House itself.  Another point made when this subject was being discussed previously was that in the last analysis it is a duty that devolves on every individual in this House to examine these statutory instruments and to take whatever action they consider appropriate in connection with them.  I do not think it unreasonable to say that the great majority of the members of this House do not consider it their duty, evidently, to make themselves acquainted with the ramifications of the statutory regulations or orders laid on the Table. It is not an easy matter to do so. Regulations are often made by reference and their examination may involve considerable time and a considerable amount of research in order to get at the original of the regulation itself. In passing, perhaps it is not unreasonable to draw attention to the fact that the three motions which were moved this afternoon, by Senator M. Hayes originally came before this House on July 1st but we had to leave them go unexamined because, unfortunately, no member of the House could tell what the three motions referred to. They were proposed by Senator Hayes this afternoon and explained by him but on the 1st July no member of the House, including myself, was acquainted with what was involved.</P>

      <P>My point is that members of the House do not come into the Library, take down every Order and go back to the source from which each Order emanates.  I had occasion, recently, to look up an Order made some time last year.

      <P>If members of the Seanad did take down the regulations and made themselves familiar with their provisions there would, of course, be less need for this motion although there still would be some need for it because, having read the regulations and having made ourselves familiar with their purport, the individual member of the House is still up against the fact that if he moves on his own, so to speak, and puts down a motion to annul the regulation he has to contend with the doubts and misgivings of all his colleagues.  They may be unwilling to subscribe to the view of a particular Senator that the regulation is a bad one or is <i>ultra vires</i>, but as likely as not the House may prefer to leave the matter alone.  If on the other hand there is a report from a committee, a committee of members of the House, chosen by the House and representing different interests in the House, as to something in a regulation which in their view ought to be inquired into the House will be more easily persuaded to look into the subject with more confidence and to accept the view that the regulation demands attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should perhaps say that this <Col N="590" /> question of delegated legislation is causing anxiety in many democratic countries.  It has been the subject of a number of motions in the British Parliament.  It has prompted certain well-known writers to publish books in relation to it and induced the opinion that there is something which needs to be done to keep delegated legislation under review and induced the British Government to appoint a committee of inquiry, the Donoughmore Committee, to report on it.  Two things will be obvious from the report of the Donoughmore Committee.  One is the inevitability of delegated legislation and the other the need for some supervision over the authorities to whom Parliamentary authority is delegated. Perhaps I might be permitted to quote an extract from the report of the Donoughmore Committee as follows:</P>
    <P>If large and complex schemes of reform are to be given technical shape, it is difficult to work out the administrative machinery in time to insert in the Bill all the provisions required.  It is impossible to foresee all the contingencies and local conditions for which provision must eventually be made.  The national health insurance regulations and the orders setting up trade boards illustrate particularly well this aspect of the problem.  The practice further is valuable because it provides for a power of constant adaptation to unknown figure conditions without the necessity of amending legislation. Flexibility is essential.  The method of delegated legislation permits of the rapid utilisation of experience and enables the results of consultation with interests affected by the operation of new Acts to be translated into practice.  In matters, for example, like mechanical road transport, where technical development is rapid and often unforeseen, delegation is essential to meet the new position which arises.</P>
    <P>That, I think, states the case very fully for delegated legislation, and I must not be regarded as offering a criticism of the practice which has grown up, the practice of this Oireachtas like that of other Parliamentary institutions, delegating much of the <Col N="591" /> minor powers arising out of legislation to subordinate bodies, whether they be Ministers, civil servants or statutory bodies.  I think it is inevitable that that delegation should take place in modern conditions.  I am concerned, however, that, having delegated our authority to a subordinate body, we are not going to lose sight of what is being done by that subordinate body.  The House, I think, is familiar with the fact that the regulations or orders made under various statutes differ materially one from the other. You have, for instance, the practice of making a provisional order&mdash;that was very common in local government legislation over a period of years&mdash; I think, back to the days of Queen Victoria, as Senator Hearne will remember.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>Why Senator Hearne?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Senator would probably like to know that there were some relations between Victoria's regime and the very modern method of delegating legislation to which I refer&mdash;the practice of making a provisional order which did not have effect until ratified by Parliament. We had experience of that kind of order here in April last.  On 21st April, this House confirmed the Summertime Order, 1948.  That Order was made by the Minister for Justice under the Summertime Act, 1925, but it was inoperative, until ratified by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce in the last Government reverted to this practice in the Harbours Act.  Under that Act where a harbour authority proposes to acquire land for the purpose of its functions it does so by provisional order, which subsequently is ratified by Act of the Oireachtas.  The important thing to remember is that the provisional order does nothing, confers no authority on the harbour authority, until the confirming Act is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have other kinds of orders, too&mdash;invented by ourselves, not importations. So far as I know, the Control of Imports Act, for instance, is peculiar <Col N="592" /> to this country.  It authorises the Minister to make an order which has a limited life.  As an example I might mention the Imposition of Duties Orders made under the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act, 1932. These Orders are made by the Minister under statutory authority, but they have effect for a limited time only; if they are not ratified by the Oireachtas they cease to have effect eight months after being made.  In other words, if an Order imposing a tariff on some imported commodity were made under the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act it would have a life of some months, and, at the end of that period, unless confirmed by Parliament, would expire. The point I am trying to make in relation to these Orders is that the making of them or the authority to make them does not take away from the supreme authority of Parliament at all&mdash;the Legislature is still supreme. It does give a temporary use of power to a Government Department, but at some time or other that power lapses, unless the matter concerned is brought to the notice of the Oireachtas, and the necessary legislation enacted.</P>
    <P>I want to come now to the type of Order with which in this discussion we will be mainly concerned, that is, the orders or regulations made by a Minister which have the force of law immediately.  Their appropriate position in our legislative system is clearly defined in section 19 of the Local Government Act, 1941, which provides that: &ldquo;Every regulation made under this section shall have the force of law in accordance with its terms.&rdquo;  That is a common feature of many of our Acts as it was a common feature of many of the Acts which we took over from the British Administration.  The provisions in our statutes enabling a Minister to make regulations having the force of law without reference to anybody has been going on pretty generally over the last 50 years. There is a practice, which this House has insisted upon frequently, where power is given to a Minister to make regulations, that the Minister shall table the regulations in both Houses of the Oireachtas and usually, not always, there is a provision in the Act that <Col N="593" /> the regulations may be annulled by either of the Houses.  In other words, we have also the power of annulment, enjoyed by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>One of the objects of tabling regulations made by a Minister is to secure that there will be publicity for it, that the public will be made aware by newspaper reports or otherwise, that a particular regulation has been made, and that it will not be sprung on them.  Unfortunately, there were some departures from that practice over a period of years.  When we discussed this subject here last year, I quoted a number of instances where the Supreme Court and other authorities complained that regulations which affected the public intimately were not available and could not be procured even by the Court itself.  Following that debate, although the motion which I submitted was not adopted by the Seanad, we had a very valuable measure introduced by the Minister for Justice, the Statutory Instruments Act, which now changes the position to a considerable extent so far as publicity is concerned.  Under the Statutory Instruments Act, the Government are required to print all Orders to which the Act applies.  They are obliged to print and they are also obliged to make available copies of all statutory instruments to a number of public authorities, the only exception being the library of Leinster House. The Library of the Chamber of Commerce, in Galway, Waterford, Limerick. Cork and Dublin, and the Universities, can all get copies of the printed Orders but there is no obligation on the Minister to table any of these statutory instruments in the Library of this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to point out that the obligation to send the printed Orders within seven days to Leinster House Library is not observed. There is no bound volume of any of the Orders made subsequent to 1938.  If you want the Orders made in 1939, 1940 and later years, in which thousands of Orders were made, you will find you will have a laborious task searching for <Col N="594" /> them unless you secure the good offices of the Librarian in the Oireachtas and his staff, who will make matters easy for you.  The Librarian in Leinster House has in fact, on his own initiative collected a considerable number of volumes, I think all the volumes down to 1942 or 1943, and had them bound with a typewritten index.  That is a tremendous assistance to the members of the Oireachtas.  The outsider, however, the solicitor, counsel or public representative who wants to consult the Orders made in 1939-40 cannot get a bound volume anywhere.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should say that there was apparently, a good deal of confusion in the minds of Ministers and lawyers regarding the obligations imposed upon State Departments by the Rules Publications Act, 1893.  Section 1 of that Act requires that, 40 days before making statutory rules, notice of the proposal shall be published in the <i>Dublin Gazette.</i>  The Section also provides for the making of an objection to the proposals and for copies being made available to the public.  That section was never complied with by any Ministry in this State, so far as I can gather.  The Minister for Justice, who introduced the Statutory Instruments Bill here, made the point that the Act was believed not to apply to the State.  However, Chief Justice Kennedy held that the Act did so apply.  Chief Justice Sullivan on the other hand held that it did not apply. There is, however, some evidence that certain Departments of State believed it did apply.  In an Order made by the Land Commission on the 6th May, 1931, I find this reference:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In exercise of the powers in that behalf conferred by Section 2 of the Rules Publication Act, 1893, the Land Commission certify,&rdquo; etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This reference is to a Section which exempted certain authorities from the obligation to publish the proposed rules 40 days in advance of being made if for some good and sufficient reason they thought it was not desirable to do so or that it would be impossible to do so.  So that, at least there is this evidence that the Land Commission believed the Rules Publication Act <Col N="595" /> applied to this country and acted accordingly.</P>
    <P>That is, of course, no longer a matter of importance because the Rules Publication Act is repealed and its place is now taken by the Statutory Instruments Act, which became law on the 20th December, 1947.  In this connexion I should say that under the Statutory Instruments Act statutory instruments, that is, rules, regulations, statutes and so forth, made after 1st January 1948 which are made by the authority of the President, the Government or any member of the Government, Parliamentary Secretary or other bodies, must be published.  If I do not make a great mistake, I think these instruments must be published seven days after being made and within seven days of the making thereof, a copy thereof must be sent to each of the following, namely, the National Library of Ireland, the Law Library, Four Courts, Dublin, the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland, the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, the Cork Chamber of Commerce, the Limerick Chamber of Commerce, the Waterford Chamber of Commerce and the Galway Chamber of Commerce.  The one remarkable omission in this recital is the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>I propose now to refer to one type of section which appears so frequently in Bills emanating from the Department of Local Government especially, and in those which come from other departments as well, which has caused a good deal of uneasiness from time to time.  Quite recently, for instance, we had a Social Welfare (Reciprocal Arrangements) Bill before us which contains this clause:</P>
    <P>The Minister may make such Orders as may be necessary to carry out any arrangement made under Section 2 of this Act and may by any such Order make such adaptations and modifications in any enactment for the time being in force relating to the subject matter of the arrangement as he considers necessary.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Minister is taking <Col N="596" /> power in this instance to adapt and modify statutes and regulations in such a manner as he thinks fit.  This is followed by a sub-section which provides that every Order made under the Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas after it is made. The corresponding paragraph in the Local Elections Bill of 1948 says:</P>
    <P>If a resolution annulling the Order is passed by either House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the Order is laid before it, the Order shall be annulled accordingly without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done.</P>
    <P>Senators will observe that, in both cases, the Order modifying or adapting a statute must be laid on the Table. In one case nothing happens after the Tabling of the Order.  In the other case, either House is free, if it thinks fit, to annul the Order after it is Tabled.</P>
    <P>Senators who were members of the House when this matter was previously discussed will remember that there was reference then made to what is known as the Henry VIII Clause.  A case has been made for it in many publications.  I disliked it, and I have opposed it in this House.  I have endeavoured to ensure that, wherever possible, an Order made under that kind of clause would be laid on the Table and be capable of being annulled. I want now to make a case for the retention of the clause.  Recently, I endeavoured to find some evidence that the Henry VIII clause was abused. I could not find any evidence to that effect, but I did find something else. I found that it was used in the present year to overcome a grave national difficulty.  I refer the House to Section 62 of the Electoral Act of 1923 which provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that: if any difficulty shall arise in the holding of any election and the Minister for Local Government is of opinion that such difficulty is an emergency requiring to be removed immediately, the Minister may by Order do anything which appears to be necessary to enable the election to be held.</P>
    <P>During the course of the last general election a serious difficulty arose in the <Col N="597" /> constituency of West Donegal when it was found on Polling day, the 4th February that owing to the inclemency of the weather the poll could not proceed on Iowey Island.  Availing himself of the powers conferred 25 years earlier under Section 62 of the Act of 1923, the Minister made an Order directing that the poll on this island be taken not on the 4th February but on the first day thereafter on which it was found possible to cross to the island from the mainland.  When I am criticising these powers and drawing attention to the danger which underlies the extensive granting of them, I am not to be taken as alleging that there has been abuse in their usage.  On the contrary I am now drawing attention to the fact that this was a very valuable section to have in the 1923 Act.  I am not sure that it was ever used before.  But 25 years after the Act was made law there was an occasion to use it in circumstances to which I have alluded.</P>

      <P>Sometimes they do things in Galway for which there may be no statutory authority.  I am quite certain however that if Senator Hawkins was associated with the doing of anything under that Act in Galway, it was done properly.</P>
      <P>I have already said that, apart from Ministers and Government Departments, there are very many other bodies on whom the power to make by-laws and regulations is conferred. For instance, between 1923 and the outbreak of war in 1939 the Land Commission published 500 closely printed pages of regulations, most of which were marked &ldquo;provisional.&rdquo; The E.S.B., under a section of the Electricity Supply Act, has power by order to declare not to be so a public navigable river notwithstanding any provision in any Act to the contrary. The E.S.B. can make an order on its own and the penalty for an infringement of it is a fine of £50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 53 of the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945 confers on the Board of <Col N="598" /> Works extensive powers to make bye-laws and provides that a document purporting to be a bye-law shall be received in any court as conclusive evidence that it is a bye-law, and was duly made and approved of, and that it is in force.  The Revenue Commissioners, the Garda Síochána, the C.I.E.&mdash;all these bodies have power to make regulations which have the force of law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">

      <P>If the E.S.B. makes a regulation under the section I have mentioned the Court cannot inquire whether it was properly made or not. If there is a person before the Court charged with having violated the regulation the Court has the power to impose a fine of £50.  The case I have quoted about regulations made by the Board of Works rules out any inquiry by the Court as to whether the Order was properly made.  I have quoted the bye-law already, and Senators will see that there is nothing for the Court to inquire into except the fact of the contravention.</P>

      <P>If I were to go to a Court with a piece of paper in my hand and with something written on it, the Court would hardly accept that as a bye-law purporting to be made under an Act without further proof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>These bye-laws, I assume, are printed and published by the Stationery Office.  That is the evidence of their authenticity, but the Stationery Office is not authorised to inquire into the manner in which the Board of Works makes a bye-law, for instance.  I am suggesting that there is a duty on this House to see how these powers are being exercised, and that, where there is something objectionable, to have the matter brought to the attention of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am on that subject may I draw attention to something which came under my notice quite recently and which, I think, is rather disturbing. I have drawn attention to the <Col N="599" /> fact that the E.S.B. can make regulations setting aside rights conferred on the community at large by statute. I now draw attention to something which is more significant.  Paragraph 1 of the first Rule of the District Court Rules, 1948, which came into operation on the 31st March of this year, says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where these rules conflict with any statute in force at the date of the making of these rules, such statute shall be modified or adapted to the extent of such conflict...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister for Justice who made the Rule or the Rule Making authority, consisting of a number of solicitors, barristers and District Justices, would have any power at all to make Rules in such terms, bearing in mind, that there is nothing to indicate what statutes are modified, to what extent they are being modified and why they were so modified.  The District Justice is evidently authorised to modify or adapt any unnamed statute if he finds it conflicts with the District Court Rules.  I do not know whether there is any other meaning to be attached to this Rule.  Certainly I was astounded when I came across it.</P>
    <P>In relation to other rules and regulations made from time to time, I must draw attention to instances in which something was done which in my view was not authorised by statute.  The first example I give is that of a regulation relating to Dublin which was made by the Commissioner of the Garda under Section 118 of the Road Traffic Act, 1933.  This regulation, amongst other things, dealt with loitering. I could not find anything in the section authorising the Commissioner to prevent loitering.  I want to draw attention to this fact, that when making regulations applying to Limerick six months later he omitted all reference to loitering.  This is a matter which a committee, had it been established, might very well consider, and might ask the Commissioner to tell them what it was all about.  They might be satisfied that he was acting within his authority, or they might consider that he had done something which was <i>ultra vires</i> the statute, and should be amended.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="600" /> The second example I want to refer to is an incident in March, 1937, when the Minister for Local Government made certain regulations under the Labourers Act, 1936.  These regulations were revoked 17 months later because they were defective.  I took the trouble of reading the original set and later on of reading the amending regulations, and discovered that one sentence appearing in the amended regulations did not appear in the original regulations. Therefore, I was satisfied that revocation took place, when it was discovered, during a period of 17 months, that the original regulations were defective.</P>
    <P>I refer now to Regulation No. 48 of 1935 made under the Road Traffic Act, 1933.  Section 121 of that Act limits the number of persons who may lawfully be carried on a public service vehicle.  It confers upon the Minister for Local Government, however, power to authorise the carrying of a greater number of passengers, but only in specified special circumstances, or on specified special occasions or during specified hours.  Regulation No. 48 permits the carrying of a greater number of persons &ldquo;during the hours of peak traffic.&rdquo;  What are the hours of peak traffic in Ballybunion?  Take Dublin, what are the hours of peak traffic in Dublin?  Is not that a matter about which a Garda officer and the conductor of a bus are liable to quarrel? There is nothing in the regulation defining the hours of peak traffic, and, in any event, as a layman I consider that peak hours of traffic do not constitute special circumstances or a specific special occasion or specific hours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps.  Two questions occurred to my mind when I read the regulation.  The first was, whether, in fact, that regulation is enforcible, and whether the Minister had any power to make it; secondly, whether the Minister ignored the public interest he was obliged to defend when he made a regulation permitting Coras <Col N="601" /> Iompair Eireann to carry passengers in respect of which no duty was payable. If, for instance, C.I.E was permitted to operate a 40-seater bus, it was paying tax on 40 seats, but if it was allowed to carry five additional passengers from Dublin to Sligo, it was carrying people for whom no tax was payable.  That is a subject, however, that we need not discuss on this motion.</P>
      <P>Before I leave the question of delegated legislation, conferring authority on a non-Government Department to make rules, bye-laws and regulations, I want to refer to one incident which I mentioned here before.  It refers to bye-laws made by Córas Iompair Éireann on November 28th, 1946. A notice published in the morning newspapers on 21st November and 28th November, 1946, read:</P>
      <P>Notice is hereby given that Córas Iompair Éireann, having their principal office at Kingsbridge station, Dublin, pursuant to the Tramways Act, 1870, have made the following bye-laws and regulations...</P>
      <P>These are set out, their main purport being to confer on a conductor power to remove me from a tram if he wants to remove me, when a tram comes to a terminus.  The bye-laws provide that a fine of 40/- will be imposed on me if I refuse to leave the tram on request. When I looked up the authority under which that bye-law was made I turned to Section 2 of the Act.  It says:</P>
      <P>This Act shall not apply to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had also experiences of Government Departments forgetting all about regulations made by themselves. On a previous occasion I quoted an incident where the Department of Finance completely ignored regulations made by themselves over a period of 21 years.  It had reference to the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920. Section 12 of that Act provided that such sums as the Treasury shall direct, not exceeding one-tenth of the proceeds of the Unemployment Insurance Fund, shall be applied as Appropriations-in-Aid for the purpose of cost of administering the Act.  Then Treasury Regulation <Col N="602" /> No. 1854 provides that each year the Treasury shall ascertain whether the one-tenth exceeds the expenditure and, if so, shall so certify to the Minister in order to enable him to make a proper adjustment.  When that regulation was revoked in November, 1946, a question was asked in the Dáil to ascertain from the Minister what returns had been made under Regulation 1854 during the period it was in force.  The reply was interesting and can be found in the Dáil Reports for the 4th December, 1946.  It concludes thus:</P>
    <P>The calculations mentioned in paragraph 7 of the earlier regulations were never made and no certificate was given under paragraph 8.</P>
    <P>These were regulations imposing on the Department an obligation to certify to the Minister whether the sums collected by him were excessive, so that if they were he would be required to make adjustments, in other words, to restore to the fund some portion of the money hitherto extracted and thereby increase the sum available for payment of unemployment insurance benefit.  These regulations were entirely ignored for 21 years.</P>
    <P>Regarding the method by which we can, as a legislative chamber, safeguard ourselves against the danger of abuses which obviously exist, the Donaghmore Committee to which I referred previously says:</P>
    <P>We see in it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That is, in delegated legislation&mdash;</P>
    <P>a definite advantage provided that the statutory powers are exercised and the statutory functions performed in the right way, but risks of abuse are incidental to it and we believe that safeguards are required, if the country is to continue to enjoy the advantages without suffering from the inherent dangers.</P>
    <P>There are many authorities who will support the view that checks are inevitable and it has been generally agreed that a committee such as is proposed in this motion affords the necessary safeguards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="603" /> Speaking here on the 24th July, 1942, when objection was taken to the powers conferred on Government Departments under the Emergency Powers Act, Mr. de Valera, who was then Taoiseach, said:</P>
    <P>It is within the power of both Houses to set up committees if they wish and give them the duty of looking over Orders and of reporting to the House if they think it necessary to do so.</P>
    <P>At that time, one of the people who was very anxious about the appointment of a committee such as is now proposed was the late Professor Magennis, who was a member of this House at that date.</P>
    <P>Objection has been raised in certain quarters to the appointment of a committee of this kind because of the amount of work that would fall upon it and questions are asked as to whether that work can be performed.  I have been looking at what has been done elsewhere by an analogous body and find that the amount of work is not as great as one would imagine.  There is a committee in Britain charged with much the same duties as those outlined in this motion.  It has been operating since 1944 and in the Parliamentary Session, 1945-46, the total number of orders examined was only 947.</P>

      <P>The British committee sat in 1945-46 on 23 occasions and out of the 947 orders examined, they found it necessary to report only 33. They called for an explanatory memorandum on 19 occasions and examined witnesses on three occasions, including the Secretary to the Lord Chancellor of England.  The report of that committee gives an idea of the kind of report required.  It might help us to realise what is involved if I quote some extracts from it.  For the session 1945-46, in its Fifth Report, the committee said, reporting to the House of Commons:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Your committee have considered the Local Government Boundary Commission Regulations, 1945, a copy of which was presented on the 16th November, and are of opinion that there are no reasons for drawing the special attention of the House to them on any of the grounds set out in the order of reference to the committee.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In other words, there was some discussion, they examined the regulations and said there were no grounds to report them.</P>
      <P>In their Sixth Report, I find this paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They have also considered the Order in Council amending regulation 442 C.A. of the Defence General Regulations, 1939, a copy of which was presented on the 16th November and are of opinion that the special attention of the House should be drawn to it on the grounds that it appears to make some unusual or unexpected use of the powers in the Statute under which it was made.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The committee is not bound down to specify the detailed point of objection. They simply say that there is something unusual about an order and then it is a matter, as usual, for individual members of Parliament to take action.</P>
      <P>If this committee is set up and if we have the assistance of officers of the House in getting staff to do whatever duty would be allotted to them by the committee, it seems to me that the duties of the committee will not be onerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="605" /> The fact that there is a committee sitting and that there is a likelihood of their reporting on something that may have escaped the attention of the draftsman will make everyone in the Department, in the draftsman's office or wherever they may be, very careful in ensuring that the statute will be complied with.  I believe that this proposal is worthy of a trial.  It merely proposes that the Seanad will appoint a committee, a committee selected in the usual manner by the Committee of Selection.  If at the end of this Parliament it is thought that the Committee was of no particular assistance or that it was not the right type of machinery for dealing with this problem some other plan can be tried. I strongly urge the House to adopt this resolution and to give the plan which it contains, a trial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>If it requires a seconder, I am prepared to do so, gladly.  I think the questions involved in this are questions of constitutional importance and questions that are very properly raised in this House for reasons which I will come to in a few moments.  I think the motion raises questions of constitutional importance that affect the rights of the citizens of the country, which it is our proper function to safeguard.  We have to accept whether we like it or whether we dislike it, that we have arrived at an age of economic planning and, that being so, that you will have a large amount of economic administrative orders.  As an individualist regretting the necessity for administrative planning and advocating individual liberty and individualism, one might be accused of regretting the passage of an age which has gone and asking for the return of some Utopia that will never be realised again.  I think it is important to draw a distinction between what is an ideal and what one regards as practicable in any given <Col N="606" /> situation.  I am prepared to accept that we have arrived at a period in history when the State has to take a larger part in the regulation of the individual's conduct than it had 50 years ago.  I do not say that I do not regret it but I accept it.  It seems to me that the position of the individualist in the middle of the 20th century is somewhat analogous to a medical man who has a patient rather ill. The medical man admits that his patient requires a special diet, special treatment, crutches and maybe a bath chair.  He admits that he has got to have all these aids to keep him going; he regrets that they are necessary and he would prefer that the patient was healthy.  But admitting the weakness of the patient, he has to try to provide the best means he can of giving this person a reasonable degree of health in the circumstances.  The state of the world to-day is the result of two great wars as well as other causes.  It is unable to stand on its own feet and therefore it requires a great deal of assistance in the control and administration of affairs which could be dispensed with in a healthy society.  We have to accept the necessity for a considerable amount of regulation although some people consider this a rather deplorable condition.  It is necessary, at the same time, to keep this administrative interference down to the minimum.  It must not be allowed out of control like some sort of internal cancerous growth that is eating up the whole healthy tissues of the free individualist society.  I think it is the duty of people in a legislative assembly like this, in a country still priding itself on its free institutions, to preserve the greatest degree of individual liberty against the administrative interference that is necessary owing to the facts of the situation.  It seems to me that the most important principle of liberty in modern society is not what is called democracy and not necessarily, universal suffrage, but what is called by the constitutional lawyers, &ldquo;the rule of law.&rdquo;  I would refer the Seanad to a very remarkable book which I am sure the majority of them have read, and if they have not read it, I recommend that they should read it.  It is <Col N="607" />&ldquo;The Road to Serfdom,&rdquo; in which the author, Professor Hayek, draws attention to the fact that the true ground of liberty in a free society is what he calls &ldquo;the rule of law,&rdquo; that is, that every single person in the community should know his legal rights and obligations, should know precisely that those legal rights and obligations are not altered <i>ex post facto</i> by any body, legislative or otherwise.  The second essential of the rule of law is that everybody should have recourse to the ordinary courts of law at some stage, that is to say that everybody should have recourse to the courts of law under the Constitution, the courts administered by irremovable judges selected impartially for their legal attainments, and that there should not be a special code of law for any particular class of people.  I do not suggest for a moment that we have to accept in its purity the rule of law on which I was brought up 40 years ago under Dicey's great &ldquo;Law of the Constitution.&rdquo; My reading of the rule of law is that at some stage every citizen of the country should have the right to challenge and to bring the Government and the Government officials before the ordinary constitutional judicial tribunals of the country.  It seems to me that that is what I would call the rule of law and that rule of law is in danger of violation to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Duffy has given a number of examples of administrative orders which seem, on the face of them, at any rate, to be questionable from this point of view.  There is a mistaken notion at large that, because we live in a democratic country, tyranny can no longer exist.  The struggle for freedom in Europe was conducted for so many centuries against privileged minorities that people may not realise that we have now reached an epoch when the danger which the ordinary citizen has to encounter is the tyranny of the majority.  Recent European history has shown that some of the worst infringements of liberty, some of the worst totalitarian régimes have been quite constitutionally established, that the ordinary machinery of election <Col N="608" /> has been used in many countries in Europe in order to erect totalitarian régimes which, when they have been erected, have proceeded to destroy the ladder on which they climbed to power. I do not suggest for a moment, I am glad to say, that there is any danger, of anything of that kind happening in this country, but there is this danger, that, where you have the Executive of a country responsible to a Chamber which is elected by universal suffrage, where the Executive has very considerable powers under these various statutory rules and orders to interfere with the liberty of the ordinary citizen, the right of the individual citizen may sometimes be sacrificed to some passing whim of the majority.</P>
    <P>I could say a great deal more about that, but it does seem to me to finish on the note on which I began, that it is precisely to guard against evils of that kind that most modern constitutions have erected a second Chamber. The trouble with single chamber government is that the will of the majority of the people, which may be expressed as a result of some wave of emotion, some irrational sentiment, may quite easily bring a government into power which, supported by that popular enthusiasm, may do something which undermines the individual, inalienable rights of the human being. It cannot be sufficiently emphasised, I think, at a time like this, in free deliberative assemblies of this kind, that every human being has certain inborn, inalienable, natural rights. They precede the foundation of the State and can be defended, morally and legally, against interference by the State.  That, I think, is a correct statement of political theory.  It seems to me that one of the great dangers in modern times is that single chamber Governments will overrun the rights of the individual and it is peculiarly appropriate that the second Chamber which is part of the system of checks and balances in our Constitution should redress this danger.  Therefore, I have great pleasure in seconding Senator Duffy's motion.  I think he has made a <i>prima facie</i> case for the setting up of a commission of this kind and I commend his motion to the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say at the outset that the Taoiseach to-day signified his willingness to come to this debate, if it were thought necessary. I was asked that question before, and, at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges yesterday, we discussed this matter, and it seemed to the whole of us that it was entirely a matter for the House, except with regard to one particular paragraph of the motion, about which I had a word with the Minister for Finance.  However, if we are discussing this motion in the absence of the Minister, it is because we considered this a matter entirely for ourselves and we can take whatever decision we like upon it.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I should like to compliment Senator Duffy upon his persistence and his industry in this matter.  He has obviously given it very great consideration and done a great deal of research in connection with it. There are a number of points upon which we are all in agreement.  It would be interesting to go into the question of delegated legislation and the freedom of the individual in general, but I propose to confine myself entirely to what one might call the practical Parliamentary aspect of this matter. It will be agreed, I think, that we cannot now stop delegated legislation.  It has become, as Senator Duffy and Senator O'Brien have said, and as we all know, something which we may diminish slightly, but which, in itself, we cannot stop.</P>
      <P>It is agreed also that it is impossible for all the members of the House to keep in touch with all the Orders, and indeed impossible for any individual member, no matter how industrious he may be, to keep in touch with these Orders.  Senator Duffy's committee is an attempt and a praiseworthy attempt, a detailed and well-thoughtout attempt, to meet that situation, and to enable us to see whether, when Orders are made, they may not be worthy of special attention.  But the committee which Senator Duffy proposes here is only one attempt, and one small attempt, so to speak, to fill the breach in the Parliamentary wall which is getting wider and wider every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="610" /> The truth, as Senator O'Brien has very well said, is that all this is part of the imperfection of a Parliamentary system which we have inherited and which was planned to deal with a much simpler state of affairs than that with which we find ourselves confronted. The British Parliament, even 50 years ago, as has been said, was dealing with a few major subjects and was only beginning to deal with all the vast complication with which we are now called upon to cope.  If one were to take the Dáil Order Paper for any given day and look at the immense variety of questions, beginning with a question as to whether we are or are not a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations and continuing with a question as to whether the Minister will ask Corás Iompair Éireann to reopen the station at Bally-i-bhfadsíos, and going on to a question of whether the case, in regard to the application by Mr. Patrick Murphy, of somewhere else, for a military service pension could be reopened, one will realise that the scope of Government is now immense, and the truth is that Parliament cannot keep pace with it. This is an endeavour to meet part of that.  I think it is a good endeavour, and that we might very well adopt it, but, having adopted it, I think we are merely touching the fringe of a very great problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that civil servants have delegated to them certain powers and the word &ldquo;tyranny&rdquo; has been mentioned, but, so far as I am concerned and so far as my experience of Governments since 1922 goes, I think it would be fair to say that there has been no attempt at a purposeful tyranny on the part of either Ministers or civil servants at any stage.  Civil servants and Ministers want to get something done and they want to get it done in the shortest way possible, and they object to the slow, cumbersome, creaking and occasionally verbose machinery of Parliament.  That getting things done in a hurry prevents the processes which are associated with the rule of law, and this also might well be put, that the functions of a member of parliament, whether of the Dáil, the Seanad, the British <Col N="611" /> Parliament or any other parliament &mdash;the ones we happen to know are those here and the British Parliament &mdash;have become immensely widened.</P>
    <P>A member of the Dáil particularly, and indeed a member of the Seanad, is supposed to do something much wider, something much more complicated, than merely watching legislation, and the member of the Dáil who does not bother his head about legislation may very well be much more successful at the next general election than the member who sits in and listens to all the debates.  I hesitate to say, Sir, that that might apply in some degree even to the august assembly which I have the honour to be addressing at the moment.  You see, members of the Dáil have correspondence. Their constituents ask them to get them old age pensions, to get them licences, quotas, houses, jobs, farms, to get them Heaven knows, what.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard examples of that although it has not come within my particular personal ambit.  In any event, one of the things which strikes you is, whether the whole question of our business could not be better transacted through Committees. What is called in the Dáil and here, the Committee of the whole House, very seldom is anything like the whole House.  It is very often merely a quorum.  It is sometimes difficult to get a quorum of members who are interested and one of the good things about this motion is that it proposes that where a particular matter is in question, there should be power to ask for a memorandum from the Department.  On that, may I ask Senator Duffy, when he is concluding, to make clear the precise meaning that is attached to paragraph (c) of Section 2 of the motion.  The paragraph reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Select Committee shall ... have power to require any Government Department concerned to submit a memorandum explaining any Rule, Order, Regulation or <Col N="612" /> Draft which may be under their consideration or to depute a representative to appear.&rdquo; ...</P>
    <P>I take it the meaning Senator Duffy attaches to that, and what he wants to accomplish is, that the Committee shall have power to ask for a memorandum but that the Department will either supply the memorandum or, if the Department likes, send a representative?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I accept that definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the definition, I think there would not be any difficulty about it but, as a matter of fact, one of the things which members of both Houses do to a considerable extent now is, they meet officials but they meet them unofficially, outside the House.  It may be worth our while to consider whether it would not be an improvement if we had a type of committee to consider Bills before which the civil servant who had been responsible, not for the actual parliamentary drafting, but for the drafting of the material for the Bill, could appear and could speak, not, of course, before the Press.  Very often, that would clear up difficulties which take a long time to resolve in public debate. In other words, the question is whether the Dáil and Seanad should not work more by Committees, whether Committees of either House, or Joint Committees.</P>
      <P>I know that in France there are considerable powers to committees and my friend Senator Douglas has, I think, made a study of the positon in Sweden where there are committees of both Houses, or joint committees who have considerable powers and functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is another point about the committee.  This committee &mdash;I think, Senator Duffy made it clear already&mdash;does not impair and cannot impair the right of the individual member to put down a motion himself, either before the committee reports or after the committee has reported, and I am not sure that Senator Duffy is right in saying that the committee should not deal with orders which there <Col N="613" /> is no power to annul.  He mentioned the orders on the Paper to-day dealing with certain matters from the Department of Industry and Commerce. There is not much difficulty about orders of that kind because they need to be approved and, since they need to be approved, an explanation can be demanded from the person who moves the approval or from the Minister if he is in attendance.  There are other motions which we have power to annul within a certain period, and there are further Orders which need not be approved and which we have no power to annul but I do not think this committee, if it were to be established, would be prevented from investigating those Orders.  I think that kind of an order might very well be investigated also if occasion arose. And, since the making of the Order is an administrative act of a Minister, I think we would not be precluded from debating the matter in the House under a suitable form of motion, and I take the view that it is possible to frame a motion to do almost anything. I think we could do that if we were put to it.</P>
    <P>With regard to whether the committee should or should not be a joint committee, I took some exception to a motion of this kind before when it was put in general terms.  It is now in very particular terms.  I thought for some time that it might be better to ask for a joint committee but, as I say, I regarded the motion as only one particular step in an endeavour to deal with a very wide and complicated problem and perhaps the best thing we could do is, as Senator Duffy and Senator O'Brien have said, to keep to our own peculiar functions, to take the line that the Dáil is very busy with other things, its financial business, Public Accounts Committee, and so on, and see what we can do ourselves in this particular matter, that is, make a beginning and see for a period how it works, leaving the matter entirely for the Seanad.  We have much more time than the Dáil, seeing that we have not got any Estimates to do.  I think that for the moment, although one might make out an excellent theoretical argument for a joint committee, <Col N="614" /> it would be better, as Senator Duffy suggests, to keep the matter entirely to a Seanad Committee.</P>
    <P>As I say, I am in favour of the motion.  It is detailed and sets out the particular functions.  I do not think it will be costly and I do not think there will be any difficulty in getting a Department to furnish a memorandum on a particular order that the committee wants to discuss, and I think it would be a beginning, perhaps, of a committee system, which might have very important developments and, on that basis, Sir, I think the motion is a desirable one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the statements that have been made, I think it is now accepted that all parties in this and the other House agree as to the necessity of legislation by Order.  In the past there was very severe criticism when Orders were not brought in in the form of legislation.  We have reached the stage now when all Parties and all members agree as to the necessity for legislation by Order. Our views on this matter when we are on this side are the same as they were when we were on the other side.  However, as it has been intimated to the House that the Taoiseach is prepared to accept and implement the motion, if any good is going to come from it, we do not propose to stand in the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of correction. I said that the Taoiseach was willing to come to the House for the Motion.  I did not say that he was willing to accept the Motion.  He was not asked that.  The only thing is that he expressed to the Clerk of the House his willingness to attend, if we thought fit but we had decided yesterday at the Committee on Procedure that we would go ahead without a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the procedure adopted on the last occasion. As I have already said, we on this side of the House, are prepared to allow the motion to pass without opposition, not that we have changed our views, but that we are prepared to give the setting up of this committee every help and opportunity <Col N="615" /> if it can achieve the objects for which it is proposed to be set up.  I would like, however, to emphasise that we are very anxious that the rights and privileges of each and every member should be maintained, that the setting up of this committee, either now or in the future, would not take away from any member of the House the rights and the duty he has to examine every Bill and every Order that is made and if he thinks fit, to have a motion to have such Order annulled placed on the Order Paper, regardless of what the decision of this committe might be.</P>
      <P>I also personally want to say that I would agree with the suggestion put forward by Senator Hayes in relation to the joint committee on Bills.  I think it would be a very good thing if such committee could be set up and that the Bill would be examined in the presence of the executive officer in charge of implementing the Bill later when put into operation, or even before that.  Very many of the snags that often appear might be removed before a Bill would become law.  I do not wish to go into the details as set out by Senator Duffy, but I do want to say that I feel that if this committee is going to perform and attend to all the functions that Senator Duffy has put before us, from the examination of every minor order made by C.I.E., and other State or semi-State organisations, I can see that it is going to be a permanent body and that there will be a great deal of work involved in being a member of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I also am prepared to support the motion but I do so without any great enthusiasm.  I am in agreement with almost everything that Senator O'Brien said, and with a great deal of Senator Duffy's remarks. It is best that we should make an experiment to try what can be done with a committee of nine.  At the same time, it is only right to say, that I do not think a great deal of what the proposer and seconder desired can be achieved with a committee of nine. That, however, is not a reason why we should not make a start in order to decide if it will work satisfactorily. <Col N="616" /> As members of a former Seanad know, I have on a good many occasions advocated the adoption of the committee system, not the same as that which operates in Sweden which is of a somewhat rigid character, and is based on a tradition going back for a 100 years, but something not unlike it, adapted to our circumstances here. Consequently, I would much prefer to see this House dividing itself into a number of committees.  I would follow Sweden's example to this extent, that I would make it obligatory on every member to belong to one committee and to attend it.</P>
      <P>There a special explanation has to be sent in and read out for nonattendance, according to the information given me and which I take to be reliable.  The system I should like to see would be to have a committee on agriculture, a committee on commercial problems, divided, say, between industry, transport, and kindred questions.  I should also like to see a committee on educational matters and a joint committee on external affairs. What I should like to see would be a committee sitting on every Bill, which would go first before it, and the Chairman could decide the most suitable committee to deal with it.  I should like to see all Government orders submitted to the committee which the Chairman or the Clerk considered to be the most suitable to examine them.</P>
      <P>I should like to have a list of all Orders submitted to a committee to decide its importance.  In Sweden these committees do not meet in public. I do not think it is desirable that they should meet in public.  Accepting that idea, what I have in mind is that a civil servant from the Department in charge of a Bill, and who knew most about it, would attend at the committee and could be questioned.  It would not be desirable to do that in public. If it was to be done in public it should be done with the Minister.  As far as Emergency and General Orders are concerned, if such a scheme was operated they would not go any further than the committee, unless it decided to draw the attention of Parliament or in this case of the Seanad to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="617" /> In the case of Bills they would then go to a stage that is virtually our Report Stage.  Only amendments proposed by the committee would be taken there, but under certain conditions amendments might be made in public discussion with which the Minister concerned would deal.  I am told that that works extremely well in Sweden, that it has a tendency to reduce acute party controversy, and to remove a great deal of the legislation from the realm of party politics.  From what I could find out, that system has added to the work of individual members of Parliament, but it has reduced the number of days that members of both Houses sit.  In Sweden they are all joint committees. I do not see any reason why we should not set up committees, even though it does not seem desirable to have a joint committee.  If there was a chance of examining the wider idea I have in mind, which is related to Senator Duffy's motion, there are some committees, particularly in reference to External Affairs and Finance which would be joint committees for which it would not be desirable for this House to set up a committee of its own.  As far as other questions are concerned I do not see why we should not go on alone.</P>
    <P>It will be interesting to see how far we can get with a committee of nine. I agree with Senator Hawkins that if it is to do such work properly it will have much to do.  I wonder if it can be done well by a small committee. I am told that under the Swedish system, in practice, what happens is that members are re-elected on the same committee and become more or less experts on parliamentary affairs. It is generally recognised that those who are on committees remain there, except when there are changes and an influx after elections.</P>
    <P>In the case of detailed Orders which Senator Duffy has in mind, it would be extremely difficult to find a Senator who would have much knowledge of some of them.  I do not think Senators look at all the Orders.  I can claim that I look at most of them, but that does not apply, for instance to those concerning Córas Iompair Eireann.  I <Col N="618" /> have not the diligence of Senator Duffy. I look at most of the Orders but I confess that I have not time to find out what they are all about.  One would not know what some of them were about unless one looked up an Act of Parliament.  The case put by Senator Duffy and by Senator O'Brien is almost unanswerable, but as to its working, better &ldquo;wait and see.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope if this committee begins to function that Senators will consider whether they should not report back, and suggest a larger committee.  I am convinced that if we are going to have as much delegated legislation as we have had we had better give up any idea of democratic control, unless we can find some system of dealing with it.</P>
    <P>I differ in one respect from preceding speakers.  There seems to be general acceptance of the belief that the amount of delegated legislation we have had during the last few years is something that is inevitable in the future.  I do not accept that view.  We have had far too much of it.  I am convinced that there should not be any delegated legislation in the strict sense of the word.  There should, however, be a great deal in the way of delegated administration, and Orders when made should be of an administrative character within the principle set out by a Bill or by legislation.  Except in times of emergency, all Orders made by subsidiary bodies, whether by civil servants or C.I.E. or the E.S.B., should be only administrative Orders, made within the principal powers of a Bill which enabled them to do so, and it should be possible to challenge them in court.</P>
    <P>I think that to hand over to civil servants or to other bodies the power actually to change the law, taking the word &ldquo;law&rdquo; in its more rigid sense, is going too far, and I am not yet convinced that it is necessary.  While I agree that the making of a great many Orders will be necessary, I still do not want to be taken as going as far as Senator Duffy, Senator Hayes or Senator Hawkins in saying that the position is necessarily going to stay. I think at the same time that an effort should be made to try and distinguish between an administrative order which <Col N="619" /> is necessary for the carrying out of legislation, and what, in the strict sense of the word should be delegated legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion. I confess to being for a great many years, a believer in the principle of complete freedom for the individual and an opponent of all delegated legislation. I came to recognise, after some period as a member of Parliament, that a certain amount of delegated legislation is necessary.  I do not see how we can avoid that.  I agree with Senator Douglas that, in late years, we have gone too far altogether in the realm of delegated rules and legislation. In a time of grave emergency there may be a possible excuse for an extension of delegated authority, but I believe that in the emergency we have passed through, we went altogether too far in delegating to the Government the authority of Parliament.  A great many people support me in that opinion.  We went so far in that direction that many of the citizens of this country came to regard themselves as being absolutely powerless in the face of the orders and regulations that were being constantly issued from the various Government departments.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Brien says that there is a distinction between the ideal and the practical.  I believed in the practical in my early connection with Parliament, but I came to recognise later that what was practical was not always possible and that the ideals I held originally had to be modified in the course of years.  I do not want to enter into the region of politics on this motion but I think the change of Government will act as a safeguard against the grave dangers arising from delegated authority.  The Government that we have now is practically a committee in itself, and will be a safeguard against some of the dangers that flow from delegated authority.  Nevertheless I think that some such suggestion as that made by Senator Duffy in the motion is necessary if we are to safeguard the deople of the country in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Brien said that the rule of law is, possibly, the greatest asset <Col N="620" /> in the possession of the people.  I agree, and I think that the greatest enemy to the rule of law is the thing that we are talking about in this motion&mdash;the delegation of legislative authority.  There is also the question of retrospective legislation which is not dealt with in the motion.  I think it was Senator Hayes who suggested that it might come within the province of a committee to examine Bills, and that there is grave danger to the freedom of the individual under delegated authority.  There is a graver danger, perhaps, as the people have unfortunately come to recognise in the recent past under retrospective legislation. I would like to see, as was suggested by Senator Hayes and by Senator Douglas, a committee set up to examine Bills.  It is possible, if that were done, that it would obviate the dangers arising from delegated authority, whether by rules or by regulations. I would like to see a committee set up that would examine every Bill. Such an examination would help to clarify the position for the public in general.  It would enable the public to see the difficulties likely to arise under the proposed legislation.  These are not always made obvious from a debate in the House.  Practically everything that could be said on behalf of the motion has been said.  Very little has been said against it.  I am glad that Senator Duffy has brought it forward and that the House appears likely to accept it.  I do not think a motion has ever been brought before this House or Parliament that has pleased me more than this one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sufficiently well informed on the matters at issue to give a decided opinion for or against the motion.  One thing I am afraid of is that Senator Duffy will kill himself, because if we pass the motion the committee will be Senator Duffy. He works so hard and is so precious a member that none of us would like to see him kill himself.  I think I know him longer than any other member of the House.  I remember him in the old days in Galway and I have been interested in him ever since.  In that sense I would be glad if the committee <Col N="621" /> were not set up.  There is a difficulty I have in mind which perhaps can be explained.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the motion proposes that the select committee shall have power to require any Government department to submit a memorandum explaining rules, Orders, or regulations which may be under their consideration and to send a representative from the department before the committee as a witness.  Apparently, if we pass the motion we give the committee that power, but who gives us the power to give the committee that power?  Have we, as a second Chamber, the constitutional right to demand explanations or to ask for information like that from a Government department?  It appears to me that Ministers are responsible only to the Dáil.  Whether Government departments are in the same position constitutionally, I do not know.  It is a question which I would like some one, with a knowledge of constitutional law, to explain.  If we pass the motion giving power to the committee to require a Government department to present a memorandum, or to send a representative before it I would like to know have we the power to give such power to the committee?</P>
      <P>The motion also proposes that it shall be the duty of the Clerk of the Seanad to provide for the committee clerical or such other assistance and facilities as they may require.  Would not the acceptance of that proposal involve the spending of public money? I do not know that we have the power to impose conditions involving the spending of public money.  These are some of the difficulties that occur to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mrs. Concannon has raised two points to which I had intended to draw attention. I am not opposing the motion.  It would not matter very much if I did, because it would please Senator Duffy to discover that the smooth and pleasant passage of his omnibus motion through the House obviously had not gone at the same speed as Senator Hayes' earlier luxury car motion, which was whisked through in a couple of <Col N="622" /> minutes like a smuggler crossing the Border with a load of sugar.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of the motion, but I wonder if we have power to summon the officials.  We should be sure of our power before we try to do so. Though the quorum of the committee is to be nine, I agree with Senator Concannon that there will probably never be more than three.  The work will be onerous, but will be valuable in providing information we do not get in the ordinary way&mdash;because we do not always look for it and even then cannot discover it when we do look.</P>
      <P>This proposed committee will only have power to point out grievances or errors in the future and will have no roving power to go back to Victorian 1870, so all the difficulties and evils Senator Duffy has mentioned as his argument will still remain in force.</P>
      <P>He referred to the Local Government Elections Act, 1948, and contrasted the final clause there with the final clause in earlier Acts.  The very alteration there was a realisation by the Dáil that this making of orders by Ministers should not be tolerated but should be curbed and the orders made subject to annulment.  Having adopted the more democratic principle laid down in this 1948 Act, the Oireachtas is not likely to give any Minister such extensive powers as were given in the past&mdash;even in the recent past, when it was necessary to do so.</P>
      <P>If we had the power to prevent legislation of the kind Senator Duffy complains of, it might occasionally do harm.  He instanced the election in West Donegal.  Had there been no power there, it would have been a rather difficult situation.  Although it is necessary that the powers of officials and of Ministers should be curbed and they should not have power to overrule Parliament, it is not always desirable that their hands should be tied behind their backs, when a Bill is passed.  A power to annul an Order within a short specified time is a general safeguard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel deeply grateful to the members of both sides of the House for the attitude they have <Col N="623" /> adopted towards this motion.  If it had to be carried by a narrow majority I would not hold out a lot of hope for its success, but the fact that it has received support from all sections indicates that Senators realise there is something which needs to be done, and which this resolution will enable them to do, to protect the authority of our parliamentary institutions.</P>
      <P>I agree very largely with Senator Douglas, especially in relation to the need for other committees to deal with such matters as External Affairs, Agriculture, and perhaps military affairs.  If it were possible it would be well to induce both Houses to set up such joint committees.  However, I am confining myself here to a very narrow field.  I was not too sanguine when putting down the motion that I would secure approval for it even in this narrow field.  If other members want to embark on a wider field of activities, such as outlined by Senator Douglas, I will be glad to give them what support I can.</P>
      <P>Senator Hawkins emphasised the need of maintaining the right of the individual Senator unimpaired to raise in the House any matter he wants to raise.  Surely, that right must continue? The Senator will observe that this motion merely sets up a committee to report to the House.  It does not empower the committee to put down a motion at all.  There is nothing in the Standing Orders that will enable the committee to do anything but report to the House on the lines I have mentioned.  When these reports are made, Senator Hawkins on one side or Senator Hayes on the other, may see fit to call for the annulment of a regulation. They are free to do it if they wish, even before the committee examines the regulation or reports. There is nothing in the motion which would impair the right of an individual Senator to discharge his duties towards this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On paragraph 2 <i>(c)</i> of the motion questions were raised by Senator Hayes and Senator Mrs. Concannon.  Senator Hayes asked whether I was prepared to say that there was no intention of requiring a Government department to <Col N="624" /> send a witness to appear before the committee.  Now I want to make it clear that what I had in mind was that the committee should have power to require a Government department, when questioned regarding the structure of a regulation or Order or draft, to send a memorandum to the committee. My interpretation of the use of the word &ldquo;require&rdquo; is this: the committee through its clerk or chairman would send a note to the Government department to say: &ldquo;We have been looking over regulation No. 244 and are doubtful, according to present advice, whether you had power to make it.  Would you send us a note showing the authority which you say you have for making it.&rdquo;  It is merely a method of expressing a request and it is intended, at least so far as I am concerned, that the department itself would have the option of sending a person such as a civil servant to the committee to discuss the matter rather than sending a memorandum.  They may say it is far better to send up the principal officer of the department who will tell you all about it.  That is the kind of procedure that is likely to be followed.  If this committee were to be set up for the purposes of finding cause for quarrels with Government departments it would not function at all.  It will only function satisfactorily from the point of view of the legislature, if it works in the closest co-operation with Government departments and with the civil servants responsible for the drafting of regulations.</P>
    <P>The point made by Senator Mrs. Concannon rests on a different basis. I think she questions the constitutional right of the Seanad to authorise any such committee to request or require a Government department to furnish them with information.  I think she is entirely wrong.  I would refer the Seanad to Article 52 of the Standing Orders of Seanad Eireann relative to public business.  I am referring to the current issue.  The clause which deals with select committee provides that the Seanad may, on motion made, appoint a select committee to consider and take evidence on any Bill or matter and to report its opinion for the information and assistance of the <Col N="625" /> Seanad.  Not merely is the select committee empowered to ask the Government department for a memorandum: it is empowered to call witnesses, to swear them and to take their evidence on oath.  There can be no doubt, I think, in the mind of any member of this House that the Seanad has power to appoint this committee and to confer on it all the power set out in this resolution.  I hope Senator Mrs. Concannon will accept this as authoritative.  I can assure her that I made some inquiries here before putting down this motion as to whether we could exercise all these powers and I am assured we can.  I may have a difference with other members with regard to our powers under the Constitution&mdash;Mrs. Concannon may hold one view while I adhere to another. In a case of this kind there is nobody to decide between Mrs. Concannon and myself except the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>That is so.  It merely gives the committee power to require the Government Department to send a memorandum.  I do not propose to delay arguing on these lines but I would like to believe that every member of this House will insist on the House exercising all the powers which it has conferred on itself in its own Standing Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of tabling regulations was referred to by Senator Hayes and Senator O'Brien; Senator O'Farrell queried whether we could undo the mistakes of the past, that is, if there were mistakes.  The duty of the committee <Col N="626" /> under this motion will be to inquire into the regulations laid on the Table and if an inquiry is not made within 21 days after a regulation is laid the power to do anything about it will have expired.  There are only 21 days in which the House can do anything practical in regard to regulations which it dislikes.  As I have said before, the Statutory Instruments Act requires that Orders made subsequent to the 1st January, 1948, be printed within 7 days and copies deposited in certain libraries.  Regulations which were made under the Health Act in May, 1948, were tabled in the Seanad on the 10th June, 1948, a delay of 28 days.  A regulation under the Shops (Hours Trading) Act, made on the 13th April, was not tabled, I think, for 30 days and regulations under the County Management (Reservation) Order, made on the 30th January, 1948, were not tabled until the 5th May, 1948.  The Unemployment Assurance Regulations (Emergency Powers) Order, made to deprive certain people of the right to benefit, 5 or 6 years ago, were not tabled at all until the Order had expired.  An Order made under the Statistics Act on the 13th February, 1948, was not tabled until 4th May, 1948.  Section 70 of the Statistics Act says that this Order should be laid on the Table &ldquo;as soon as may be.&rdquo;&ldquo;As soon as may be&rdquo; here means well over four months after the Order was made, notwithstanding the obligation imposed by the Statutory Instruments Act to print the Order within seven days.  I mention these things not merely to complain, but to show that, if the committee were in existence and became aware of this lapse and reported to the House, I think the House would be bound to express some view on the matter, a view which probably would ensure that, in future, these departments would see to it that their Orders were tabled promptly.</P>
    <P>There is another matter dealt with by regulations and in regard to the validity of these regulations, I have some doubt.  I advert now to Article 15 of the Constitution which says:</P>
    <P>The sole and exclusive power of making laws is hereby vested in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> Then, I find Government departments making all kinds of instruments which may be regarded as laws.  On 15th June, we had regulations made by the Department of Finance increasing the inland postage rates.  They are probably entitled to do that.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government in 1924 made an Order increasing by 50 per cent. the costs payable under the Labourers Acts. Regulations under the Road Traffic Act, 1933, permitted insurance companies to charge increased fees for a certificate of cover.  These are regulations imposing taxation; in other words, the civil servants making these regulations are claiming to exercise powers which are denied to this House. Although one of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Seanad, may not impose a charge a civil servant sitting in the Custom House may.  Or he may make an Order enabling an insurance company to impose a charge.  That, I think, shows the need there is for some method of having these regulations examined and, where necessary, reported to the House.</P>
      <P>I do not think the task would be as laborious as Senator Mrs. Concannon has suggested.  Between 1st January, 1948 and 30th June, 1948, the first six months of this year, the number of documents laid on the table&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;documents&rdquo; advisedly&mdash;was 341 and I calculate that, of that number, less than 100 were capable of being annulled; these documents include such things as the report made by the sheriffs in respect of the election of 147 Deputies, the report of the Department of Agriculture, a report on fisheries and a number of informative documents which are not capable of being annulled at all.  On the British basis that only 33 orders were reported on out of 947, we cannot anticipate that the number of documents requiring special attention in this Chamber would exceed five, six or seven in the half-year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The number would be much less than 33 here, because the number of Orders made here is smaller than the number made in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We tabled 341 documents in the half-year and the British Committee examined 947 in a year, out of a probable 4,000 or 5,000. I should say that, in 1940, 1941 and 1942, we made about 1,500 Orders a year, but that number has decreased, and we are making less than 500 Orders at the moment.  Senator Hayes goes further and asks whether the committee would be precluded from examining statutory instruments which were not capable of being annulled.  I do not think the House would ask the committee to refrain from examining any Order or regulation they thought it desirable to have examined, but, so far as the resolution is concerned, it does not impose upon the committee an obligation to examine any document, except those which are capable of being annulled.  If the committee is working satisfactorily and if it is found desirable to draw the attention of the House to other documents, I have no doubt that the House will suitably amend its instruction to the committee at a later date; but at the moment the intention is that the committee will be required and have power to report to the House on every document in respect of which the House is entitled to take some positive action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mrs. Concannon also raised the question of the power to spend money in furtherance of the proposal in paragraph (4) of the motion, &ldquo;And it shall be the duty of the Clerk of Seanad Éireann to provide for the committee clerical or such other assistance and facilities as they may require.&rdquo;  As is well known, this House sets up committees from time to time. It is authorised to set up select committees and other special committees, and the facilities which a committee requires in the way of office and staff are always provided from the resources of the <Col N="629" /> Seanad itself.  If I may say so, I should add that, before putting in the clause to which the Senator referred, I made some inquiries as to whether it is permissible and possible to provide clerical assistance, and I was assured that that will be done, if the Seanad thinks fit to adopt the resolution.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point made by Senator Séamus O'Farrell, when he referred to one of the provisions of the Local Elections Act, I think he misunderstands the point I made.  I was referring to what is commonly known as the Henry VIII clause.  I do not want to go deeply into it, but it is roughly a clause which was inserted in many of the Local Government Acts during the past few years, authorising the Minister to modify or to adapt any law he finds in force which he thinks is in conflict with the Bill in which this clause is inserted.  The sub-section requiring the Minister for Local Government to have tabled the Orders made under that section, and authorising either House of the Oireachtas to annul them, is not a new invention. That sub-section, providing for the Orders being tabled and for their annulment in suitable cases, has been in most of the Local Government Acts from 1898 to the present day.  It was omitted in one or two cases.  It <Col N="630" /> was omitted in the case of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, and members of the Seanad who were here then will remember that we had a stiff fight with the then Parliamentary Secretary on that very issue.  However, his will prevailed and no provision was made in that Act for the tabling of regulations or for their annulment, but, as far as I can remember, during the last five years, that is the only statute in which this clause is inserted that did not have the additional sub-section which now appears in the Local Elections Act, 1948.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by expressing my deep appreciation to the members of this House for the patient manner in which they have listened to my efforts to propound these proposals, and the friendly welcome which they have extended to this resolution.</P>
    <P>Motion put and agreed to.</P>
