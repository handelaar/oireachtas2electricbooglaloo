    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4 to delete sub-section (4) and substitute the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  Notwithstanding sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, a prosecution for an offence under any section of this Act may be brought at any time within whichever of the following periods later expires, that is to say&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  three months from the date on which evidence sufficient in the opinion of the law officer of the housing authority to justify a prosecution for the offence comes to his knowledge, or</P>
      <P>(b)  twelve months after the commission of the offence,</P>
      <P>and a certificate under the signature of the said law officer as to the date on which such evidence comes to his knowledge shall be conclusive evidence thereof.</P>
      <P>This amendment is intended to bring into line the provisions of this Bill with those of a number of Acts which have passed through this House in recent years in relation to the time in which proceedings may be taken under an Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be observed that the provisions of sub-section (4) enable a prosecution to be taken within 12 months from the date of the offence.  I think, under the Petty Sessions Act, offences must be prosecuted within six months from the date of the offences.  This question was raised in relation to another Bill three or four years ago and, after a good deal of discussion, the Minister in charge of that particular Bill agreed with the members of this House that in general principle the period of six months should not be altered but, as he pointed out, circumstances might arise where it would not be convenient or practicable to take a prosecution within six months.  A formula was then <Col N="2017" /> agreed upon which provides that, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10 of the Petty Sessions Act, a prosecution may be brought within limits which enables, in the case of the Bill I have in mind, the Minister to certify that information on which to ground a prosecution reached him on a particular date and that the proceedings must be brought within three months from that date.  In other words, the intention of this House, when this question was brought before it on a number of occasions during the past three or four years, was that the proceedings should be brought as soon as possible; in any event, they should be brought not more than 12 months after the date of the offence, but that they should be brought within three months of the date on which information to ground a prosecution reaches the prosecuting authority.</P>
    <P>Senators will remember that in the case of the Children's Allowances Act, which we discussed here some years ago, the Minister accepted the view that the proceedings should be brought within three months of the date on which the information to ground the prosecution reached the Minister and he undertook to give a certificate certifying the date on which the information to ground the prosecution came to his knowledge.  I think we should try to maintain uniformity in these matters. If it is the practice in the case of the Forestry Act and the Children's Allowances Act and numerous other Acts, where the provisions of the Petty Sessions Act are being set aside, I think we should follow the practice in the other Acts to limit the time in the manner proposed in this amendment during which proceedings may be brought.  I urge the House that uniformity should be preserved.</P>

      <P>If the circumstances under which this Bill was being considered were not in themselves somewhat unusual, perhaps we might have a longer discussion on this amendment so that the merits of it might be fully investigated; but I ask the Senator not to press it.  To do so would mean that the enactment of this measure will be postponed perhaps for some weeks and perhaps for a somewhat longer period.  I <Col N="2018" /> do not, in these circumstances, wish to prolong the debate unduly by suggesting that the effect of the Senator's amendment may perhaps be to create a certain indefiniteness from the point of time, whereas he wishes, I think, to impose a limiting period of not more than 12 months within which the proceedings may be taken.  I would ask him not to press the amendment, it is not, I think, of sufficient importance to justify the holding up of the Bill.  I would concede that, if we were in a position to devote the normal period of time to this Committee State, perhaps we might have a prolonged discussion on the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I would oppose this amendment, because it has the direct opposite effect to what Senator Duffy intends.  He states that it is a good thing to have prsecutions brought within a very short time of the commission of an offence, but, if his amendment is passed, it will simply mean that there is no limit of time at all; the prosecution can be brought at any time when the law officer of the housing authority gets knowledge of the offence.  The law officer gets notice as soon as he gets instructions from the local authority.  Therefore, the local authority can give instructions five, six or ten years after the committal of the offence and if the law officer said: &ldquo;I only got instructions and only heard of this offence within the last three months&rdquo;, that is sufficient to enable the prosecution to be brought.  The amendment will have an exactly opposite effect to what Senator Duffy has in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that view, Sir.  Senator O'Dea and I took part in a debate in relation to the Children's Allowances Bill here two or three years ago.  I protested on that occasion against varying the provisions of the Petty Sessions Act in relation to a particular statute.  I am quite prepared to say that we should redraft Section 10 of the Petty Sessions Act in its entirety, but we ought not to be in a position where, allowing Section 10 of the Petty Sessions Act to stand. we put into a Bill, simply at the will and pleasure of a Department, a provision that, notwithstanding Section <Col N="2019" /> 10, we can still prosecute in any period of 12 months after the offence is committed.  The arrangement which was arrived at on that occasion was suggested by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in response to the representations of Senator O'Dea and myself and this very formula was adopted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge the Senator to refer to the provisions of the Children's Allowances Act and see whether or not this amendment is on exactly the same lines as the corresponding section in the Children's Allowances Act, subject to this reservation that, under that Act, the prosecution is brought within three months after the date on which information on which to base the prosecution reaches the Minister and he so certifies.  As the Minister is not the prosecutor in this case and as information on which to base a prosecution may not reach him at all, I substituted in the amendment the law officer of the local authority, but I am quite prepared to substitute the manager of the local authority or the chief executive officer of the local authority.</P>
      <P>I do not want to prolong the discussion. The Minister puts this case on a different basis.  I think he agrees entirely that there should be uniformity in these matters.  It seems to me that if we are to press for uniformity we shall have a long discussion on this amendment.  I am prepared to admit that the amendment would have to be withdrawn and submitted in a different form on Report Stage.  I do not want to go through these formalities and I do not desire to press the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear as to why it was necessary to insert these provisions with regard to the responsibility of company directors and officials.  Surely it is part of the general law that the directors and officials are responsible for the wrongdoings <Col N="2020" /> of a company.  Why is it necessary to set that out in this Bill rather than in a number of other Acts where persons, including companies, are responsible for proper performance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Sir John Keane is mistaken about that.  An offence may be committed by a company and, generally, it has been held that a company is not liable to the criminal law.  That is one of the reasons, I assume, that that section is put in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say, just to help Senator Sir John Keane, that this is a provision which it has been found necessary to include in other Acts&mdash;the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act, 1933, the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1938, the Shops (Hours of Trading) Act, 1938, the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, and the Supplies and, Services Act, 1946.  We have been advised that, in order fully to cover the position, a section in these terms is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in stating that directors are not responsible for the wrongdoings of their company unless that responsibility is set out in the relative Act and, where there is no such provision as is now laid down, directors are not responsible? It is a question of statute law.  I am puzzled that it should be necessary to set out in each particular statute the responsibility of directors and, where that responsibility is not set out, is there no responsibility?  That is what puzzles me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not ask me to give a general interpretation of what the law is on the subject but, at any rate, I am advised that it is necessary to incorporate a section in these terms in this Bill if we really wish fully to cover the position.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 7 and 8 put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 9 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2021" /> 9.&mdash;Nothing contained in Sections 7 or 8 of this Act shall be so construed as to prohibit the use of a dwellinghouse by the occupier thereof for the purpose of carrying on any home trade which apart from this Act may lawfully be carried on in such dwellinghouse.</P>
    <P>The two sections which have just been passed deal with the right of an occupier of a house to use that house for certain purposes.  Section 8 says that&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;a person shall not demolish in whole or in part or use otherwise than as a dwellinghouse any habitable house unless he has the permission, given under sub-section (1) of Section 7 of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems to me that these provisions are very drastic in relation to people who have been in the habit of carrying on certain occupations in their own houses.  For instance, in Dublin you will find a considerable number of women who take work from the shops which they carry out in their own homes.  They have been in the habit of doing that all their lives.  Let me give an example.  A woman who is a tailoress will go into a house like Clerys, or Todds or Arnotts and contract with the cutter there to take home garments, which are cut out for her, to be made up at home.  In other words, she is an out worker.  That kind of work is done in relation to paper bags, clothing and a number of other things in a city like Dublin.  It is probably done also in Cork and in other cities.  I am now drawing attention to the fact that it is done extensively in Dublin.  The effect of Sections 7 and 8 would seem to me to prevent the occupier of a dwellinghouse from carrying on a home trade which has been carried on in that house in the past.  I want to ensure that this measure, when it becomes an Act, will be made clear on the point that there is not obligation on the present occupier of premises to get specific permission from the local authority to carry on a home trade where that has been the normal custom.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amendment is entirely unnecessary.  You have cases under the Increase of Rent Act where a house is partly used for business and partly used as a dwelling. Such houses are held to be dwellinghouses. In this Bill, the expression &ldquo;dwellinghouse&rdquo; is defined to mean &ldquo;a building constructed or adapted to be used wholly or principally for human habitation.&rdquo;  As long as the premises are used principally for human habitation, then they would be held to be dwellinghouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Senator O'Dea has put his finger on the kernel of this matter.  I do not think the amendment is at all necessary, because it is assumed that, if a house is being used principally for living in, a person may carry on inside that house any sort of work which would normally be done at home.  Therefore, if dress-makers, for example, were to take home work to do in their own homes they would not be infringing the provisions in Sections 7 and 8.  I think the amendment is entirely unnecessary.  I think, too, in relation to matters of this sort, that we can depend on the housing authorities to act with ordinary common sense.  In fact some of them are inclined to go to the other extreme. They not merely allow a dwellinghouse to be used to carry out the work which is normally done in the home, but, in fact, they go far beyond that, and allow it to be converted to other uses.  I do not think that in present circumstances it is necessary to press the amendment.  As I said on the Second Stage of the Bill, we shall probably be having a consolidation Act coming along within the next year or two, and if it is then found necessary to amend the section as it stands I am sure that an amendment to safeguard the position which Senator Duffy has in mind will be introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The activities of a local authority under the Bill are very largely subject to sanction by the Minister. If the Minister will give an undertaking that he will keep this point in mind, that will satisfy me&mdash;once it is clearly understood that the provisions of the Bill in relation to the use of a <Col N="2023" /> dwellinghouse are not intended to prevent people doing what they are lawfully entitled to do now in a dwellinghouse in relation to a home trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 7 there is the right of appeal to the Minister. I can give the Senator the assurance that, so far as the present Minister is concerned, this section was not designed or intended to prevent work being done in the home which would normally be done there arising out of a person's employment or occupation outside.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 11.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 11 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to get some information from the Minister with regard to this section.  The object of the section, apparently, is to prevent the sub-division of a dwellinghouse and the creation of a tenement house. I find that the term &ldquo;tenement house&rdquo; is now covered by the more respectable title of &ldquo;multiple dwelling&rdquo;.  A portion of the multiple dwelling may be either a respectable flat or an overcrowded tenement.  Apparently, under this Bill all these sub-divisions, where they are created in the future, will be subject to the sanction of the local authority.  I speak subject to correction as to what the position will be with regard to sub-divisions which now exist.  As I read the section, permission to sub-divide a dwelling will have to be obtained in writing, and that permission has to be granted before the 1st July, 1948.  After that date, it will be an offence to sub-divide any house into one or more separate dwellings without the consent in writing of the local authority.  Does the Minister think that it will be possible to carry through such a large volume of work as is there envisaged before the 1st July?  It seems to me that an enormous amount of work will have to be done.  I agree, of course, that this provision is confined to certain areas such as Dublin, Cork, <Col N="2024" /> Waterford and Limerick.  It is in these areas that most of these multiple dwellings exist.  If all this work that I speak of cannot be done by the 1st July, what will the position be?  If a person sub-divides a house without that permission in writing, will he be committing an offence, even though it was not possible, administratively, to carry out the permit provision by the date set down in the section?</P>
      <P>I am puzzled by this expression &ldquo;multiple dwelling&rdquo;.  It is defined to mean &ldquo;premises let in parts to form two or more dwellings&rdquo;.  There is no definition in the Bill, so far as I can see, of the word &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo;.  There may be a definition of it in other Acts, but there is so much of this legislation by reference that it is very difficult for anybody to keep track of it all.  Since there is no definition, so far as I can see, of a dwelling, what is the position going to be with regard to lodgers?  If a person lets a room or two rooms to a lodger, what will the position be?  I feel that all these definitions ought to be made clear not merely to our satisfaction but to the satisfaction of those who are going to be affected by them. What I fear is that it will not be possible to grant all the necessary permissions within the time set out in sub-section (4).  I would ask the Minister to amplify the definition of &ldquo;multiple dwelling.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point to be considered in regard to this section. I think that, in so far as it is the desire of the Minister to limit the number of persons who will be permitted to reside in any dwellinghouse, his proposal will meet with the general approval of the House; but, while saying that, one must be conscious of the fact that there is to-day, in Dublin particularly, a dreadful shortage of living accommodation.  A case was brought to my notice quite recently of a woman, her husband and three children who were forced to leave a mother-in-law's house because the mother-in-law occupied a house provided by the corporation.  The occupier, her husband and some members of her family lived in the house and a daughter got married. After some years, the daughter, her <Col N="2025" /> husband and children were evicted from a basement dwelling in the city which they occupied.  Having nowhere to go, they went into this corporation house, and notice was then served on the occupier that, unless she got rid of her tenants, proceedings would be taken against her for recovery of the premises on behalf of the corporation. The result was that, to save herself from eviction, the mother-in-law intimated to her daughter and son-in-law that they must get out, and they did so.</P>
      <P>These people have been living for 12 months in this way: they go into the Dublin Union at 9 o'clock at night and get out at 8 o'clock in the morning. They walk the streets all day.  The husband has been working at periods and has been unemployed at other periods, and early this winter he was unemployed.  They had no place to go and everywhere they turned they found difficulty in getting accommodation.  In one instance, the man concerned applied to an agent who had two rooms to let down on Wellington Quay.  He started to enumerate the grounds upon which he thought he should get preference, saying that he had three children. The agent told him that these were three black marks against him and that the rooms would not be let to him because he had three children.  Up to this week, these people have been for almost 12 months living in these conditions. This week, through the intervention of a member of the corporation, they have been enabled to get a basement in the centre of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am drawing the attention of the Minister to that fact in relation to the effect of Section 11.  While we all agree with the basic intention of the section.  I urge on the Minister that it would be a terribly serious matter if people were forced to leave these dwellings, no matter how poor they are, no matter how bad they are, before alternative accommodation is provided.  It will be generally agreed that the providing of alternative accommodation for the thousands of families in Dublin looking for accommodation is going to be a very slow process.  I do not know what the Minister's intentions are&mdash; whether he intends this section to apply rigidly from July next or whether it is <Col N="2026" /> merely a guiding principle for the local authorities so that they might be active in preventing sub-letting where it can be avoided&mdash;but terrible hardship will be inflicted if people are forced to leave these dwellings, no matter how unsatisfied they may be, before alternative accommodation is provided for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I fear that Senators are reading more into the section than is really written in it.  The stated object of the section is not, as has been suggested, to prevent the sub-division of houses.  It is merely to ensure that, if houses are sub-divided, the housing authority will have knowledge of the matter and will be entitled to impose certain conditions in regard to that sub-division.  All that is said here is that persons shall not permit premises to be used as a multiple dwelling without the permission in writing of the housing authority, and it is further stated that that permission shall not be unreasonably withheld.  I think that has a bearing on the point raised by Senator Sir John Keane.  The administration of this section rests entirely with the housing authority.  Before we put down this operative date, 1st July, we took the matter up with the housing authority and we have been assured that, so far as the Dublin Corporation is concerned&mdash;and the problem is proportionately greater in Dublin than anywhere else&mdash;they will have no difficulty in dealing with all the applications which come before them in relation to this matter, and, I assume, in granting the necessary authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to suggest that at the outset the housing authority will embody in this permission all the governing conditions which it will lay down after the section has been in operation for perhaps two or three years and they become fully seized with the problem, but they have assured us that, so far as the granting of permission is concerned, there is not likely to be any great difficulty or any undue delay.  If there were undue delay in dealing with these applications&mdash;I cannot bind the courts and I am not going to go further; I am merely adopting the approach of the ordinary layman with common sense when I say it &mdash;I assume that, a provision having <Col N="2027" /> been included in the section to the effect that permission shall not be unreasonably withheld, it must mean that, since there is a limited period of time in which the permission must be granted, if the application is made in reasonable time, the housing authority will have to grant the permission. Otherwise, the courts would hold that it had been unreasonably withheld, since the housing authority is not able to deal with the application in any very close exhaustive way.  That is how, I think, the ordinary layman would approach it, and I do not think any very great difficulty is likely to be occasioned by reason of the fact that this section is to come into operation on 1st July this year.</P>
    <P>As to the other aspect which Senator Duffy raised, it really has nothing to do with the section at all.  The primary purpose of Section 11 is to enable a corporation to institute a register of multiple dwellings, and, in due time, to ensure that no multiple dwelling will come into existence or will be permitted to remain in existence, unless certain conditions which are necessary for the health of the public in general and of the individual living in the dwelling in particular are complied with.</P>
    <P>The other matter Senator Duffy has raised as to a mother-in-law having to put her son, daughter-in-law, and family out of a house in order to protect herself is, I think, rather beside the point.  I suggest&mdash;and not merely that, I contend&mdash;that it is not by any means a usual practice of the corporation. On the contrary, where a dwelling is shared by relatives, the corporation take a very lenient and commonsense view of the sub-division of the dwellinghouses.  They are bound to do that, because, as the housing authority, they are aware&mdash;as we are all aware&mdash;of the acute housing shortage. Therefore, as a rule they do not compel tenants to eject the families of close relatives.  They take a very lenient view and may turn a blind eye to a violation of the original conditions of the tenancy.  Where a mother-in-law is compelled to put her son-in-law and family out, I am afraid there is a little more behind it than that.  I do not <Col N="2028" /> want to press that, but I think we can assume it.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane said there is no definition of &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; in the Bill.  There are thousands of words in it for which we have no definition and we will have to rely on the court to interpet the Act in accordance with the usual interpretation and connotation of plain English.  They know what a dwelling is.  We have a definition of &ldquo;dwellinghouse&rdquo;, to which the courts may refer themselves for guidance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be very puzzled if asked to say whether a lodger makes a difference in the term &ldquo;dwelling.&rdquo;  I believe a lodger comes into the definition of dwelling, so that every house that has lodgers would become a multiple dwelling.  This is full of ambiguities and difficulties.  One may say these are only fine points that do not matter and that the purpose of the section is to give the local housing authority and the Minister power to deal with the main evils of overcrowding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the better-class houses divided into flats, apparently <Col N="2029" /> the housing authority is going to define the maximum number of people who can be allowed to live in any sub-dwelling to a multiple dwelling.  What power has the housing authority or anybody else to go in there and inspect the premises to ensure that those conditions are being observed?  I imagine they would need something more than the power given by regulations.  It raises a big point of constitutional significance&mdash;the right of entry into persons' houses without clear statutory authority&mdash;and that point does not appear to be covered by the section. It will be intolerable if inspectors have the right to walk into multiple dwellings and satisfy themselves as to how many people occupy any given sub-dwelling. If I own a house now and wish to let it to two or three lodgers, and there is no question of overcrowding, does the Minister say I must go to the housing authority and get permission to make these lettings or otherwise I will be infringing this section? The Minister may say he has no time to go into all this now, as the Bill is being debated under special circumstances, but this is a new provision in our Housing Acts and, in my opinion, it deserves from the Oireachtas the most careful, close and critical examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are up against a new problem.  I suspected that as no provision had been made to describe them as reserved functions they would be managerial.  This deprives the elected members of a city council of any right to interfere with the discretion of the manager or his officials in the implementation of this section.  Had this been a reserved function, the 45 members of the Dublin Corporation could interest themselves in what has been done under it.  They could put down a motion and debate it and could give directions in regard to these provisions, and I would feel happier about it.  However, we all know what happens when the matter is one of <Col N="2030" /> managerial discretion.  The manager cannot handle all these problems, he cannot know whether Mrs. Murphy has been treated fairly or unfairly, whether her house is one in which there should be a multiple dwelling or not.  He must leave all that to the officials and those officials are responsible to nobody, except in so far as the Minister for Local Government has a right to interfere&mdash;and his right of interference is very limited, particularly where the local authority have no discretion in the matter.</P>
      <P>On the question of definition of &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo;, the Minister made a remark which aroused in my mind a good deal of suspicion.  He said: &ldquo;I think we all know what is meant by a &lsquo;dwelling&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to a statement made in Great Britain in relation to the Workmen's Compensation Act when a case came before the courts many years ago.  The judge on that occasion&mdash; Lord Halsbury, I think&mdash;said: &ldquo;We all know what &lsquo;an accident&rsquo; means&rdquo;: but 70 subsequent appeals were made to the House of Lords to determine what the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo; meant.  So it is not at all unlikely that these simple words &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo;, &ldquo;dwellinghouse&rdquo; which look so simple to the layman may prove a very fruitful source of inquiry and of revenue to the legal profession.  If it is at all possible we should close that gap and define each phrase or word in the Bill so as to ensure that all will know what they mean and that there will be no doubt in the minds of lawyers.  It is desirable that it should be done and that it should be done now.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Senator suggests that at this stage we should endeavour to cope with a situation where there could be 70 decisions on the meaning of a word.  I do not know what sort of a volume we should produce before getting away from Section 11.  Surely we have got to assume at the outset that our judiciary will interpret the laws and statutes of the Oireachtas with ordinary common sense and in accordance with the commonly <Col N="2031" /> accepted meaning of the English language or the Irish language.  The Senator is a lawyer while I am merely a layman, but I will give the judiciary credit for more common sense than the Senator is apparently prepared to give.  We cannot stultify ourselves by assuming that another organ is not going to act in an honest way.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to take this matter more seriously than he appears to be doing.  I drew attention in the course of the debate in 1947 to a fact which was commented upon and verified by the Minister for Justice in the month of December.  The fact was that two chief justices differed so widely from each other in a case that one said that the Rules Publications Act of 1893 was in full force in this country while the other ruled that it had never been adapted and had no force in this country.  Both were rational men and read the law as they saw it.  After all, we are dealing with fallible human beings.  One man will say: &ldquo;Here is a paragraph, statement or word which means one thing&rdquo; while another person equally competent and honest says that it means something else.  That is why we have appeals and why cases are reversed in higher courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <P>I think that this is a profoundly unsatisfactory attitude of <Col N="2032" /> the Minister.  We are not to attempt to examine what &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; means but we are to leave it to the courts to fill in as best they can and to do what we ourselves have failed to do. We should give the courts something clear on which to work and we should not throw loose definitions into an Act of Parliament saying that the courts know what we mean.  We have a distinct responsibility and I have brought up a specific case in regard to a house occupied by lodgers.  Is it a dwelling or not?  The Minister refuses to answer and says that the courts will know and I think that this is profoundly unsatisfactory. We should say whether lodgers are included in multiple dwellings or not and it is wrong for us to leave it in a loose way to the courts. We all know that judges have animadverted, and rightly so, on the loose methods of Parliament and we have a responsibility.  The Minister never answered me in regard to the right of entry.  A man's home is supposed to be his castle and has the Government the right of entry there to see how many people are occupying a flat or must we leave that question to the courts too?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I have roused Senator Sir John Keane to such extremes of indignation.  I did think that the Senator had heard Senator O'Dea on this matter.  Senator O'Dea pointed out that persons who occupied a place as lodgers did not occupy a separate dwellings but shared another person's dwelling and that they were covered by the Public Health Act of 1878.  I assumed that Senator Sir John Keane had heard that and had accepted what Senator O'Dea had said.  Senator O'Dea was correct and therefore I did not refer further to the point which the Senator raised in relation to lodgers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the right of entry, perhaps I ought to say that what we are doing here is not something entirely novel in principle, as Senator Sir John Keane said, but something which has been attempted before, particularly by Dublin Corporation.  We are going further perhaps, because they did it under a private Act, while we are <Col N="2033" /> giving power to other municipalities to do what Dublin Corporation tried to do by their Act of 1890.  That is to say, they tried to ensure, where a building was let in tenements or separate dwellings or multiple dwellings, according to the phrase in the section, that they would be duly notified of that fact and be able to take certain steps. For one reason and another, Dublin Corporation found at an early stage that the 1890 Act was defective, and attempts were made by them, notably in a Bill of 1908, and subsequently, to make the original provisions of the Act of 1890 effective.  We are carrying this a stage further to see if we can find a solution for the problem which has hitherto baulked Dublin Corporation. We are all anxious to see that such control is maintained over the use of dwellinghouses so as to prevent the creation of slums.  Under existing Acts, Dublin Corporation sub-sanitary officers have the right to inspect dwellings which they think are being let as tenements.</P>
    <P>If the Seanad will be with me while I read the report on this matter from the Committee of Inquiry into the Housing of Working Classes in Dublin, set up in 1939, I think that the matter will be clearer. The by-laws made under the Act of 1890 impose a duty on the owner to notify the corporation that he has let a house to more than one family.  That is what we are asking here but we are making it an offence to let a house to more than one family without having received the permission in writing of the corporation.  I think the Senator will concede that there is no difference. We are endeavouring, by putting the onus on the owner not to let the house, to operate the principle more effectively. The relevant by-law reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...upon which the corporation may lay down what they deem necessary to be done in connection with the building...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is precisely what we are doing in Section 12.  We are giving the corporation power to attach conditions as to the repair, alteration or reconditioning of premises: a condition as to the number of dwellings which may be provided in the premises: a condition as to <Col N="2034" /> the maximum number of persons who may occupy each separate dwelling provided in the premises, and a condition as to responsibility for maintenance of the premises.  Here is what the corporation were empowered to do under the by-laws made by them under the Act of 1890:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...upon which the corporations may lay down what they deem necessary to be done in connection with the building&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;and the building is registered.</P>
    <P>Under the Acts of 1870 and 1878 under which by-laws are made governing these conditions upon which premises may be let, among other things these by-laws specify the number of cubic feet of space to be allowed for each person.  They also impose on the owner the responsibility for providing water closet accommodation sufficient for the inhabitants, a sufficient supply of pure water, and he is responsible also for maintaining the roofs, external walls and basements in a reasonable state of repair.  These by-laws remained in force until 1908 when they were superseded by another set which were, perhaps, even more stringent.  I submit that under Sections 11 and 12 we are not doing anything more than trying to make more effective the by-laws which were made under the Public Health Act of 1878 and subsequently under the Corporation Act of 1890.  We are not introducing anything novel.  We are not introducing, as has been suggested by Senator Sir John Keane, anything that had not been attempted in previous legislation.</P>

I feel that I have not yet been answered with regard to the power of entry.  I think that in the course of time a whole host of problems will arise under this section. Time will tell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, but the very important question is whether it is a self-contained flat or not.  It must be a self-contained flat in order to be excluded from any of the benefits of the Act.  Therefore, the landlord, in order to show that it is a self-contained flat, must show that it has proper lavatories and other accommodation.  If he cannot do that, he cannot charge an increased rent.  He cannot charge more than a proportion of the standard rent of that particular flat.  We are dealing here with a class of houses where a family may be put into possession of rooms which have not the proper amenities for a family.  Because of that the corporation are enabled to protect these people.  This only refers to certain towns, but the Minister can apply it to any town with a certain population.</P>
      <P>If people apply to the corporation for permission to let one or two families in they will be asked for particulars as regards accommodation.  They will be asked if they are going to put the people into a house where they will be treated like cattle&mdash;where they will not have the proper amenities which men and women ought to have.  They will be told that if they can provide the proper amenities they will be given the required permission, but that if they are not able to provide these amenities the permission will not be given.</P>

      <P>Perhaps, but let me deal with the general question.  I assume you do not expect the Minister or anybody else to deal with fine points now.  I take it, in general, that if permission has been refused to an owner, and if the owner proceeds to eject the occupants of these separate dwellings, he will succeed in ejecting them unless they go to the courts under the Rent Restrictions Act.  Assuming, in general, that they are covered by that Act, the question would naturally arise.  The owner would say that he tried to get these people out but that <Col N="2037" /> they would not go out, and somebody would probably raise the provisions of Section 11 or Section 12.  That may mean that people would be driven back to having recourse to sub-section (6) of Section 12 which gives the owner a right of appeal against a refusal of permission by a housing authority.  I assume that he would say: &ldquo;It is a case of Hobson's choice; I have to evict these people; the court will not allow me to evict them under the Rent Restrictions Act and I suggest, therefore, that the only reasonable way out of my difficulty is that the court should compel the housing authority to give me the necessary permission until such time as I am in a position to get rid of these people and comply with the reasonable requirements of the housing authority.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>To delete the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think everybody knows that the great scandal in relation to house control and rent control has been the evasion permitted under the provisions in regard to furnished lettings.  When rents were controlled it was open to the landlord to put in a few sticks of furniture and call <Col N="2038" /> his letting a furnished letting.  Subsequent to that action on the part of the landlord &ldquo;the sky was the limit&rdquo; in regard to rent.  That is an obvious method of avoiding this multiple dwellings provision.  A sparsely furnished sub-dwelling can be called a furnished dwelling.</P>
    <P>What does furniture mean?  It is defined under sub-section (4).  A furnished letting means a letting of a dwelling which includes payment for board, attendance, or the use of furniture.  I take it you can have a furnished letting, provided you supply board and attendance, because these are alternatives.  There need be no furniture so long as board and attendance are given or so long as steps are taken for the supply to the sub-dwelling of heat, hot water, fuel or electricity.  As I read it, one need only provide heat, hot water, fuel or electricity in order to come within a furnished dwelling.  The sub-section also says &ldquo;or any other commodity&rdquo;. You might provide window-cleaning and in that way qualify as a furnished dwelling.  &ldquo;Or the rendering of any services in connection with the dwelling&rdquo;&mdash;you might have a porter or somebody to open the door.  The only safeguard then is the proportion of the total rent attributable to such services. As far as I can see, if quarter or more of the rent is attributable to that service, the letting becomes a furnished letting; if it is less than a quarter, it fails to qualify as a furnished dwelling. On the face of it is not that an absurd position?</P>
    <P>Who is going to assess the relative proportions of these rents?  I can see no right of appeal to anybody on the apportionment of the services or the use of furniture as against the total rent.  What values will be brought into operation?  This is a delightful section for the lawyers.  I can see endless opportunities for them.  What is the objection to bringing in these furnished lettings under Section 11?  Why not permit them to be part of the multiple dwellings machinery?  That seems a simple solution to me.  If the provision is left as it is a whole host of artificial difficulties will arise and endless complications will ensue.  Here one is <Col N="2039" /> merely perpetuating all the scandals of the housing code under which wholly nominal conditions as regards furniture were overcome.  If my suggestion is accepted, the Bill will be impaired in no way.  In fact, I think it would be an improvement if this section were taken out completely and furnished lettings were brought in under multiple dwellings.</P>

      <P>The position under this section seems to me to be entirely unsatisfactory. Section 11 provides that after a certain date a person shall not permit a premises to be used as a multiple dwelling without a written permission from the housing authority. Section 13 provides that if, in the opinion of the housing authority, the rent of a particular premises&mdash;if that premises comes within the definition of Section 13&mdash;is greater than the rent which a person of the working classes would be likely to pay the whole letting is outside the scope of this Act.  How is the housing authority to determine the amount of rent a person of the working classes is likely to pay?  What is happening to-day is that people of the working classes are paying more for dwellings than are the people of the leisure classes.</P>

      <P>That may be so, but they are paying these rents at the expense of food for their families.  There is no other alternative for thousands of people in this city except to take a premises at any rent the landlord cares to demand.  Under this measure the City Manager in Dublin will have imposed upon him arbitrary powers of determining the rents which people of the working classes are likely to pay. Once the rent goes above that level then, so long as the conditions of Section 13 are complied with, there can be as many sublettings as the landlord wishes to have and as much over-crowding as the landlord will permit.  The whole machinery of Section 11 goes by the board.  If Section 11 means anything its main purpose is to restrict overcrowding and to restrict the use of premises by more people than the <Col N="2040" /> housing authority permits.  Once a sufficiently high rent is charged the premises cease to come within the scope of this Bill.  The City Manager in Dublin may take the view that a reasonable rent a member of the working class would pay is 5/- per week.  If the landlord charges 6/- per week his premises are outside the provisions of the Bill.  Of course that is subject to the reservation in sub-section (2) to which Senator Sir John Keane referred. If the value placed by the City Manager on the services rendered in respect of a dwelling is less than one-fourth, this sub-section (1) applies.</P>
      <P>Let us see what happens.  Somebody takes a furnished flat at £2 a week and there is hot water laid on, and some other services of that kind are provided. The City Manager says that these are worth 10/- a week.  In that case the rent, apart from the charges for the amenities, is 30/- and consequently the flat is covered by this Bill. All the landlord need do is to charge enough and he is safe; he is outside the provisions of this Bill.  The landlords are doing that with a vengeance. I know a case in this city where two or three rooms which were let at £1 a week five years ago are now let at £3 10s. 0d. a week; and flats will go higher so long as people do not care tuppence who occupies them, whether they come from England or America or anywhere else.  The owner is entitled to let them if the house has been reconstructed into separate flats at any time from the 7th May, 1941, because the Rent Restrictions Acts do not apply.  That was done deliberately in face of warnings in this House that a scandal was being perpetuated in the interest, I allege, of certain sections of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go back to Sections 11 and 12, but I can assure Senator Sir John Keane that an Act passed by the Oireachtas in 1931 imposed upon the local authority the duty &ldquo;to cause an inspection of their district to be made from time to time with a view to ascertaining whether any dwellinghouse therein is unfit for human habitation, and for that purpose it shall be the duty of the local authority and every officer of the local authority to comply with such regulations and to keep such records as the Minister may prescribe.&rdquo; Under that there was the right of entry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Really I cannot see what the difficulty is here.  We are endeavouring in this section to relieve the corporation of the responsibility for having to enforce a statutory provision which would bring inside its scope furnished flats of a type which, quite obviously, do not require to be inspected with a view to preventing them from becoming overcrowded.  We want to exclude, if you like, the more comfortable and luxurious lodgings and furnished flats which we know exist, for the simple reason that we do not think it necessary that they should be inspected and that we do not want to impose on the corporation staff the duty of inspecting them to the detriment of the much more essential work which we think they ought to be <Col N="2042" /> attending to in ensuring that the dwellings of the less fortunate classes which are likely to be overcrowded and where the conditions are likely to be detrimental to the health of the community and the individual will be inspected. That is mainly the purpose of the section.</P>
    <P>I do not rightly appreciate what Senator Sir John Keane has in mind in putting down this amendment.  Does he wish by deleting the section to have all these comfortable and luxurious flats and lodgings inspected?  If he does, it simply means that he will impose an added burden on the corporation, the cost of which will have to be borne by the ratepayers for whom the Senator is very often the spokesman and champion. I do not think it is necessary to do it and I do not think we should do it unnecessarily, because, if we do, we are going to do it at the cost of the much more essential work which the staff of the local authority should be undertaking. I cannot really see how this section as it stands opens a way to any of the abuses which the Senator mentioned. Somebody, naturally, must determine whether the rent is greater than the rent which a person of the working classes would be likely to pay for the letting.  I concede at once that there is no definition of &ldquo;working classes&rdquo;.  Nevertheless, that term is generally taken to mean, so far as housing is concerned, manual workers and people within the low income group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any legal definition of the term &ldquo;working classes&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no legal definition of &ldquo;working classes&rdquo;.  There is no definition of a suit and we all know what a suit means.  There is no definition of a chair, a bench or a seat, but we all know what these things mean.  Generally, when we talk about the housing of the working classes, we do not mean the housing of people who are in the comfortable financial position of some Senators here or of some other members of the community.  We generally mean those people who have to earn their bread, as the saying is, <Col N="2043" /> by the sweat of their brow or the work of their hands under conditions which seem to justify the concession to them of unusual assistance by the community. I take it that that is what we generally mean by people of the working classes.</P>
      <P>As it will be the City Manager who will be the responsible officer under this section or the appropriate officer who acts under the City Manager and in the name of the corporation, I assume that he is as competent to determine what is generally meant by the term, &ldquo;a person of the working classes&rdquo;, as, say, a district justice or a judge of the High Court or any other person, even a Senator, or, if you like, a Minister of State.  Therefore, I think that we need not start to split hairs about the fact that it is the housing authority which is to determine this question.  In fact, I think that no suitable alternative could be found to the housing authority to determine this question, because, after all, the housing authority has a much wider knowledge and a much greater experience of the administration of the Housing of the Working-Class Acts than other persons or agencies normally have. Again, I think that the appropriate officer of the housing authorities is as competent&mdash;more competent, I should perhaps say&mdash;than most other people would be to determine what fraction of the rent would be properly attributable to the services rendered or the commodities provided by a landlord in the case of a furnished letting.  Bearing in mind that we do not want to complicate the task of local authorities unduly by imposing upon them unnecessary obligations, and, at the same time, that we do not want to allow the terms of the provisions of Sections 11 and 12 to be readily evaded, I think it will be seen that this section is essential and that it is not at all as objectionable as Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Duffy would have us believe.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister himself feels that his case is rather weak when he defends the section upon the well-to-do furnished flat.  Obviously there need not be a stick of furniture in a flat at all; if you provide hot water and window cleaning, as I have <Col N="2044" /> said before, up to a value of a quarter of the total rent, that is a furnished flat. The object of my amendment is really to carry out what the Minister is attempting under Section 11 and to avoid the evasion of Section 11 under the provisions of Section 13.  Really it is deplorable at this late stage that we should have this spirit of distraction over a matter of this kind.  I am surprised that the Minister attempted to define a furnished dwelling; I do not think anybody has ever attempted it before.  It may be a dwelling that has not a stick of furniture in it at all.  I think that is an extraordinary definition. Then you have this old argument about economy, and it is said that, although I am always advocating economic administration, I now want to add to the burden of the rates in this case.  We have got to look at this case on its essential merits instead of chasing hares about extra inspectors and the burden they would involve on the rates.  I cannot believe that it would mean any appreciable burden on the rates.  I think the amendment would secure what the Minister himself seeks to achieve under the earlier sections and I strongly urge that the section be deleted.</P>

      <P>On the matter raised by Senator Sir John Keane, I want to say that I support him as a fellow-worker. I believe, whether people are well to do or not, it is our duty to see that they are not subjected to any exploitation. So far as the well-to-do classes are concerned, there is no reason why a landlord could not make some arrangement whereby his flat would appear to be of a superior type.  Locality alone would decide in that case&mdash;not fittings or service, but simply locality.  Flats in Merrion Square or in Fitzwilliam Square would be defined as well-to-do flats, but there is no reason why people living around Mountjoy Square and other areas, where the working classes reside, should not be protected.  I think there is a good deal to be said for Senator Sir John Keane's amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to emphasise one point.  You can provide a dwelling without a stick of furniture but with certain services with possibly an arbitrary value or these services may be assessed by valuers at a certain value and in that way evade the provisions of Sections 11 and 12.  You might create minor tenements, which would be described as furnished flats. The general statement of the Minister that the adoption of this amendment would make the Bill unworkable&mdash;there is some proportion of sub-dwellings that would qualify as furnished flats, but against that there would be others which would not&mdash;is merely a general statement which is not treating this Bill seriously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 41, before the word &ldquo;wilfully&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;unless he withdraws or does not proceed with the application&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a most extraordinary section. The provisions of sub-section (2) seem to me to have been inserted without due regard to their significance.  The section deals with the information which the housing authorities may require from persons making applications for grants. Sub-section (1), it will be observed, authorises the housing authority, for the purpose of enabling them to determine the rent that shall be payable by a person to whom they have let or who has applied to have let to him a house, cottage, or other accommodation provided under the Housing Acts, 1932 to 1946, and other Acts, to require such person to furnish particulars as to the number of members of such person's <Col N="2047" /> family residing with him, the weekly income of such person and of each of the members of his family, together with other information as regards transport and income from home assistance or State funds.</P>
    <P>I am objecting to the provisions authorising the housing authority to seek that information from a person who has applied for a house or cottage or other accommodation.  What I am mainly concerned with is the provision of sub-section (2), which sets out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any person to whom a housing authority have let or who has applied to have let to him a house, cottage or other accommodation provided under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1932 to 1946, the Housing of the Working Classes Acts or the Labourers Acts and who wilfully neglects or refuses to furnish any information required by a housing authority under this section or who furnishes false information shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding five pounds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let me take this case.  A person applies to the Dublin Corporation, the Cork Corporation or the Mayo County Council for a house.  He is asked to fill in a form giving accurate information regarding all the matters specified in sub-section (1).  He fills up the form and for some reason he decides subsequently to withdraw his application. The housing authority still has the right to investigate all his answers and, if they find any of them incorrect, they have the right to prosecute him and he may be fined £5, although he has not got a house and has actually withdrawn his application.  I suggest that a conviction will not lie unless the person gets a house from the local authority on foot of his application.  If he decides to withdraw the application my view is &mdash;and I want the House to accept it&mdash; that he should not be exposed to a prosecution or conviction whether or not his information is correct.  If he has withdrawn his application, he should not be prosecuted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder does Senator <Col N="2048" /> Duffy realise what happens in cases of this kind?  A housing authority will have numerous applications for each house and is it to be suggested that a man who writes in and says: &ldquo;I withdraw my application&rdquo;, should have any further consideration given to him, seeing that they will have hundreds of other applicants?  Is it to be suggested, if a man writes in to the housing authority withdrawing his application, that the housing authority will bother further about his application?  Will it not naturally be put aside?</P>
      <P>Senator Duffy's amendment would not, in any event, carry out his intentions. There are other words that would probably carry out his intentions better than the words he proposes. &ldquo;... unless he withdraws or does not proceed with the application&rdquo; is clearly unnecessary because the housing authority will be delighted to have a withdrawal of one of the numerous applications.  Besides that, the form of application is generally prescribed and all the particulars have to be given in that application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument advanced by Senator O'Dea seems to be this, that is does not matter what goes into the Act, it will be applied in accordance with certain preconceived notions of the local authority, which in this case means the city manager or county manager.  The county council have no discretion in the matter; it is a function of the manager, and the Senator's view is that the manager has a preconceived notion and it does not matter what we put into the Bill, certain things will follow.  If that is so, why not say that the county manager can do what he likes and let us stop pretending to pass legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest anything of the kind&mdash;that the manager can do what he likes.  Of course, no county manager would do what he likes and nobody would ever suggest it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how Senator Duffy wants us to phrase legislation.  Obviously if the Oireachtas were to try to provide in every Act phraseology to cover every possible reasonable or unreasonable interpretation <Col N="2049" /> and every possible reasonable or unreasonable administration of the Act, we should get a Statute Book which would resemble nothing as much as the convolutions and involutions of an intricate piece of Celtic tracery and we should only be further tied up in knots of judicial interpretations.  Apart from that, we have to accept that the housing authority will act in a reasonable way, with the commonsense of people who have to administer public affairs and even to administer their own business.  If a person allows his application to lapse or formally withdraws it, I am perfectly certain the local authority will not pursue that man into the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is admittedly an executive function; it is the function of the manager to prevent abuse of the provisions of the Housing Acts and therefore it would be his duty, in certain circumstances, such as if a person got a house under false pretences, to take action against that person under this section.  But I am perfectly certain that if the person did not get the house the manager would not pursue the matter further, because no harm would be done so far as the corporation or council would be concerned and so far as the other applicants for houses would be concerned. Therefore, he would not take legal proceedings in a case which the elected representatives of his authority would regard as being unnecessary and a frivolous waste of public money. So, I think we can rule out at once as a probability that a county manager or the manager for a housing authority will take action where a person has withdrawn or does not proceed with his application or allows his application to lapse.  From that point of view, I think, Senator Duffy's amendment is unnecessary for the protection of the person involved.  Not only is it unnecessary, but it might in certain circumstances be positively harmful, because what in effect Senator Duffy's amendment says is: &ldquo;Go in; make a false statement with the assurance that, if you are found out before you get the house, then nothing will be done so far as the law is concerned and you cannot be pursued under the law.&rdquo;<Col N="2050" /> That is in fact what Senator Duffy's amendment, in the form in which he has put it down, would do.  It would hold out a sort of tacit encouragement to people to go ahead and disregard the obligations of sub-section (1).</P>
    <P>Again let us advert to sub-section (1). Sub-section (1) expressly states that the information can only be sought for the purpose of enabling a housing authority to determine the rent that shall be payable by a tenant or applicant and, if the applicant withdraws his application or does not proceed with his application, there would be no legal justification for demanding information under the section.  Therefore, as I have said, I do not think that an amendment in those terms is necessary. On the contrary, I think it would be likely to do more harm than good in so far as it would make the task of the local authority more difficult by reason of the encouragement which it would hold out to people, by offering them a certain immunity, to make at the outset false statements.  I am sure the Senator does not want that.  We always want to feel, when an application is made for a house and certain information is given, that the information will be true in fact and will not be calculated to mislead or to deceive the housing authority, to the detriment of more deserving cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>And Senator O'Dea does not seem to have read it, or to have understood it.  It is not a question of giving false information.  That is not what the sub-section deals with at all. What it provides for is a punishment where the applicant wilfully neglects or refuses to furnish any information required by a housing authority under the section.  If the applicant makes a request to be supplied with a cottage he gets this form which asks for particulars concerning his home, his domestic conditions.  He considers that, rather than furnish the information to the local authority, which <Col N="2051" /> means, to an official of the county council or corporation, he will not proceed with his application.  He can still be prosecuted under this section if he wilfully neglects or refuses to furnish the information asked for.  This is not merely a question of prosecuting somebody who endeavours wrongfully to get a house on foot of false information or misleading information.  It is a proposal to punish a person who will not get a house and who, when he sees the conditions on which the application must be made, declines to proceed with his application.</P>
      <P>I suggest, with all respect, that the section is badly drawn.  If what the Minister says was intended, then the amendment which I have suggested should be inserted.  It is being resisted now only because the Minister does not want to take the Bill back to the Dáil, and for no other reason.</P>

It is true the section covers other people.  It covers people to whom the local authority has let houses.  Sub-section (2) is a composite section designed to cover people who are already tenants of houses and who, being tenants of houses, wilfully&mdash;the word &ldquo;wilfully&rdquo; comes in there&mdash; neglect or refuse to furnish information which is necessary and which the local authority require for the purpose of enabling them to determine the rent which shall be payable by a person to whom they have let a house.

      <P>This section provides that the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and subject to regulations made under this section make, out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas, to any person erecting or reconstructing or to any public utility society erecting, one or more than one house, a grant.  The point I want to make is, why is it necessary to give a private individual power to erect more than one house inasmuch as the house he erects has to be for his own occupation?  He has no right to get a grant unless he occupies the house.  Why is it necessary to give a person power to erect more than one house?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise this question: When grants are made to utility societies under this section, I would be anxious to know what steps are taken by the Minister&mdash;or shall I have to go to the Minister for Finance to find out what steps are being taken? &mdash;to ensure that the amount of the assistance granted by the State is <Col N="2053" /> passed on to the individual who gets the house built?  I am speaking with a fair amount of personal experience of what has been happening in Dublin. I have seen public utility societies formed ostensibly for the purpose of enabling a number of people requiring houses to come together to form themselves into a body which, under a provision of this kind, can get State money to enable them to provide their own houses at the minimum cost.  What actually happens is that the ordinary member of the society has no influence whatever over the society and has no authority to determine how the money provided by the State, or by the local authority, will be utilised by the people managing the society.  The result, in one case that I have knowledge of, is that the people running the society were able to charge members of the society for whom houses were built £150, and in some cases, £250, more than the houses cost, so that in a few years the society became so wealthy and had accumulated so much money that it decided to form itself into a public liability company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, that is a well-known fact.  I suggest it is not an isolated case.  I am speaking of it because I know all about it.  I happen to know that the society was making anything up to £300 profit on the houses provided for its own members.  The fact of the matter is that a person wants a house and joins a society.  He takes out a £5 share, and puts the rest of the money down in loan stock.  That loan stock is cancelled when he gets the house.  It disappears.  What we are doing under this Bill is, we are authorising the payment from public funds of very large sums of money ostensibly for the purpose of reducing the cost of houses, but, in fact, for a totally different purpose, because it will not have the effect of reducing the price of the house.  It will have the effect of enabling a group of people to form a society and to keep under their own control very large sums of money as they have done in the past.  I think some safeguard should be inserted in the Bill to protect the public funds from misuse of this kind.  I do not <Col N="2054" /> know whether the Minister has adverted to what has happened in the past.  There must be records in his Department&mdash;I know there are such records in his Department&mdash;of a complete disregard for the intentions of the Oireachtas when legislation of this kind is being passed.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether I am to take it, from what Senator Duffy has said, that in general he regards these public utility societies as performing no service for their members, and that, therefore, he wishes them to be discouraged, because I think he cannot ground his argument against the section merely upon his experience of one society.</P>

      <P>I take it that if the Senator is suggesting that, in general, public utility societies are not operating in the interests of their members, then he must be making a case against the section.  The Senator, I think, is trying to put upon the Oireachtas the responsibility of doing for the members what the members of the society should do for themselves.  After all, they are the people who constitute it, and they have certain rights under their rules. They take shares, I gather, in the society, and they share in the profits. Is that not so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator said that he was aware of a certain case. I am not aware of that case.  It has not been brought to my attention, and I do not think it was brought to the attention of any of my predecessors. I take it that it was not a case which the Senator thought should be investigated either by my predecessor or by myself.  I am concerned with the manner in which these societies, in general, work and I am told that, as an almost invariable rule, they work very satisfactorily, particularly in the country districts where they have carried out a great many housing propositions <Col N="2055" /> to the full satisfaction of their members, and without any excessive profits being made by anybody. The Senator seems to be aware of cases where these conditions do not obtain.  If they do, I think it must have been with the connivance and consent of the members.</P>
      <P>I understand that, as far as public utility societies are concerned, when a person becomes a member he can take shares up to a very substantial amount, and on the basis of his shareholding is entitled to participate in the profits of the society.  If a person feels that it would be much more to his advantage to take a comparatively small share in the society, and to waive his right to participate in the profits, then I do not see what grumble he has against the society if it fulfils its main function which is to provide houses for its members, let us say, in general at a cost which would be lower than that at which they would be able to provide houses for themselves by their own unaided and non-co-operative effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in a difficulty in appreciating what Senator Duffy's exact position is. I asked him at the outset why he was opposed to public utility societies in general, and whether he thought they should not be encouraged.  If that is his attitude, then I assume that he feels that we should not have provided them with a slightly larger grant than we are prepared to pay to private persons erecting houses for their own occupation. I think the Senator would be wrong in that.  Let us start with the assumption that we wish public utility societies to provide houses at the lowest possible cost to their members, I take it, and I am told that in general they do.  It is only with the generality of cases that I am concerned in putting through a measure of this sort.  I would be concerned to ensure, in the administration of the measure, that the provisions of the Act in relation to public utility societies are not abused. That is not the point which arises here on the section and on the Schedule. If, therefore, I take it that the public utility societies in general do function as they are intended to function, that is to say, to try to provide houses for <Col N="2056" /> their members at the lowest possible cost, and to try to facilitate their members in dealing with architects, builders and other technical persons with whom the ordinary private individual would have to deal, then I think there is not anything to be said against the terms of the Schedule which, as I have said, will give a grant of £10 per house built to cover what would be the ordinary administrative expenses of the society, including in the first place, the ordinary cost of entering into an arrangement with an architect and builder and, secondly, of ensuring that the houses are being properly supervised during the period of construction. That is the purpose of the grant. I think it is justifiable, and I am therefore prepared to defend giving to public utility societies a greater grant than we give to the private individual.  That is the only point which properly arises on the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, I am an enthusiastic supporter of the idea of public utility societies.  I took some part in the formation of a public utility society and I had great expectations that it would serve a class in the community who could look nowhere else for assistance in providing themselves with houses.  What I was dealing with here was the desire which I know is felt by many people that, in encouraging utility societies, we should be careful to ensure that the financial aid accorded to them under this Bill will be passed on to the individual members of the society and will not disappear down some boreen <i>en route.</i> I said earlier that what can happen, and what to my knowledge has happened, is that four, five, six or ten people come together and form a public utility society.  They put up a certain amount of money.  The maximum holding which any individual shareholder can have is £200, that is, £200 of share capital, but he can have an unlimited amount of loan stock.  In the case I have in mind, no dividend whatever was paid on either loan stock or share capital, and yet the society in a couple of years accumulated £16,000, and then proceeded to build on a gigantic scale for sale to anybody, members or not.  So far as I can recall, <Col N="2057" /> its capital eventually reached something like £100,000.  In other words, £100,000 accumulated out of its building activities, and it then became a public company.</P>
      <P>The point I am making and which the Minister has not clearly grasped is that, if this Bill is to provide public funds for a utility society, in order that that society may enable its members to obtain their own houses at the minimum cost, we should take some precaution to ensure that the money in fact serves that purpose.  It does not serve that purpose if the house is going to cost as much when built by a utility society as when built by the speculative builder who is living, and living well, out of the profits he can make as a builder.  That is what has happened. I remember an official in the Minister's Department telling me that he believed that certain utility societies, or at least the people running them, were making a net profit of £300 per house for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will remind us about the obligation on the members to control a society.  I want to point out that normally a member comes in and takes a few shares in the utility society.  He becomes a shareholder and puts into the society say £100, £150 or £250 in the form of loan stock and the society then proceeds to build his house.  When the house is completed, the key is handed to the member, and his loan stock, of course, is cancelled.  His share capital cannot be cancelled, but that is infinitesimal&mdash;it may be a couple of pounds&mdash;and the member concerned goes to the local authority or to an insurance company and gets the balance of the money to pay for his house.  If from the local authority, the money is advanced under the Small Dwellings Act, and if from an insurance company or other finance corporation, it is advanced under certain safeguards provided by the lender.  The house then becomes the property of the member of the society for whom it is built and his interest in the society ceases.  It ceases to the extent that he is prepared to sell his shares to somebody else&mdash;the shares he holds in the share capital of the society&mdash;and that person, having bought the shares, comes along, puts <Col N="2058" /> up loan stock and gets another house, and the same process is gone through again.  In the long run, two, three, four, five, six and, at most, ten people, who may in fact be the officials of the society&mdash;its architect, quantity surveyor, solicitor, chairman and secretary &mdash;are the society and nobody interferes with what they do.  Nobody is concerned with anything about the society except to get a house.</P>
    <P>The Minister will argue that we cannot correct all these defects in human nature.  I agree, but it is a rather novel argument from a Minister of State.  It is not the usual argument we hear from the Minister for Finance or from the Minister for Local Government. When we ask for something else, we are always reminded of the duty which is placed on a Minister of State to safeguard public funds.  He must have auditors, inspectors and all kinds of safeguards to ensure that not a penny is misapplied and not a penny lost.  It is, therefore, a surprise to me to listen to the Minister telling us here that the safeguarding of the money we vote is not the function of this House or the Minister's Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is the position and let us face it clearly&mdash; we are abandoning our functions, transferring them over to individuals who have no interest as such in protecting public funds.  They have one interest only&mdash;the interest of a person who wants a house.  It is a most deplorable situation that we should be asked to pass this section in this form without any guarantee that the money we provide will be used in the interests of the person who gets the house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been a member of a utility society for about 15 years and I know just as much as Senator Duffy about the working of these societies. I will say this, that the extra grant given by this House and by the Dáil, £10, to the society of which I am a member, to the extent of £8 10s. 0d., has been paid to the individual whose house has been built.  That means that 30/- covers the complete expenses, and that is all that is deducted.  Senator Duffy talks about the particular case he has in mind, but I am giving here the other side of it which is within my own knowledge and which has been going on for the past 15 years.  What we are concerned with is that the moneys voted here by way of grants to utility societies should be properly expended.  I would remind the House that there is a statutory obligation enforced on utility societies to have their accounts audited every year. Many of us who are in such societies do a very considerable amount of work, for no return at all.  In the event of grants being misapplied, the public auditor will draw attention to it.  Mind you, not every auditor is competent to audit those accounts.  In addition to being fully qualified, he must be appointed by the Department of Industry and Commerce as a public auditor.  There are only 70 of such auditors in the country and the number is kept at that.  If there is any misapplication of the moneys voted here and transferred by way of housing grants to utility societies, the auditor at the end of the year will very properly draw attention to it.  The former grant was £70 or £80, and it is now about £250, a very much greater sum, so the £10 is a very much smaller percentage of the total amount than it was previously.  It would be utterly wrong to allow it to go from this House that there could be any misapplication of the moneys voted here by way of grants and that there is no proper check.  There is a proper check and Senator Duffy should be fully aware of it and might have drawn attention to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement made now by Senator Hearne paints the other side of the picture, but I do not want <Col N="2060" /> the House to go away with the idea that these safeguards he speaks of give all the grounds for complacency he seems to suggest.  The rules of a utility society, to my knowledge, contained a provision that the members of the committee could not vote themselves or any member of the committee any money except for special duties, the intention being that if a man had to travel on behalf of the society his out of pocket expenses and subsistence allowance would be paid, or if he performed any duty in connection with a loan he would get his expenses and probably commission. Notwithstanding that rule, I know that members of the committee voted themselves £150 each and the &ldquo;special duties&rdquo; they had assigned were &ldquo;attending meetings of the society&rdquo;.  I was concerned with the society and I challenged the right of the members to vote this money.  They attended 12 meetings in the year and voted themselves £150 each for those attendances.  The auditors, as far as I know, have never challenged that during the past 15 or 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point raised by Senator Duffy.  We are dealing with the grants made available to utility societies for the erection of houses, to ensure that they will be passed on to the members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not.  The members can buy shares or subscribe for loan instalments.  I know nothing about the particular case Senator Duffy has in mind.  Apparently it applies to a building society in Dublin. The utility societies in rural areas fulfil an entirely different function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making any allegation against societies.  I am stating that we are voting £250 to a utility society to enable it to provide one of its own members with a house at approximately £250 less cost than if there were no grant; and believing that it is a non-profit-making source there should be another substantial cut if the profits of the speculative builder were cut out. The point I am making is that these conditions are not passed among the <Col N="2061" /> members in all cases and that a society, in one particular case, was able to make sufficient profit, notwithstanding their own rules, to enable them to pay this £150 a year, making £900 in all. It was a society in a small way of business, though it flourished after that and there was very much more to spend after two or three years than a mere £900.  As long as that can happen, there is something wrong with the legislation, there is a gap somewhere and I want it closed.  I am making no allegation against societies to which the Senator refers.  I have no doubt that there are large numbers of them, particularly in small towns and rural areas, that have done great service and have enabled people to get houses who could not have got them otherwise.  I accept all that and I am merely concerned now with pointing out that, if the State provides money for the purpose of enabling citizens in a particular form of organisation to get houses at a reasonable price, there is a duty imposed on us to see that the money is not running down some drain <i>en route.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Senator Duffy's warning is very good and I would ask the Minister to take note of it in making his regulations.  It is subject to regulations that this money will be granted, and it is very important that every provision be put into the regulations to ensure, first of all, that the money will be spent on the houses and, secondly, in the case of a utility society, that the member to whom the house will be given will get the benefit of all these grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a later section, where grants are given for houses erected by the utility societies for the working classes, I see the Minister has power to provide that the grant will be given only in the event of their agreeing to a particular rent being fixed on the occupier.  This is left out of Section 16, but I hope the Minister will be able in some way to make regulations to provide for that. It will be very hard to draft the regulations as, after all, you do provide that, if the grant is given to a particular person, that person will reside in the house.  But once he resides for a short time, what is to prevent him <Col N="2062" /> from selling it and getting the benefit in cash of his erection of the house? Also, in the case of a utility society, there is nothing to prevent the fixing of rents that would be too high for that member.  As Senator Duffy points out, he may not get the benefit in that way. The Minister will have to draft the regulations very carefully and I am sure he will do that before he gives any grant.</P>

      <P>What Senator Duffy says comes as news to me.  I think this is all wrong, if what he says is right and if individuals who already possess houses, well-to-do people, can by means of a public utility society get a house and then sell it at the maximum market price.  It is all entirely wrong that such a society should get a grant.  The Minister apparently seems to say that nothing of that kind comes to his notice.  But Senator Duffy is speaking with personal knowledge and I do think that there is an obligation on the Minister to see that such abuses as Senator Duffy has indicated do not happen.</P>

      <P>It is important to consider to what extent Senator Duffy has telescoped the facts when he was presenting them here.  My recollection is&mdash;and I am subject to correction&mdash;that Senator Duffy states that public utility societies after two or three years found themselves in possession of sufficient funds to build houses not for their members but for sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That was later.  It started as a public utility society, building houses for its members and got grants, and the promoters were able, I gather, to make profits which they did not divide among their members.  They also financed this society by taking out loan stock.  I gather that that also happened, and I think that the Senator said that they <Col N="2063" /> did not even draw the ordinary interest on the loan stock.  Over a period of years they accumulated funds and entered ordinary business as speculative builders, building houses for sale and not for their own members. I may be wrong, but I understand that the society continued to amass funds and subsequently converted themselves into an ordinary public company.  That is what I understood the Senator to say was the history of public utility societies.  If I am correct, and if my account of the history of the public society is correct, I do not see such grave abuses as Senator Duffy said were attaching to the public utility society.  Members of the public utility society instead of conserving their funds and finances might have taken the profits out and distributed them; they might have drawn the interest on the loan stock.  They might have withdrawn their money and used it in another way, but they started a business quite independently of the ordinary purposes of a public utility society and in relation to that business they got no grant at all.  I think that fact is of at least sufficient importance to be brought out.  If they were building houses as ordinary speculative builders for sale to persons other than the members of the society they got no grant.</P>

      <P>We should be careful and that is why I am sorry that we did not have fuller information before this debate started.  They got no grant and Senator Duffy's answer is to ride off on another side track.  They got a trade loan; any person or any individual can get a trade loan.  In regard to the facts, this building society was running two businesses.  It was running the business of building for its own members and as a side line it was running a business of speculative building for which it got a trade loan, and therefore we may assume that having got a trade loan for the business of speculative building it was being financed by the trade loan and not, as Senator Duffy suggested at the beginning, out of the profits of the society.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2064" /> I do not want to spend any more time on this question as we spent a long time on the section&mdash;in fact we spent too long on the section.  Bearing in mind that Senator Duffy has already very strongly indicated to the Seanad his views on public utility societies, unless we are going to have a proposal that grants to public utility societies should not be given at all, that such grants should be abolished, it is not necessary to hold up the House any longer on this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am going to say this; I am going to draw attention to another aspect of the section.  I take it, Sir, from the definitions in the section that money is provided for an ordinary person, apart from public utility societies, who erects or reconstructs a house and I take it that he would get that grant if the house is sold, if he sells it to some other individual.  I want to draw attention to a practice which exists particularly in Dublin where particular people who are selling houses require the purchaser to insure the property with a particular insurance company, maybe an English company, and to do the transactions through certain <Col N="2065" /> firms of solicitors.  Is that going to be permitted in relation to houses erected by the aid of State grants?  The Minister may say: &ldquo;I have no say in this matter.  I cannot stop it; there must be freedom.&rdquo;  Very well, we will then know how we stand, but I am drawing attention to what I conceive to be a great scandal, to this practice where I have a document drawn up for me, if I am going to buy a house, specifying a number of matters, one of them being that I must insure the house and maintain the insurance with a particular insurance company.  This practice also obtains in certain cases where a firm of solicitors may be the agents for the estate.  In the case of certain estates the person who gets the house is tied hand and foot with agents and solicitors and I am informed that in some cases the fees demanded are outrageous.</P>

      <P>I do not know.  One of the criticisms levelled at the Government is that we are alleged to tie things up in red tape.  If we were to bring in a section providing one or two things&mdash;you must go to certain solicitors because they would not be tied up with the estate, or you must not go to certain solicitors because they might be tied up with the estate; or you must not buy from a certain company, or you must buy from a certain company&mdash;how does the Senator think that this or any other legislative assembly could draft legislation ensuring that, if you like, enterprising people, who can see opportunities of getting rich out of legislation, are not going to take advantage of it?  A person who acquires land which is developed for building purposes needs an assortment of other people who can render specialised services and all must be paid highly.  It is an undesirable sort of thing which arises out of the development of building, but will the Senator tell us how it is to be changed without introducing more red tape?</P>

      <P>The Minister has not answered the point I originally raised on the section, namely, the apparent inconsistency between taking power to give a grant to a person to erect more than one house and yet confining a grant to a house occupied by a person.  Why give a person power to get grants for more houses than one when there is a condition of occupancy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is an omnibus clause drafted by the draftsman in the most convenient and succinct form he possibly could.  It is intended to give the Minister power to do certain things subject to regulations.  Normally the intention is that a person will erect only one house for his occupation and this will be covered in the regulations.  I suppose the expectation is that public utility societies will erect more than one house.  It would not be reasonable for a number of people to form themselves into a public utility society and confine themselves to the erection of one house. Therefore, a clause must cover the position of a person who will erect a house for a member of a public utility society who is a private individual. That is why we say &ldquo;one house&rdquo;.  It must cover the position of a person who will erect one house.  The public utility society will erect houses for its members, and the clause must, therefore, cover the position of public utility societies.  That is why we have &ldquo;more than one house&rdquo;.  The whole <Col N="2067" /> of sub-section (1) is covered by the general clause that all this will be done subject to regulation.  In the regulation the Minister can make it quite clear that a person will be allowed to build only one house for his own occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am anticipating legislation but I should like to know how occupation is ensured. We are entitled to know how the regulation is going to operate.  I can understand that at first a person will be held by occupation.  One cannot, however, reasonably hold a person to occupation for more than a short period because he might get out of work and be offered a job in some other part of the country, in which case the house would no longer be of use to him.  Will he then be allowed&mdash;as he should be&mdash;to sell the house on the open market?  How does the Minister anticipate these regulations?  How is he going to see justice done and, at the same time, how is he going to prevent abuse? There is always the danger in any State control that it will fail to make intelligent exceptions.  Any individual can do so but State machinery invariably fails on the question of making human and intelligent exceptions.  I am entitled to an answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, I think, is entitled to assume that Senator Sir John Keane is familiar with the terms of the existing Housing Acts. They contain precisely this provision in almost identical terms.  I have in mind the Act of 1932 and earlier Acts.  This is nothing novel.  I assumed Senator Sir John Keane would not have required a detailed explanation of every word and clause and phrase in this section.  It is quite true that a person could, I suppose, build a house here ostensibly for his own occupation and proceed later to sell it if he were allowed to do so without any sort of restriction.  That is not the position. The person who applies for this grant must first of all have the lease of the site and, if the house is built, he must be in occupation before he gets his grant.  It is possible that when he goes into occupation he may wish to sell it <Col N="2068" /> some time afterwards.  As long as that practice does not become so general that it constitutes an abuse of the Act I would be reluctant to fetter a man's right to sell his house.  As Senator Sir John Keane himself has pointed out, dire necessity might arise which would force him to do so.  If he were a person, say, in the employment of a public utility undertaking, or even a civil servant in the employment of the State, he might be transferred from Dublin to somewhere else and he might possibly have to purchase a house for himself in his new place of residence. Therefore unless it was quite clear that the right to sell were being used as a device to bring a person within the terms of this section and the Schedule I would be slow to fetter it.  We would, however, have the power under the regulations to impose certain reasonable restrictions upon the right to sell a house which had been the subject of a grant under this section.  No doubt, as I have said, reasonable restrictions would be imposed if it were seen that there was a general need.  There is no use in the State's using a steam hammer to crack a nut.  There is no use in setting all the apparatus of the law in motion to catch the odd person who might, without any reason beyond that of making an exceptional profit in exceptional circumstances, try to sell a house which had been the subject of a grant given under this section.</P>

I understand also that the town commissioners <Col N="2069" /> or urban council or borough &mdash;a borough that is not a county borough&mdash;cannot make a grant either if the house to be erected is situated in such a town.  I refer to the county health area which excludes a town.  I want to know if that is correct.</P>
      <P>Section 19 does not apply to an urban district or to a town having a town commissioner and, therefore, in such cases no grant can be made under this section.

      <P>I seek information under Section 26.  There is a limit of £3,550,000 to the total amount of grants-in-aid&mdash;I speak now subject to correction&mdash;that can be made under previous Acts and including this Act. Would the Minister give us some indication as to how much has already been paid out or is earmarked for grants already made for houses already built?  I am not quite clear either as to what sub-section (2) means.  The limitation there is £580,000.  Is this a separate amount in addition to the £3,550,000?</P>

      <P>I am not clear as to what actual services that £580,000 is being allocated for as distinct from the £3,550,000.  I raise this point not with any intention of suggesting a further restriction in financial parsimony but rather with the intention and the belief that enough money is not being spent on housing.  I do not want to widen the debate unduly but it seems to me somewhat anomalous that we should envisage an expenditure of £10,000,000 on health services while we are prepared to spend a comparatively small sum on housing.  Health and housing are very closely allied and housing has a greater bearing on health than have other social services.  Is the Minister satisfied with these limitations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the best way to explain these financial provisions is to say that sub-section (1) should be taken as relating to all the services covered by the Act of 1932 and the £3,500,000 will be slightly more than sufficient to provide for all the applications under the Act of 1932 pending the final winding-up of these grants. Sub-section (2) provides that the duration of this Bill is for a limited period to the 1st April, 1950.  One cannot say whether the sum is sufficient or excessive.  If our hopes are realised and we get a freer supply of labour and materials than we are getting at the moment it will be insufficient.  In that event we can then bring in a small amending Act to increase the amount provided under sub-section (2).  That has been the common practice in all Housing Acts&mdash;to enlarge the limit as <Col N="2071" /> one goes along and as circumstances permit.  From the financial point of view, there is no intrinsic merit in making an excessive provision designed to cover a situation years hence&mdash;a situation which, in fact, may never arise.  While there is a global figure here of £580,000, that may be analysed and allocated as between the various sections.  The figures are, of course, merely estimates and one cannot know at this stage to what extent they will be realised.</P>
      <P>The only thing that is certain is that they do not represent what might be described as water-tight allocations as between one section and another.  We anticipate, however, that owner-occupiers and public utility societies building for members will absorb about £250,000; public utility societies building for letting will absorb about £100,000; persons building for letting perhaps £20,000, £25,000 or £30,000; reconstruction grants and grants for repairs in urban areas, £100,000 to £105,000, and the retrospective portion of certain grants will probably require £100,000.  These are the estimates which we have made, but the Senator will realise that they are only estimates and are made in circumstances which are not quite normal.  We are not, therefore, in a position to give any further figure than that which we have given.</P>

      <P>I am not satisfied with the tenor of the Minister's reply in relation to the circumstances under which this Act will be administered. This Act will be administered under all the rigidity of Government regulations. We all know that things move <Col N="2072" /> very slowly under Government regulation. All kinds of difficulties continually crop up.  Business is not done with the speed of ordinary private enterprise.

      <P>I am afraid the situation will again arise where the Government will say that it has only got financial authority for a certain limited sum and prospective builders will have to wait until there is fresh legislation.  In certain cases legislation can be fairly prompt&mdash;in other cases it is painfully slow.  I want to see no restriction of any kind put on the speed at which building is carried on.  If possible I want to see the rapid methods of private enterprise being introduced in local authority work.  I am afraid that I am asking for more than I will ever get.  Do not, however, create a position in which, owing to inadequate finance, the thing will be held up.  Once applications come in from <i>bona fide</i> sources there should be no restrictions whatever.  This matter is vitally important to the moral welfare, to the health and to the general interests of the community.  I am afraid it will be held up again by Government restrictions and by the very small sums allocated.  After all, they are very small sums.  The Minister mentioned the sum of £20,000 for houses to let.  That is a mere flea-bite and I can see that being gone in no time.  The Minister said that these grants are not segregated separately. Knowing something about the slow deliberate methods of local authority procedure, I believe that the thing will be held up through want of finance, especially as the larger part of it is money to cover past expenditure.  There are only half a million pounds to cover all these increased new grants.  To my mind, it is totally inadequate and a disservice to the welfare of the country and the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is under a complete misapprehension. <Col N="2073" /> First of all, it is not true to say that the local authorities are held up in any way in proceeding with housing schemes by reason either of the inability of the Department of Local Government to deal with them or for want of money.  In fact, except in relation to the special class of houses covered by Section 27, the local authorities are not dealt with in this Bill at all.  As I was careful to emphasise on the Second Reading Stage, the Bill relates only to houses built by private persons for their own occupation or by public utility societies.  So far as local authorities are concerned, therefore, they are not being held up.  It is quite true that we have asked them to step up to the fullest extent they possibly can, and they are taking all the building materials they can get.  It requires, however, not only materials but men to build houses and contractors who are prepared to undertake the responsibility and the obligation of building.  The shortage of men rather than anything else and, up to the present, the uncertainty in regard to the supply of materials have been the principal reasons why the local authorities' housing programmes have been slow to get under way.  So far as the sum mentioned in this Bill is concerned, I think it is a considerable sum.  I am perfectly certain that, when the Minister for Finance comes here with his Appropriation Bill, Senator Sir John Keane will also think that it is a quite considerable sum.  It is not merely a considerable sum but, as I have said, it does not represent the last word.  If things go more rapidly than we anticipate at the moment, then no doubt we shall have additional financial provision made.</P>
      <P>There is one point on which I should like to correct the Senator.  I mentioned a sum of £25,000 or £30,000 for persons building houses for letting. That only represents the amount necessary to cover two instalments.  If the Senator will turn to the Fourth Schedule, he will see that these grants are being paid in instalments spread over a ten years' period, and that sum in fact only represents about one-fifth of the total amount.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to explain exactly how these houses for special classes differ from what we call ordinary corporation houses or why the need could not have been met by making the corporation set aside a certain number of their houses for these special classes which I think are most deserving.  I think the idea is a good one but I do not quite see the object of doing it in a different way&mdash;doing it by means of grants instead of through the ordinary machinery of local authority housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There are perhaps three reasons why it was decided that this was the best way to proceed to deal with this problem.  First of all, the housing authorities in most of the county boroughs and large towns have a particularly acute problem to solve in dealing with slum areas and congested areas in their districts and they have set up a special section in their organisation for dealing with this, which works in a rather specialised way.  All the grants which have been appropriated heretofore under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts for that special purpose have proceeded on the assumption that none of the tenants of ordinary corporation houses could afford to pay an economic rent.  The houses are built more or less on approved and standardised plans for the accommodation of families where the segregation of the sexes is required. There is such a very long waiting list of persons with large families, persons coming within the special class of families where one or more of the members may be suffering from tuberculosis, families which have been living in condemned houses and so on, that it would have been, I think, unjust to have disregarded their particular claims under the existing provisions of the Housing Acts and have required the corporation to set aside houses which as I have said <Col N="2075" /> are primarily designed to accommodate families of five, six or seven where the segregation of the sexes is required and where the assumption is that those who are going to live in them cannot afford to pay an economic rent.</P>
      <P>In the case of young married couples, I think we can assume that at the outset at any rate, provided the man is in reasonably constant employment, provided he has such a job as would justify him, in prudence, in marrying, the question of providing a house at a rent less than the economic rent does not in general arise.  Therefore some of the houses will not be subsidised at all and, in cases where a subsidy is given, it will not be on anything like the same scale as is given in the case of ordinary houses built under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.</P>
      <P>Secondly the houses need not be so large.  They are built primarily for young people with no children.  It is not felt that it is necessary, in present circumstances particularly, to provide these people with large houses which might be more than a woman with a young family or a baby to look after, could comfortably manage.  Apart altogether from that, the supply of building materials being restricted, we have got to try to reduce the demand on the common pool of building materials and labour.</P>
      <P>The next point is that these houses are designed for young people entering on married life and it was felt perhaps that we should, if we could, having due regard to the other considerations, such as the burden which might be imposed on the State in relation to subsidies and the burden which might be placed on tenants in regard to non-subsidised houses, design them on the most modern lines&mdash;that is to say that they would be provided with first-class kitchens, first-class bathrooms and generally with the amenities which attach to very good houses and which would enable these houses to be conveniently, easily and economically run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact the idea was to give these people starting married life every possible support we could while at the same time not relieving them unduly&mdash; in fact not relieving them at all in some <Col N="2076" /> cases&mdash;of the ordinary obligations and responsibilities which attach to the foundation of a family and which should normally belong to the head of the family.  For that reason we decided these houses should be special class houses.  Another way in which they differ from the ordinary houses is that the Minister takes power under this section to require these houses to be constructed.  He proposes that the general planning and design of the houses should set a higher standard than we have been able to adopt in relation to houses which have been built under the various Housing Acts.</P>
    <P>These are three or four of the reasons which determined us to proceed in this way.  It is a highly experimental approach to this problem.  I do not know whether it will be successful.  We are trying to break new ground.  The scheme has some advantages.  It will be a good thing if we can get people entering on married life to assume the responsibility of paying an economic rent, and of not being under any definite obligation to the community. If they can stand on their own feet, that creates a good psychological approach on their part to future problems. Next, you can have a reasonably expeditious turnover on these houses. They are small; they are not intended to be the last habitation of these families; they are houses in which we hope they will be able to adjust themselves to the various problems of married life.</P>
    <P>This will give them an opportunity, when they can get a house, of marrying earlier than they otherwise might and starting life in a decent home in good surroundings.  It will give them five years in which they can find alternative accommodation.  At the end of five years we hope that they will be in a position to pay an economic rent for a house provided under the ordinary Housing Acts, and indeed that those who are in a better position at the end of that period may be able to provide themselves with accommodation independently of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The general idea is to make it possible for people, who normally could afford to marry but who cannot get a house, to marry.  We are also trying <Col N="2077" /> to cater for a second class of person, the person who, while not able to pay the full economic rent of a house such as we have in mind, will nevertheless be able to pay a substantial rent, a rent perhaps higher than the generality of those who occupy local authority houses can afford to pay or are called upon to pay.</P>
    <P>These are the general principles upon which we proceeded.  The houses will contain two bedrooms and we hope we will be able to provide them with modern up-to-date kitchens, bathrooms and the other amenities that attach to a good house.  We hope they will become model homes.  That is the general theory upon which we proceeded.</P>
    <P>The houses will be of two classes. There will be a Class A house which we anticipate will let at about 30/- or thereabouts per week&mdash;perhaps a little more or less.  That will depend on the cost of the house, but that type of house will be let at an economic rent. Then there will be the Class B house which will be let at about 20/- per week.  It is not intended that these houses should be occupied by the same tenants for a period longer than five years.  At the end of that period we think those people should either be provided for by the local authority with a house built under the Housing Acts or be able to secure alternative accommodation themselves.</P>
    <P>This plan will be run for at least five years and if it is successful and justifies itself it will probably be continued.  I should like to emphasise that this is an entirely experimental approach to the problem.  We do not know whether it will work out successfully, but we hope it will.  If it does, it will meet what is a very crying need in our cities and larger towns.</P>

      <P>I am very interested in this section.  The Minister referred to the special classes whose needs are to be considered.  I would like to mention other classes of the community whose needs ought to be considered, people like school inspectors and inspectors of taxes who have to be moved from time to time; they are left scarcely more than five years in any place.  There are about 14 or 15 <Col N="2078" /> people of that type in Galway and they have been separated from their families for four or five years.  It ought to be possible under some Housing Act or scheme to provide houses for that class of person.  I think the Government should do that.  Those people do not come under this type of housing scheme and I would like the Minister to consider their position.</P>

      <P>I have listened carefully to what the Minister has said and I think this is a very commendable experiment.  As I understand it, the local authority will build and own the houses and there will be no subsidy except a grant attaching to the houses. There will be an attempt made to get an economic rent.  There must be somebody to choose the tenants and deal with the conditions of occupation and that is the reason the housing authority is entrusted with that duty.</P>
      <P>I foresee considerable difficulty in getting people to leave these houses. If they have large families that overflow the two rooms, that will be all right, but, if they have small families, I believe there will be considerable difficulty in getting them out.  I do not know if the Minister is satisfied that he will be able to get them out.  I hope the houses under this scheme will be given a high priority because I know many people will be pressing their claims for them.</P>

      <P>May I draw attention to the provisions of sub-section (4) of this section?  It provides that money borrowed under this section shall not be reckoned as part of the total debt of a <Col N="2080" /> council of a county for the purpose of the Adaptation of Enactments Act. That question arises very frequently, particularly in Bills brought in by the Minister for Local Government, and I have been wondering what is the purpose of maintaining in force the Adaptation of Enactments Act, or these provisions of the Adaptation of Enactments Act, in view of the fact that almost every Bill which the Minister introduces and which provides for the expenditure of money exempts the moneys raised under that Bill from the provisions of the Adaptation of Enactments Act.  My recollection is that the provision referred to here limits the borrowing power of a local authority to something like twice its rating powers. There is a provision by which borrowing power is limited by the power of the local authority to raise rates and the sum of the rates so raised.  The provision concerned may have had some validity in the beginning.  It appears to have no validity now and is in fact worthless so long as a Minister can insert in every one of these Bills referring to housing, sanitation, public health a provision saying that the money raised under the particular Bill will not be taken into account when calculating the amount that may be borrowed under the Adaptation of Enactments Act.  My suggestion is that that provision of the Adaptation of Enactments Act should go.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 41 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw attention to the fact that Section 201 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, makes certain provisions in relation to the placing of contracts.  The provisions are divided into two parts.  First, there is a provision in relation to contracts the amount of which does not exceed £50.  There is a further provision in relation to contracts the amount of which exceeds £100.  In regard to the first part, Section 201 requires that every such contract made by a local authority shall be in writing and shall be sealed with the common seal of the authority.  Secondly, it provides that every such contract shall specify the work, materials, matters or things to be furnished, had or done and the price to be paid and the time of times within which the contract is to be performed.  A third provision, relating also to similar contracts, provides that an estimate shall be obtained in writing of the probable expense of executing the work, and so on.</P>
      <P>In regard to contracts the amount of which exceeds £100, Section 201, to which I have referred, provides that before the contract is entered into there shall be an advertisement&mdash;ten days, in fact, before the contract is made&mdash;and provision is made in regard to the form of the advertisement and the matters to be done following from it.  Lastly, it is provided that every contract entered into by a sanitary authority, in conformity with the provisions of this section and duly executed by the several parties thereto, shall be binding on the authority by whom the seal is executed and their successors, and so on.</P>
      <P>Now we come to Section 41 of this Bill.  This section provides that the Minister may exempt a housing authority from compliance with all or any of these provisions at his discretion, that is to say, so far as the matters concerned are related to the powers of the local authority, and the performance of their duties under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts or the Labourers Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2082" /> We have already discovered that the housing authority referred to here is the county manager or the city manager, as the case may be, and the provision in this section is that the Minister may cancel the whole of the provisions of Section 201 of the Act of 1878 to which I have referred, so that a county manager or city manager is no longer required to advertise a contract, irrespective of its amount, or he is no longer obliged to get quotations or specifications or anything else.  The only safeguard we have is an assurance from the Minister that he will not exercise his powers or that, if they are to be exercised at all, they will be exercised under certain limitations and qualifications.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that by the method adopted here, the method of legislation by reference, we are getting to the stage where both Houses of the Oireachtas will be deprived of any control whatever over the administrative acts of Government Departments or deprived of any power of review over the relations which exist between themselves and permanent officials appointed by the Local Appointments Commission and exercising all the functions of a local authority.  I am personally distressed that this thing should be permitted and, if the members of this House think seriously about the matter, they will agree with me that Section 41 should not be written into this Bill.  If the Minister insists, and if the majority of this House uphold his determination to have this authority conferred upon him, the members of this House can make up their minds that, to all intents and purposes, their continued influence over the legislation that is enacted in this country is of very little account indeed.</P>

      <P>Having listened to several speeches from Senator Duffy on this Bill, I thought that my capacity for surprise had been exhausted, but I find that I was entirely mistaken. This provision is introduced into the Bill on the basis of a recommendation made by the Dublin Housing Inquiry Committee which gave very great weight, indeed, to the case which had been made by the representatives of various trade unions and of the Labour <Col N="2083" /> Party on the corporation to the effect that previous housing schemes undertaken and carried out by direct labour had been rendered uneconomic because of the manner in which the corporation as a public authority had been tied up by the provisions of Section 201 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878.  Among those who gave evidence at that inquiry was L. J. Duffy, Esquire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that no evidence was given on behalf of that Party.  I did not give evidence on behalf of it. I gave evidence in my personal capacity in relation to the manner in which local authorities are rooked by the financial authority from whom they borrow money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what is the precise policy, in relation to housing, of the Party to which Senator Duffy belongs, but I understood that one of the planks in the Labour Party's programme was that the housing authorities ought to be facilitated in the carrying out, by direct labour, of their housing scheme programme.  I may be wrong in that, but I assumed that was one of the fundamentals in the Labour Party's programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But in any event, take it for what it is, people who are commonly regarded as being in a position to express the <Col N="2084" /> views of workers and of the organisations which represent them, urged on the members of the committee of inquiry, that the Dublin Corporation should be allowed to undertake an experimental housing scheme by direct labour under much freer conditions than they had been able to carry out such schemes heretofore.  It is as a direct consequence of that recommendation, that this proposal is embodied in the Bill.  I draw the Senator's attention to the fact that it is a fairly restricted proposal.  The intention of the section, at any rate, is that it will relate only to purchases.  The Senator has pointed out that, under the law as it stands, if a housing authority, like the Dublin Corporation, was carrying out a large scheme, such as the Ellenfield scheme, and wanted to buy more than £100 worth of material they had solemnly to advertise for it and enter into a contract.  They had to go through all these formalities in order to possess themselves of more than £100 worth of material for a scheme probably costing £250,000.</P>
    <P>That is how the direct labour schemes, undertaken by local authorities under laws that now exist, were carried out and I think that is one of the principal reasons why these schemes compared so unfavourably with those undertaken by the ordinary private builder.  The position is, that the housing problem is so acute, and the difficulty of securing contracts has been such, that we have decided, as a matter of general policy, that as long as that situation lasts we are going to urge local authorities to build houses for themselves if they can get anybody to build them, and that, in order that these houses should be built economically, we are going to release them, subject, of course, to conditions, from the terms of Section 201 of the Act of 1878. With that object in view, and bearing in mind that the release is going to be hedged round by conditions which will safeguard it against abuse I do not see why Senator Duffy should have felt called upon to put down this amendment. As I have said, I thought that my capacity for surprise had been exhausted, but when I saw this amendment I rubbed my eyes and said: &ldquo;Surely, that is not the same Senator <Col N="2085" /> who functions outside drafting programmes for the Labour Party in which he urges that everything should be socialised either by the State or by the local authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether anybody in this House feels happy about the reply to which we have just listened.  It seems to me that it contains more ballyhoo and more dodging of the real issues than any pronouncement that I have ever listened to, and I have heard some foolish ones.  The Minister starts off by drawing attention to a report which was prepared by the Dublin Housing Committee.  May I say, in passing, that the report refers only to Dublin?  That committee of inquiry was concerned with Dublin, only, and the report takes no account of conditions in rural Ireland.  It makes no record of the conditions outside of Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Minister has interpolated the view that I gave evidence in support of this proposal.  Actually, I attended before the committee in a personal capacity.  I made it perfectly clear that I was there in my personal capacity. I suggested to the committee that, if housing were to be done rapidly and on such a basis as to enable the ordinary workman to occupy a house in Dublin, then we had to get rid of the racketeering that went on in the financial world.  I drew attention to practices elsewhere, the main purport of which was to ensure that the principal item of expenditure involved in rent was not interest.  I take it that if the Minister had been diligent, before referring to this report, in looking up the evidence he would have seen what exactly the witness, to whom he has referred, said.  I do not know whether Mr. James Larkin, the chairman of the Housing Committee of the Dublin Corporation, adverted to this fact at all. There has been no quotation from the evidence to show that he did, but assuming that I gave evidence in support of this section, assuming that Mr. Larkin gave evidence in support of it and assuming that 20 other people gave evidence, is that a good reason for putting this section in the Bill without one word of justification?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2086" /> We are told that the local authorities are held up, are embarrassed, because they have to put their contracts in writing.  The first provision of sub-section (1) of Section 201 of the Act of 1878 says that if the contract is for an amount over £50, it must be in writing. Is that embarrassing, and, if it is, to whom?  It was not considered embarrassing to local authorities while they were doing their own contract work, but it is embarrassing now when officials in close contact with the Minister's Department and subservient to that Department are making these contracts. Under the Act of 1878, if a contract is for an amount exceeding £100, there must be tenders.  Is there anything seriously wrong with that? Is there anything seriously wrong with a requirement that local authorities should advertise their contracts?  It must be remembered that this Bill does not relieve them of the obligation merely in respect of small contracts.  It relieves them of the obligation to advertise all contracts&mdash;even contracts of £50,000&mdash;in relation to housing.</P>
    <P>One of the complaints made by the Minister's Department against the committee of Cork Street Hospital was the failure to advertise certain contracts&mdash;they were being handed around to friends of members of the committee was the allegation&mdash;but now the thing is perfectly all right and something we should feel proud of because it is the county manager or city manager who is being entitled to give out a contract for £50,000 or £100,000 without the obligation to have the contract advertised, or in writing.  If the members of the House feel they can accept that point of view, it seems to me that there is not very much use in discussing the Bill or bothering very much about an amendment because the Minister's attitude is: &ldquo;You have a proposal before you,&rdquo; and he jokes with the House rather than gives any reason why it should be retained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point which I wish to ask the Minister to consider with sympathy.  The administration of this Bill, not being a reserved service, is largely in the hands of the Minister's Department and the departments of the county and city managers.  With the very great increase in corporation housing, there is a great need for using modern methods in relation to rent collection.  Rent collection can be carried out and, I understand, is carried out, largely in a sort of routinist spirit, rather in the fashion of the policeman, and, if my information is correct, the rent collecting service of the Dublin Corporation is largely of that character.  It is, in fact &mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;a vocation which passes from father to son, and so long as the rents are collected punctually, the authority&mdash;in this case, the manager&mdash;considers the rent collectors good and is satisfied; but I can assure the Minister that modern rent collecting has assumed a totally different form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is becoming a very highly skilled social service.  Out of the organisation or the idea originally founded by Octavia Hill has grown the provision of estate managers who go through a considerable training in knowledge of building, social service and all the questions attached to dealing with housing matters.  The modern rent collector is essentially a person, and more often than not a woman, with human sympathies and knowledge of the family circumstances and all that attaches to the family life of the tenants.  In order to get the full social value out of housing and also get the most up-to-date information on social work, it is necessary that it be approached in that spirit of understanding and sympathy, and I hope the Minister will give, and will get the housing authorities to give, a new approach to this question of rent collecting, will inquire into the methods now adopted in relation to these advanced social services, will make rent collecting a great deal more than the mere getting of the pound of flesh <Col N="2088" /> represented by the rent, will make it a human service in which the circumstances of the family will be taken account of and the confidence of the tenants gained by the rent collector, so that generally the best interests of all the tenants will be considered and a complete social service provided through this medium of rent collecting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an instance of a Bill being passed through both Houses without any effort to meet reasonable criticism.  I do not think the Bill was given very much consideration in the Dáil&mdash;it may have&mdash;but it certainly received no consideration at all in this House.  We have spent four hours pointing out to the Minister what some of us conceive to be serious blemishes, but that has made no impression on him.  I suspect that he is influenced by the fact that an election is pending, that Dáil Éireann is in recess, and he desires that Dáil Éireann should not be recalled to consider any amendment which might be made by this House. There is no other explanation for the attitude he has taken.  His arguments were unconvincing; I think many of them were amusing and amused many members of the House.  They certainly did not satisfy any Senator that the criticisms offered in relation to different aspects of the Bill were reasonably or fairly met.  The Minister's best effort was to tell us that, if those defects which we point out are discovered when the Bill is in operation, there will be an amending Bill.  Surely that is one of the most untenable situations the Minister could adopt.  Is it not obvious that the purpose of this House is to consider legislation which comes before it, to examine it carefully and, if the wisdom of the House discovers defects, the machinery of the House should be availed of to amend them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had other experiences of this kind.  We have had other Bills at various times which were criticised because of certain defects which, in our judgment, were revealed by the consideration of the measures in question. Ministers, because they are in a hurry, because they want to get the House adjourned in the summer or before Christmas, will not accept proposals for <Col N="2089" /> amendment, with the result that we take up a daily or evening paper and read of a judge criticising both Houses for slovenly legislation.  The truth of the matter is that the Houses are not responsible except in so far as the members acquiesce in the Minister's attitude.  They are not responsible for the slovenly manner in which legislation is enacted.  On two occasions recently, this has occurred; in one case a Circuit Court judge and in the other a High Court judge.  One of the most competent judges on the High Court Bench criticised vehemently the manner in which certain legislation was passed through these Houses in the last 12 months.  In the case of the Circuit Court judge, the suggestion of the court was that the person who drafted the Bill should be brought before him to explain it.</P>
    <P>I want to make a protest, so far as I am personally concerned, in regard to this attitude towards legislation.  If the legislation is to be effective, if it is to do what the Oireachtas intends it should do, if it is not to bring Parliament into contempt, it should be considered with whatever skill and whatever patience we possess.  That has not been the case in relation to this Bill.  I make that comment, regarding those of us who have been criticising the Bill concerned, so that the world at large may know that we are dissatisfied with the manner in which the Bill has passed through the House.</P>

      <P>The Minister's friends know what a good Bill this is and they are prepared to support it.  The Senator said also that this Bill did not receive very much attention in the other House.  I wish the Senator were sitting in my place during the period when I was piloting the Bill through&mdash;he would know how much attention it received and how keenly it was debated there.  In any event, here are the Dáil Reports for the 26th and 27th November and the greater part of them is occupied with the debate on the Second Stage of the Bill.  Here are the Dáil Reports for the 4th, 10th and 11th December and the greater part of those Reports is taken up with the debates on the Committee Stage of the Bill. So keenly was this Bill discussed and so searchingly was it examined that we recommitted the Bill on the Report Stage in order to permit the consideration of certain amendments which had been formulated as a result of the discussion on the Committee Stage.  Some of these amendments were to meet points of view which had been raised by members of the Opposition, including <Col N="2091" /> members of the Senator's own Party.</P>
      <P>After all, it is playing a little on public credulity to expect the newspaper readers to-morrow morning to believe that a Bill which received so much attention in the other House, which was amended in the other House to meet criticism which had been raised there and also to meet the pleas which had been made there, was passed by either House of the Oireachtas without having received full and due consideration.</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 47, after the word &ldquo;practitioner&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;or a qualified veterinary surgeon&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am not going to occupy much time with this amendment.  In order that the position might be made clear I want to say that representations have been made to me by some veterinary surgeons employed by local authorities who claimed that they are excluded from the provisions of this Bill as far as superannuation for officers is concerned. I am not speaking of Dublin, I am speaking of country areas, and in many of these places I understand that the veterinary surgeon is in much the same position as the dispensary doctor. He is a part-time officer, having a private practice of his own in precisely the same way as a dispensary doctor is a part-time officer with a private practice of his own, the difference being, I understand, that the dispensary doctor is a pensionable officer while the veterinary surgeon is not.  I am not aware of any good reason why he should be excluded, and, therefore, the purpose of this amendment is to bring him in.</P>

      <P>The trouble about this <Col N="2092" /> amendment is that if it were accepted it would mean that we should have to consider the position of quite a number of other part-time officers as well as the fundamental principle in drafting the Bill.  As we have imposed additional burdens on local authorities, particularly in relation to servants of local authorities, we should not at this stage extend the classes of pensionable officers.  For that reason, we have not brought in others who, perhaps, have as good a claim to be brought under the Bill as veterinary surgeons.  I could not accept this amendment at this stage and I think it will have to wait until we see how the Bill will go.  As I said before, this is not the last Bill and probably as a result of the discussions here and in the Dáil an amending Bill will be brought in to deal with a number of small matters which have been raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, in respect of the definition of a permanent servant, I want to be quite certain that the position is properly safeguarded in respect of any persons who served in the Army during the emergency and that that period of service will be taken into account in computations of service.  Of course that was done in most cases, but I came across a case last night where it was not done in respect of a particular branch of the Civil Service, the Customs and Excise Department.  In that case the Minister was not responsible but the fact that I found that a proper regard was not taken in respect of that service makes me wonder whether it is absolutely certain that every claim of a local authority official who joined the Army during the emergency in pursuance of the national call is fully covered and that every class is fully covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was quite appalled last night in respect of this one branch of the Revenue Commissioners to find that everyone was not covered, and having found that in that section of the Department of Finance everyone was not covered, I would like to get an assurance from the Minister that, as <Col N="2093" /> far as he is aware, all servants of local authorities are covered, and the House would like to have this on its records. Any person who served in the Army during the emergency should have that period counted for his pension and any person who came in under the demobilisation plan should, in my view, enter the service at the point where, but for his emergency service in the Army, he would have entered if there had not been a call to the Army.  He should be in a position of being able to take credit with the local authority for the service which he gave to the nation in the time of emergency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point which I should like to raise on the section.  It will be observed that on page five the expression &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; is extended to include certain bodies covered by the Local Government Acts, 1925 to 1946, and that one of the bodies which for the purpose of this Act becomes a local authority is the Cork Fever Hospital Board.  It has been represented to me that there are in fact two fever hospital boards in Cork, and I have been unable to distinguish from the definition in the Bill which of the boards is intended to be a local authority. One of those fever hospitals is efficient; the board is efficient and in general the institution is regarded as satisfactory and as performing a meritorious service.  The same enthusiasm does not prevail in relation to the other one.  It is run by a committee, the members of which are very concerned to promote their own interests and the interests of their families in providing jobs and appointments under the board.  So I would like to know from the Minister which of the Cork fever hospital boards is meant in this definition.  I would like to get an assurance before this Bill leaves the House that we will be satisfied that the hospital concerned is the hospital which, in the opinion of the people of Cork, is properly managed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Even during the emergency local authorities took regard to that service.  I have no knowledge of the case of the customs officer to whom Senator Sweetman referred, but I do know that cases did arise in the early stages, perhaps, where civil servants who could not be spared from their duties joined the Army and were recalled.  In some cases they may not have been recalled but may have been allowed to serve.  They took the course which they regarded as being in the best national interests, no doubt, but in defiance, in some cases, of their superior authority who thought they should have remained at their post and done the duty which it was considered would be most serviceable to the nation at the time.  I think these people may not have received full incremental value for the time they spent in the Army.  I am not sure what the position is.</P>
      <P>In relation to this question of regarding service with the Army during the emergency period as pensionable from the point of view of the local authority and of considering it as service with the local authority I think we must consider that upon their demobilisation from the Army these officers and men, officers in particular, received very substantial gratuities based upon their service with the Army.  They can, therefore, hardly expect to be rewarded twice over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We were talking here in a rather general way.  I am not prepared to commit myself to the view- I do not know what another Minister might say&mdash;that, irrespective of the circumstances under which local officers <Col N="2095" /> left the service of a local authority and entered the forces, they should be given the equivalent of direct service under a local authority when it comes to computing their pension and their increment. As I have said, I think we would have to consider and lay down general principles which would apply to the generality of officers who had left the service of the local authority and joined the forces with the approval of the local authority.  There is in the Bill&mdash;it does not cover, I think, the case the Senator has in mind&mdash;a provision dealing with established servants and officers of local authorities who, as members of the Reserve of the Defence Forces, were absent from their employment for a period for the purpose of attending to and performing their duties as members of these forces, providing that they shall be entitled to reckon as service the period of such absence.</P>
      <P>To the extent of that provision, of course, the right of a person who has obligations to the Defence Forces to have his service with the Defence Forces recognised as pensionable service is accepted.  I am not prepared, however, to go so far as to say that if a person has left the service of a local authority and joined the Defence Forces, served there, drew the emoluments attached to the post which he held in the Defence Forces and then received a gratuity for that period of service, he is entitled to get anything more than that from a local authority. As I have already indicated we shall probably have an amending Bill to follow this Bill and I will look into the position then.</P>
      <P>If the hospital to which Senator Duffy refers is a local authority hospital or is regarded as a local authority hospital no doubt the staff of that institution will be covered by the provisions of this Act.  The Cork Fever Hospital Board which is mentioned in the definition section of this Bill has not, in fact, come into existence yet. It is a board which it is anticipated will come into existence when the new fever hospital is built.  Therefore, the Bill is designed to cover that contingency but otherwise so far as I know there is no local authority fever hospital in Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 6 to delete sub-section (2).</P>
      <P>Section 5 deals with the manner in which Part III of the Bill will become operative in the case of the registered servants of local authorities.  So far as the officers are concerned the Bill is automatic once it becomes law.  The officers of all the local authorities within the definition will be entitled to the pensions and the gratuities and they will be subject to the obligations imposed in this Bill.  However, in relation to the servants of the local authorities a different procedure is followed.  In other words, so far as the servants are concerned the Bill is adoptive.  Nothing happens until the local authority passes a resolution adopting Part III of the Bill.  It is the part that is concerned with the provision of pensions for the servants of local authorities.  Sub-section (2) is a provision which baffles me.  Sub-section (2) reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A resolution under this section &mdash;that is a resolution adopting Part III of the Bill&mdash;shall contain a declaration of the maximum number of persons to be at any one time in the employment of the local authority as permanent servants.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin Corporation, or the Dublin County Council, or the Mayo County Council, or the Skibbereen Urban Council can employ as many officers as they like and all of these officers are automatically pensionable&mdash;they come under the provisions of this Bill.  But the county council or the local authority adopting Part III for the purpose of making their servants pensionable must include in the resolution a <Col N="2097" /> provision fixing a maximum number of persons who are to be regarded as permanent pensionable servants.  Personally I do not know what effect that resolution will have.  I do not know what it is intended to achieve.  Let us take this case.  Dublin County Council may, and probably does, employ 1,500 servants.  So far as I know there is nothing in the Bill which requires the county council to say the number of permanent servants who will come within the scope of the Bill is 1,000, 1,500 or 2,000.</P>
    <P>In other words, it does not appear to me that there is any restriction on the number of persons who may be mentioned in the resolution but, once the resolution is adopted, it restricts the number of persons who may be added to the register of pensionable servants for five years.  I think that will work out very unfairly.  If a county council takes the view that their maximum number of permanent servants is 1,000 that figure will be inserted in the resolution; but in the subsequent two or three years the number of persons eligible for admission to the scheme might jump to 3,000.  The council is debarred from adding one more name to the register and they cannot amend the resolution for five years.  At the end of five years they can fix the figure at 3,000 or 5,000 but, having amended the resolution to that extent, they are tied for the following five years.  I cannot see any advantage to be derived from the inclusion of this provision.  It seems to me merely a temptation, for one reason or another or in one set of circumstances or another, to limit unduly the number of persons who may be designated pensionable officers.  I urge upon the Minister the deletion of this sub-section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this Bill we must have some regard to the position of the local authority.  As I pointed out on the Committee Stage, we are not here imposing burdens upon the State.  We are imposing burdens upon other people.  We think it wiser in the interests of those who we hope will become beneficiaries under this measure not to make the provisions <Col N="2098" /> mandatory or obligatory upon the local authorities.  Therefore, that portion of the Bill which proposes to bring in a very large number of public employees into a pension scheme has been made permissive.</P>
      <P>It may not be a very easy matter to get a local authority to adopt Part III of this Act.  It would certainly be much more difficult to get them to adopt it if they were not in a position at the outset, at any rate, to fix some limit to their responsibilities.  That is why we have stated that the resolution should in the first instance contain a declaration as to the maximum number of persons who would be at any one time in the employment of the local authority so that the elected members of the local authority, upon whom the responsibility for adopting this Act will rest, will know exactly where they are and what is the full extent of their obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary also to put in that provision for another reason.  Under Part III it is anticipated that a very large number of persons who would not in the strict interpretation of the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; be regarded as permanent, are being brought in. Under that Part of the Act we shall be able to bring in a very large number of road workers whose period of service with a local authority is periodically interrupted for fairly prolonged periods of time at a stretch.  We have, again, to assist the local authority in dealing with their problem by allowing the local authority to fix a limit.  If that limit happens to be exceeded we shall simply have to say to the servants concerned that they will have to wait until a vacancy occurs in the register and that then they will be regarded as established and permanent servants according as vacancies arise.  If we did not do that I think a very large number of local authorities would not adopt Part III of this measure at all. It is really to induce them to accept the obligations which Part III imposes upon them that we have included this provision under Section 5.  On the whole I think it is not an unreasonable provision.  If the local authority is going to accept obligations it should itself be in a position to specify the extent of these obligations in the first <Col N="2099" /> place.  I think it will be found, as time goes on and people adopt it, that the figure will be increased to cover any increase in the numbers of persons who might be regarded as being in reasonably permanent employment under the local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the sub-section does not impose any obligation on the local authority to limit the number of persons mentioned in the resolution in any particular respect?  Let me take a case.  Assuming there are 500 servants employed by the Cork Corporation is it not open to the corporation under the section to mention a figure of 1,500 in the resolution? Is there anything to prohibit them from doing that?  If there is not the sub-section is meaningless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not meaningless. They can mention 1,500 if they wish to do so, but I do not think that the members of local authorities will behave in that ridiculous fashion.  I think they will ask their officers to say how many people would be regarded as being in permanent employment&mdash;road workers and everyone else&mdash;and they will arrive at a figure, put that into the resolution and let it stand as the limit of their responsibilities for the time being.  At the end of five years they can amend the figure if they wish.  This, again, is very like some of the provisions of the Housing Bill.  Part III is highly experimental.  We tried to draft it so that it would cover the problem of the servants of local authorities who have more or less broken time.  Until the local authorities themselves see how this is going to work I think it is better for us to leave them the power of fixing a limit to their ultimate labilities under the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of providing pensions for the servants or workmen employed by local authorities has been under discussion for a number of years. The Minister and his predecessors on previous occasions undertook that a scheme would be introduced to provide these pensions.  This scheme does not fulfil that undertaking.  The scheme in the Bill is purely permissive.  It enables a local authority to adopt, by resolution, Part III of the Bill, which, once adopted, becomes the groundwork of their pension scheme for workmen.  But, if it is the intention of the Minister that there should be a universal pension scheme, then he has got to do something more than give us this Bill, because, if any particular local authority fails or refuses to pass the necessary resolution to make Part III of the Bill operative, there is no pension scheme so far as the employees of the local authority are concerned.  We ought to be clear on that.  Therefore, if the Minister is suggesting to us that this is a measure to provide a pension scheme, I want him to examine it again because I think he will admit readily that it does not provide a pension scheme.  It provides a local authority with the power to have a pension scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am anxious about is this. Should a number of local authorities ignore the Bill and fail or refuse to pass the necessary resolution to bring Part III into operation, is the Minister satisfied then that he has no further duty in the matter, no further function; in other words does he intend to do anything by encouragement or any other method open to him to ensure that a <Col N="2101" /> pension scheme for the workmen employed by local authorities will be universally applied?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for the Minister to do anything more than is provided for in this Bill.  We have provided the scheme. We have given the local authorities every inducement to adopt it, and I am sure the local authorities will act in conformity with the general spirit of the times under this Bill.  I am not going to coerce them to adopt it, because, if I did, I should be told that I was imposing a burden on the local authorities which should be shouldered by the State.  That is a very common cry now.  When the central authority takes responsibility for enacting measures dealing, say, with public health, with the housing of the people, with the provision of water supplies, roads, and so on, we are told that, having given the local authority power to do all these things and, in some instances, compelling them to do them, we ought to accept financial responsibility for them.  I have no doubt that if we were to say to every county council: &ldquo;You must pension all your servants,&rdquo; we would be told that it was the Government which was compelling the local authorities to do this, that the members of the local authorities would never have dreamed of giving these men pensions if it were not for the Government measure and that the Government must bear the responsibility. I am not going to put myself in that position.  We have given the local authorities a lead.  They are manned by responsible men who are quite as capable as I am of assessing what are their obligations to their servants.</P>

The county council has adopted no pension scheme.  That will not prevent the manager from saying that a man is too old and that he will be sacked.  That is what I am asking the Minister to address himself to&mdash;the problem that will arise where a local authority does not pass the resolution, where there is no pension scheme, and where the manager, irrespective of what the county council may think, dismisses all the older men who are then thrown on the road.</P>

    <P>There is an element of unreality about the whole of our proceedings regarding these amendments, because it would appear that, no matter how strong a case is made, there is no <Col N="2103" /> chance of any of these amendments being seriously considered.  All I can hope for in moving this amendment is to induce the Minister to say something which would ease the minds of the officers affected by this particular amendment.  When Part V of the Vocational Education Act was being put into operation in Cork, the first city where that part of the Act was implemented, there was an element of doubt as to whether the scheme would be successful.  It was experimental.  The Minister has on several occasions this evening mentioned the fact that this Bill is of an experimental character. This was an extremely important development of technical education, perhaps the most important development for 40 years.  Cork City had the honour of initiating this experiment and classes were put into operation for the benefit of young people between 14 and 16 years of age who had ceased to attend primary or any other schools.  It was a tremendous educational experiment. It was a great social experiment too.  In addition to its educational aspects, its social aspects are of fundamental importance.  As time went on a difference of opinion was expressed as to whether the experiment was successful or not but, at present, it can be said that it has been a complete success.</P>
    <P>As a result of the successful termination of the experimental stage the officers who carried on the work during that period&mdash;a period extending over eight years&mdash;were made permanent and pensionable officers in general.  Similar remarks apply to the persons described as servants in this Bill.  The position that arises, then, under this Bill is that unless the Minister and the officers who will have charge of the administration of the Bill give an assurance that these officers will get full credit for their eight years' work, the Bill would appear only to provide for a period of four years.  I know that Section 21 of the Bill can be interpreted to cover perhaps the whole of the service.  So far as I am concerned, I would be satisfied if the Minister would give an assurance that Section 21 would cover the cases of the officers concerned.  If <Col N="2104" /> the Minister is satisfied and can assure me that that is so, then, with the permission of the House, I would be prepared to withdraw this amendment in order to save time.</P>

      <P>So far as I am personally concerned, I think it can be made quite clear that the officers of the City Vocational Education Committee who were temporarily employed can be considered under paragraph (b), sub-section (2) of Section 21 but, in the first instance, the matter rests with the local authority and then the Minister must be a consenting party.  Beyond agreeing that the case of these officers can be considered by the Minister under that sub-section, I cannot go any further.  You cannot expect me to bind, say, a successor of mine, some ten or 15 years hence.</P>

      <P>The Senator has argued that these officers are in a special position.  I want to be clear that I am not accepting that on the basis of the discussion that has taken place but the Senator has argued that these officers are in a special position and that there are special reasons to be taken into consideration in their regard.  If the local authority are of that view, I suppose the Minister would have to consider it very carefully but, on the other hand, it is only right to say that the Minister would also have to have regard to the provisions of Section 78 of the Act of 1941 because, after all, that is the more comprehensive provision.  However, I think I cannot go any further than I have gone.

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the first sub-section where in line 40, on page 10, the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; appears.  It is not clear to me what is meant there, whether it is the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for some other Department concerned with the affairs of the local authority involved. Sub-section (1) says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where an established officer of a local authority has not less than ten years of pensionable local service and&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  he is removed from his office for a cause other than misconduct or unfitness,</P>
      <P>(b)  his office is abolished, or</P>
      <P>(c)  his position has, in the opinion of the appropriate Minister, been materially altered to his detriment by changes in its condition made without reasonable cause and he resigns his office with the consent of the appropriate Minister,</P>
      <P>the local authority shall add to his pensionable local service such number of additional years as may be sanctioned by the Minister....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What I want to know is: who is to have the sanction?  Is it the Minister for Education, the Minister for Health, or the Minister for Local Government? The words used here are &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; and these words are defined as meaning the Minister for Local Government, so that as the Bill stands, sanction must come, not from the Minister for Health or the Minister for Education in the case of a vocational education committee, but from the Minister for Local Government.  I wonder is that the intention.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I draw attention to the fact that that is the only instance in which the Minister for Local Government intervenes under Section 21? In any other activity in relation to a vocational education committee, the Minister involved is the Minister for Education.  He is the person who takes the decision involving the resignation of an officer whose conditions of employment have been worsened.  The Minister says that, for the purposes of added years, it is the Minister for Local Government shall give sanction but when we come to sub-section (2) we have another case of a somewhat different character and again the word used is &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; but, with all respect, I think the expression that should be used there is &ldquo;the appropriate Minister&rdquo;.  It seems obvious that in the case of officers of a vocational education committee the decision should lie with the Minister for Education and that in the case of officers of an agricultural committee, the decision should lie with the Minister for Agriculture. If not, a most Gilbertian situation is being created.  Everything that happens in relation to the employment of officers of the agricultural committee is governed by the actions, the decisions and the orders of the Minister for Agriculture.  But if for some reason an officer is adversely affected by some decision of the Minister for Agriculture and decides to resign, then the agricultural committee does not apply to the Minister for Agriculture for permission to add years to his service but to the Minister for Local Government. I suggest that that is a thing that was not adverted to when the Bill was being drafted and that it is being put across now as a brilliant idea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to bring to the Minister's attention the fact that when we were passing the Vocational Education Bill here some time ago the Minister for Education said he would take into account the question of adding years and he gave the impression <Col N="2107" /> that he would be rather liberal in adding years in cases where people were compelled to resign because of the age limit.  Now that the Minister has power to add years, I hope he will consider what the Minister for Education said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>That statement by the Minister for Education was made after consultation with the Minister for Local Government and the Senator may assume that we shall jointly give effect to the expressed intention of the Minister for Education.  With regard to the point Senator Duffy has raised, there is nothing unusual in this.  It is, in fact, part of the existing procedure. As regards officers of a vocational education committee or officers of county committees of agriculture or other subsidiary bodies of the local authorities, the final and determining Minister in relation to certain matters is the Minister for Local Government.  As regards matters relating to superannuation, the determining Minister is the appropriate Minister, whoever he may be; that is, the Minister who is responsible for the general activities of the subsidiary body.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill the functions of the appropriate Minister extend to such questions as deciding appeals on failure to inscribe a name on the register, appeals against removing a name from the register and other such matters. The Minister defined in the definition section, the Minister for Local Government, is the only Minister who can entertain appeals against failure to grant superannuation, the amount of the superannuation and the failure of the local authority to return contributions. The Minister is also the appropriate Minister to deal with this question of added years.  There are reasons why that should be the position.  These are all subsidiary bodies of the revenue raising authority. The local authorities are under the general supervision of the Minister for Local Government and, therefore, he is more concerned than all the other Ministers with a matter of this sort. He is the most appropriate Minister for dealing with these questions.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, I suggest that the provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 21 ought to be altered.  If the Minister to deal with added years is the Minister for Local Government, he ought also to be responsible for giving consent to an official of an agricultural committee who wishes to resign.  An officer claims that his position has been altered to his detriment.  Some Minister is appealed to and he forms the opinion that the claim of the official in question is well founded.  In other words, some Minister takes the view that the official's position has been altered to his detriment and the Minister concerned consents to the resignation of the official.</P>
      <P>There are two functions of the Minister, whoever the Minister may be.  He is the person who hears the complaint of the official and who forms a judgment as to whether the position of the official was altered to his detriment.  If he forms that opinion, and the official desires to resign the Minister consents to his resignation.  Take the case of an official of a committee of agriculture. Let us say that an official of the county committee of agriculture in Galway complains that some decision of his committee, some alteration in the status of the office, has disimproved his position, that he is unfairly treated and he wants to resign.</P>
      <P>Immediately he makes the complaint, not to the Minister for Local Government, but to the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Agriculture agrees that something has been done which prejudices the official's position and he then consents to the official resigning his position; the official resigns and the question arises as to whether he is entitled to have years of service added to those years which he worked.  Say he has worked 25 years and he says: &ldquo;If you give me five or ten years I will be satisfied.&rdquo;  The person who will decide will perhaps be a new Minister, a Minister who knows nothing of the facts and who does not know whether the officer's position was altered to his detriment.  Yet he is the Minister who will decide whether there should be added years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister in the Department controlling his activities <Col N="2109" /> will be in a position to know; he will be aware whether the conditions of service of the officer are worsened or otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of the terms of the officer's appointment.  It is very difficult to appreciate what Senator Duffy is getting at.  He must realise that these are subsidiary bodies, that there are certain things in relation to which there must be general uniformity of treatment.  If that is so, there must be one administering Minister.  In this case it has been decided that the most appropriate Minister is the Minister for Local Government who exercises supervision over the principal bodies, the local authorities, the primary bodies to which these other bodies are merely subsidiary.</P>
      <P>As Senator O'Dea has pointed out, if a vocational teacher is removed from office or if his status is altered or if his hours of duty are in any way altered, the Minister who is familiar with all the circumstances is the Minister who, in the first instance, sanctioned the terms of his appointment and in whose Department there is a full record of that officer's services, not merely the terms of his appointment, but the various inspections that have been made and a record of the officer's professional competency, and other matters.  Therefore, if the officer's position is changed, the only Minister who can really determine whether it has been changed to his detriment, without reasonable cause or not, is the appropriate Minister, that is, the Minister who has charge of that particular service; but, when we get outside that narrow sphere and come to consider these officers as merely a section of the general body of officers of local authorities, but a section which must be treated more or less in the same way as any other section of this composite body is treated, then the Minister who should do that, I think, is, as I have said, the Minister who is charged with the responsibility of supervising the work of the primary or principal bodies and that happens to be the Minister for Local Government.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Duffy has plenty of experience of something comparable with this arrangement between Departments.  Several Bills indicate that such and such a thing is subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  In this case, as far as I can see, the Minister for Local Government is the last appeal.  He is the correlating officer for various sections.  I am not enamoured of it but I think it is a feasible and workable arrangement at present and I think Senator Duffy should see that.  The same principle applies in Civil Service matters where the Minister for Finance has the last word.  The Minister for Local Government in this case will have the last word in correlating matters between the various local authorities and the various committees of local authorities. That is understandable.  Whether it might be objectionable or not is another matter.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator O'Donovan's view that this arrangement is similar to the control exercised by the Minister for Finance but there is this defence for the position taken up by the Minister for Finance that, wherever money is expended, he has to find it and, consequently, he must have an over-all supervision over the spending Departments.  I think that is a bad arrangement.  I think in fact it has become an excuse for the Department of Finance to interfere in everything, from dog-licensing up.  But now we are getting into a similar arrangement in relation to the Department of Local Government.  The Minister for Local Government now is claiming in this Bill that he and he alone shall decide whether a fellow down in Ballina who was dismissed or who was forced to resign his position by some change in his status and who the Minister for Education decided was entitled to resign, should get added years.  The Minister for Local Government has no official knowledge of the officer's conduct.</P>

      <P>The Minister is quite right in this particular matter because it is in accordance with the usual custom and in the case of, say, agriculture and vocational education, there is a sort of mixed fund involved. Part of the fund comes from the local rates and part from the Central Fund. It is the part that comes from the local rates, I think, about which the Minister for Local Government has the final say.  That is the reason, I think, that as regards pensions he has the final say in the matter.  In cases such as those visualised in sub-section (2), it is my experience that it is the usual practice. As regards the point that the Minister would have no official knowledge there is constant communication between the two Departments.  I know that when a particular case arises the Department of Education communicates all the facts to the Department of Local Government and I should say that in 99 cases out of 100 it is the view of the Department of Education that prevails with the Department of Local Government.  I accept that as being correct.  I do not think it would be worth while to waste much more time in regard to it.</P>

Any decision in that regard has to go to the Minister for Education or the Minister for Agriculture and must have his sanction before there is any change.  So that whatever decision is taken has the approval of the Minister, whether it is an alteration of the status or the functions of a particular officer.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), paragraph (a), line 12, to delete the word &ldquo;and&rdquo;; and to delete also paragraph (b).</P>
      <P>If we imagine these deletions made, in what would remain of the section, the cases in which an officer would be entitled to pension would be specified with sufficient clearness.  Very considerable objection has been made to the provision regarding diligence and fidelity.  That matter has been debated in the other House.  I know the officers concerned feel a certain amount of uneasiness about it.  In all services there are personal factors and it might easily happen that an officer or servant, as the case may be, might fall foul of his superior officer for the time being and that a record might be made which would not be brought to the notice of the officer or, at any rate, would not be brought to his notice with sufficient clearness and he might know nothing about it until the time would arrive to give him a pension and then the record might be produced.  I may be in error about that.  There may be regulations requiring that an officer would be notified immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, as has been stated by many others in the course of the debates on this Bill, if there is any reason to suspect that an officer is incompetent or inefficient in any way, he should not be retained, normally, in the service. There should be some disciplinary action taken.  I say that as an administrative officer.  That is what ought to be done generally in the interests of the public service as a whole and, I would say, in the interests of the officer concerned because an officer may be allowed to drift and get into bad ways and the errors on his part may accumulate until eventually breaking point is reached and he has to go.  If prompt action were taken and if there were some reduction in his status in order to indicate that his conduct does not conform to what would be expected of him, it would meet the case, rather <Col N="2113" /> than to reserve the punishment until the end of a long period.  A case has been put up to me of a record being made in the case of an officer having two or three years' service and a similar record being made in the case of an officer having 30 or 40 years' service and the disparity between the losses involved in the respective cases. The punishment in these cases does not fit the crime.  That is the reason for suggesting the deletion of paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 23 and the deletion of the word &ldquo;and&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In this case I am sure the Minister will be able to say something.  The unreality of the whole thing is apparent and the uselessness of moving the amendment, even if we had the power to carry it, if the Minister himself is not convinced about it.  There seems to be great reluctance to incur the expense of summoning the Dáil to consider amendments but I take it that the discussion on this Bill and the official record of the debates will be of some service.  When these clauses come to be interpreted, I hope that the statements made in the course of this debate will get due consideration and weight, and that nothing very hasty will be done in their implementation.  I would say to the Minister that very considerable uneasiness exists on the part of officers generally regarding this particular form of wording.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the uneasiness arises out of paragraph (b) (1).  Well, we are not asking for anything unusual there.  The general purpose of this Bill is to bring, so far as it can be done, having regard to the special circumstances attaching to the service of local authorities, the superannuation code of the officers and servants of local authorities into conformity with the existing Civil Service superannuation code.  In the Civil Service, a pension is not given unless a certificate is forthcoming that the officer has served with diligence and fidelity.  That is essential in the Civil Service, and I do not see that there is any reason why we should not ask that the same condition should be fulfilled in the case of officers of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2114" /> It was suggested that the section, as originally drafted, was perhaps too rigid in that the fear was expressed that an officer who had given satisfactory service over a long period, and had one record against him, would lose his whole pensionable service by reason of that record.  To meet that point, and to allay those fears, I accepted an amendment to insert the words &ldquo;in general&rdquo; in paragraph (b) (1).  I think that covers the case fully. It will provide that, if a man served day in and day out with the same sort of diligence and fidelity as the generality of his fellow officers, he will then be entitled to full pension.  I do not think that you can go further than that.  We cannot go to the extent that you can make a man's entitlement to pension depend entirely on years of service, irrespective of whether he has been a generally satisfactory officer or not.  I think that if we are going to ask the local authority to bear the greater part of the cost of these pensions, we will have to ask their officers to give them something in return.  What we are asking here is that they should serve with general diligence and fidelity.  We are not asking for anything more than would normally be given by a conscientious employee to a good employer.</P>
    <P>Now, the other provision of this section is to enable us to deal with cases which have caused me and my predecessors a great deal of worry.  We know what the tradition in the local service is.  I suppose it is the same as the tradition in the Civil Service. Officers are generally treated with a great deal of consideration and with a certain amount of leniency, and the approach in matters of this sort is a very human and sympathetic one.  It might happen that you would go on treating an officer, as Senator O'Reilly has suggested, with a great deal of consideration&mdash;giving him a certain amount of latitude.  In fact, I am afraid that is the position&mdash;you give latitude because there is no other alternative to that except dismissal. I expect that the service of local authorities will continue to carry a few lame dogs until a point is reached when it is felt that in the interests of everybody it would be far better if this lame <Col N="2115" /> dog were given a rest for a prolonged period.  This enables me to meet the case where we will give him something, something which will enable him to maintain himself, and which will enable, I suppose, the local authority to extend to him the same sort of consideration as a considerate employer would give to a man whom he has permitted to remain in his service for a long time even though he was not securing full value for it.  That is the purpose of that part of the provision. It is not to penalise the officer but to enable the officer to be treated with compassion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the section, as it stands, is to exclude officers who are over 60 years of age.  There does not appear to be any special justification for such exclusion because, even if the lump sum is to be paid, the fact is that such lump sum might be regarded as something in the nature of an insurance policy, if you like.  The payment of it would not be a burden on the community. The fact is overlooked that if there is a lump sum payment there would also be an accompanying reduction in the rate of pension.  Without the lump sum, the ordinary pension is fixed at one-sixtieth for each completed year of service.  With a lump sum payment, the pension is fixed at one-eightieth for each completed year of service.  It is really a toss-up as to which of the two methods would be the more economical one for the State. Very often officers, after retirement, live to a ripe old age.  If their pension is at the rate of one-sixtieth for each completed year of service they may <Col N="2116" /> actually draw more from the State than if they were given a lump sum payment, thereby taking the pension at the rate of one-eightieth.</P>
    <P>The length of time this Bill has been on the stocks was mentioned by, I think, Senator O'Donovan on the Second Reading.  I think he said it was on the stocks for a period of 15 years. I am not able to say the exact time, but I do know that a number of officers who took part in the propaganda for this Bill have since died, so that the benefits under it which they visualised cannot be given to them.  This 60-year limit has been put in.  I understand that a similar rule obtains in the case of the Civil Service.  The fact that that is so is not, in my opinion, any justification for its insertion in this Bill because the conditions which apply in the Civil Service and in the case of officers and servants of local authorities are widely different.  I do not see any justification for it myself.</P>
    <P>Further down on the list of amendments I have another amendment which, unless this is accepted by the Minister will have no effect, because the officers who would benefit by it would be cut out by this limit of 60 years.  It is a matter for the Minister to say whether, in the event of an amending Bill being brought in, he will consider this proposal seriously.  I quite realise the difficulties at the moment in securing approval for an amendment of this kind, but I should like the Minister to give his views on the subject and to state clearly why the limit of 60 years is put into the Bill at all and why these officers are excluded, particularly when they have waited so long for this provision.</P>

      <P>I had intended raising this point on the section.  It appears that, under the Civil Service regulations, officers may retire at 60 and get the benefit of superannuation provisions, but local authority officers may not retire until they reach the age of 65 and if they happen unfortunately to be over the prescribed age of 60, six months after the 1st January, 1947, they will not derive any benefit, notwithstanding the fact that in one case I have in mind the officer concerned has over 40 years' service.  Surely that <Col N="2117" /> should be a recommendation instead of a bar in the matter of securing the benefits.  It could be prescribed without any injustice to anybody that anybody with at least 40 years' service should come under the provisions of the measure, and I am sure that if the Minister does bring in an amending Bill, he will take that into consideration. It is very unfair that just because a man who has served faithfully for over 40 years is a year or a year and a half over the prescribed age, he should be excluded from the benefits of the Bill.  The Minister, I am sure, will agree that such a man should come within the provisions of the Bill as soon as he has attained the age of 65 at which point he is bound to retire.</P>

      <P>The wording of this section is precisely what I discussed on the Second Reading and Senator O'Reilly supported my remarks then.  I support his remarks now, but I am afraid that, as I failed to convince the Minister on the last occasion, all we can do is to appeal to him in the hope that in this amending Bill&mdash;I hope the Minister will be here again to bring it in for us&mdash;we will get this matter redressed.  We have made as strong a case as could be made and I hope the Minister will take cognisance of the remarks made from both sides of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is as far as I can go&mdash;to say that I will take cognisance of them.  I must remind the House that this is not by any means a simple measure.  It is an attempt to bring all the superannuation code of the local authorities into conformity with the Civil Service code and that has conferred many benefits on the officers of local authorities.  I cannot go further.  I cannot start by means of this Bill to bring them within the Civil Service superannuation code and I would not be allowed to do it.  An important measure of this sort requires the assent of every Minister of the Government, and, apart altogether from the fact that I think the Bill is a liberal Bill in which we have tried to improve the position of the officers of local authorities fairly, there are some things that one simply cannot do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not right to lose sight of the <Col N="2118" /> fact that this Bill, even in regard to the right of option given under it, represents a concession to the officers of local authorities which the members of the Civil Service have not got. Under the 1909 Act, it is true that an option was given to the serving officers of the time to avail of the provisions of that Act, but it was subject to the condition that they must undergo a medical examination, and, unless they passed that examination, they would not be allowed to opt to come under the 1909 Act.  The fact that we are not asking for any medical examination in this case is a substantial concession. While saying all that, I am not closing my mind rigidly, but I do not see much hope of changing it.  As I have said, however, there will probably be an amending Bill&mdash;shortly, I think&mdash;because there are certain things we should like to look into again and an opportunity may arise to consider that matter further.  I do not want to go further than that and do not want to be taken as going further for the reasons I have already given.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (9), paragraph (a), page 17, line 7, to delete the figures &ldquo;1947&rdquo; and insert in lieu thereof the figures &ldquo;1945&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons for this amendment were explained in the debate on a previous occasion.  The Minister has recognised the principle underlying the amendment when he provides for the case of a person who died on or before the 1st day of January, 1947.  There the principle of going back is accepted, and, as Senator O'Donovan, other Senators and I pointed out, if we could induce the Minister to go back to 1945, we would let in a considerable number of cases&mdash;not a very large number&mdash;who would be beneficially affected.  As the previous amendment was not accepted, one of these cases will be automatically excluded because the particular officer was over 60 when he died and hence would not have been eligible for admission to the register of established officers.  That is the reason I was anxious that the Minister would accept <Col N="2119" /> that amendment.  The Minister may scarcely believe it, but I can tell him that I am genuinely more interested in the cases of the dependents of officers who die than in the case of officers who are alive, because living officers can defend themselves and do something, but those who are dead cannot.  In the case of officers who have died, the source of livelihood of their dependents has gone and in many cases their condition is pathetic indeed.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies as to a previous amendment.  We quite understand the Minister's difficulty in the matter and we hope our remarks will tend to increase that sympathy which he has already displayed in connection with many parts of this Bill and that the sympathy will eventually result in a change in the people in the Government who are opposed to provisions of this kind.</P>
    <P>We are supposed to be a great Catholic and Christian State, but if a report were read of our proceedings, when the Minister is defending economy of this particular type, people would find it hard to believe that we are really so very Christian as we claim to be.  We seem to be more coldly mathematical and to forget the human elements concerned.  These are of great importance, and if we destroy that human spirit of Christianity we will destroy a whole lot of other things far more important and of much more value than any financial considerations could ever hope to be.  In fact, financial considerations themselves are very largely governed by these human considerations.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to keep this particular year in mind and go back at least to that year, if he is bringing in his amending Bill.  That would be a great source of consolation to the people whose breadwinners have been taken from them during the past two or three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained to the House the circumstances in which I am asking to have this Bill without amendment.  I persuaded the Dáil to give me this Bill without any amendment, except the Government amendments, all of which were designed to <Col N="2120" /> make further concessions to meet the points of view expressed by the officers of local authorities.  Whatever we are doing here will be considered anew without prejudice to any decisions taken here, in order that we may get the Bill law at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), page 17, line 31, to delete the word &ldquo;three&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;two&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is related to the first of the sections which govern the conditions under which the servants, as distinct from the employees, of the local authorities are brought under the scheme.  The section provides that the local authority shall maintain a register of its established servants and then goes on in sub-section (2) to provide that a person under the age of 60 years who has been a permanent servant of a local authority for a continuous period of three years shall have his name entered on the register.  It seems to me that a period of three years is unduly long.</P>
      <P>Standing by itself, if we were to take a figure of three years as representing a waiting period, it might be reasonable enough but it does not stand by itself. The person concerned may have been a temporary employee of the local authority for ten years or more before becoming a permanent servant, but for the purpose of having his name entered on the register he must be able to show that he has been a permanent servant for three years.  I did not attempt to delete the waiting period in its entirety, but the amendment which I have submitted proposes that it be reduced to two years.  The sub-section would then read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a person under the age of 60 years of age has been a permanent servant of a local authority for a continuous period of two years, the local authority shall enter his name on the register.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2121" /> It is not a very big concession, but one which the Minister might accept.  I have submitted it as a compromise. The case that was made to me was that the permanent servant should have his name registered right away. After some discussion, I found agreement on a suggestion that after a year of continuous permanent service he should automatically go on to the register of permanent service.  I have been trying here to compromise between the Minister's proposal for three years and the demand which has been made by the representatives in Dublin of the workers employed by the corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  We are seeking here to give a person who enters the employment of a local authority, without any stipulation or specification as to whether that service will be permanent or purely temporary, an opportunity to prove that for the purposes of this Bill it may be considered to be permanent. The servant concerned may be absent in each of those three years for as many as 60 days; he may cease to be in the employment of the local authority during that period; he may take advantage of the rainy season to go into some other employment and he can then come back to the local authority when the climatic conditions become more favourable to him.  If he is allowed to do that for a period of three years, he qualifies to be entered on the register of established servants.  We can scarcely go further than that, bearing in mind what our problem is.  I suggest that we should not hold up the Bill for the sake of further expanding what are, in fact, fairly liberal terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The waiting period is important in calculating benefits subsequently under the Bill and it is much longer than it might appear at first sight.  For instance, under this Bill any period for which a workman is employed by the local authority before the age of 18 will not count at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After he reaches the age of 18, any period which he works in a temporary capacity will not count, and mind you, <Col N="2122" /> the word &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; in the case of a local authority, as in the case of the Civil Service, has a meaning which is peculiar to itself.  One often comes across a civil servant who has 25 years continuous service under the State and who is still &ldquo;temporary.&rdquo;  In the case of local authorities, you have people who have been in continuous employment for five or ten years and who are still &ldquo;temporary.&rdquo;  I think that in the case of Dublin Corporation, it is common knowledge that a considerable section of the workmen who have been there day after day for the last ten or 12 years are still &ldquo;temporary.&rdquo;  When they are put on the permanent staff, that itself is a distinctive thing.  It is not only a question of giving a man a new status or new employment, but he is put on the &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; staff and he must remain for three years on that permanent staff before his name is entered on the register of pensionable servants.  So when we come to calculate, for the purpose of a pension or gratuity, the period of service which is to be reckoned by the pensionable servant, we have got to disregard the whole period in which he was in the employment of the local authority before becoming a permanent servant; we have got to disregard his whole period of temporary or quasi-permanent employment; and we have got to disregard his first three years on the permanent staff.  We find, therefore, men with 25 years employment who can reckon only five or ten years of pensionable permanent service.</P>
    <P>I am informed by employees of Dublin Corporation that for many of them this Bill has no attractions at all. As a matter of fact, their present status is much preferable to what is provided for them in the Bill.  Many of them who would not be regarded as permanent servants under the Bill are very apprehensive lest the Bill should become operative, because it would worsen their position rather than improve it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator himself has admitted that servants of the Dublin Corporation who have been ten or 12 years or even longer, on the nonpermanent staff are regarded as temporary and do not get any benefit.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), line 35, after the word &ldquo;becoming&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;an officer or&rdquo;, and after the word &ldquo;become&rdquo; in line 36 to insert the words &ldquo;an officer or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is to cover a possibility which, I think, does not often occur, but which may occur in such circumstances as to place a servant of a local authority in a very awkward position.  The section provides that where an established servant of a local authority gives up his job with the consent of the local authority and becomes the permanent servant of another local authority, his name automatically goes on the list of the second local authority for pension purposes.  But what happens if he leaves the service of one local authority to become the officer of another? That is not provided for.  I have made some inquiries and I gather that some posts in the case of, say, the Dublin Corporation, where the holders are classified as officers, are being filled almost exclusively by people who are described for the purposes of the Bill as servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a discussion earlier on the position of rate collectors and I understand that rate collectors in the case of Dublin Corporation are graded as officers of the corporation, but they are invariably recruited from the ranks of the servants, the workmen's group in the corporation&mdash;or outside the corporation for that matter.  If for instance, somebody who is being employed in that capacity worked for Dublin County Council or for Kildare County Council and has a status in County Dublin or County Kildare as a pensionable servant, that status is lost to him when he takes up a position as rate collector, because he then becomes <Col N="2124" /> an officer and has no credit for the period during which he worked as a pensionable servant of a county council. I think, Sir, that that case should be met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain that that case is not already fully covered by Section 19.  Section 19 provides that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;an established officer shall be entitled to reckon as service any continuous period ending when he first became an established officer of any local authority during which he was an established servant of any local authority.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now it is perhaps possible that the amendment which Senator Duffy has suggested might be better.  We have got to consider it when we have had an opportunity of trying out the Act and as we will probably have an amending Bill then, this matter which Senator Duffy's amendment seeks to raise can be dealt with.</P>

      <P>The amendments which we dealt with earlier were all on Section 5.  The amendment to sub-section (2), Section 5 was concerned with the character of the resolution which should be passed by a local authority purporting to adopt Part III of the Bill.  When we come to Section 38, we are dealing with the register which would be maintained by a local authority which adopted Part III.  We had a discussion earlier regarding the reasons for sub-section (2), the Minister then contending that the local <Col N="2125" /> authority must have some assurance that in adopting Part III of the Bill, there would be a limit to the number of persons who would be regarded as permanent servants.  I think we agreed eventually that the resolution placed no such limitation as suggested on the discretion of the local authority in regard <Col N="2126" /> to the number of servants that they may employ.</P>
