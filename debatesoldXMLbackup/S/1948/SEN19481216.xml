      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide increased compensation for workmen who are partially or totally incapacitated for work by accidents arising out of and in the course of their employment.</P>
      <P>Under the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, the maximum weekly payment was 30/-.  Under Emergency Powers (No. 274) Order, 1943, this maximum was, in the case of total incapacity, increased to 37/6 a week at which point it stands at present. In cases of partial incapacity the maximum still stands at 30/- a week. In total incapacity, subject to the maximum 37/6 a week, 75 per cent. of the pre-accident average weekly earnings is payable by way of compensation when these earnings exceed £1 and 80 per cent. when they are £1 or less.  In partial incapacity, subject to a maximum of 30/- a week, 75 per cent. of the difference between the pre-accident earnings and the post-accident earnings, actual or potential, is payable where that difference is £1 a week or less and 80 per cent. if the difference is more than £1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In effect, therefore, only earnings up to 50/- a week are reflected in the weekly amount of compensation for total incapacity.  Since 1st June, 1943, when the emergency increase became effective, wage levels have risen considerably and an immediate increase in the maximum amount of compensation is, therefore, called for.  Section 6 of the Bill fixes the maximum at 50/- a <Col N="402" /> week for both total and partial incapacity and extends the increase to persons receiving payments who were injured both before and after the date to be appointed by Order under Section 2.  The Emergency Powers Orders are being revoked by Section 8.</P>
    <P>Due to the absence from the Act of 1934 of a definition of the expression &ldquo;weekly payment&rdquo;, some persons injured by accident who are in receipt of payments voluntarily made by or on behalf of their employers are unable to secure advantage under some of the statutory provisions governing compensation. These provisions are contained in more than one section, but chiefly in Section 25.  That section empowers the courts, on the application of either the employer or the workman, to review the weekly payment being made to an injured workman, and, on such review, to confirm, end, diminish or increase it.</P>
    <P>It has been held by the courts, however, that the section applies only to weekly payments being made under an order of court or a duly registered agreement.  As a result of this defect in the Act, persons in receipt of compensation voluntarily paid by an employer, without an order of court or formal registered agreement, cannot have their weekly payments reviewed and adjusted.  Section 7 of the Bill enables such workmen to put themselves on the same footing as others, and gives them a right of review almost identical with that given under Section 25 of the Act of 1934.  The provision is regarded as a necessary complement to the main provision.  If it were not made, a number of persons would not benefit by the increase of the amount of the maximum weekly payment to 50/-.</P>
    <P>There are still persons in receipt of compensation under the Acts that were in operation prior to 1st August, 1934, the date of the coming into operation of the Act of that year.  From 17th January, 1944, an Emergency Powers Order provided for the payment to these of a supplementary allowance of one-fourth of the weekly payment they were then receiving.  It is now desired <Col N="403" /> to increase their present payments by a further one-third of these amounts. This will make an increase of two-thirds on the payments as they stood on 1st August, 1934, and, as the Emergency Powers Order is being revoked in Section 8, Section 3 provides for an increase of two-thirds on the 1934 payments subject to a maximum of 50/-a week.</P>
    <P>A person employed otherwise than by way of manual labour whose remuneration exceeds £350 a year is an excepted person and does not come within the scope of the Act of 1934. It is provided in Section 4 of the Bill that all such persons whose remuneration does not exceed £500 shall be brought within the scope of workmen's compensation.  A similar extension has already been made in these cases for unemployment insurance, national health insurance and widows' and orphans' contributory pensions.</P>
    <P>A minor provision is the correction of a copyist's error in the Act of 1934. It appears at Section 5 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, therefore, that the main provisions of the Bill are for the purpose of increasing the compensation at present being paid to injured workmen. This increase cannot, I am advised, be effected otherwise than by legislation.  If it could have been done by Emergency Powers Order, I should have preferred that course, both because it would be more expeditious and because I desire not to undertake avoidable amendments of the present code of social legislation until the comprehensive scheme which is being devised is ready.  The problems inherent in that scheme are, however, so numerous and complex that the task entailed in its preparation is enormous and it will be some time before the examination of the details is completed.</P>
    <P>Since the commencement of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, many defects calling for legislative amendment have come to light.  These will be carefully examined in connection with the comprehensive scheme of social legislation.  It would not be <Col N="404" /> reasonable, however, to defer the raising of the present weekly rates of compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Acts, and it is for that reason that I have decided to proceed with this Bill, so that the most urgent problem&mdash;that of increasing the existing rates&mdash;may be dealt with speedily. I would hope for the co-operation of the Seanad in enabling this Bill to be passed before the Christmas Recess, so that those who will be entitled to increased payments under the Bill may benefit therefrom at the earliest moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with mixed feelings that we on this side receive the Bill presented to us to-day.  While we welcome the Bill for the very little consideration it gives to these people whom it proposes to affect, we have a feeling of regret that, after a period of so many months, when we were led to believe that it was only a matter of very little consequence to have introduced into this Parliament a comprehensive social security scheme or plan, we get merely this Bill.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Bill are quite simple and quite disappointing in many respects.  The Bill raises the allowances to workmen from 37/6 to 50/- per week and it also raises the ceiling, as has been done in the case of national health insurance and unemployment insurance, to bring within its scope people with incomes up to £500.  But it is a Bill which is costing the State nothing.  There is no State contribution in respect of the premiums which will have to be paid under the Bill.  Workmen's compensation is an obligation on every employer, and I should like to have from the Minister a little more information.  He has not told us what the increase in the premiums will be as a result of the Bill, or what the increase in the case of industrial or agricultural production will be.  I am sure he will admit that every time you place an obligation on a certain section of the community to make a particular contribution, you are increasing, to some extent or other, the cost of production, and thereby raising the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> It is disappointing, particularly when it comes from a Minister for Social Welfare and more particularly from the Leader of the Labour Party, to hear him say that when a man becomes incapacitated by reason of an accident at his work he and his family are to be compelled to live on a sum of 50/- per week.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me&mdash;but he smiles. He has said that hitherto they were compelled to live on the sum of 37/6 per week.  We were, however, promised greater benefits.  There are very few employees, even labourers in the building trade, who are now in receipt of anything less than £4 10s. 0d. per week, and if, as a result of an accident, such a man is put off the payroll, the family income, which should, if anything, be increased, is reduced to 50/-.</P>
    <P>There is another very disappointing feature of the Bill to which I desire to call attention.  I cannot understand how the Minister overlooked it.  We find that 50/- per week is being made available for a single man who has no dependents.  I quite admit, of course, that there are quite a number of them in the country who have as serious obligations to shoulder as many married men.  But the proposal in the Bill is 50/- per week for each person who comes under the Workmen's Compensation Act, regardless of whether he is married or single.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me that a married man with a family has many heavy obligations to meet.  He has to keep a house, pay rent and rates and all the rest.  Last night, on another Bill, we had a long discussion on the difficulty that quite a number of our people find in meeting the payment of their rates.  All the obligations which a married man has to meet will, of course, continue when he goes off his employer's payroll as the result of an accident.  We now have a proposal coming from a Labour Minister that a man who may be in receipt of an income of £4, £5 or £6 a week will have that income reduced to 50/- a week if he is unfortunate enough to meet with an accident.  That accident may have occurred as a result of his interest in his firm's work. But the fact is that when he meets with <Col N="406" /> an accident, his income will be reduced to 50/- per week.  Despite all the criticism that we heard in the past, we are now going to compel that man and his family during his period of incapacity, to supplement his income by going on public assistance.  That is what we find in a Bill put before us by the Minister for Social Welfare.  He told us many times in the past, he told us during the last general election campaign and for many years before that, that in order to correct a situation of that sort, all that was required was the will to put into operation, at the shortest notice, a comprehensive social security plan that would make provision for people equal to that which they are able to have when in employment.</P>
    <P>The Workmen's Compensation Act of 1934 provided for a maximum weekly payment of 30/-.  Under the Emergency Powers Act (No. 27 of 1934) this was increased to 37/6.  That Emergency Powers Order is now being revoked. Another Order will require to be made by the Minister to give effect to the provisions of this Bill.  I may say that we on this side are prepared to facilitate the Minister in every way to enable him to give effect to the provisions in this Bill, even though we are not satisfied that it is going to do all the things that we would wish.  As I have said, the mere passing of it is not going to be sufficient.  In order to bring it into operation, an Order will have to be made by the Minister.  When that Order will be made will rest, of course, with the Minister himself.  I am sure, however, that he will give effect as early as possible to what is contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Another point is that money has to be found for this purpose.  Payments will have to be made.  While we might all be anxious to give money, regardless of where it comes from, we must take cognisance of the fact that it has to be got.  I should like to know what will be the position of employers who have entered into agreements with insurance companies to cover their workmen over specified periods?  The premiums in these cases, I take it, are based on the number of workmen insured, and on the fact that certain <Col N="407" /> payments would be made in the case of accident.  In other words, contracts have been entered into.  Despite that fact, we are now going to compel people who had not contracted to do a particular thing to do it.  We are saying to them that they must go further, and do what is laid down in the Bill.  I am sure that matter has got serious consideration.  If the insurance companies are prepared to be as generous as the Minister would like them to be, then I have no complaint to make.  If insurance premiums are increased as a result of this Bill, that will have certain reactions on, for example, the erection of houses, and our housing problem may be described I suppose, as an emergency one at the present time.</P>
    <P>While the Minister may claim a certain amount of credit for bringing forward this Bill, I would like to point out that there is no State contribution being given under it.  We are just compelling people to do something that they had not contracted to do.  The worst feature of it is, I think, that it makes no differentiation between the married and the single man.  As I have said, the married man has many obligations to meet.  If he meets with an accident, his income is going to be cut from £5 or £6 a week to 50/- a week.  That will be his only source of income.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the present position with 37/6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but, as I have already pointed out, the Minister is not only the Minister for Social Welfare, but as Leader of the Labour Party, he put it before the country on many occasions that his Party had a solution for all those problems and that it was only a matter of putting them in a position to implement their policy and their programme.  We now find that he comes along and tells the workers of the country who are in receipt of £5 or £6 a week that if they are removed from their employer's payroll as a result of an accident, they will have to be content with 50/- a week, so that their families and themselves <Col N="408" /> will be reduced to the position of having to seek home assistance.  No family could exist in reasonable comfort on 50/- a week.</P>
      <P>There are other aspects of the Bill that I do not wish to go into.  We have had many of these compensation cases before our courts from time to time. Some of these aspects of the Bill have been dealt with at length by the legal people in the Dáil.  We have been told by the Minister that this is only just a stop-gap, something that we should be asked to pass immediately in order to give benefits to those people for a very short time.  We have heard that during the last six or eight months the increases in the widows' and orphans' pensions and old age pensions were just introduced as stop-gaps, and that the Minister was in the course of preparing a comprehensive scheme. Will the Minister say whether workmen's compensation will form any part of that comprehensive scheme or if it is going to be outside of it?  If it is, then I think we should have a more comprehensive Bill before us than the one we are discussing.  If, however, it is going to be part of the comprehensive scheme, we can pardon him.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to detain the House further on this Bill.  We welcome even the small advance that has been made in it.  We are prepared to facilitate the Minister in giving it an early passage so that those who are to benefit under it will have those benefits conferred on them at the earliest possible moment. I hope the Minister will do something to rectify what must be admitted by every member of the House to be an injustice&mdash;that is, the placing of married men and single men on the same basis.  If the Minister is prepared to make that correction in the Bill, I am sure that the Dáil would not object to come back in Christmas week &mdash;we see that it has decided to take a long holiday&mdash;to rectify that injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an advantage that Senator Hawkins should plead so strongly as he has done for an improvement in the rates of benefit to be provided for people who are injured in the case of industrial accidents.  This question <Col N="409" /> has been raised on a number of occasions, as to compensating people who, through no fault of their own, are injured in the course of their employment; and it is the first time that any member of the Fianna Fáil Party suggested that there should be discrimination between the rates paid to a single man and those paid to a married man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator take up the Seanad debates on any question that arose during that particular time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to listen to the Senator quoting.  Prior to 1934 the rate of benefit payable to a person who was totally incapacitated by accident was 35/- per week.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce who was in office in 1934 brought in a Bill providing 30/- a week.  In other words, the rate of benefit was reduced in 1934, for the people already in receipt of benefit, by 5/- a week.  I did not hear any protests from the members of the Fianna Fáil Party when that was being done. There was a positive reduction of 5/-per week, being effected by the introduction of a Bill which passed through this House in 1934.  Now we have Senator Hawkins making the case that some terrible injustice has been done, and any casual reader might easily imagine that the purpose of this Bill was to reduce the rate of benefit being paid now to persons injured by accident.  On the contrary, what is being done in the Bill is to provide an immediate increase of 12/6 per week for every person who to-day is receiving payments in respect of industrial accidents.  All these people are going to have an immediate increase of 12/6 per week.  The Bill is doing something more than that, it is providing potentially an increase of 20/- a week in the compensation payable for industrial accidents, because the Emergency Powers Order under which 7/6 of the present payment of 37/6 is provided depends for its life on the annual enactment of the Supplies and Services Bill, which passed through this House last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, there is no question about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="410" />
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question for 12 months, but Deputy de Valera, on the last occasion he spoke in respect of the Supplies and Services Bill in this House, promised to drop it as early as possible.  He undertook to the people in this House who were opposed to that temporary measure, that it would be dropped as early as possible.  Senator Hawkins shakes his head; but it is on the records of the House.  It is obvious to everyone that, being a temporary measure, an Act continued from one year to another, it is not going to continue for a very long period of years.  Some permanent measure will have to be found to replace it in respect of a number of the things which are preserved under that temporary Act.  One of those things is the increment of 7/6 provided under the Emergency Powers Order made in 1944.  Let us not contemplate what would happen if the temporary measure of 1946 is not continued: it is enough to say that this Bill provides an immediate increase of 12/6 for every person now in receipt of compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1934 or under any of the older Acts&mdash;that of 1906, 1897 or 1900, or other Acts.  There cannot be many of them now, but it is conceivable that there are many people who got compensation under the Act of 1906, when the limit was £1 per week, and who are going to be brought up to 50/-.</P>
      <P>Two questions have been raised by Senator Hawkins.  One is this discrimination in favour of married men. He himself was quick to admit that there must be many single men with dependents, so it is not merely a question of saying that a married man should have £5 and a single man 50/-. That does not meet the case.  One must consider the question of dependency as a whole, and it is not something you can settle by putting down a short amendment to this Bill.  It is obvious that, if we come back this week and even the following week to get this Bill through by the 1st January, we still could not get all the matters he wants put into it.  I think he is suffering under an illusion on the principle of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have recollection of <Col N="411" /> having read a document prepared by the Senator that would make provision for cases of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, and I am coming to that now, since that is the only sensible thing I have heard to-day from Senator Hawkins on the subject. There is a method of dealing with this scheme, but it is not the method that Senator Hawkins suggested, of amending this Bill.  You cannot do that; you must have a new principle.  I am going to suggest to the Senator &mdash; and apparently he has been studying the matter&mdash;that you have to take this plan out of the hands of insurance companies if you are to make proper provision for people injured in the course of their employment.  I do not think the Senator is aware that, out of every £1 paid in premiums by the ordinary employer to protect himself against claims under the Workmen's Compensation Act, the insurance company puts 10/-in its pocket, or roughly 50 per cent. As a matter of fact, when the inquiry was held by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, before the 1934 Act was introduced, the evidence given then showed that only 48 per cent. of the premium income was returned by the insurance companies to the injured workmen&mdash;and that that 48 per cent. included the lawyers' and doctors' fees incurred by him in establishing his claim under the Act.  If there is to be proper provision for injured workmen, we must proceed on a totally different basis.  If the Senator has read closely the document to which he has already referred, he will discover that that was recognised by some of us many years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other matters that require to be dealt with in the amending legislation to which the Minister has already referred.  I do not know whether we can discuss them here.  I am afraid we cannot, because we are merely concerned with increasing the weekly payment, subject to other small rectifications of the law as it stands. I do not want to spread myself out on that.  It is enough to say that I am satisfied there is a good case for leaving the whole question over to be dealt <Col N="412" /> with in a new measure based on new principles.  I think you have got to have workmen's compensation tied up with unemployment insurance, with sickness insurance and with the general scheme which is now universally described under the heading of social security.  I think this must be linked up with the social scheme as a whole. My own view about it is that it should be based on the principle that when a man is ill he should get adequate compensation under some heading, whether you call it sickness benefit or compensation or whatever you may call it.  If he is ill and unable to follow his occupation and he has a wife or others depending on him, there must be some scheme by which anxiety would be removed from his home to give him a chance to recover rapidly without suffering, in addition to his other ailments, the anxiety which poverty is bound to cause.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we ought not to delay in considering whether this Bill should be amended.  I do not think it can. There were amendments put down in the Dáil, but they were ruled out on the ground that they were outside the scope of the Bill and proposed to widen it.  I do not think we can do very much about it.  But what you can do is to give encouragement to the Minister to proceed with a different scheme, a scheme which will provide adequate benefit in such circumstances that a person need not go into court and waste his money trying to establish before the court whether or not he has been injured by an accident, or whether he is malingering or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdmundSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with two points for the consideration of the Minister.  One is the undoubted increase which there will be upon employers on the passing of this Bill. I want to deal with one section of employers with whom I have some familiarity, and that is the farming community.  Whatever Senator Duffy may say about insurance companies it is quite clear that, on the passing of this Bill there will be a serious increase in the premiums that must be paid under the Workmen's Compensation <Col N="413" /> Act.  I know that these premiums are heavy enough as it is upon the farmer, and I should like to address my remarks to what I call the smaller farmer who has two or three workmen. Such an increased weekly payment will mean something to him and something very definitely oppressive upon him.  As Senator Hawkins suggests, we have already heard about an increase and, possibly, a further increase of rates.</P>
      <P>We are hearing continuously about the burden laid upon the employer.  I am not so much interested in the larger employer, who has ways and means of shifting the burden off his shoulders on to the shoulders of the consumers.  In the case of the smaller farmer, however, this is going to be a heavy cost.  I am going to ask the Minister, when he comes to the comprehensive code which he promised to introduce, not to be bound by the 50/&mdash;-I am going to say, to be absolutely fair, that possibly he may think the 50/- too little&mdash;but that he will not be bound by a calculation to-day that will be very different even in the few months when he comes to make his final calculation in connection with the comprehensive scheme, because it is quite possible that by the time he comes to make his comprehensive scheme such employers as I am discussing will either have had their prices increased, in which event they will be better able to pay the increased charges, or they may have their overheads increased elsewhere, in which event they will be less able to pay. It is unnecessary for me to say to the Minister, because he is well aware of the fact, that he cannot go on injecting air in the inflationary balloon all the time, because it will burst at some stage.  This is a further injection of air into the inflationary balloon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a person who has practised in the courts and earned good or bad fees, depending on your views of lawyers, out of this Act, I may say that in many cases at the moment farmers are not insuring under the Act.  For what it is worth, I should like to issue this warning to the Minister&mdash;that, if you make the premiums very much higher, fewer <Col N="414" /> smaller farmers will insure, and you will have the cases of extreme hardship that I come across every second week in the courts where a man has a leg whipped off in a threshing machine or his arm taken off in a sawmill and he is not insured and we never can get a penny piece from the farmer who employs him.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in Senator Hawkins' views in regard to the married man.  He is in agreement with the principle in the Act that, when a man has met with a catastrophe, he should be recompensed for it.  But it seems to me that he wants to compensate a man for a further catastrophe, and that is for being married.  I do not think that is very complimentary to his wife.  Perhaps, the Senator will think about that.  With all respect to Senator Hawkins, who has been far longer in this House than I have been, we could not workably differentiate between the married and the unmarried man, for this reason, to give a simple example.  If a man the day after he is married meets with an injury, he gets paid more than he would if he met with an injury the day before his wedding, although he is engaged to get married. If he works on the day before his wedding and is injured, he has to do with the 37/6 until such time as a change comes here.  How you are to differentiate between the married man and the unmarried man I cannot see, or the married man with one child and the married man with five or six children. I believe that the married man who meets with an injury is harder hit.  I would say, however, to Senator Hawkins that I do not think that any system of legislation can effectively help the married man as against the single man.  To sum up, I urge on the Minister to give some indication that he is sympathetic towards the view I am putting, that this increased cost is putting a further load on the type of person I am speaking for, namely, the smaller farmer, which he is ill-suited to bear at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take up consideration of this Bill with the remarks which have been made by Senator Sweetman.  I cannot see how you will differentiate in the payment of compensation between the married man and the single man.  As Senator Duffy put it, why should a married man with dependents get preferential treatment over a single man with dependents? It seems to me there is a simple solution to the whole problem.  If, as the Minister says, compensation for total incapacity is to be fixed at 50/-, or any figure at all, if there is total incapacity, compensation, in my opinion, should be fixed at the amount that the man was learning when he was injured.  That will cover both the married man and the single man.  That is the only fair basis on which compensation could be assessed, I think, because if a man suffers total incapacity and is prevented by an accident from earning his living again, surely he is entitled to such compensation as will enable him to continue to live, to rear his family or to maintain his dependents in the same way as he was doing prior to the accident.  That is one point, I think, that should be considered.  It does not come under this Bill, but as the principle will have to be considered at some time, and, as new legislation and, perhaps, a whole new principle will be adopted in the future, I think it should be kept in mind.  I do not see any equity in awarding a man less than he was able to earn because, by an accident, he has been rendered unfit or incapable of earning anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sweetman also pointed out that insurance was not compulsory.  I suppose that under the new scheme which is in contemplation it will be compulsory just as other forms of insurances are, but he mentioned, as somebody before him did, that whatever increase there may be in contemplation there is bound to be an increase in the premiums charged by the insurance companies to cover the increased compensation.  Maybe there will be, but that does not necessarily seem to involve an increase in the cost <Col N="416" /> of living.  The increase in the cost of the premium will not be such an enormous amount on the small farmer that the cost of living will go up on the people in the cities.  Even if it did, however, mean a considerable sum on an employer who employs a great number of people, I think it is more equitable that an employer should have to pay increased premiums, if he must, rather than that the workers should continue to risk the loss of life or a limb without adequate compensation. It is a choice of two evils, whether it is a greater hardship on the employer to have to pay a couple of pence or a shilling a week&mdash;though perhaps it would not be absolutely necessary to pay an additional shilling or two&mdash;or that to save him from that the workman must accept inadequate payments such as are made now and as will be made even when this temporary measure is passed.  I have no criticism of this as a temporary measure which is a considerable improvement on the position as it is at present, but it is only a temporary measure.  I hope that when the Minister comes to examine the whole question of compensation he will evolve some newer and better scheme to deal with all the problems which are left undealt with or unsatisfactorily dealt with under the Bills we have at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill because I think it is only time that people should get more compensation in case of injury than they have received in the past. The increase in the premiums will not be such that any employers, I think, will find the burden of them anything to cry about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister when he is introducing the new insurance Act to ensure as far as possible that people who are not entitled to compensation do not get it.  There have been many unrecorded miracles in the past and I believe that employers and workers alike would hope to see this thing stopped, because insurance in some cases can become a burden.  In the building trade at present workmen's compensation insurance is very heavy. I believe that if a number of these false claims could be exposed there would <Col N="417" /> be a reduction.  Action has been taken in other countries which has narrowed down the number of miracles that take place.</P>

      <P>I am very happy to welcome this Bill, and I consider it long overdue.  Reference has been made to the possibility of fear arising in the minds of small farmers at the possibility of increased premiums, but, as far as my knowledge goes of small farmers in Ireland, there are no grounds for any fear of that nature, because surely the small farmer is really concerned with having proper provision for his injured workmen.  I think that up and down through the country you <Col N="418" /> will find no instance where the small farmer and employer would like to see his injured workmen put on the basis of compensation that we have known in past years.  I rose to speak on this Bill for that reason alone, that I think it is unjust to attribute to small farmers the possibility of a fear arising from the possibility of his paying a higher premium on his policy of insurance. The farmer regrets as much as anybody in the country the miserable pittances which have been paid to workmen in the past.  The Minister is to be congratulated on bringing in this Bill, and providing the machinery for increased compensation in very deserving cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not very much to say on this Bill and my principal object in rising is to ask the Minister a question.  I agree with Senator Woulfe that the small farmer, the large farmer or any class of farmer, has no objection, and that they would feel very sorry if a workman injured in their employment was not properly compensated. As Senator Hawkins said, the whole cost of the insurance is going to come from paying bigger premiums, and no farmer will object if it is necessary to pay bigger premiums.  There is one point where I would not agree with Senator Woulfe, when he said how anxious they are for compensation for their employees.  There are still a big number of them who, to my knowledge, are not insured under the Workmen's Compensation Act, and it is very foolish for themselves.  As Senator Sweetman pointed out, he has cases in the court every day where they are not insured, and where an injured workman cannot get any compensation whatever except by selling out a farmer.  I feel that if it were made compulsory on employers employing workmen to take out insurance, it would lower the premiums for those who are anxious to have their insurance properly set out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Objection has been taken to the Bill on the ground that the amount of compensation, 50/-, is small, but the position is that, if a man, during a period of incapacity, is to get the same amount as he earns when working, there is a great danger of malingering <Col N="419" /> taking place.  The man who is not working constantly is not entitled to the full compensation and I think the 50/- is very reasonable.  I know of one case, and there are possibly others, of a farmer who had two accidents involving employees within a year and his insurance company refused to take him on.  He felt very sore about it, because it looked as if it were being suggested that he was standing in with his workmen to get the compensation, which was quite untrue.  If an insurance company refuses to take on a farmer, is there any provision to compel the company to do so?  I understand that there is not at present, and I should like to know if the Minister, in the new Bill, will make it compulsory on an insurance company to accept an employer who wishes to take out insurance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBurke" hpid="Mr. R.M. Burke Mr. R.M. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of the speeches made here to-day emphasise the point that the only satisfactory and ideal way to deal with this whole matter eventually under the comprehensive scheme is State insurance against accidents, and I believe we should try to work up public opinion so that the public will eventually agree to that solution.  This measure, as a temporary measure, is a very good move in the right direction, and I believe that many thousands of people throughout the country will be very pleased and will congratulate the Minister on the improvement which is being brought about.  But it should be emphasised that it is only a temporary measure, until such time as the comprehensive scheme can be brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One point against this proposal which has been mentioned is that 50/- a week, although a good deal better than was <Col N="420" /> ever paid in the past, may be small to the man who has been earning £8 or £10 a week.  In reply to that point, I think the man earning £8 or £10 a week could well afford to take out a private insurance policy to get additional cover for himself in case of accident, if he wished to receive more than 50/-.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>A wage of £8 or £10 a week was never mentioned, so far as I can recollect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBurke" hpid="Mr. R.M. Burke Mr. R.M. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the scheme is to cover people with incomes up to £500 per year, which would include people with £8 and £10 almost a week.  As I said, these people could afford to have a private insurance policy to supplement the 50/-.  The 50/-per week will, I think, be heartily welcomed by tens of thousands of wage-earners with small incomes, because it is far more than they ever got before, and agricultural labourers and others in that income group will regard it as a wonderful improvement.  If we are to have a satisfactory comprehensive scheme, however, I believe that public opinion will have to be gradually worked up, until such time as the nation as a whole is willing to spend more of the national income on social insurance.  I believe that, as a nation, we could afford to spend more on social insurance, I believe it would be a very good way for us to spend more of our income, instead of spending as much as is now spent by the wealthy sections of the community on luxuries and amusements.  If more of the national income were spent on social insurance it would mean greater happiness for many thousands of people during sickness and during disablement resulting from accidents, and it would mean a happier nation as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that he was very loath to interfere with workmen's compensation provisions because of the near approach of the Social Services Bill.  It would possibly be unfair to ask the Minister to give even an approximate date for the introduction of that Bill, but I take it the Minister envisages workmen's compensation as being part <Col N="421" /> of it.  He did not say that and I wonder if he was deliberately skirting around the point.</P>
      <P>The real matter is that this compensation takes the form of a flat rate of compensation, because of the very different earnings of various sections. I quite see that there would be tremendous difficulty in finding out, in the case of every employee, his weekly earnings, but certainly, as between the agricultural labourer and the skilled artisan, there is an injustice in the flat rate.  I am not suggesting that the Minister should hold up this measure and make alterations in it, but I want to point out to him that the whole workmen's compensation code is frightfully complicated.  There are, I think, three sets of procedure open to a workman who receives an injury, without taking into account what usually happens, namely, the employer saying to the worker: &ldquo;You have received an injury which was not your fault, and I think you are entitled to compensation.&rdquo; Another point is that there is a frightful difficulty in separating the genuine cases of injury and the cases in which the worker feels that he is presented with an opportunity of making a bit of money.  I am not suggesting for a moment that there are not genuine accidents from which great hardships arise, but I should like the Minister to deal with these points when replying.</P>

      <P>I was spurred into making a few remarks by the suggestions put forward by Senator Denis Burke, who, I am afraid, was preparing to step into the inflationary balloon when he told us how to spend our income.  How to spend our income is a subject for a first-class debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that, before the Minister considers bringing forward his comprehensive scheme, he should take some solid evidence of what the income is, and where it comes from.  Nobody can deny that the scheme that he has brought in is an excellent one and that, perhaps, it was overdue.  We hear a lot about the small farmer.  I do not know if he is to be judged by the area of land that he occupies or by the part that his head or his heart plays in controlling <Col N="422" /> him.  It would, in my opinion, be a healthier sign for the nation if the Government would examine the question: what is the difference between the small farmer and the big farmer who attempts to pay his workers a living wage?  In my opinion, the big farmer is a greater asset to the country.  From the point of view of production, he is producing more.  A man requires to have a certain acreage of land to enable him to give the best results to the State.  If the land is not rested, it will lose its fertility.  Far be it from me to fault the present Minister for Agriculture for what he has done.</P>

He has to try and give a living wage to his workers. The small farmer is working for himself, and his children are helping him.</P>

Burke's speech, as to how we should spend our income, that brought me to my feet. We are told that we are to have a comprehensive scheme from the Minister. Where is the money to come from for that?  I ask Senators to grasp this fact that the big farmer should be encouraged, to enable him to pay a living wage to his workers.  Do not burden him with further additional <Col N="423" /> rates and taxes.  In my early days, I was told that these charges should not represent more than one-tenth of a man's income.  I ask Senators, in conclusion, to remember the sacrifices that have been demanded from the land and the country in the past 16 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fortunate for me that I have not to approach the consideration of this Bill from the point of view of the farmer.  I feel that I should say right out that I think the Minister is deserving of congratulations on the forward step he has taken in this Bill.  In my young days I worked at the bench and in the machine shop, and saw the tragedy that could come to a man, through no fault of his own, but because of an incapacity he suffered as a result of an accident at his work. We are living in modern times.  We have got a more enlightened outlook than people had 40 years ago.  I feel that we are going to make a big step forward by allaying a lot of quite reasonable discontent by removing from the workman, to some extent at all events, the fear of want that hitherto faced him when, by reason of an accident, he was unable to continue his employment.</P>
      <P>Now a good case can be made for State insurance in this particular matter.  I hate State interference so much that I am not going to advocate it.  I feel, however, that since the provisions in this Bill are going to mean what I shall describe as a new load for the farmer and the industrialist, it should not be possible for insurance companies catering for workers, or for insurance generally, either to refuse business or to increase premiums.  I am all for private enterprise in insurance. I feel that it should be within the realms of possibility and probability that, when the insurance companies are confronted with the new problems arising from this Bill, uniform rates can be established and can be uniformly applied to all sorts of risks incidental to the payment of these additional benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had speeches from the two Senator Burkes.  I am going to deal first with the speech which was made <Col N="424" /> by Senator Robert Burke.  He urged that more money should be spent on social insurance schemes than on luxuries or amusements.  Unless I misunderstood him, the inference to be drawn from the Senator's speech was that it was the better classes who were squandering money on amusements. I would suggest to the Senator that he should take a walk down O'Connell Street some night, and see for himself the huge queues outside the picture houses, and, in addition, should make a study of the people who compose these queues.  If he does so I think he will find that to the extent of 95 per cent. they are composed of what I shall call, for the want of a better word, the working classes.  I suggest that a big proportion of the wages that are being paid in the country are going on that type of amusement.  Of course, it is quite within the competence of a worker to do that if he wishes.  Let us not, however, confuse the issue, or imagine that it is the better class people who are prodigal in the spending of money. In my opinion it is the other way about&mdash;that working class people are more prodigal in the spending of money than the better off people.</P>
    <P>Senator Denis Burke referred to the possibility of malingering.  I have dealt with this on other aspects of social insurance and I do not think the danger is as great in the case of a man injured in his job, as in the case of a man temporarily incapacitated and who holds on to the benefit rather than go back to work.  My experience is that a man injured by accident is very anxious to get back to work.  This is a temporary measure, but it is a move in the right direction, and will give some relief from grievances of working men, industrious men, with limited incomes, who are incapacitated by accident and have to run into debt until they can get back to work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, like Senator Summerfield, and am rather perturbed by the attacks on State insurance in the course of this debate. I suppose we are no different from other people and are always anxious to get something for nothing.  Over <Col N="425" /> the years there have been complaints from two sides&mdash;the meagre amount of the old age pension compensation and other services&mdash;and still we are not prepared to pay for them.  We expect to find an unlimited pool here into which we can dip and take out without questioning where we shall get the wherewithal to fill the pool.  There is no use in saying that we are opposed to State insurance and would rather have private insurance.  That is all very well, but human nature being what it is, very few of us favour insurance for any purpose at all, particularly for sickness or accident.  In the main, when anything happens we depend on the State.</P>
      <P>I do not see why Senator McGee or other employers should object to paying their share to insure their workers, if through accident or sickness they are not able to carry on their work.  The trouble is&mdash;and the Minister admitted it on the last occasion, when he was dealing with other social services legislation which he introduced&mdash;that there has always been objection from the trade union point of view, which represents the working class, about the amount of money that is to be got if a person becomes sick or meets with an accident. The remedy for that is to increase the insurance for sickness and to put the old age pension on a voluntary basis. I always felt it was rather strange that, when an accident happens, the amount of money given was so small.  It has been increased, I know, but I agree with Senators who state that there should be something of a differential rate between rural and city or borough areas in the case of accidents.  I appreciate that you can raise this compensation too near the regular rate in the district and may encourage malingering. Senator Summerfield says there is not much danger of malingering in the case of this particular social service, but you will have it in others.  If the Minister meets the suggestion about differential rates, I think the city worker should be prepared to pay more for his compensation than you ask the rural worker to pay.  I welcome this Bill and believe it will mark an improvement in the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this Bill.  My views have always been a little unorthodox, as it always seemed to me that workmen's compensation for injury is an essential part of the cost of production or distribution.  It is inevitable that there will be accidents, even though we take every care to minimise them, while there is progress and change; and the cost of these accidents is part of the cost of production or distribution as the case may be.  It has to be borne and treated as part of the actual cost.  Therefore, it does not seem to me that it can be viewed exactly in the same way as an additional tax.  We are not dealing with what is proper or reasonable profit, as profit must include adequate compensation.</P>
      <P>I have never felt that the law is really proper or satisfactory in the case of injury.  I cannot help feeling that, particularly where there are dependents, during the time in which a man is incapacitated, he wants not less but rather more wages to get him back to his job.  I am not dealing with it purely from the sentimental point of view, though I have a certain amount of sentimental feeling in regard to it.  If the man is to take his place in industry, he will not do so as quickly if the wage he gets during the period he is out is so low that he cannot get better and keep his family at the same time. Therefore, I have personally always supported improvements and would be prepared to go considerably further than this Bill goes.  Every man and woman&mdash;but particularly men&mdash;who has dependents, has a duty to be insured against accidents.  If the State should come in and provide that it is done by the employer where the level is such that the persons cannot be reasonably expected to do it themselves, I would personally like&mdash;though I do not suppose I would support the Bill and I am sure if I were Minister I would not be prepared to introduce it&mdash;that we could get such a public opinion that every man, when he got married, and certainly when he had children, would feel a moral duty on his part to provide against accidents.</P>

      <P>That raises another point, which I will not deal with now. I am dealing with the question of life. There is a moral duty, and the State steps in in the case of the lower-paid workers.  I would like everyone&mdash; leaving out whether it is the duty of the churches to deal with this or not &mdash;to feel a moral duty, on getting married, and particularly on having children, to provide for insurance out of his income.  Whether he has a higher wage, sufficient to enable him to provide for accidents, or whether it has to be done through the employer, it is something morally desirable, and it is good politics.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I support the Bill, and would be prepared to support it even further.  I know there is a difficulty, particularly in sickness, in regard to malingering, but I entirely agree with Senator Summerfield that it is not difficult to prevent malingering in the case of accidents, which can be dealt with easily by the doctors.  I will not be satisfied until it is possible to provide that a man who meets with an accident in the course of his employment, which is part of his job, is able to draw, for some reasonable time, the sum which he was earning when he was working.  I believe that that is part of the total cost of the goods or services rendered, and that it is the rate at which he should be paid.</P>

      <P>There is no more pitiable spectacle than the man who, through accident, is deprived of the power of providing for himself and his family.  Therefore, anything that can be done to help him should be welcomed generously by both sides of the House.  The Workmen's Compensation Acts were almost the first glimmer of a social conscience; and as the social conscience develops so should this particular aspect of it be discussed in a more enlightened way.  I welcome this Bill because it means progress.  We know that 50/- a week in these times is not enough, but it it better than 37/6, so we should be glad that it is secured to the people who need it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question needs a great deal of consideration and it has not been easy to give that consideration on a Bill of such limited scope as the <Col N="428" /> present one.  It would be wise of the Minister to bring in a Bill of wider scope than the present one.  This is, in a way, an emergency Bill to meet the harsh conditions that are imposed on people by the high cost of living. The Minister's object is to ease that hardship to some extent.  This Bill does that and, for that reason, I for my part and for those who think as I do on this side, will congratulate the Minister on having introduced it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephMeighan" hpid="Mr. Meighan Mr. Meighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meighan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Bill.  I was impressed by the remarks of Senator Douglas with regard to the necessity for everybody being insured, even out of his own private resources. For the last couple of years it has been brought home to me, and I think to anybody who reads the newspapers, that scarcely a season passes but you have some accidents in connection with threshing.  Of course I think there is a good deal of carelessness in connection with that.  It is only in the past four or five years in the West of Ireland that many of these threshing sets have been in use.  Anybody knowing the West will understand that on threshing days it is usual for a number of farmers to join and assist.  If a farmer cannot go himself to help a neighbour, he sends a man, if he has a man.  While many farmers pay the national health insurance for their men, I think the percentage of them who insure under the Workmen's Compensation Act is very small.  I am speaking of farmers who employ a man or two.  Very few of them, I think, have their men insured under the Act. I would go so far as to suggest that it would be wise for the Government to take steps to make insurance under the Workmen's Compensation Act compulsory. In connection with the giving of licences to tractor owners and owners of threshing sets, I think it should be made compulsory on them to take out a comprehensive policy of insurance. Some of them have such a policy, but quite a number have not.  The result is that when an accident occurs great hardship is caused, and it might mean the wiping out of a small farmer.</P>

      <P>I support this Bill as I believe the increase is badly <Col N="429" /> needed.  I agree with Senator Douglas when he says that the man who meets with an accident would really need as much if not more than he had been earning before.  I am sure everybody will agree with the principle of the Bill. In that respect, I should like to point out, however, the effects of the increased premiums.  We ought to consider carefully the effect of these.  I believe that the time is coming when the State will have to take a hand in this kind of insurance, as it would be beyond the means of the ordinary farmers.  Those engaged in agriculture find that insurance companies have the greatest dislike to taking on this kind of insurance.  Only one or two of them will undertake it now.  Very often farmers find the greatest difficulty in getting an insurance company to insure them under the Act.  The premiums have been very high for some years back and, without doubt, they will be raised further now.</P>
      <P>There are two points in connection with the increase to which I should like to refer.  The last speaker told us that a very large proportion of the farmers in the West do not insure at all.  That is a very serious thing, because it means that, when an accident occurs, the injured man is perhaps left helpless for the rest of his life and has no means of getting anything from his employer if that employer is a poor man.  It means also that the farmers are subjected to very heavy law costs.  There is a great deal to be said for the principle of compulsory insurance.  Perhaps, if insurance was compulsory there would be more equitable premiums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that in raising these insurance premiums, together with raising the National Health Insurance contribution and the other contributions, you are placing an unduly heavy burden on the man who employs labour as compared with the man who does not employ labour. For instance, a farmer with good land has two alternatives.  He can work his farm and keep cows, etc., and employ men or he can simply turn in dry cattle on it and employ no men except the one in his gate lodge and make more profits even than the working farmer. You put a premium on that kind of <Col N="430" /> farmer, the non-working farmer, and you increase the burden on the man who does work his farm.  In the long run, you will hit the workers, because, the greater the burden, the fewer men will be employed.  On the whole, I think there is no escape from the fact that the State will eventually have to take up this question of insurance and, if insurance is made compulsory, the premiums will be placed on a more equitable basis so that they will not bear unduly on industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hawkins opened with criticism of this Bill, a very artificial criticism, of course, as the Senator almost felt himself.  If he were not the &ldquo;good companion&rdquo; that I believe him to be, I might make serious comments and, perhaps, harsh comments on the criticism which he attempted to offer.  May I, however, compliment the Senator on making a brave show with very poor material in an effort to write down what he must know in his heart as a citizen, even though he may not pretend to know it as a Fianna Fáil Senator, is a good Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us get the background of this whole business.  In 1934 an Act was passed by the Fianna Fáil Government, and from 1934 until 1943 nothing was done to increase the compensation payable to insured workmen.  In fact, when the Fianna Fáil Government passed the 1934 Act, the maximum compensation up to then payable to an insured workman was 35/- per week.  The Fianna Fáil Government in the 1934 Workmen's Compensation Act reduced the maximum from 35/- to 30/- per week in the case of total incapacity.  Therefore, the Fianna Fáil Government, having started out in 1934 to bring down the ceiling of compensation from 35/- to 30/-, did nothing from then until 1943, when, by pressure of economic circumstances, they stepped up the compensation from a maximum of 30/- per week to a maximum of 37/6 per week.  In other words, they provided for an increase in weekly compensation by 25 per cent.  That is where Fianna Fáil left workmen's compensation benefits between 1934 and December, 1938. Fianna Fáil stepped up workmen's compensation benefits by 25 per cent., <Col N="431" /> but this Bill is doing one simple job and it is stepping up the compensation, not by 25 per cent. but by 66 per cent.  If you look at the Bill from the point of view of the injured workman, whether he meets with an accident in the future or whether he has met with an accident in the past, I think it is doing a very good job, and I think that, privately, Senator Hawkins would agree with that, although he made a pretty brave show this afternoon with very poor material, and it was obvious that he had not his heart in the case he was trying to make.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins was in a very difficult role this evening and it is always a difficult role for anybody in a similar position to be on both sides of the fence at the same time.  Senator Hawkins said &ldquo;it should be better&rdquo; and then he put a barricade before that pious aspiration of his saying &ldquo;What is the cost of this to the farmer?&rdquo;  The whole background of workmen's compensation is that the workman does not insure himself under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  The traditional practice here and in Britain has been that the employer is compelled to insure his injured workman.  If you wanted to take the line that the injured workman is entitled to full pay when he is injured, well and good; you can do it and we can frame legislation accordingly, but you cannot suggest that you are entitled at the same time to say, &ldquo;What about the cost to the man who pays?&rdquo;  That was Senator Hawkins' particularly difficult role this evening.  He showed, however, a skill which at times I admired, during the course of his speech.  He managed for a short time, though rather uneasily, to ride both horses, but I think he was very glad when he was on the ground of reality again.  Senator Hawkins said that the compensation should be better. Maybe it should, but is this a fair point to put to Senator Hawkins in a vocational Seanad?  Whatever the difficulties of workmen's compensation have been&mdash;and they have been bad for 14 years and particularly bad since 1939&mdash;nobody as far as I know, prevented the last Government from stepping up the rates of benefit, nor was <Col N="432" /> the legislative programme terribly crowded because I think we passed Bills regulating the netting of immature fish and regulating tidal waters under the Fianna Fáil Government and heaven knows if Senator Hawkins broached the stepping up of the rates of workmen's compensation I have a shrewd suspicion that his influence in the Fianna Fáil Party is such that the injured workmen's wives and children would at least take precedence over the regulating of tidal waters or the netting of immature fish.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make any political point about that at all, but I feel sure that Senator Hawkins is, in fact, behind this Bill and that in yester years or, in fact, in yester months he would be very glad to come in here and say: &ldquo;This is another milestone on the road to a Fianna Fáil El Dorado.&rdquo;  I sympathise with the Deputy in not being able to say that, but I say to him that the El Dorado, as far as it is humanly possible for ordinary mortals on this earth, will be accomplished much more quickly now, as this Bill fairly indicates.</P>
    <P>The point has been made by some Senators that we should pay a special rate of benefit to an injured workman who is married and has children compared with the rate paid to the injured workman who is unmarried.  Frankly, I am attracted to a scheme of that kind and I have spent a good deal of time examining the matter.  I think, however, that it must be examined closely and no examination of the problem can be complete without a knowledge of the imperfections of our present workman's compensation.  Our present workmen's compensation code enables an injured workman to recover benefit against an employer but it does not compel an employer to insure, with the result that a person may employ another to do some work for him and if the person employed meets with an accident he can sue the employer.  The employer is not compelled to insure, with the result that the employed person must get what he can against whatever estate his employer has with all the possible financial fallibility surrounding the said estate.  It has been found that where an employer does not <Col N="433" /> insure, particularly when he is a small employer, very frequently his reluctance to insure is accompanied by an inability for financial reasons to effect the insurance.</P>
    <P>Suppose we were to introduce a scheme by which you pay a single man a certain rate of compensation, a married man a much higher rate and a married man with children a still higher rate.  I am still attracted to that scheme and I hope that before many years have passed we will see it implemented, but I think that if we follow the present pattern of workmen's compensation legislation we would be making a fatal mistake in doing so because once an employer is not compelled to insure, if he carries his own risk he will want to make that risk as light as possible.  He may say: I am going to insure my workmen out of my trouser's pocket and if they meet with an accident I will pay, but to make sure that the demand on my trouser's pocket is not very great, if I have to make a choice of recruiting as a workman a single man or a man who has got a wife and two or more children, my liability will be greater according to the domestic liability of the workman I employ.  Take as an example a farmer who says: I want a workman. I cannot afford to insure him because I do not feel like giving the insurance company the premiums they now demand for insurance, but at the same time I want to make sure that if I have to employ him I will have to cover him under the Workmen's Compensation Act because if I do not cover him with an insurance company I will have to pay him myself.  Take the case of an individual farmer as a matter of simplicity.  When he wants a workman the obvious thing for him, if he wants to reduce his risk under a scheme whereby you pay a higher rate to a married man with children, is to say: I will employ a single workman who has no dependents whatever because that is the cheapest form of workman I can employ under the Workmen's Compensation Act.</P>
    <P>If you had a scheme following the present pattern of workmen's compensation legislation whereby you paid preferential rates to married workmen with children you would impose on that <Col N="434" /> individual farmer a liability to face a risk substantially higher than the risk if he employed a single man and preferably a single man without any dependents whatever within the meaning of the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1934.</P>
    <P>I still like the scheme by which the married man, his wife and children, would play some part in the fixation of the compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act, but you just simply cannot do it under the present pattern of workman's compensation.  I hope to do it, but it can only be done under a State scheme of workman's compensation, under which all those who employ people will pay a certain comprehensive contribution and under-which it will avail them nothing whether they employ single or married men, because the whole contribution they pay, with the worker's contribution, will go into a common pool to meet the collective responsibility.</P>
    <P>But if I were to attempt under this Bill to provide special rates for the married man with a wife and children, I fear&mdash;and I think that trade unionists with the background of Senator Colgan will appreciate this point&mdash;that you might put a premium on recruiting single men.  While that might not happen in the City of Dublin, where you have organised employers' associations and organised trade unions, the latter having considerable bargaining strength, it might well happen in country areas, because a small contractor doing a road job, a sewerage job or a water job might go to the local exchange and say: &ldquo;I intend to carry my own workmen's compensation risk but, so that it will be as small as possible, I want you to send me 50 single men, and, if you can, 50 men who have no adult depending on them.&rdquo; If the exchange does not do that, he could still sieve them out by interview, cutting his risk as low as possible.  If he chose to take that line, I could not protect the married man under any legislation at my disposal or at the disposal of my predecessor to ensure that he would get a fair chance of employment.  If you put a premium for workmen's compensation purposes on the employment of single men, and <Col N="435" /> particularly single men with no dependents, I could not protect the married man.</P>
    <P>While I have a lot of sympathy with the point of view so expressed and have explored that point of view many times, and while I still think it would be possible to attain that objective ultimately, it can only be done on the basis of a national scheme of insurance, under which it will not matter to the employer whether his employee is a single or a married man, because his contribution will be the same.  From the views expressed here on the subject and in the Dáil, I think that will not be a matter of any profound political disagreement when we reach the stage at which that objective will be attainable.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator Hawkins who expressed some doubt as to the power in the Bill to declare what the appointed day for its implementation will be.  The House may take it from me that I want to make this appointed day as soon as possible, and, with the co-operation of the Seanad to-day, I hope to make the appointed day the first of January, so as to make sure that this Bill will go into operation at the earliest opportunity.  The &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; is put in the Bill only to convenience the Houses of the Legislature, and I hope it will be possible, with the co-operation of the Seanad, to fulfil my intention of putting the Act into complete operation on the appointed day, so as not only to enable those who may meet with accidents after the appointed day to get the increased compensation payable under the Bill, but so as to make sure that those who have met with accidents in the past and who are now tied down to compensation of 37/6 a week will be enabled to have their compensation stepped up to the maximum of 50/- per week.  In doing that I do not think I am doing anything but the barest justice to a large number of people who have seen their compensation tied down to a figure which represents 25 per cent. increase on the 1934 standard, while many, if not all, sections of the community have got substantially greater increases in <Col N="436" /> their remuneration compared with 1934.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Hawkins expressed the view that the compensation provided should be greater.  If the Senator has any deep feelings in that matter and if the Chair permits him, he can put down an amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that the Chair would not accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>And I have the suspicion that the Senator would not like the Chair to accept it.  One of his colleagues in the Dáil introduced an amendment the other day&mdash;a city Deputy, admittedly&mdash;which would have meant that an agricultural worker at present paid £3 per week would get compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act amounting to 69/- per week. I know very well that Senator Hawkins is sufficiently deep in the inner circles of the Party to know that, if he suggested to the Party that an agricultural worker whose foot is injured when a horse stands on it, or who scratches his hand on a nail, should get 69/- per week as compared with 60/- per week when he does a full week's work, things might not be very harmonious at that Party meeting.  Senator Hawkins, however, still has rights in the matter, and if he can convince his own Party and the Seanad, he is still entitled to put down amendments to the Bill, but I have looked at it from this point of view.  In 1934, the rate was 30/- per week and the present position is that an injured workman gets a 25 per cent. increase on that amount.  I propose to give him a 66 per cent. increase on the 1934 rate and I think that is approaching the matter in a reasonable way, bearing in mind that the injured workman has to pay no contribution whatever towards his insurability under the Workmen's Compensation Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sweetman pointed out that one of his fears in connection with the Bill was the cost to farmers.  It is perfectly true that anybody who employs workmen has to bear that risk.  He may relay it to an insurance company and ask the company to meet his costs in the matter, but even that costs money, and it must be remembered, in that connection, that the contributions <Col N="437" /> in respect of workman's compensation are in the vicinity of £960,000 per annum, so far as the premiums of insurance companies are concerned.  If a person does not insure his workmen, he has to carry the risk himself, and&mdash;let us be perfectly clear on this&mdash;in so far as he carries the risk himself, every new piece of workmen's compensation legislation which improves the rate of benefit increases that risk. Having regard to the general movement of wages, salaries and price levels since 1934, and particularly since 1939, injured workmen are entitled to the benefit provided by this Bill.  We do not gain anything or contribute anything to the general pool by putting our heads in the sand and not realising that, as far as workmen's compensation is concerned, it has to be paid by the person who employs workmen.  Asking them to pay this higher rate is a reasonable request, especially having regard to wages, salaries and price movements since 1934.  Senator R. M. Burke talked about the risk of malingering in connection with workmen's compensation and, if I did not misunderstand him, made reference to malingering in the building trade.</P>

      <P>Of course the Senator would not.  Everybody knows that a craftsman can get 3/3 per hour for a 44, a 47 or a 48 hour week but, at present, all he can get by way of workmen's compensation if he meets with an accident in the course of his employment is 37/6 weekly.  Accordingly, if you take the normal wage, apart from overtime, apart from production bonus, and apart from a man's particular skill, who would want to malinger? Of course nobody does.  I am afraid that Senator Denis Burke completely misunderstood the position in that connection. <Col N="438" /> Senator Counihan thought that there should be compulsory insurance. I think there should be, and I congratulate the Senator on his conversion to the collective concept of life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that.  It is part of the kindness that the Senator always radiates.  But I do not think it can be done at present.  I do not think you can have the collective concept of life for workmen's compensation, when you have individual insurance companies insuring workmen, not because they want to insure workmen, but because they want to make some profit by doing so, or out of the employer who insures workmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope before the Senator sees many more winters that we will have a comprehensive social security Bill on this subject.  I am glad to have this early indication from the Senator that he will be one of the warmest supporters of the collective concept which will surround such a Bill.  I should like to say again, that the simple purpose of this Bill is to step up the rate of compensation from 37/6 to 50/- a week.  During the emergency the last Government had at its disposal the Emergency Powers Act under which it was possible to make an Order one night which would have effect the next day.  The Emergency Powers Act has since been repealed and has been replaced by the Supplies and Services Act, and, consequently, I have not the easy access for doing that that the Minister for Industry and Commerce previously had, namely to make an Order at night which would become operative next day, nor do I get in the Supplies and Services Act power to do by Order what was previously done by the Emergency Powers Act.  I have to go through the cumbersome practice of introducing an amending Bill in the Dáil and to do by means of legislation, with the slothfulness that that involves, what my predecessor in the Department of Industry and Commerce was enabled to do by means of an Order under the Emergency Powers Act.  This Bill has one purpose, and one purpose only, to step up compensation from 37/6 to 50/- weekly.  I am <Col N="439" /> sure that the whole House will agree with Senator Mrs. Concannon when she said she thought it was time that that was done.  Accordingly I bespeak the support of the House for this Bill.</P>

      <P>This particular Bill is really in the nature of a small amendment which could be done by Order, though I prefer to see it done by legislation.  I think that, before long, the time may come when we shall have to re-cast our Standing Orders under which the Cathaoirleach would have power to decide between Bills which are of a simple character and which would be virtually a resolution approving of something, and Bills of a legislative character.

It would be quite convenient for me to come here to-morrow or on next Tuesday or Wednesday.  I think we should take this out of the Party question.  I have said here over and over again, when I sat on the other side of the House, that Ministers do not belong to Parties for certain purposes: that they are just Ministers.</P>

      <P>On that question, I should like to say that I accept all the sympathy which the Minister has extended to me in the course of the debate on this Bill, and at the same time to offer him my sympathy.  I can quite appreciate that this is not the type of Bill that he would like to present to us, and that there are circumstances over which he probably has as little control as I have.  But, having put some questions to the Minister, which he did not answer, I feel that it may not be out of place that we should have some clear indication as to where we are going.  I agree with the Minister that if workmen's compensation is to continue on the present basis, it will be impossible to make provision for the type of case I have referred to.  The Minister agrees with that point of view.  The only way in which provision of that kind can be <Col N="443" /> made is under a national social security scheme.  The Minister has not informed the House, or at least if he did, I did not grasp it, whether in the social security scheme or plan, that he proposes to introduce some time in the near future, workmen's compensation will be included.  If we are going to have an amalgamation of national health insurance, unemployment insurance and other benefits and are going to leave workmen's compensation to the ordinary insurance companies and outside the scope of that amalgamation scheme, then the position is going to be as it was before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Minister for Defence (Dr. O'Higgins) Thomas Francis (Jnr.) O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Dr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper circulated with this Bill makes its contents very clear.  In the main, it is the annual Bill for the renewal of the temporary Defence Forces Act, which has a life only of one year.  When I was here in the Seanad last, discussing the Defence Forces Bill, a claim that has been repeatedly put forward in the Dáil that a permanent Act should be introduced was rather resisted here, on the grounds that, since Estimates do not come up here for review, the only opportunity the Seanad ever gets for having a word to say or a view to express on Army matters is on the annual introduction of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That particular matter was referred to again during the week in Dáil Éireann and I agreed to meet the view of the Leader of the Opposition as far as possible by trying, in connection <Col N="445" /> with the permanent Bill, to make some arrangement that it would come up annually for discussion even though it might be permanent in many of its features.  The reason for the early introduction of the Bill this year, leaving a period of some 15 months before I would have to return, is in order to give the Minister and Departmental officials adequate time so that they would not be unduly rushed in giving consideration to the permanent Bill, the skeleton of which is on the stocks.</P>
    <P>As far as this Bill goes, most of its sections are merely machinery sections, fixing dates, repeating titles, renewing definitions, that have been there all the time.  There are only five sections in which there is any new element or feature in this temporary Bill.  Section 5 deals with the question of attestation and reattestation of soldiers. Heretofore, after the soldier had completed his full period of service, if he desired to reattest he could do so for a period of two years and could keep on reattesting in periods of two years until he reached a total of ten years; but during any two-year period, by giving three months' notice, he could vacate the Army.  That meant instability in the Army and was very unsatisfactory from the point of view of the General Staff, who never knew its strength at any time for a period of three months in advance.  Section 5, while preserving the right of the soldier to reattest as heretofore, in periods of time up to a maximum of ten, lays it down that when he has reattested he cannot terminate his military engagement on three months' notice.  It leaves the ordinary Ministerial machine there. He can apply to get out of the Army in the ordinary way, that is, he can apply for release on compassionate grounds or business grounds.  All such applications, even with regard to younger soldiers, are always adequately and very sympathetically considered. In the light of that, it is obvious that, when we are dealing with the case of a man who has given his full legal period of military service, if such an application goes forward it will be considered in a very sympathetic manner. An assurance could nearly be given that when such an application goes forward he will be released.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" /> Section 6 deals with the Reserve of Officers.  Again, that is merely a matter of oiling the machine.  Applications frequently come before the Staff from officers to change from one reserve formation into another.  As the law stood up to this, that could only be done by terminating that officer's engagement and reattesting him into the other unit.  This is merely a case of oiling the machine, so that on application from the officer, if it is approved of by the General Staff, he can be transferred from one reserve formation to another.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the calling up of the Reserve.  As the law stands at the moment, if you call up a reservist for his annual period of training and&mdash; because of things that may arise, business or deaths, or anything like that&mdash;his period of annual training is broken, he cannot be called up a second time in order to complete his number of days' reserve training, with the result that he cannot get his financial grant and allowance for that particular year.  Section 7 makes it possible, where special circumstances arise, to call the reservist up at once, twice or three times, so as to give him an opportunity of doing what is regarded as the normal stretch of training and, therefore, putting him in a position where, first, he gets his training and, second, he gets the financial benefits that arise from that particular training.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the training of the cadets in the Navy.  In the course of training they had, at one period, to carry out the duties of an officer and, as it were, to understudy an officer; but according to military law they have not the authority of an officer.  We are proposing to create a new rank of midshipman, with the military power and authority of an officer, so as to get over that particular difficulty.</P>
    <P>I have left Section 8 until last, because it is the only section of anything more than mere machinery importance. Section 8 is the only section about which there may be any doubts or uneasiness, any controversy or criticism.  In Section 8 it is proposed that the civilian penalties which have been heretofore imposed on men who deserted from the Army should be <Col N="447" /> removed.  At first sight, any Senator might think that this is in some way condoning the rather serious crime of desertion or, alternatively, that by granting immunity with regard to this penalty to those who deserted you may be running the risk of encouraging desertion in the future.  From some quarters I was rather accused of having adopted that particular attitude.  I want to make it clear before I deal with the particular effect of this section that I am as conscious of my responsibilities as Minister for Defence as any Minister for Defence was before my time, and I hope that any Minister for Defence who succeeds me will be equally conscious of his responsibilities with regard to discipline in the Army and establishing healthy or unhealthy precedents.</P>
    <P>The position is this: that the military law is a drastic, ruthless code of law and, within the four corners of the military law and of the Defence Forces Act which we renew with life every single year, there are as heavy and as severe penalties for the military offence of desertion as there are in any European army.  I am not remitting any of the penalties that were in that Act from its beginning; I am not remitting any of the penalties that are imposed on deserters from any army in the world.  But I think it is bad for the <i>esprit de corps</i> of an army, whether this Army or any other army that, for military offences, military men should pass over the delinquents to be sentenced and punished by civilian boards up and down the country.</P>
    <P>If a military offence has been committed, then military men should deal with the offender in a military way. In my opinion, it is indefensible to pass the transgressor over to the Cork Corporation or the Clonmel Town Council and ask them to deal with the military offender.  But every Minister for Defence and every Minister for War, after a war is over and when he is dealing with transgressors, reaches a point where somebody or some group of persons touch the ordinary feelings of sympathy and compassion that are within the heart of every one of us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="448" /> When the war was over and we had this number of deserters listed in our books, my predecessor informed us that he got letters from mothers, wives and children asking him, if those men came back to the country, would he waive the penalty of imprisonment.  He was touched and he regarded the situation in this way.  As the war is over now, let us forget about it and get on with the job of peace, and he remitted all the military penalties of imprisonment.  He replaced those penalties, however, by the penalty of seven years of outlawry so far as employment by any body, directly or indirectly associated with public funds was concerned.  The first step towards interfering with the working of the ordinary machine was when that particular step was taken.  Let me say clearly, in case anyone may have any doubts as to my outlook on the matter, that he did the right thing.  After the war was over, with these fellows scattered over the globe, any person would have done exactly as he did.  If I were there at that time, I would have taken the same action.  I probably would have replaced that penalty by some such penalty as he imposed by the seven years' disqualification. But three years' out of that have gone by.  These people have laboured under that disqualification for three years out of these seven.  I have asked the Dáil, and now ask the Seanad, to waive the other four years.  That particular penalty in operation has worked out as a punishment of the wife and the children rather than a punishment of the individual soldier.</P>
    <P>As I said in the Lower House, I have had those men knocking at my door at night accompanied by wives and children and, as a medical man, I could see in the faces in front of me actual physical starvation and I found myself the individual charged with the direct responsibility as to whether that state of affairs was to continue or not. I made my decision in face of the picture presented to me, and I asked the Dáil during the week to take their decision in the light of that information truthfully given to them.  There is no individual sitting in this House, no matter what he may say, who in face of that picture would not take the same <Col N="449" /> decision as I took and I am asking others to take.</P>
    <P>That is the one matter in this Bill which I believe may be the subject of criticism.  The risk I am taking on it, and the risk I am asking others to take, in some way, directly or indirectly, may be interpreted as regarding the crime of desertion as not being in the field or arena of major crimes.  I do not want that impression to get abroad.  I do, however, want it to be understood that, whatever penalties we may inflict on the soldier, we should not extend them to the family. With the onset of winter, there may be minor relief schemes or drainage schemes of one kind or another for the relief of unemployment and destitution in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>If such a scheme were in operation and if one of these transgressors were living on the fringe of it in utter destitution with a wife and young children dependent upon him, I do not think one of us would stand over a situation where, by our decision and by our vote, we must say: you cannot enjoy any part of that work although there is a vacancy; you must starve and so must your wife starve and so must your children starve.  That is an act which no Christian could possibly adopt, an attitude which no Christian could defend.  All kinds of verbal red herrings have been dragged across this subject.  I like, if I am examining a body professionally, to strip that body naked and see what I am dealing with.  In this case let us face up to the question stripped naked as to whether, in fact, if any of us as individuals were faced with the situation we would not make exactly the same decision as is implemented in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil it was argued that I was displacing old I.R.A. men in order to make way for deserters.  I was one of the former myself.  I am not charged with any responsibility, or particularly with disciplinary responsibility, to give priority to any transgressor as against the man who stuck to his job, whether it was difficult, whether it was laborious, whether it was risky or monotonous, or to favour the fellow who quit.  There is no intention of doing that, but there is an intention of <Col N="450" /> removing civilian penalties from the military transgressor.  I think that at the time when those penalties were imposed the matter was not sufficiently considered.  If any of us was a military man, it would offend our <i>esprit de corps</i> to think that we were passing a transgressor over to civilians to deal with.  A number of other penalties are imposed on these men which are continuous and will continue; the loss of pension, any pay that accrued to them, the gratuity which had been accumulating for every serving soldier and the loss of unemployment benefit for the period of his army service.</P>
    <P>In addition, the record is clearly marked on the service book or the service card: this man was dismissed from the Defence Forces.  That is a disability on any man who is seeking employment whether from a local authority, a State organisation or a private employer.  I am leaving all those disabilities.  The only disability I am removing is the disqualification from employment in works financed directly or indirectly out of public funds for the next three or four years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this opportunity, and I hope that when the Bill which the Minister has promised us comes along, the annual opportunity of having a word to say on that very important subject, our Defence Forces, will be presented to us here in the Seanad.  We appreciate very much the services rendered by members of the Defence Forces in years past.  We owe a deep debt of gratitude to those people who, when the nation called, went out and left their occupations and everything dear and near to them and joined the Defence Forces.  This is a temporary measure and there is very little in it which has not been contained in the various measures of this kind which have passed through this House on other occasions.  I do not think it is necessary to deal with it at great length except with one or two sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all recognise that the Army is not a Party Army.  That had been clearly demonstrated at the change of Government in 1932.  We on this side of the House appreciate the loyal service which those men, many of whom were opposed in arms to the people who took <Col N="451" /> over in 1932, gave in the years following. I think it would be well if we made up our minds at this stage not to approach the matter of defence in the light of any Party views or of anything we may have said in the past and to remove it from the political platform. Any discussions we are to have in relation to the Defence Forces should be here in this Parliament, but one place which they should not be discussed is on the political platform.  If we can agree, even at this stage, on that, we will have made a very great advance.</P>
    <P>The Army is very essential to the life of our nation.  It is the premium which our people must pay for their freedom. Great sacrifices were made in the past to get us to the position we are in to-day and if we are going to maintain that position, and not alone maintain it but extend the freedom which we enjoy to the whole of our territory, we must be prepared to make still further sacrifices in the future to maintain those essential forces here.  I think we should have from the Minister for Defence on this occasion a clear and definite statement as to what our policy is.  We know that while the emergency is past, the world is not at peace.  We feel around us the beatings of another war and the people are anxious to know where we are going to be if war takes place.  We hear a good deal at the present time about western agreements and alliances of one kind and another.  In the course of the passage of a very important Bill through this House and the other House recently, suggestions were made about secret talks and negotiations.  I can assure the Minister that suggestions of that kind were made more in the statements of supporters of his own than from this part of the House.  I have heard a candidate of the Minister's Party in a very recent by-election asking the support of the people of one particular constituency in order to strengthen the hands of his Party and his Government to carry through to a successful conclusion negotiations which are now proceeding with another Government.  We have had no information as to whether such negotiations are taking place.  I am not suggesting that, but I am putting before the Minister a statement <Col N="452" /> made during the recent by-election by a candidate of his own Party.</P>
    <P>When the emergency was declared an appeal was made to the young people of the country to join the national forces.  Those who were in a position to do so joined the Army and others joined the other Defence Forces but each of them was prepared, if necessary, to make the supreme sacrifice in defence of the freedom we had won. The Minister has made, I would say, a very good case for Section 8 of this Bill which is before the House to-night. He has told us of the very difficult position of many of those people who joined the Army and who were induced for one motive or another to leave it, many of whom joined the armed forces of other countries.  He pictured for us the conditions under which those people exist at the present time.  They find it almost impossible to find employment and they and their wives and families are in a very bad way.</P>
    <P>We have in this country men who gave loyal service throughout the emergency, men who gave up their positions to join the Army and the various emergency forces, who to-day find themselves in exactly the same position as those about whom the Minister has spoken, who, of their own free will, abandoned their allegiance to this country and joined a foreign army.  I suggest to the Minister and to the House that if these people, of their own free will, abandoned their allegiance to the Irish State and the Irish Army and adopted the attitude that they were prepared to fight for another State, it is the duty of that State to provide work and maintenance for these people.  We can be charitable and say that these men are Irishmen&mdash; many of them were induced away for various reasons&mdash;but our first duty is to provide for those who stood loyally by this country and served up to the last.  Until I am satisfied that each and every one of these is in the position which he should occupy, after giving service to the country, I would not be prepared to support Section 8.</P>
    <P>We have been told that the previous Minister for Defence removed many of the just punishments, as they might be termed, on these people who <Col N="453" /> deserted.  If a soldier deserts, he should be dealt with by military people, and, that having been done, civilian matters should be brushed aside, and the soldier should take his stand with, and have the same rights as, every other citizen.  But that has not happened.  We had, as we know, many people here who were actively engaged as agents during that period in recruiting young men to serve in another army, and I feel that many of these young men who were induced away and whom we now describe as deserters were induced to go by that means, but be that as it may.  We have been told that the previous Minister removed every military punishment to which these people were justly liable and which would have been visited upon them, if military discipline had been strictly enforced, and that the only steps taken in respect of the maintenance of discipline was the debarring of these people for a period of years from employment or from holding any office or employment paid out of the Central Fund or any office or employment with a public body.  There is, however, one question on which I want information. Sub-section 2 of the explanatory memorandum states that the provision is necessary to cover any case in which disqualified persons may have obtained and may still be retained in any office or employment of the nature mentioned. That, to my mind, is an indication that, despite the regulations made, some of these people have already got into positions and are now in receipt of State funds which, in the light of the regulation, is illegal.</P>
    <P>In the present state of Europe and the world and in view of this country's position, it is essential that we maintain an army.  I regret that, in recent times, the necessary encouragement is not being given to young men who wish to take up Army careers and I think this Bill is a demonstration of the fact that there is a change of outlook in the matter.  I should like to see our young men being encouraged to take up military careers&mdash;those who have the inclination for such a career&mdash;and I feel that we should see more of our Army.</P>
    <P>When the British were in occupation <Col N="454" /> here, there were frequent military parades of various kinds and every encouragement was given to young men to join that army.  I think our people should have a greater pride in their Army and should be enabled to see it oftener.  We should have more of these military displays and we should look upon the Army as something of which we are justly proud.  Being justly proud of the Army, we should treat these men who serve in it with the greatest respect and admiration and should see to it that, when there is something to be given in the way of employment of one kind or another, they will have first claim on it.  They certainly have first claim on it.</P>
    <P>Some of these people may have taken the poor child to the Minister's door and presented their very pathetic case but there are people in this country who gave loyal service to the country and who could have gone there in the same manner and put their case in the very same words as those used by the people who deserted this State in its hour of greatest need: &ldquo;We are unemployed; we are hungry to-day; and we are debarred from giving our best to the State for which we were prepared to sacrifice our lives a few short months ago.&rdquo;  Until the claims of these people are satisfied and until each of them finds employment in this country, I for one will oppose the enactment of this section.</P>

      <P>I think it is very fortunate that not only have we a comprehensive and explanatory memorandum with this Bill but, also that the Minister took the trouble to give us a full explanation of the provisions of the Bill.  Let me say that I am almost 100 per cent. in agreement with the Minister's speech.  I only wish that he had dealt with one or two other points.  When we have the rare opportunity of discussing defence in a quiet atmosphere, we should go as fully as civilians are justified in going into such matters.  There has been a great deal of what I should like to call purposely muddled thinking on general defence matters.  We frequently see statements to the effect that we must have a large <Col N="455" /> Army if this country's independence is to survive.  That sounds very nice but, I am afraid, in the world of to-day that it is nonsense.  A small country with a population of 3,000,000 could at most have an Army of 300,000 men if every picked man between the ages of 17 and 60 was conscripted.  To-day 300,000 men do not go very far even when modernly equipped.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to a phrase used by the Minister when he was speaking on this Bill in the Dáil.  I draw Senators attention to the matter, because somewhat similar statements have been make or are said to have been made by other speakers while the wording and meaning were quite different.  Speaking in the Dáil on December 10th, at col. 1341 of the Official Debates the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An adequate defence plan for a small island divided into two is nearly militarily impossible.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is absolutely true.  That statement is different and has a very different meaning from the sort of language which suggests that this country will not form any defence plan so long as Partition exists.  I do not think any responsible Minister would use such words, but it is plain that that is what is being said.  We have on record now what the Minister for Defence thinks, and I am sure that anybody who examines the subject will be convinced that the Minister's statement was the correct one.  As things are to-day no small country can stand on its own feet, or its own resources if war breaks out.  At best, if it survives, it has got to co-operate with those having similar views, if that is possible. We should realise that, under present-day conditions, the survival of every small nation which has the misfortune to come within the ambit of modern war depends upon combined effort, as isolated effort is useless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to say a few words on Section 8 of the Bill.  I am sure that everyone agrees with the Minister, that desertion from an Army in a time of emergency is one of the worst crimes of which a soldier can be convicted.  There are two sorts of desertion.  Desertion <Col N="456" /> usually means running away from your responsibilities, running away from the enemy, running away from risks and trying to reach a place where the risk is less.  That sort of desertion is the worst and deserves the severest punishment. It is well to point out, however, that, although the numbers as given by the Minister of those who are technically deserters from our Army seems astonishingly high&mdash;I think the figure exceeded 4,000&mdash;some of these deserters deserted in the firm belief that, by so doing, they were adding their might to the defence of this country.  I do not say that that condones desertion, but it makes a difference, and it is well to remember that these men who belong to the category I have just described, along with a multitude of others, may be said to have enabled us a day ago in this House to pass The Republic of Ireland Bill.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister justified himself in the action he proposes to take in Section 8.  These men who deserted have already suffered military punishment. They have also suffered three years' additional disability and the proposal in the section is to absolve them from having to suffer for another four years.  We must remember, however, that, unlike a civilian, the ex-soldier can be usually recognised, and an employer usually asks to see his discharge papers.  I am afraid these unfortunate men will continue to suffer to a certain extent by reason of not having a clean sheet in their discharge papers.</P>
    <P>This House ought to have an opportunity of legitimately discussing defence problems, so far as the civilian is allowed to go into such matters.  I do not think that this Bill allows us to go very far, but I would say in conclusion, that it seems to me that all the muddled thinking about defence which one finds in newspapers and articles points clearly to the fact that we have not hitherto had sufficient opportunity to discuss these matters amongst ourselves, of getting our ideas clear and understanding the nature of the problems involved in running an army&mdash;what an army can do and what an army cannot do; what equipment an army requires to-day and what equipment a country the size of ours can <Col N="457" /> provide.  We have passed the age of bows and arrows and an army equipped with bows and arrows to-day might not be there at all.  I think it useless to talk to-day in terms of numbers of men. What we must first think of is the number of men we can equip properly and fully with all the equipment required by a modern army, how we can train them and make them highly efficient, and capable of being the nucleus of a larger army, should the occasion of a larger army become necessary.  I am sure we all hope that it will not be necessary, but let us not make the mistake of thinking that half-measures are measures which are any good at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are all agreed on the necessity for an army. As to the size of that army, I think the ordinary man in the street is not the best judge.  I believe at all times in talking only about something on which I am fit to talk, and my only qualification in my intervention in this debate is the fact that I had the honour of serving in the L.D.F. from its inception until its handing over to the new force, the F.C.A.  I was a senior officer practically all the time. I do not intend for that reason to suggest that I know a lot about the Army and I will certainly admit straightaway that I know nothing about high strategy, although people without even my service seem to have no hesitation in wandering into these realms.  I will deal with what I think is a very important point in connection with the Army&mdash;the men and officers, as individuals, in the Army.  The Army is built up on a series of individuals, and one of the first things we learn when we go in is that we get our individual training before getting our collective training.  I notice that nearly all discussions of this kind seem to be kept on this high plane of dealing with groups or large numbers of men, and I should like to put a few considerations before the Minister with regard to the new arrangements being made for what we may regard now as the new Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite a considerable amount of money, as we know, is being spent on the Army.  We should not begrudge it, but I think we would all like to see that <Col N="458" /> it is well spent.  One of the best ways, I think, of spending money on the Army, and of making it attractive would be to make the conditions in it good.  At present, there seems to be the idea that we should get men in the Army cheaper than men can be got for other occupations in life, as well as getting them to live a totally different kind of life from that which one usually associates with civilian life.  The conditions of life in the Army up to the present have not, to say the least, been ideal.  The living quarters are dismal, the lighting and the general cleanliness of the barracks leave a lot to be desired.  There is a complete lack of privacy in the ordinary soldier's living quarters.  Though the food is good and well cooked, the conditions under which it is served are often very bad. The tea, for example, is often served in a bucket and is never warm.  Men in ordinary life would not put up with such conditions.  We must make certain that, in future, the living conditions for the men in the Army are going to be good.  The sleeping conditions in barracks&mdash;and on this I can speak from my own experience as well as that of others who have served&mdash; are very bad.  One sees in the sleeping quarters in barracks the most frightful pillows.  They have been there, apparently, since the Treaty, and in many cases I do not think they have ever been washed.  I am not exaggerating. That is true.</P>
    <P>We have at the present time, as Minister for Defence, a doctor.  I am glad of that.  I would like to make a special case to him in regard to hygiene in barracks and in camps.  The sanitary arrangements are, to say the least of it, appalling.  I know there are men who would rather not avail of the provision that is made in that respect. I do not want to go too much into this, but rather to make the case that the living conditions for our soldiers should be considerably improved.  They will have to get a better deal in the future if we are to make the Army attractive for them.</P>
    <P>I know also that the conditions, so far as the officers are concerned, have given rise to a certain amount of dissatisfaction in the past, owing to the uncertainty under which officers serve. <Col N="459" /> I would recommend that point to the Minister for his consideration.  Coming to the higher level, I would like to refer to what I think is an important aspect of Army life, a thing that affects the whole morale of the Army.  I refer to the lack of independence in the officers, even the higher officers.  I understand, from meeting them constantly, that they are afraid, and have been afraid in the past, to make constructive suggestions unless they know beforehand that their suggestions are going to be acceptable to those higher up.  Even the remuneration that is paid to our higher Army officers puts them on a lower scale than that enjoyed by civilian officers in the Department of Defence.  I understand that the salary of the Chief-of-Staff is lower than that of the Secretary to the Department of Defence.  Psychologically, that is all wrong.  We must realise that we have had an Army for the last 25 or 26 years, and that our military men have a task that is all their own.  It is a task for which we want expert soldiers.  We have here still a lot of amateurs who fought in the War of Independence. They are not in the Regular Army, but they still seem to think that they are in a position to know more about military matters than military men.  We must realise that we have got professional soldiers now and a professional Army, and we should treat them as such.  You will not get the best men in any profession nowadays unless you pay them.</P>
    <P>There is only one minor matter that I would like to refer to, and that is the allowances made to officers taking a course in a foreign country or representing Ireland abroad.  These allowances are regarded as being totally inadequate. I understand that the allowance for an officer is about 10/- a day. That may sound quite big, but actually it is very small.  I understand that, when certain adjustments are made in it, the officer usually has about 4/7 a day on which to mix with the officers in other armies.  That, surely, is cheese-paring.  I feel that if economies are to be made they could be made in some other way than that.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about the F.C.A.  There has been a lot of <Col N="460" /> talk in the country about a civilian army and how desirable it would be&mdash; that, if we cannot afford a large professional army, therefore, we should have a civilian army.  That is a very laudable idea.  It sounds very well, but I think we must face up to the practical difficulties of a civilian army.  I think if we had one it would be found that we were wasting more money on it than it deserved.</P>
    <P>I think that is clear to anybody who served in the L.D.F.  We had a large number of men in it&mdash;a large paper strength&mdash;but at any given time my own estimate was&mdash;it was based on practical experience&mdash;that 50 per cent. of the paper strength was not a live strength, and that even that would only be got on very special occasions. But, day in and day out, there was the most frightful wastage of our strength. We found ourselves handed out full equipment.  Many, however, only volunteered their services for what they could get out of it.  Of course, the nucleus and the hard core of that wonderful force was there to give and not to get.  I am only arguing that we want to be careful about the people who get and who give nothing.  In that connection, what I suggest is that in the F.C.A. only men who are going to attend the annual camp should be issued with uniforms and equipment.  I feel it should be made compulsory that they attend annual camp.  Provision should also be made for those men to be released from their employment without any compliment on the part of their employers, and that the State should see that they were paid for the time they are away, either by their employers or by the State itself.</P>
    <P>Anybody who knows anything about military life knows that you must have basic progressive training, and that the only way that can be given is in camp.  Weekly parades are all right for keeping people's minds on the training they have already got.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should go into this question of the F.C.A. very fully, so that we will have in this force a real live strength with the certainty that the country is getting full value for the money expended on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words in the first instance about Part III of the Bill.  This part is concerned with keeping free of traffic or of use certain roads which are adjacent to training centres or other places where any section of the Army may be located.  It seems to me that it is conferring powers which should not be given without the closest scrutiny and without taking precautions, so far as the Houses of Parliament are concerned, to ensure that these powers are used properly and in such a manner as Parliament may approve.  You will find that Section 11 confers on the Minister power to make by-laws referring to roads crossing or near land used for military purposes.  These by-laws will have reference to the user of the roads in question.  They will be made with the consent of the roads authority but, having secured the consent of the road authority, they confer very wide powers.  Powers of arrest are being bestowed on private soldiers; powers to remove vehicles or animals from the roads concerned in the regulations, without any indication as to what is to become of these vehicles or animals after they have been removed from one of these scheduled roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is here an indication that the civil administration responsible for the Department have found a need at some time or other to prohibit the use by the public of certain thoroughfares and they have taken power not merely to do that, but they have taken power in a most unusual fashion, because I am not aware of any other instance in any statute where power is conferred upon a private soldier to act as a policeman and arrest a citizen on a public road.  That is what is being proposed here.  Section 14, for instance, says that if a person is on a particular portion of a road to which a by-law relates in contravention of the by-law an authorised officer may order that person to leave, and the authorised officer may either remove him from that portion by force or arrest him without warrant.  That seems to me an invasion of the right of the citizen, because an authorised person, according to Section 10, may be either a member of <Col N="462" /> the Garda Síochána or a member of the Defence Forces authorised in that behalf by the by-laws.  There is nothing in this Bill which says that an ordinary private soldier with three months' experience in the Army may not be an authorised officer for the purpose of arresting people without warrant.  It is important to bear that phrase in mind &ldquo;without warrant&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Then, in Section 15, power is conferred on an authorised officer, again any member of the Defence Forces may be an authorised officer, to remove or cause to be removed any vehicle, animal or other thing which is on any road to which a by-law relates in contravention of the by-law.  What safeguard is there for the man whose cattle roam accidentally on to a highway concerned in one of these by-laws?  Will it be obligatory on the authorised officer to see that they are brought to the nearest pound or put into any place for safekeeping, or is it just a matter of driving them before him until they are off the road concerned in the by-laws and then letting them roam away?  It seems to me that this is a matter which requires serious consideration and that Part III of this Bill should not be passed until we have the fullest assurances that there will be no departure in relation to these matters from the ordinary practices which have been approved by this House over a long period.</P>
    <P>Then I should like to come to Part II of the Bill, particularly Section 5.  This is a section which authorises a soldier to contract for further service after having served 21 years in the Defence Forces.  He may contract for one or more periods of two years up to a total of ten years.  That means that a soldier can contract for service for a period not exceeding 31 years.  Assuming he is 19 years when he joins the Army, he then ceases to be a soldier at the age of 50 and reverts to civilian life with which he has no familiarity.  If he has not learned some useful trade or equipped himself for civil employment, on quitting the Army, he will be an outcast.  He will have no opportunity of competing in the commercial or industrial market with those who have <Col N="463" /> spent the previous 31 years at civil employment.  This man has been accustomed to a different type of life. He has been removed from the ordinary avocations by which the civilian population live.</P>
    <P>I think the whole question requires reconsideration.  I think it might even be considered whether it is wise to permit a young man to remain 21 years in the Army.  Despite what the last speaker said, I think there is a lot to be said for a citizen Army; that at least there is something to be said for men serving for short periods rather than long periods so that, when they return to civil life, they are not returning as strangers, as aliens, to the ordinary civil way of living.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this matter has been considered closely or whether it is merely that the Army is ready to say: &ldquo;Let the fellow continue for another period after he has served 21 years.&rdquo;  It does not matter what becomes of him then, that is his out lookout. He must serve two years once he makes any contract and so on until he has made five such contracts.  At the end of the fifth contract he will have 31 years' service and then he is dropped out.  It seems to me that this is a matter which should get very serious consideration from the point of view of the Army itself and from the point of view of the men who will be leaving the Army after having completed their full period of service.</P>
    <P>The only other point I desired to raise was this question which is cropping up so frequently as to what exactly should be our aim regarding an Army organisation.  That aim would be determined by the use which we think can be made of the Army.  Some speakers are inclined to address themselves to the position if we are involved in hostilities with some foreign country either on our own, in isolation, or as part of a defensive organisation in which we might be linked with other Powers.  That is a subject which, I think, has not been considered at all, or at least if it has been considered, nobody knows what conclusions have been reached.  It is necessary, in my submission, that we should make up <Col N="464" /> our own minds as to what our attitude should be in relation to foreign commitments or to military commitments at home or abroad before we can determine the size of the Army, its equipment, its cost of its method of training. These are the matters, it occurs to me, which will have to be considered before we can determine our attitude towards the Army organisation as a whole.  I do not suppose that this is the occasion to discuss that subject.</P>
    <P>This is a temporary provisions Bill and it is concerned with rather unimportant amendments of existing law except as far as Part III is concerned, although that too is really an amending provision.  Before the Estimates are presented next March or next April, it seems to me that some decision should be approved by both Houses as to the functions of the Army, its size, its equipment, its cost and the manner it is to be used so that the public will know what is expected of them, the bill they will have to pay and the reason they will have to pay such a bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisIreland" hpid="Mr. Ireland Mr. Ireland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ireland</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this Bill.  As one who was once a soldier himself, it seems to me to be a rather extraordinary principle in Section 8 that the punishment of a soldier should be, in a sense, delegated from the military to the civilian authority.  That is all I am going to say about that point, but if the Cathaoirleach will allow me I want to revert to certain wider issues which were raised by Senator Orpen.  Like Senator Orpen. I hope that a better opportunity will come later to have wider discussions on these issues, but this seems to be the only opportunity we have in the meantime and I will only keep the House five minutes.  I want to dot the &ldquo;is&rdquo; and cross the &ldquo;t's&rdquo; in what Senator Orpen said.  He referred to muddled thinking in this country, but unfortunately muddled thinking is not confined to this country.  There is muddled thinking in Britain as to what the Irish Army is for and what the Irish soldier is for.  As far as I can make out from studying the British and American Press their theory of the rules governing the defence of Ireland is to take Irish soldiers out of Ireland <Col N="465" /> and put them in the armies of other countries and when it comes to the defence of this country to put the soldiers of another country in to defend it.  That seems pretty crazy but that is what it is.  Churchill gets up in the House of Commons and speaks of how gallant Irish soldiers are, but does he believe that they are gallant when they are defending their own country or does he only think they are gallant when they are fighting for other people?  That is some of the confused thinking that we must get rid of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another example of this confused thinking is the term &ldquo;British Isles&rdquo; which is almost as great a course as this word &ldquo;Eire&rdquo; that we have here at home.  Senator Orpen touched on what to me is the reality of the whole situation.  I stand open to correction from the Minister, but is it not a correct thing to say that the reality of the situation is, as Senator Orpen said, that no really satisfactory arrangement can be entered into on all sides while Partition exists?  It does not matter about sentiments or whether you want it or not.  The fact is that it cannot be done.  As one who was not only an Irish soldier but who has formulated a scheme for the united defence of this country in the last war, I am particularly interested in this question.  I wrote to the <i>Irish Times</i> in July, 1940, when France fell&mdash;anyone who has the curiosity can find it&mdash; saying that once France had fallen this State stood in dire danger and that the only way to defend the country was for all of us in the Six Counties and in the Twenty-Six Counties to unite in green uniforms and form a defence force.  The scheme I formulated never came to anything.  It was to be published by an English publisher but it was removed from the post on its way to Britain by, I take it, the Ministry of Information.  The reality of the defence of this country in the last war is that there was never a defence, but if that arrangement of the country being defended partly by foreign troops had been really tested by the brutal reality of invasion, nobody knows what would have happened, or the chaotic conditions which would have arisen.  When it comes to the defence of the country, <Col N="466" /> the national sentiment of all Ireland should be harnessed to the defence of all Ireland, from Fairhead to Bantry Bay.  Anything that stands in the way is a danger to the security, first of this island, and, by consequence, to the security of the island next door.  That is not our primary concern; what we are concerned with is the security of this island primarily and until we get our national sentiments harnessed to the defence of the country as a whole, our security is needlessly endangered. I would be interested if the Minister would comment, if he is so inclined, on that situation which has been so ably raised by Senator Orpen, that the reality of the situation is that we cannot have a satisfactory arrangement until Partition comes to an end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My short experience as Minister for Defence has been that it is far more dangerous to discuss candidly defence matters than actually go to war.  If a man happens to use any form of words that are subject to the interpretation of complete isolation then he is accused of being a non-coperative isolationist.  On the other hand, if his words can be so interpreted as to mean the apparently essential co-operation of countries in the modern war and the modern world, then he is immediately accused by somebody of having entered a backdoor secret alliance with some Power or Powers unnamed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have more than once ventured to express the opinion&mdash;which is not just my own, but is the opinion of the military men on whom I rely for advice; and I am glad to see that it is an opinion shared by many Senators present&mdash;that the task of framing a defence plan for three-quarters or two-thirds of a comparatively tiny island is an impossible task.  In the old days, war comparatively might be described as a parochial matter, where battles were fought over a very limited area of land, and the war was either won or lost by those particularly and those peculiarly localised battles.  To-day, any defence plan for an island must be based not only on a land scheme but on water and air schemes.  You may have either a natural or an artificial boundary defining the geographical limits of two <Col N="467" /> States, but it is physically impossible to carry that boundary out into the ocean or up into the sky.  Experience has shown that, during the recent war, with the best intentions in the world, soldiers in what is called the &ldquo;North&rdquo; and soldiers in what is called the &ldquo;South&rdquo; found it equally impossible to devise a sensible, sound and workable defence plan.  That is my view. It is, apparently, the view of most sensible people, and I am pleased to find that, if I am in trouble over that particular view, I am in trouble with good companions beside me.</P>
    <P>On the matters raised in the course of the debate, I was particularly disturbed by some of the observations of Senator McGuire.  I would hasten to explain that his experiences with regard to the conditions under which soldiers live and the general hygienic conditions&mdash;service of food, sleeping accommodation, living quarters, etc.&mdash; were, as he stated, based on the experiences during the war.  Now, we were in a unique and abnormal position during the war.  Normally, barracks are used for mobilisation purposes, and when the army is mobilised, the army, or a great portion of it, takes to the field. In other words, depôts are for mobilisation and for transport outward.  We mobilise and, on account of the peculiar position in which we found ourselves, we remained mobilised&mdash;and not only mobilised, but immobilised, which meant, in fact, that the barracks were naturally overcrowded from every point of view.  Living conditions, sleeping conditions, eating conditions, all were called on to serve a purpose from week to week, from month to month and year to year which normally they should only be called upon to serve for a very, very short length of time.</P>
    <P>My period of service in the Army was as a medical officer.  In peace time, a medical officer's main function is to look after the amenities of soldiers.  I had excellent officers, N.C.O.s and men, under me.  The normal living conditions in our Army are second to none. Within my very early months as Minister for Defence, I visited a number of barracks in every Command.  I was not interested so much in guns and tanks, in wheels and lorries: I was peculiarly <Col N="468" /> and specially interested in the living conditions, particularly those of the private soldier.  The officers are in a position to look after themselves, and they do so.  At the present moment, in every permanent barracks where many of our soldiers are living, there are not only living quarters of an excellent type, but in addition to dining-room there is billiard-room and lounge, recreation-room and reading-room, and that kind of thing, as good as and better than any of us have in our own homes.  That is because the normal Army is a small Army and you have adequate space for all these amenities. When the Army is mobilised, the recreation-rooms and so on are taken over for billeting purposes, and sleeping and eating conditions are definitely bad.</P>
    <P>I would not like any Senator to get the impression, from war-time experiences or observations of any individual, that the normal conditions under which our soldiers live are not particularly good and attractive.  I would welcome at any time a tour of Senators through any barracks selected by themselves&mdash;and without any notice in advance.  I think they would come back as convinced on that particular aspect of army life as I am.  With regard to the standard of living of soldiers, my standard would be higher than most.</P>
    <P>With regard to Part III of this particular Act that I did not refer to, but which Senator Duffy referred to with evidence of considerable uneasiness, he seems to think that these particular paragraphs were not only the birth of some civil servant's brain but the precipitate birth&mdash;which usually produces some extraordinary kind of freak.  Nothing in haste ever appears in this particular Bill.  I want to assure the Senator and the Seanad generally that very full and lengthy consideration is given to anything that appears in this Bill, for the simple reason that it is an annual Bill. If any point is not adequately and comprehensively threshed out in any year, the general tendency is to leave it until the next year.  If our civil servants can be criticised in any particular aspect, I have never yet heard them criticissed as being in a hurry about anything.  The particular <Col N="469" /> paragraphs which are referred to here in Part III are paragraphs which deal with steps necessary to protect human life, to protect property and to protect animal life.  Part III of this Bill arises out of the extension of the runways at different military aerodromes.  On account of the heavier and more rapid type of plane, runways have to be extended at points across what was heretofore an isolated road, detached and divorced from the runway.</P>

      <P>It may.  Our attitude is this, that if there is any danger of that type to human life, or to animal life, or to property, through our activities, it shows more consideration for the general public to take power to keep them out of the danger zone than to take the chance of leaving them in it.  This has been represented as autocratic action by the military.  This particular section is dependent on the sanction and the approval of the elected representatives of people functioning as the road authority in the various centres affected.</P>

      <P>People like myself and the Senator are plain people.  We are not of a different race or of a different breed, and we are not going to be any more unreasonable than the Senator or a country council would be when dealing with our own people.  The condition there is, number one, that cause is shown; number two, that the approval of the road authority is secured, and then the by-law is made. When the by-law is made either myself or somebody else has to come here once or twice a year to defend the by-law as well as any action taken.  I do not think there is anything in Part III that anybody need be nervous or alarmed about.  There would be good ground for nervousness or alarm if Part III was not in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a further word I should like to say because mention was made of it <Col N="470" /> in connection with deserters.  A reference was made to the number of deserters, 4,000, being rather high. People here might think, with the high number of deserters from the Regular Army that the morale or the discipline of the Army generally was to be gauged on that.  Only one-tenth of that number were people who deserted from the National Army.  When we were making regulations in the past to deal with deserters, these regulations were made with the ordinary simple mind of plain people, but I am nearly afraid to say that when the lawyers got at it the expression &ldquo;deserter&rdquo; covered everybody who ever wore a bit of green, the reservists who had got employment with Bord na Mona and left no addresses, the fellow who passed through the barracks for a night, as well as those who were good members of the Sluagh who qualified in some profession and in good faith had gone abroad to take up duty elsewhere. All these were found to come within the category of &ldquo;deserters&rdquo;. The number of regular soldiers who deserted was really very small.  It is due to the Army and to the Seanad to give that explanation.</P>

      <P>The explanation of my remarks is that following a particular section, which we are proposing to delete, there was a responsibility on the Minister for Defence annually to send to every public authority a full list of people who came within the legal definition of &ldquo;deserter.&rdquo;  There was a legal obligation on such authorities to ensure that they were not employed.</P>

There are a few matters of urgency, number one being a new form of reattestation for soldiers, and number two, which I should have mentioned first, regarding cadets in the Navy.  There are also applications for transfers to the Reserve of Officers, which have been accumulating awaiting this Bill.</P>

      <P>If we adjourn until early next week, having disposed of the business on the Order Paper, it is clear that the House will not meet until the middle of March in view of the decision of the Dáil to meet sometime in February.  I think we could give better consideration to the points raised by Senator Hawkins if we disposed of this Bill early in the New Year.  As to the argument put up by the Minister, that some matters were urgent I wonder whether three weeks would make any essential difference.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a purely permissive Bill.  It imposes no duty on the local authority. It merely leaves it open to the local authority to raise a rate of not more than 7d. in lieu of the existing limit of 4d. for the purposes of the county committee of agriculture under its authority.  The reason why the provision is necessary is that about half the county councils have already raised the full 4d. and are not free to grant their county committees of agriculture any further funds.  The other half have already raised a rate of between 3d. and 4d. in the £.  I think there is only one county council in Ireland that, at present, levies a rate of less than 3d. Some councils will deem it prudent, where they consider that their existing services in the matter of agricultural instruction and for other purposes are insufficient, to raise the additional rate, and thereby make funds available for their county committees of agriculture. Others may decide not to do that. That will be a matter entirely within the discretion of the county council itself. That explains the provision of Section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 is designed to permit of a county committee of agriculture reimbursing its members for travelling expenses and what is described as <Col N="473" /> maintenance on precisely the same terms as is provided for the members of a vocational committee under the Vocational Education Act.  At present you have the anomalous position that a member going to a meeting of the county committee of agriculture who is not himself a member of the county council, is only entitled to be given what may be described as vouched expenses and he may not claim in any circumstances maintenance.  Under this proposal a county committee of agriculture will be able to provide, where a member lives more than five miles from the place of meeting, that he be entitled to the mileage he travels at a prescribed rate, and, in addition, he will be entitled, in substance, to the price of his lunch, if he is more than three hours away from home, and to the price of his lunch and his tea if he is more than seven hours away from home on the business of the committee.  It further provides for a county committee of agriculture, which forms subcommittees of the whole, to make available similar accommodation for the members of that sub-committee at rates approved of by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The last purpose of the Bill is provided for in Section 4.  It was intended in the Principal Act to cover all types of public servants who work under a county committee of agriculture.  Some doubts arose as to whether the Act, which is hereby amended, was as clear as the Legislature intended, and lest litigation might ensue, it is thought better to enact Section 4 which makes manifest that which it was intended to do under the Principal Act.  To the best of my knowledge and belief that is all this Bill is designed to do.  I need hardly say that, if any other point presents itself to Senators, I shall be very glad to explain it on request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the Bills that we welcome.  We are prepared to give every facility for its passage as quickly as possible.  We quite realise the great work that our various county committees of agriculture are doing through the country.  Where a county council is prepared to place more money at the disposal of its committees, <Col N="474" /> then I think it is right that it should have permission to do so.  We are glad to see that the facilities at present afforded to the members of various other committees set up under the county councils are now to be extended to the members of the county committees of agriculture.  We do not propose to detain the House on the Bill.  We approve of it.</P>

      <P>This Bill in no way alters the powers, responsibilities or duties of the county committees of agriculture, but, while it is passing through, I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to something which has been a grievance in my mind for quite a while.  County committees of agriculture offer a good many scholarships every year and these scholarships are confined exclusively to farmers' sons and daughters.  The agricultural workers of this country are part of the agricultural community and scholarships should be made available to them.</P>

      <P>The only way in which it might come within the scope of the Bill is that we propose to allow a rate increase from 4d. to 7d. in the £, and, if they are getting more money <Col N="475" /> I might suggest that it could be spent in that way.  I am not putting it forward as an amendment, but it gives me the opportunity to ask the Minister the question.</P>

      <P>On Section 3, it was perhaps trespassing a little on your indulgence, Sir, but I think we can take the Bill as it is and consider the provisions it permits a local authority to make.  I would not like Senator O'Farrell to feel that the provision which the local authority is now permitted to make is so restricted as to prevent the son of an agricultural worker benefiting under any scholarship scheme provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" /> I think I am correct in saying that all the county council scholarships are accessible to an agricultural worker's son, and I will give the Senator this undertaking: to the best of my understanding, no agricultural worker's son is excluded from the scholarship schemes which may be promoted by county committees of agriculture, but, if they are so excluded, I shall look forward to introducing appropriate legislation at an early date to ensure that they are no longer excluded.</P>
