    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will recall the announcement made in January last of the decision to remove quantitative restrictions on imports as soon as possible and, in any event, not later than the 30th June, 1963.  This decision was taken as a consequence of Ireland's application for membership of the European Economic Community, since quantitative restrictions would have to be removed at once on entry into the Common Market, so far as the goods of EEC countries are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even as a member of the European Economic Community, however, it would still be possible for us to maintain such restrictions against goods coming from certain countries outside the Common Market, subject to the obligations of the Rome Treaty in regard to common commercial policy. The Control of Imports Acts are not suitable, as they stand, for the operation of quotas on such a selective basis, and, since it was considered necessary to be in a position to maintain quantitative restrictions on the entry of goods <Col N="938" /> coming from particular countries, e.g. those which are low-cost producers, while removing them from the goods of other countries, steps were taken, subsequent to the decision announced in January, to prepare legislation amending these Acts so as to enable this to be done.</P>
    <P>In view of the change, which has taken place in the circumstances in which this country applied for membership of the European Economic Community, it has been decided to proceed more slowly with the removal of quotas and to retain most of them for the time being.  In certain cases, however, where it is judged that the industries concerned can be adequately protected by tariffs, it has been decided to carry out the original decision and to remove the quotas as from 30th June, 1963.  It may be necessary, however, to dismantle these quotas on a selective basis should there be a danger to the Irish industry of severe competition from low-cost countries, and for this reason it is necessary to proceed with the legislation amending the Acts.</P>
    <P>The present Bill amends the Control of Imports Acts so that goods from specified countries can be exempted from the quantitative restrictions imposed by Quota Orders.</P>
    <P>At the present time, the quotas which are being removed are those applying to rubber-proofed garments and cycle tyres.  The manufacturers concerned have been consulted, and they have indicated that, subject to protection against low cost countries in the case of cycle tyres, the removal of the quotas should not affect employment or output.</P>
    <P>As a measure of liberalisation the size of many quotas is now being increased by 10 per cent.  This should provide a stimulus towards increased efficiency in the industries concerned and should be regarded as the counterpart of the 10 per cent across-the-board tariff cut which was brought into operation in January last.  The industries concerned have been consulted, and there is no reason to think that the <Col N="939" /> increase in the size of the quota should create difficulties.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill appears to be a necessary measure in our legislation in regard to tariffs and quotas.  One would like to express the hope, however, that the change will not result in unemployment and, if that is so, then everything is for the good. If we do become a member of the European Economic Community we must be in a position to make certain changes rapidly.  For that reason it seems to me that the Bill is one which has to be supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Hayes, I agree that this is a necessary Bill and that it should be supported. As I see it, the purpose of quotas and tariffs is to protect our own industries and, I suppose, to encourage other countries from whom we purchase goods to purchase goods from us.  That is sound but Government Departments should set an example by trying to encourage the countries from whom we purchase goods to purchase goods from us, and it appears that Government Departments do not always do that.</P>
      <P>In reply to a question in the Dáil last week the Minister for Defence stated that we had purchased a number of helicopters from France costing something around £230,000.  In reply to a further question he stated that no reciprocal arrangements were made with the Government of France or with private concerns in France whereby they would purchase goods from us.  I personally think that a worthwhile opportunity was lost there.  An order worth £230,000 for helicopters or anything else is a sizeable order and the opportunity should have been availed of to try to get a reciprocal order placed with France for Irish goods.  I am bringing this point up merely to show that Government Departments do not always practise what they preach. When large orders like this are being placed by the State they should seek reciprocal orders against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>While welcoming this Bill, it appears plain to everybody <Col N="940" /> now that the present Government took a gambler's chance on our entry into the Common Market.  They placed all their eggs in one basket and since General de Gaulle used the axe and saw to it that neither Britain nor ourselves would be admitted to the Common Market the Government seem to be without any preconceived policy.  They do not seem to know where they are going and there is no doubt that in the dilemma which faces them they are even prepared to reverse their own policy and the policy they had in operation in this State for the past 40 years.  Imagine the screams of hysteria there would be from the Fianna Fáil benches if a Fine Gael Government introduced some of the measures that Fianna Fáil are introducing.</P>
      <P>I believe this Bill is necessary.  I believe the Government should proceed with more caution than if we had been admitted to the Common Market.  I welcome any move to prepare us for the freer trade era that lies ahead.  We should have been preparing for that, perhaps, for a longer number of years.  After the protection that has been given since 1932, many of our industries are like an overfed but undernourished youth and they may not be able to stand up to the competitive period which, it is admitted by all, lies ahead.  We must hasten slowly because if we make too rapid a reduction in quotas or tariffs it might mean the death knell of our industries and unemployment and hardship for many of our people.  It is a well-known fact that highly industrialised European countries are quite capable of supplying the entire Irish market for 52 weeks of the year by less than one month's production. That is something we should take into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as our trade with the EEC countries is concerned, last year we purchased some £40 million worth of goods from them and they only purchased £8 million goods from us.  In other words, for every £5 million worth of goods which we purchased from them they only purchased £1 million worth of goods from us.  I agree with Senator Fitzpatrick about the helicopters. <Col N="941" /> There are other countries with whom our trade has been far more favourable and we by-passed them and dealt with a nation from whom we are purchasing five times what they are purchasing from us.  All our energies should be devoted to getting markets and exporting more to those countries.  Our marketing system seems to be completely antediluvian and whether our objective could be attained through our embassies by having sales representatives there, or by trade missions, or sending our Ministers abroad, I do not know, but something should be done to increase our trade with EEC countries.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the pattern of our trade, despite all the marketing boards and commissions that have been set up over the past five or six years, has been deteriorating each year since 1957.  For example, in 1957 Belgium bought 43 per cent of what we bought from her.  Today she buys only roughly 17 per cent.  In 1957 France bought 60 per cent; today she only buys 18 per cent.  Germany in the same year bought 47 per cent and today only buys 27 per cent.  The Netherlands bought 22 per cent but today that is down to 21 per cent.  Italy in 1957 bought 64 per cent and now that figure is down to 33 per cent.  Luxembourg bought nothing from us in 1957 but last year we bought over £300,000 worth of goods from her as against her £700 worth from us.  Undoubtedly, something should be done about those figures.  If we are to reduce quotas and tariffs, which I believe is necessary, it must be done hand in hand with a &ldquo;buy Irish campaign,&rdquo; not for one week of the year but for 52 weeks. If we do not do something like that our industries will fail and we will have wholesale unemployment which nobody wants to see.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>One point which I want to raise is, perhaps, more a Committee Stage point.  Section 2 of the Bill states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government may in and by a quota order exempt from the prohibition effected by the order goods which are shown to the satisfaction <Col N="942" /> of the Revenue Commissioners either (as shall be specified in the Order)&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to have been manufactured or produced in a specified country or countries,</P>
    <P>(b)  to have been consigned to the importer from a specified country or countries, or</P>
    <P>My point is whether it is necessary to have subparagraph (b) at all.  If one wanted to import goods from a prohibited country perhaps one could order the goods from an agent.  Suppose we did not want to allow imports manufactured in country A.  Perhaps, under a quota, there is an agent in country B who would import those goods from country A and reconsign them to the importer here.  Could that not follow?  Similarly, it would also appear to have an adverse effect on trade statistics.  An importer here might wish to import a large quantity of important machinery which would play an important part in the impression it would convey in trade statistics. The goods imported might have been imported from a country that did not manufacture them and the figures might be returned in our trade with that country but they were only imported from an agent in that country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister has this point in mind, that is that I hope that when quotas are given firms engaged in manufacturing or assembling those goods already will be safeguarded as regards employment. I should like the Minister to be more specific about this when he is replying. In his statement he said that some of the parties involved were consulted and did not see any danger.  When a quota is given for goods to be imported they may in some way eventually affect existing firms.  We have often been told that existing firms which are producing an article or articles would not be affected but it does not always work out that way.  Because of the competitive nature of the trade, employment could be affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Senator Hayes has seen the true purpose of this Bill and has welcomed it. <Col N="943" /> Unfortunately, Senator L'Estrange never misses an opportunity to have &ldquo;a go&rdquo; politically but when he gets on to industrial ground he is treading on fairly dangerous territory as far as his Party are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The white elephant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government make no apology to anybody for their policy of protection introduced in 1932. We are convinced that without that policy the degree of industrial employment now available in the country would not be available and that policy was implemented, the country and the world knows, in the teeth of fierce opposition from Senator L'Estrange's party.  I do not want to be too hard on him.  He likes sticking his neck out and I must give it a slight chop, if not chop it off altogether, if he does stick it out.</P>
      <P>I should like to remind him that every country in the world has a system of tariffs and were it not for that there would be no necessity at all for the Common Market, the European Free Trade Association, or would there be any necessity for this Kennedy round exercise.  Other countries have as formidable tariffs as we have but having regard to the world-wide movement now towards freer trade we shall have to take similar steps.  If the Government put all their eggs in one basket they have been considerably assisted in placing the eggs there by the Fine Gael Party, and, indeed, by every thinking person in the country because I think it was the desire of everybody that we should at the earliest possible time accede to the European Economic Community.  Unfortunately, circumstances have altered that.  If our application had been accepted together with those of Britain, Norway and Denmark, it is probable that we would perhaps at the beginning of this year, or certainly hardly later than next year, find ourselves in the position of compulsorily having to reduce tariffs and to extend or eliminate quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, the breakdown in the British negotiations for entry to the Common Market is not conclusive that Britain or the other three applicant <Col N="944" /> countries whose applications have not yet been negotiated will be precluded from entry for all time.  Anyway, the belief is currently held that Britain may well reapply in two years and may at that stage become a member of the European Community.  If she does we hope to become a member too.</P>
    <P>I do not have to go into the reasons why we did not seek membership of EFTA.  I think these reasons are well known and widely appreciated by our people.  I need only say in regard to that that we have now practically all the industrial advantages that Britain's partners in EFTA would enjoy after the end of the transitional period when tariffs would have been removed, and, secondly, the EFTA agreement takes no account whatever of agricultural goods and that in particular was the attraction which the European Economic Community had for us over and above EFTA.  But, in the meantime, these two organisations have proceeded at a fast rate to reduce their tariffs.  EFTA has actually outbid the Common Market countries in that respect in so far as eliminating tariffs in about two years' time.</P>
    <P>This Bill intends to deal with quotas. As Senators know, there are three main means of protection&mdash;(1) to prohibit goods coming in altogether; (2) to prohibit goods coming by fixing quotas; and (3) to prohibit goods coming in from outside countries except on payment of tariff.  The first is the extreme protection.  Quota protection is secondary in its effectiveness and tariff protection is third.  The European Economic Community countries have already abolished quotas and the probability was that had we gained admission as from the 1st January last, as we had hoped, then we would have had to eliminate our quotas immediately.  In anticipation of that, we replaced these quotas by tariffs which would have to be progressively reduced once we were members of the European Economic Community. When the British negotiations were broken off, the Government reviewed the situation, and having already decided that quotas should disappear not later than the end of this month in fact, decided to eliminate <Col N="945" /> quotas only where it was shown that the industries concerned could stand the abolition of these quotas and have sufficient protection by a tariff which would replace it.  The removal of quotas was discussed with the industries affected and they agreed.  The extension of the quotas by 10 per cent which, as I said, corresponds with the 10 per cent reduction in tariffs was also discussed with the industries concerned. In reply to Senator Desmond, I can say that practically in every case we got a full or reasonable measure of agreement, and in only a few cases was any apprehension expressed.  I can assure the Senator and the House that very careful consideration was given to any action taken in this matter before it was taken to ensure, first of all, that the interests of the workers in these industries were safeguarded and, secondly, that the interests of the investors in these industries were safeguarded.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Fitzpatrick's point on the purchase of helicopters by the Department of Defence from France, I am afraid I have no detailed knowledge except I believe that the advisers of the Department of Defence in this matter gave the best advice possible; I presume that, having regard to quality and price, they found the best bargain in France.</P>
    <P>It is true that we have an adverse balance of payments with France but it is not so important.  It is important but not extremely important that we should balance out between ourselves and every other country.  What is important is that we should have an overall balance of payments with regard to our visible trade and our invisible exports.  That I think has been achieved satisfactorily in recent years.</P>
    <P>In so far as there has been a trend shown of imports from certain countries increasing considerably, we have in the Oireachtas taken recent steps by way of the Restriction of Imports Act to ensure that State trading companies, which are numerous, of course, behind the Iron Curtain, will not have a free hand in exporting to this country to an extent that will make our balance <Col N="946" /> of payments with them go completely out of hand.  We find that even without any action being taken under the Restriction of Imports Act the imbalance has been remedied in many cases.  We have had a very effective instrument but, as I have said, in the case of any country from which we import necessary goods, if they do not buy a reasonable quantity of goods from us which we are in a position to export and which they would normally import, then we can make Orders under that Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cole's point refers to Section 3, subparagraph (b). Section 3 generally gives power to the Government to exempt certain countries from quota Orders.  As I said in my opening statement, a Quota Order is imposed at the present time, and we have no power to preclude any country in the world from getting inside that quota and sending to Ireland a quantity of goods up to the limit of the quota.  The purpose of this Bill, therefore, is to bring us into line with Common Market countries whereby the Common Market countries even though they abolish quotas in the community can maintain quotas against other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three paragraphs under which we can make exemptions.  In Section 3, paragraph (a), goods may be exempted which are shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to have been manufactured or produced in a specified country or <Col N="947" /> countries.  That would naturally be the paragraph under which action would normally be taken.  Paragraph (b) would have, of course, the dangers inherent in it that the Senator points out.  Nevertheless, I think it is only right that the Government should have a degree of flexibility in operating these exemptions.  The greatest care will be taken that when exemption is given under paragraph (b) it will be only in the interests of this country and the whole State and not to the detriment of interests in the country. I can only give the Senator that assurance but I also want to suggest to him that it is important in these Exemption Orders that the Government should have a reasonable degree of flexibility so that if they found certain goods were required in the country and it was impossible to exempt them under paragraph (a) they could have recourse to paragraph (b).  Such a course would only be taken in exceptional circumstances which would warrant it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, would the Revenue Commissioners have any option under Sections 2 or 3 (b) other than the assurance that the goods have been consigned to the importer from the specified country?  It seems to me they would have no option but to let them in without a word from any manufacturer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners themselves are not the last word because it is the Government Order which will be based either under (a) or (b).  There would have to be a Government Order first and it would be based on one or the other.  It would not give an option in that case.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to authorise the increase to £160 million of the existing statutory limit of £135 million on the capital expenditure which the Electricity Supply Board may incur for general purposes, that is to say, exclusive of capital expenditure on the electrification of rural areas.</P>
      <P>At the 31st March, 1963, the actual capital expenditure of the Electricity Supply Board for general purposes was about £97 million.  In addition, the Board had entered into commitments for the same purposes amounting to approximately £37 million.  The total of £134 million covers expenditure already incurred and expenditure likely to be incurred on foot of present commitments up to 1968-69.  It includes provision for 470 Megawatts of generating plant yet to be commissioned.  It is expected that all this additional plant will have been commissioned by 1969 and the Board's generating capacity will then be 1289.5 Megawatts, of which 219 Megawatts will be hydro, 407.5 Megawatts peat-fired, 15 Megawatts fired by native coal and the remainder of 648 Megawatts fired by imported coal or oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Board must plan system extensions well in advance, especially generating plant extensions.  The Board must, in fact, be in a position to enter into commitments in the immediate future in respect of additional plant and equipment which will be required after 1969.  As the total of the Board's expenditure and commitments is now <Col N="949" /> approaching the limit of £135 million set by the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1962, which was passed in July, 1962, the authority of the Oireachtas to the raising of this limit to £160 million is now being sought.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that I said when moving the second reading of the 1962 Bill that the limit of £135 million was expected to cover the commitments likely to be entered into for the next two years or so.  At that time the ESB were assuming an 8 per cent per annum rate of growth in the demand for electricity.  The board are still working on an annual growth figure of 8 per cent long term but they have found that they must be equipped to deal in the short term with annual growth rates exceeding 10 per cent. For example, in the year to November, 1962, i.e. before the onset of the very bad weather, the growth rate was 10 per cent.  To meet the load situation which would develop with an accelerated growth rate of that order the board have decided that three instead of two extra 60 megawatt generating sets must be installed at Ringsend thus bringing the capacity of that station in 1966-67 to 270 megawatts.  Commitments in respect of the extra 60 megawatt set at that station, which must be entered into immediately, practically exhaust the board's authority to incur capital expenditure for general purposes and this explains why it is necessary to seek the approval of the Oireachtas to increase the limit at least a year earlier than had been expected.</P>
    <P>On the basis of their forecast of a long-term rate of growth in the demand for electricity of 8 per cent per annum, the board expect that further capital investment amounting to about £27 million will arise for approval in the next three years.  The construction of about 200 megawatts of additional generating capacity and large extensions of the transmission and distribution system are envisaged.</P>
    <P>It is expected that all bogs suitable for economic development by present methods for power station fuel will be in production by about 1970.  Power stations have already been sited on all <Col N="950" /> the rivers capable of being developed economically for hydro electricity generation, and, while the collection of data on other water power resources is continuing, no significant additions to generating capacity can be expected from them.  The possibility of using the indicated reserves of high ash coal, known as Crow Coal, in the Arigna area as fuel for an extension of the Arigna generating station is still under investigation but, in any event, the amount of additional generating capacity which could be based on the Arigna coalfield is insignificant in relation to future generating plant requirements.  Unless, therefore, we should have the good fortune that adequate and economically workable reserves of oil or natural gas are discovered in the country, we must rely on imported conventional fuel or nuclear energy when that becomes economic to supply energy for new generating stations commissioned after 1970.</P>
    <P>The ESB continue to watch developments in the application of nuclear power for electricity production, but so far conventional methods of generation are cheaper.</P>
    <P>The unprecedentedly heavy demand for electricity experienced during the prolonged spell of severe weather last winter taxed the Board's generating system to the limit.  It was only by calling on every available generating unit including the stand-by plant at the Pigeon House, which had to be worked well beyond its rated output, that the Board were able to maintain supply throughout this period.  Early in February the peak load reached a high record level of 632 MW.  The difficulty of maintaining supply was accentuated by the widespread damage to transmission and distribution lines caused by blizzards during this period. The extent to which the Board succeeded in maintaining the supply of electricity during this period was really an outstanding achievement and I am sure that Senators will agree that the Board's staff concerned are deserving of heartiest congratulations for the excellent services rendered by them.</P>
    <P>Although it does not arise directly <Col N="951" /> on this Bill, I should like to say a few words about the progress of rural electrification.  The 1962 Act authorised an increase in the capital subsidy for the connection of rural houses to the electricity supply to 75 per cent of the capital cost, subject to a maximum of £75 for any one house, and authorised the Board to spend an extra £5 million on the scheme, bringing the total permitted expenditure on it to £37 million. A special grant of £90,000 was provided for &ldquo;backbone&rdquo; distribution lines in certain rural areas which it would otherwise be quite uneconomic to connect. The Board are now pressing forward with the completion of the initial scheme and expect that the development of all areas will be completed by June, 1964.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the Board are putting into operation a further programme under which all, or nearly all, houses still without supply will be re-canvassed over the next few years and local post-development schemes to bring supply to all those now requiring it will be drawn up.  It is a feature of the rural programme in its final phase that some houses now prepared to take supply, may have to wait awhile until the post-development scheme for their locality comes to be carried through, but this is inescapable if orderly progress, rather than haphazard individual connections, is to prevail and thus ensure the minimum capital expenditure on the work and, consequently, lower special service charges for those who have to pay them.  It is expected that comparatively few people will have to be asked to pay special service charges of more than half their normal fixed charge.</P>
    <P>The total number of consumers connected under the rural electrification scheme at a recent date was 271,763 which together with 14,370 consumers who had been connected before the rural areas were developed gives a total of 286,133 or approximately 72 per cent of all rural dwellings. The total capital cost of rural electrification to date is about £32 millions.  On the basis of the present subsidy arrangements the Board can offer supply on reasonable <Col N="952" /> terms to some 100,000 rural dwellings still unconnected.  The Board expects that about 64,000 of these will accept supply during the next four years and that in due course some 96,000 will be connected bringing the total rural connections to about 96 per cent of all rural dwellings.  This achievement compares very favourably with what has been achieved in many better-off European countries.  The total estimated capital cost of connecting the 96,000 houses is £7 million or, on average, about £75 per house.</P>
    <P>There are, however, some 12,000 houses or about 3 per cent of all rural dwellings which because of their isolated locations would be hopelessly uneconomic to connect.  The total estimated capital cost of connecting these houses is £2½ million or an average of over £200 per house.  While a subsidy of £75 per house is available in these cases very heavy special service charges cannot be avoided because of the inordinately high capital cost of connection.  It will be appreciated that the cost of connecting these houses would be altogether out of proportion to any benefits to be conferred. The vast majority of these houses would be connected mainly if not wholly for lighting and cooking. These needs could in these cases be met in a reasonable way by alternative fuels and the initial cost would be insignificant compared to what it would cost to connect with the electricity supply.  With this end in view the Government have made available a grant of £10 per house towards the installation of bottled gas for these houses.</P>
    <P>Senators will, no doubt, have been struck by the magnitude of the capital investment in the electricity industry which will be required in the future, and by the rate at which it has increased.  The maximum expenditure of the ESB for general purposes, i.e. excluding expenditure on the electrification of rural areas was set at £100 million by the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1954.  In 1961, the figure was raised to £120 million, in 1962, to £135 million and it is expected that in three years' time the <Col N="953" /> limit of £160 million now proposed will have to be raised again.  The foregoing figures are exclusive of expenditure on the electrification of rural areas, which has to date cost between £32 million and £33 million.  Increasing capital investment in the electricity industry is common to all countries and, indeed, the consumption of electricity in any country is a good measure of the degree to which that country has been economically developed. Of course, as I have already indicated, the Board's cash requirements lag considerably behind their commitments.</P>
    <P>Re-investment of their depreciation funds at present provides about half the Board's annual capital requirements. For a number of years past, apart from rural subsidy totalling £5 million and minor receipts from other sources, the Board have obtained the remainder of their capital requirements direct from the public by the issue of stock guaranteed as to principal and interest by the Minister for Finance. Stock to a total of £27 million has been issued to date, including the successful issue of £7 million in March last.  The eagerness with which the Board's capital issues have been taken up by the public is a measure of the public confidence in the organisation, a confidence which I feel sure is shared by this House.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great pleasure for me to find myself in agreement with this Bill, and supporting it.  I remember the founding of the ESB, the initiation of the Shannon Scheme, and the debates that took place on it, particularly inside Dáil Éireann, but, indeed, outside it as well. This Bill is to enable the board to spend up to £160 million on general capital purposes, apart from another figure estimated at £32 million or £33 million for rural electrification.  This Bill, I think, shows the wisdom and foresight of the people who initiated the Shannon Scheme, and started the ESB.  They were friends of mine, and some were colleagues at University College, Dublin.  The man who brought <Col N="954" /> in the idea was actually a pupil of mine but not, I hasten to say, in electrical engineering.</P>
      <P>The dismal wails of the people who opposed the initiation of the ESB have been falsified, as this Bill and every other Bill like it, and the whole history of the ESB amply prove.  The predictions made as to its future development have been more than justified, and its founders have been justified.  I should like to join with the Minister in thanking the staff of the ESB from the beginning, to date, both administrative and professional or engineering, for the work they have done to make the ESB what it has now become.</P>
      <P>A few moments ago the Minister for Industry and Commerce was telling us seriously, in reply to Senator L'Estrange, that our industrial development started in 1932.  This Bill is very cogent proof that that statement is not true.  As a matter of fact, this was one of the pieces of machinery&mdash; I think the economists call it part of the infra-structure&mdash;which enabled industrial development to take place, apart from the fact that more than half of our imports were subject to tariffs by 1932.</P>
      <P>However, the important point relevant to this Bill is that the generation of electricity for light and power in this manner was a very important contribution towards industrial development. But for that measure and other measures taken by the same people industrial progress would not have been possible.  The Electricity Supply Board, founded at that time, in that way and with that opposition has been successful in paying its way generally.  All the predictions about consumption that were made then&mdash; which I must say I thought, as a nontechnical person, would be very difficult to justify&mdash;have been more than justified and I suppose I myself should be thankful that, having seen the beginning of it, it should now fall to me nearly 40 years later to support a Bill to bring the capital expenditure for general purposes of the ESB up to a figure of £160 million.  I support the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join in the welcome extended by Senator Hayes to this Bill.  The Electricity Supply Board under the various Acts has done a very fine job of work over the entire country.  The vast majority of the people are now served with electric power and the days of drudgery in their houses or in their farmyards are a thing of the past.  However, it does appear to me that the great success of the ESB highlights the small measure of its failure here and now.  When I speak of its failure, I refer to the failure of the Board to supply electric power to houses referred to by the Minister as isolated houses except on payment of a prohibitive special service charge.</P>
      <P>That is a disgrace and when we are speaking here in terms of £160 million should we not go the whole way?  I do not know whether I understood the Minister correctly or not but I think he said it would take £2 million to connect the remaining 12,000 houses or three per cent of the rural houses which at present are not connected.  I make a sincere appeal to the Minister to think again about supplying these people living in isolated districts and some of them not so isolated.  They see their neighbours getting a supply of electric power at normal rates while they are refused a supply unless they pay up to the equivalent of £200 per house.</P>
      <P>The normal cost of servicing a house is £75; the extreme case the Minister takes, or maybe it is the average case of those which are not serviced, would be £200.  Therefore, these people are asked to make an additional contribution of £125 per house notwithstanding that these people make their contribution as taxpayers to the rural electrification drive and notwithstanding the fact that they pay their rates and taxes the same as their neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This question of rural electrification should not be approached on an economic basis any more than the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should be approached on such a basis or any more than any other necessary <Col N="956" /> service should be approached on the basis of whether it is economic to supply it or not.  Looking at the overall picture, the country would get a good return for a couple of million pounds over a few years spent in supplying electric current to those people situated in inconvenient places. It would make these people happy on their holdings.  It would do something to stem the flight from the land which is going on and about which the Government say from time to time nothing can be done.</P>
    <P>Most of these people do not enjoy good roads into their houses.  They have to go through lanes and again very little is done to repair those lanes or to help them to repair them.  It is very hard to make a case for neglecting these people the way they have been neglected and I do not agree with the Minister when he says that power supplied to these people would be used entirely for cooking and heating. Most of them are progressive farmers and many of them would utilise a power supply in order to use farm machinery such as little corn mills, electric saws or appliances for heating houses for livestock, milking machines and various other things. At any rate, they get no encouragement to do it.  It is a miserable approach by the ESB and the Minister both of whom in this field have done a good job otherwise.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about the tourist drive from time to time.  I know one house situated in a lake district which caters for a goodly number of English fishermen each year.  They have been refused a supply of electric current for that house unless&mdash;and I hope I am not correct&mdash;they pay a special service charge of about £40 a year.  That is tantamount to saying to the man: &ldquo;We shall not give you a supply of electric current.&rdquo;  I think the country can stand this.  It would be money well spent and it would show a good return.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join in welcoming this Bill and in doing so I should like to add my meed of praise to the staff of Bord Soláthair Leictreachais on the wonderful achievement <Col N="957" /> and progress that the Board has made down through the years.  I should like also to support the points raised by Seanator Fitzpatrick because they are worthy of consideration by the Board.</P>
      <P>There is one point I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister and that is regarding the bimensal charges on rural households.  These charges are calculated by the floor area of the house and we find in places in rural Ireland where the Land Commission have acquired estates and men have been allotted old mansions with 35 acres of land that some of these people are denied the services of this great national network.  I would appeal to the Minister to consider introducing a maximum bimensal charge of, say, £2. It is extraordinary that one farmer may be getting a supply for around 14/-on a two-monthly charge, whereas his neighbour with, perhaps, less land and a far smaller income has to pay £4 or £5.  There is no pleasure in having a huge house if you have not got the income to keep it in the old, almost regal, tradition.  Therefore, when it comes to a farmer being allocated a Land Commission holding and being unlucky enough to be given the mansion as well, it is unfortunate that there cannot be special provision to give him the benefit of this great service.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the rural electrification scheme has made so much progress. Since we are going to sanction the spending of £160 million I would appeal to the Minister to go the whole way and add the extra £2 million to supply all rural Ireland and give the people that extra comfort which will surely be inducive to keeping more people on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome this Bill and I am grateful to the Minister for giving us the opportunity of saying a few words on rural electrification.  While it does not directly arise, he was kind enough to introduce the matter and I feel he will not object if Senators wish to take advantage of that.  We are pleased to see that a new survey is being made and houses or areas not connected already are likely to be connected in the near future.  I assume that the <Col N="958" /> Minister is referring to the more or less isolated areas but I wish to refer to an area which is within 15 miles of the city of Dublin where there are a number of cottages here and there in an area where there is already rural electrification.  Some of these houses are a quarter of a mile or a couple of hundred yards from neighbours already connected but these people are asked to pay considerably increased charges if they wish to be connected.  That is a situation which should be got over. In the same area, within the past 12 months, 15 Land Commission houses have been erected.  Eight of them have been connected by the ESB and seven of them will be connected within the next month or so.  I feel that it is a very good economic proposition for the ESB to get 15 new connections in such an area where rural electrification was introduced ten years ago; yet on the fringe of that area there may be two or three houses which they regard as uneconomic because they are a quarter of a mile or so from a house already connected.  I fail to see any justification for that type of policy on the part of the ESB and while I can congratulate the ESB officials for many things they have done I cannot congratulate them on that.</P>
      <P>That is a situation which deserves more appreciation than it is getting. I have seen returns sent to those people with reference to the scheme for the £10 grant for bottled gas.  Most of those people have gas cookers installed and I fail to see why they would qualify for the £10.  Anyway, to my mind bottled gas is a poor substitute for electric current and I would appeal to the Minister to have another look with the ESB officials at this and to give some consideration to borderline cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been received in a very kindly way, for which I thank the House.  There is not very much for me to say except to point out that while it is true that the ESB was founded a long time ago, and those who founded it showed initiative and vision, a great deal has happened since then and the Government of which I am a member have <Col N="959" /> been responsible for initiating and developing, our peat bogs as a source of power for electricity.  They also initiated the rural electrification scheme in 1946.  Remarks have also been made to the effect that the ESB has paid its way since that date.  The ESB is a very efficient and well-run organisation and, therefore, nothing I might say need detract from that, but of all the State companies it is the one which is nearest to a monopoly in certain respects and you have the combination of the privilege of near monopoly with very excellent management and first class service, with the result that the ESB has been able to pay the interest on its sinking fund and on the capital which it obtained by loan or raised itself.</P>
      <P>The only question that was put to me was in regard to the borderline cases in regard to the rural electrification programme.  It is impossible for any Government charged with enormous capital commitments to do a 100 per cent job in relation to any phase of economic, national or social development, and we decided it would be wrong to spend another £2½ million connecting 12,000 households&mdash;about 10 per cent of those unconnected&mdash;at an average cost of £200 each.  We felt it would be equally wrong to impose on the urban consumer the obligation not only of subsidising the rural consumers to the tune of about £700,000 a year, as at present&mdash;that being the loss on rural electrification consumption&mdash;but also having to subsidise them to the tune of an additional £300,000&mdash;representing the additional annual loss that would be incurred by the ESB&mdash;even if we provided the subsidy of £2½ million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members of the House can recall a great many national development schemes in which there is some limit imposed for the sake of economy, such as, for example, land reclamation.  Both Governments imposed some limit on the total cost of land reclamation in a given area.  When it becomes totally uneconomic on any basis, that land reclamation scheme is turned down. Similarly, with the bog development <Col N="960" /> grants awarded each year and the grants for accommodation roads in areas of high unemployment, there is a limit imposed in relation to the number of people who will benefit by the reclamation of the bogs and the number of people who will benefit by the repair of the road.  Equally, there is a limit in regard to the grants made for industries, if, above a certain level, it is felt that it would be too much to ask the taxpayer to contribute for the kind of industries that might be drawn to the country.  If the grant were made tremendously high, it might not result in the right kind of industry.  So one can look through the whole field of national development and discover that there is a lack of 100 per cent protectionism in regard to grants because of the immense capital commitments of the Government.  I do think that if we can secure a 96 per cent connection within the next five or ten years we will be doing very well having regard to the economic conditions of the country.</P>
    <P>I cannot help saying at this juncture that all subsidies for rural electrification were withdrawn in 1955 and only restored in 1958.  The resulting extra amount paid by the Electricity Supply Board each year as a result of that was something between £500,000 and £600,000 a year and that has not helped us in regard to making this final decision.  However, I am glad, in any event, to see that the House is in agreement with the general objectives of the Bill and I hope that the increase in consumption of electricity will continue because, as I said already, it is a sign of economic progress.  The very great increase of 10 per cent in a full year, just before the bad weather, illustrates that we are beginning to make economic progress, even if all of us would like to make it more than we are doing at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, I should like to ask a question.  I understand that the Electricity Supply Board have a system of two separate charges, a meter rent charge and a charge for the power used.  The view is held that the charges should be made purely on the Electricity Supply Board power used by the consumer <Col N="961" /> and that there should be no meter rent charge.  I am anxious to know if the Minister has any power in the matter.  Is it a ministerial matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal domestic meter rent is 1/9d. for two months and this charge is barely sufficient to meet interest on sinking fund charges and the capital involved over a period of 25 years.  It contains no provision for replacement costs.  As I understand it, domestic consumers are only paying meter rent if they are on a flat rate of charge and they do not pay service charges.  There are very few of them&mdash; about 5,000 in the Dublin area.  There are other consumers who have a meter rate.  They have a second meter installed. There are about 1,000 of these. I have been asked this question before and people are very often surprised to see this sum on their ESB bill.  Quite naturally, they have the impression that some sort of extra profit is being tacked on whereas I have the assurance of the ESB that there is no extra profit.  Whatever meter rents are charged just pay for the bare interest on the sinking fund and the capital.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <P>It is, therefore, fitting that the elected representatives of our people should mark the historic occasion in a historic manner by providing the opportunity for the President to address them in a joint sitting of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Title>Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Bill, 1962: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>Copies of the Convention relating to Co-operation for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) have been circulated for the information of Senators.</P>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to enable Ireland to continue to play a full part in maintaining, in co-operation with other States concerned, the safe, orderly and efficient flow of aircraft particularly the newer jet aircraft which fly not only at very great speeds but also at very great altitudes.  Practical experience shows that it is only through common action by the States concerned that the economic utilisation of their upper airspace can be achieved.</P>
      <P>Owing to the high speeds of jet aircraft flying above 20,000 to 25,000 feet, reliance cannot be placed on visual watch from the aircraft to avoid collisions.  All such traffic must, therefore, be controlled from the ground. Jet aircraft move quickly from an area under one control centre to another and from one national boundary to another, sometimes in a matter of minutes and this places a considerable strain on the existing control systems organised on a national basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concomitant with increases in the numbers and speed of aircraft there has been a significant growth in the volume and complexity of radio and electronic equipment designed to extend the reliability and use of aircraft in varying weather and other flying conditions.  This expansion calls for the <Col N="965" /> rationalisation of demands on available radio frequencies, and other communication media.  Keeping control centres to the minimum demanded by technical considerations and the standardisation of equipment and procedures are necessary steps in avoiding any possibility of saturation in aviation communications media.</P>
    <P>The problems arising from the increasing use of jet aircraft are accentuated in the airspace over the Western European countries because of the high density of traffic and following negotiations between them Western Germany, Belgium, France, Great Britain, Luxembourg and the Netherlands signed at Brussels on the 13th December, 1960, the &ldquo;Eurocontrol&rdquo; International Convention relating to co-operation for the safety of air navigation. The Convention concerns upper airspace i.e. above 20,000 or 25,000 feet but a contracting State could ask that the control services of its lower airspace be entrusted to the Organisation to be set up under the Convention. Approach and aerodrome control would not, however, be taken over by the Organisation.  Accordingly, if we join Eurocontrol, air traffic control for planes landing or taking off in this country and planes in transit over Ireland below the upper airspace would continue to be exercised by my Department. The staff of Eurocontrol will consist of qualified officers from the countries which are members, including Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Convention has been ratified by the six signatory States and it came into operation on the 1st March, 1963. Membership of Eurocontrol differs from that of the Common Market in that Britain is a founder member while Italy is not yet a member.  Italy's difficulties in becoming a founder member are believed to derive from the fact that its air traffic control service is administered by the military.  Spain has applied for membership of Eurocontrol.</P>
    <P>Air traffic for Eurocontrol purposes comprises civil aircraft movements and those military, customs and police aircraft movements which conform to the procedures of the International Civil Aviation Organisation.  In the case of air traffic which does not conform <Col N="966" /> with those procedures Eurocontrol will ensure that there is proper co-ordination of their activities so as to attain the maximum degree of safety of operation in airspace.</P>
    <P>The Organisation established by the Convention has two parts; a permanent Commission for the safety of air navigation, which is called the Commission, and the Air Traffic Service Agency, which is called the Agency. The Commission is the Governing Body.  The Agency is the Executive Body run by a Committee composed of representatives of the States and a Director to be appointed for a term of five years.  The planning staff at present operates from Paris but will be moving to the permanent headquarters of the Organisation in Brussels.  Ireland has had an observer in attendance at the provisional planning meetings.</P>
    <P>The work of the Organisation will include the establishment of Air Traffic Control Centres, the determination of the areas to be controlled by the centres, the equipping and staffing of the centres, the fixing of charges, the relationship of the Organisation with other Control Administrations and policy in relation to equipment. Decisions on Air Traffic Control Centres or treaties with other States must be unanimous, that is to say, each country has a veto.  Directives about financial matters require a majority of votes weighted in accordance with the gross national products of the member States.  Recommendations on common policy on navigational equipment require a majority vote of the members.  Member States have discretion as to the implementation of these recommendations.  The weighting of votes in the Commission, although related to gross national products, is not strictly proportional to those figures but is biased in favour of the smaller countries.</P>
    <P>The financial arrangements of the Organisation provide for annual Estimates, allocated either to the operating budget or to the investment budget, to be approved by the Commission. Capital expenditure will be shared proportionate to gross national products of the contracting states. <Col N="967" /> Operating costs for the first three years will be shared in the same proportion. Later that proportion will apply only to the net cost of services rendered to aircraft other than civil aircraft of contracting states.  In the case of civil aircraft of contracting states net operating costs will be shared proportionate to user.  Provision is made for the raising of charges directly against users.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated that the contribution of Great Britain to Eurocontrol in the early years of operation will be almost one-third of the whole. France and West Germany will contribute a quarter each, Belgium and the Netherlands about a twentieth each and Luxembourg about £1 in every £400.  The 1963 budget for Eurocontrol is estimated at £90,000, and Ireland's contribution would be about £700. The cost of the organisation next year may rise to £2 million of which our contribution would be £16,200 on the basis of gross national product.  As against this expenditure, there would be savings in the costs of operation of navigational services in this country, as part of these would be borne by Eurocontrol, and eventually large savings in capital expenditure on the purchase of equipment.</P>
    <P>Formal adherence to the Eurocontrol Convention will be dealt with in accordance with the procedure laid down in our Constitution.  The purpose of enacting the present Bill is to ensure that the necessary legal status can be given to the Organisation to carry out its functions in the upper airspace on adherence of this country to the Convention.  The upper airspace for this purpose is that above altitudes of 20,000 to 25,000 feet.  The precise level will be decided by agreement in due course.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives the Organisation corporate status so as to enable it to enter into contracts and other commercial relationship and to sue and be sued in the courts.  The Bill also gives the Organisation the necessary authority to ensure that in its daily tasks of allocating airspace to aircraft so as to secure the safe and orderly flow of <Col N="968" /> traffic its working would not be frustrated through the failure of some aircraft to follow instructions.  Accordingly, it is proposed that aircraft flying in airspace over Ireland or Irish registered aircraft flying anywhere in Eurocontrol airspace will be guilty of an offence under Irish law if they fail to comply with authorisations to proceed issued by Eurocontrol.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the Bill to give diplomatic inviolability to Eurocontrol archives and to premises housing Eurocontrol installations and to exempt the organisation and its employees from specified taxes and customs requirements. This provision repeats that made in other countries and is the minimum necessary to provide the means of common action.  Provision is made also to enable the necessary payments to be made to Eurocontrol. These fall into two classes.  In the first place the State assumes responsibility for annual contributions to be assessed under the terms of the Convention. Recurring liabilities of this kind would be defrayed from Voted moneys and accordingly would come before the Dáil annually.  It is possible also that the State might have to collect at least on an interim basis charges from users of Eurocontrol services and remit them in whole or in part to the organisation. Provision is made accordingly to enable regulations to be made for the collection and transmission of user charges to the organisation.  In addition, power is taken to enable user charges to be collected by the State in respect of services provided by it.  The purpose of this provision is to make express provision for the collection of these charges and, accordingly, to remove any possibility of legal doubts in the matter.  The Bill makes provision also for the acquisition of land for transfer to Eurocontrol for the purpose of its activities.  The main requirement for land, in so far as civil aviation is concerned, is for airport purposes and the amount of land required for radio aids and housing navigational facilities is insignificant.  Right of entry on lands for the purpose of erecting radio buildings and aids can be negotiated usually without recourse to compulsion and <Col N="969" /> accordingly the extra powers of acquisition involved in the proposals contained in the Bill are unimportant.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the making of Ministerial Orders, to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, which appear to be necessary or expedient for carrying out the Convention.  All important matters contained in the Convention are covered by the Bill and the purpose of the provision is to enable incidental and administrative requirements to be met from time to time.  The Bill provides also for the making of regulations requiring owners and hirers of aircraft to keep records. The use of electrical and radio equipment in aircraft, in control centres and in ground aids to navigation has progressed to such an extent that the facts of any incident in the flight of an aircraft may be determinable only on the basis of the evidence supplied by the examination of this equipment or the recording apparatus incorporated in or associated with it.  It is accordingly necessary to include items such as discs, films and tapes in the definition of the records for the purpose of the provision.</P>
    <P>It is desirable to mention, however, in relation to the provisions in the Bill with respect to offences and the making of regulations that, in the ultimate, reliance cannot be placed on punitive measures for securing compliance with the requirements and procedures of Eurocontrol.  The Organisation is founded on the practical necessities of the limitations of the available upper air space and the impossibility of the safe and efficient use of that space except on the basis of full co-operation and exchange of information between national administrations and between the Eurocontrol Agency and those engaged in the day to day operation of aircraft.</P>
    <P>I should mention that Eurocontrol is a civilian organisation and that our adherence to the Convention does not involve the country in any way in military commitments, either explicit or implied.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill strongly to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as we have <Col N="970" /> been told, is brought before us to enable Ireland to carry out her obligations under the Convention signed in Brussels on 13th December, 1960, at the Eurocontrol International Conference. As the Minister explained to us, the object of the Convention is to further safeguard the airlines of the world, and in this case to deal with high-flying and fast-flying aircraft&mdash; planes that fly at 20,000 feet and 25,000 feet, and such great heights.  We in Ireland are all very proud of the safety record of our existing airlines for such a long period of time.  Long may that safety record last, we all pray.</P>
      <P>It is apparent to anyone who has experience of flying&mdash;and nowadays that applies to a growing number of people&mdash;how complicated and dangerous air traffic has become everywhere. Therefore, improved and improving methods must be found to maintain the safety record that already exists, not only in this country but, it is fair to say, in the world in general. If we examine the comparatively low degree of disaster in the air, and compare it even with that on the roads in this and in every other country, or with any form of transport, we find that there is quite a remarkable safety record all over the world in the air, and Aer Lingus is at the top of the class in the safety sphere.  It is not only with Aer Lingus that we should be concerned, but with safety in Ireland.  Ireland's name, as a country, should be associated with air safety in all its shapes and forms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us that Eurocontrol was started by countries where there is the heaviest density of aircraft, and where aircraft converge from all parts of the world and control of navigation has become more and more difficult.  It is obvious, as he also explained, that the fast-flying planes must be controlled from the ground, and must be controlled in the most efficient way possible.  It is also obvious that if that control were left to individual countries, it would be good, bad or indifferent, according to the countries concerned, and their concern with safety.  The right way <Col N="971" /> to go about this problem is to get the nations concerned to come together and pool their resources and their equipment, and to have equal standards of efficiency at all points over which planes fly.  That is the only way in which such an aim can be achieved.  Therefore, I feel that we as a country are very wise to participate in this organisation.</P>
    <P>Several points arise, but I shall not delay the House because the Minister explained the whole position very well in his opening statement.  Views have been expressed as to whether, by joining this international organisation and subscribing to this Convention, we might involve ourselves in other commitments. The Minister has clearly and specifically stated that no military commitments will arise out of this Convention and the Bill with which we are dealing today.</P>
    <P>I see that the Minister says traffic at Dublin Airport will not be affected because all our planes fly under 25,000 feet and traffic coming into and going out of Dublin Airport is under that level.  I am not sure whether the same applies to Shannon Airport in relation to the planes which come into Shannon and land at the port.</P>
    <P>This is an international service.  The setting up of stations and equipment here will be welcome not only for what they will do for aircraft but because they will be very good for our own personnel, technicians and the people concerned with the air industry.  They will be associated with this international organisation and be part of the staff working for it.  In that way we will not only participate in this international operation but it is bound to be very good for our own people and technicians.  It will keep them in the closest touch with what is happening in aviation generally and so, in an international co-operative way, they will be enabled to find out and know what is happening generally, and what are the latest safety methods.</P>
    <P>The only other point is that one is inclined to ask are our financial obligations under this Convention very great. It would seem from what the Minister <Col N="972" /> has told us that our share this year will be small, only £700.  Next year, when it is envisaged that more money will be needed, I do not think that £16,200 is a sum we should shy at in view of the other benefits which we will get.  From our participation and, indeed, from the use of the equipment and a saving in capital investment, it will be very well worthwhile.  I have much pleasure in supporting the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to join in welcoming this Bill.  Apart from any other considerations we may have as a comparatively small partner in the brotherhood of the flying lanes which now cover every country in the world, we have an obvious duty, not only to ourselves but to the whole of mankind, and to everyone who is even remotely interested in or connected with the flying of aircraft in any part of the world.  We would be lacking in our duty to ourselves and to our fellow nations if we did not take our rightful place inside a system of this kind.</P>
      <P>Anyone who has had any experience of flying, and particularly of flying in the faster type of aircraft for which the introduction of this system of Eurocontrol is intended, does not have to be a technician&mdash;I am not; I have had experience of flying but I do not need convincing&mdash;to know that no individual national system of navigation is any longer adequate to cater for the type of traffic we have got to get used to.  These are obviously international problems which will require control on an international scale.  We have a duty which we cannot shirk or ignore, and I think the Department are taking the right and proper steps in placing the country within this system.  Certainly, for that reason, if for no other reason, this Bill will be welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for their friendly reception of this Bill.  As Senator McGuire has said, we have to do everything possible to ensure air safety and I am glad he paid a tribute to Aer Lingus and Aerlínte in that <Col N="973" /> regard.  In fact, the death per million passenger miles all over the world decreased last year in spite of the appallingly tragic accidents that are reported from time to time in the newspapers. This measure is designed further to increase safety measures and to ensure the safe passage of aircraft in areas where the number flying is very considerable.</P>
      <P>In speaking of the record of Aer Lingus, I always like to pay a tribute to those who are frequently forgotten because they are the people with whom there is no romantic connection, namely, the maintenance men in Aer Lingus who maintain the planes, who take them to pieces at stated intervals and examine all the parts.  Their devotion to duty contributes very largely, along with that of the pilots and the general executive officers of Aer Lingus, to this splendid record which we hope will continue.  The maintenance men are all too frequently forgotten. Everybody thinks of the pilots flying in the air whereas maintenance control is of very great importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator McGuire has said, the financial obligation incurred through participation in Eurocontrol will be offset by participation in the use of their equipment and by other forms of saving.  I should say the cost of air traffic control of all kinds is absolutely enormous and I am thinking particularly of the cost of a form of new long <Col N="974" /> distance precision radar which we are now establishing at Dublin Airport in order to conform with the regulations in the International Civil Aircraft Organisation and to keep up our standards. We are paying anything up to £150,000 for this piece of equipment which is designed to scan and see aeroplanes at a distance of anything from 100 to 200 miles.  Therefore, the cost of air traffic control in general is a very heavy commitment on the Vote each year but it is essential and we do our best to collect as much as we can in the form of landing fees and other charges for aircraft to meet the inevitable deficit which arises in this and other countries.  I thank the House for their co-operation in relation to this measure.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
