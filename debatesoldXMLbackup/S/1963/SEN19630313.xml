      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 12, to add a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() This section shall not apply to a trade mark which qualifies for registration in Part B and which is shown to the satisfaction of the Controller to have been continually used in the State for a period of not less than two years immediately preceding the application.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this amendment and the subsequent amendment at the request of the Association of Registered Patent Agents, who are specialists in the subject matter of this Bill.  Since the Second Stage of the Bill was taken here last week, the Minister was kind enough to agree to receive a deputation of the Patent Agents Association. He received that deputation at very short notice and I wish, on my own behalf and on their behalf, to publicly thank himself and his officials for so doing.  The fact that the Association of Registered Patent Agents have thought fit to follow up these amendments both in the Dáil and in this House, the fact that they have thought fit to prepare lengthy <Col N="410" /> memoranda in support of these amendments, and the fact that they have thought fit to ask the Minister to receive them on a deputation, is, I think, the best argument that I could put to the House or to the Minister in support of these amendments.</P>
    <P>These agents specialise in registering trade marks and advising business people on their rights in respect of trade marks.  As I said on the Second Stage, there are only three or four of them in the country and each and every one of them has long experience in this branch of the law.  So much by way of general remarks.  As I say, I cannot put forward any better argument than the anxiety of these men to improve this Bill as much as they can and their anxiety to produce a perfect Act.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 1, which stands in my name, is an amendment to Section 22.  It proposes to add a new subsection which will read as follows:</P>
    <P>This section shall not apply to a trade mark which qualifies for registration in Part B and which is shown to the satisfaction of the Controller to have been continually used in the State for a period of not less than two years immediately preceding the application.</P>
    <P>As we all know, the object in registering a trade mark is to secure a statutory protection for the trade mark and to protect infringements of it.  Apart from that statutory protection, the owner of a used trade mark acquires rights in it at common law, which he can enforce against anybody who attempts to infringe it.</P>
    <P>A trade mark may be registered in either Part A or Part B of the register. As I hope to show the House by a short quotation, there is a considerable difference between registration in Part A and Part B.  It is harder to qualify for registration in Part A but, once registered there, the owner of a trade mark has greater protection.  It follows that it is easier to get registered in Part B, but Part B affords less protection.  To show what I mean, I propose reading a short passage from the judgment of the late Mr. Justice <Col N="411" /> Meredith in the Leathermac case of Richardson v. Weiner, which is reported.  Mr. Justice Meredith said:</P>
    <P>The reason that the requirements for registration in Part B are substantially less stringent than those for registration in Part A is that the proprietor is put in a less advantageous position.  Under Section 113 registration in Part A gives to the proprietor (subject as therein stated), &ldquo;the exclusive right to the use of such trade mark upon or in connection with the goods in respect of which it is registered.&rdquo;  Registration in Part B does not confer this right at all.  It merely makes the registration <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the registered proprietor has the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark, and even then the proprietor can obtain no relief for infringement if the Court is satisfied that the user by the Defendant is not calculated to deceive.  (See Section 114.)  The net effect, therefore, of registration in Part B seems to be to facilitate an action in which the Plaintiff has a substantially lighter burden of proof than he has in an ordinary &ldquo;passing off&rdquo; action, while, at the same time, not being as exacting in the requirements for registration as in the case of registration in Part A.</P>
    <P>It follows from that that there is a considerable difference between Part A and Part B.</P>
    <P>For the past sixty years it was possible to register a trade mark in Part B on proof that it had been used by the applicant for a period of two years, and it was not possible to be called upon to accept a disclaimer in respect of any part of a Part B mark. A disclaimer, as I tried to explain the last day, is a renunciation of rights in respect of part of a trade mark. Supposing the trade mark was &ldquo;Tudor Chocolates&rdquo; manufactured by Cadburys, in a Part A application the Controller could ask the applicant to disclaim his absolute right to the word &ldquo;Tudor&rdquo; and anyone else could come along and use &ldquo;Tudor&rdquo; as part of another trade mark.  That is as clearly <Col N="412" /> as I can state the meaning of &ldquo;disclaimer&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It was always accepted here that because a Part B registration conferred lesser rights, a disclaimer was never called upon and never thought necessary.  That has been the position here since 1905, and I respectfully suggest to the Minister that in all that time there have been no complaints and no abuses about failure to insist on disclaimer in respect of a Part B registration.  It is a well-settled principle of law and procedure that unnecessary disclaimers are to be avoided.</P>
    <P>I think I can best put my argument on this aspect of the case by reading part of the judgment in a case reported in the Reports of Patent, Design and Trade Mark cases, 1915, Volume 32, No. 7.  The title of the case is an &ldquo;Application by Cadbury Brothers Ltd. for the Registration of a Trade Mark.&rdquo;  In the course of the judgment Mr. Justice Sargant said:</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I think that the commercial case made on behalf of the Applicants is also well founded, that they would, by disclaiming on registering their Trade Mark any right to the exclusive use of the word &ldquo;Tudor&rdquo;, in fact be inviting the public to disregard such common law rights as they may have acquired to the use of the name, with the result that there would be a crop of passing-off actions.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that in the section to which I have referred there is the ultimate proviso &ldquo;that no disclaimer upon the Register shall effect any rights of the proprietor of a Trade Mark, except such as arise out of the registration of the Trade Mark in respect of which the disclaimer is made&rdquo;; but commercial persons do not go about with their heads full of provisos to sections of Acts of Parliament, and I can quite see that the disadvantage to the applicants of the insertion on the register of such a disclaimer, unless it is really necessary, might well outweigh the advantage to be derived by the public in general from the impossibility of its being said that there was some statutory, as distinguished <Col N="413" /> from some common law, right to the exclusive use of the word &ldquo;Tudor&rdquo; in connection with chocolates.</P>
    <P>It seems to me perfectly clear that the registration of this trade mark cannot possibly give rise to any rights except a right to the mark as a whole.  It cannot give any statutory rights at all in respect of the word &ldquo;Tudor&rdquo;, and, that being so, it seems to me that it is wholly inexpedient to place on the register what appear to me to be totally unnecessary disclaimers from the legal point of view, because the effect of that is to unsettle the law and raise difficulties in other cases.  The effect of inserting disclaimers which are unnecessary is to raise all sorts of difficulties in cases where such disclaimers are not inserted.  If the registrar had merely exercised his discretion in one particular case on one particular application, it may be that I should have found great difficulty in overruling that discretion, having regard especially to what was said in the well-known case of Eno v. Dunn, but here the registrar appears to be insisting on this disclaimer in accordance with a general practice of the office which he has stated.  In my judgment that practice is one which is far too wide and would result, as a general rule, in the placing on the register of a vast crop of unnecessary disclaimers.</P>
    <P>With the greatest respect I could not possibly hope to put the argument clearer than that.  Section 22 as it stands will do just that.  It will result in placing on the register a vast crop of unnecessary disclaimers.  As I said earlier, apart from the right which the owner of a trade mark gets from registration, he may already have common law rights, and the registration of a disclaimer is an invitation to all and sundry to deprive this man of his common law rights.  It will lead to confusion and a great many actions for passing-off.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say that a person can by registering anything he likes under Part B acquire rights to it. Before a trade mark is registered under Part B it must meet the requirements of Section 18.  The provisions <Col N="414" /> of that section are quite exacting and, therefore, subject to what the Minister has to say, I urge him to accept this amendment.  I say this disclaimer is unnecessary.  Why do I say it is unnecessary? The law as it stands has worked perfectly well for nearly 60 years without causing any abuse.  I know the Minister will tell me that up to now it has not been possible to register new trade marks in Part B. You could only register a trade mark which had been in use for two years. The Bill proposes to confer the right to register new trade marks.  I accept that completely; I understand it, but why interfere with the established custom and procedure that has been going on for 60 years by virtue of which a mark in use for two years can be registered without disclaimer?  I have no objection to the Minister taking power to insist on new trade marks under Section B being registered subject to disclaimer.  I think that is reasonable, but I think the Minister and his advisers&mdash;I will not say fell into a trap&mdash; went on the line of reasoning that in England since 1938 the law has been amended and I think, when the Minister decided to extend the right to register new marks in Part B, he then decided to go the whole way and said they would register all the marks subject to a disclaimer, or give the right to register all marks subject to a disclaimer. Therefore, when he is giving something with one hand, he is taking it away with the other.  I urge strongly on the Minister, both in my own name and in the name of the Association of Patent Agents, that this amendment should be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Fitzpatrick observed, I saw the Senator with three registered patent agents on this point yesterday.  I had already dealt with this matter in the Dáil and had resisted an amendment.  I had, of course, before then taken fully into account advice which I had got and memoranda which I had read on both sides of this particular question.  Nevertheless, I decided to see the agents, in case by sticking to the text of the Bill as it stands I might in any way do an injustice or in any way make this a <Col N="415" /> less effective Bill, to make sure that none of these two events would happen.</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to what the agents had to say and read subsequently very carefully the brief they presented to me on this matter.  I want to say at this stage that in major respects no new arguments had been put forward that I had not taken into account before.  In some other respects, new arguments were put forward but were not sufficient to convince me.</P>
      <P>Let us look back on this whole question.  First of all, a mark must be distinctive of the goods that it purports to refer to whether the mark is registrable in part A or part B of the register. This is the first prerequisite.  The mark may be registered in part A.  It is a much more effective registration because after seven years it may not be objected to.  Part B is different.  The marks there may be more easily removed and for that reason some marks that would not qualify in the opinion of the Controller for registration in Part A are registrable in Part B.</P>
      <P>Hitherto in this country, the law has been that marks that had been in use in the State for a period of two years were qualified for registration in Part B if they first passed the required test of distinctiveness.  But even with that distinctiveness and even with two years' use in the State, there could still be certain symbols, letters, numbers, or words forming part of that mark which could be marks, letters, symbols, numbers or words in ordinary use and matters that no one person could be given a proprietary interest in.  The intention is that if a mark such as that were in use for two years it should be, provided it satisfied the test of distinctiveness, registered in Part B.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the law as I now propose it, the same test of distinctiveness will still apply, but the 2-years' user will not be necessary if the distinctiveness test is satisfied.  But the Controller may require a disclaimer in respect of part of the mark in which it would be wrong to give a proprietary interest to the applicant for registration.  I think that is reasonable because the provision <Col N="416" /> as I propose it, and as it is in the Bill, is an illustration of the dual purpose of this Bill, protecting the proprietary rights of the registered proprietor on the one hand and also the trading public from unreasonable trespass on their natural rights on the other.</P>
    <P>I want to say, in reference to what Senator Fitzpatrick said, that the law has been changed in England since 1938.  It is not my intention, nor do I think it is generally desirable, to follow willynilly British law in this matter, although in matters affecting commercial interests we tend to follow them&mdash;insurance, trade marks, copyright and other matters like that&mdash; because we have such a lot to do with British trade in this respect.  But the law was changed, from what we now have to what we now propose, in Britain in 1938 and has continued so since. That, as I said, is not a sufficient test but, nevertheless, I think it is an illustration that it has worked out satisfactorily in practice in Britain over the past quarter of a century.</P>
    <P>The three patent agents who came to see me did put up certain arguments which, as I said, have not succeeded in convincing me.  But there are other people who are interested in this line of business&mdash;members of the Senator's own profession and the Incorporated Law Society who have been adverting to the provisions of this Bill.  Their members have dealings in trade mark applications and they&mdash;the Incorporated Law Society&mdash;did not make any suggestion along the lines now being made in the Senator's amendment. The Senator suggested that a vast crop of disclaimers would be likely to be made on Part B of the register.  I have made, or attempted to make, an assessment of the number of disclaimers that would be likely to be made in used marks having regard to the previous experience of the Controller and his staff in this respect, and the figure that I have got for likely disclaimers in Part B on this basis is four per annum.  This is the best estimate I can get of the number of disclaimers likely to arise.</P>
    <P>There is another section in the Bill &mdash;Section 48&mdash;which enables traders who propose to register trade marks to <Col N="417" /> come in advance and seek preliminary information from the Controller as to whether such a mark would be registrable without going through all the formalities of full application for registration.  There, again, is the prospect of avoiding cluttering up of the register or avoiding the emergence of a vast crop of disclaimers.  The provisions now proposed in the Bill are expected to facilitate traders seeking registrations.  They will not render any less effective the registration given to the marks in Part B.  An insistence on a disclaimer will not affect in any way the common law rights that the trade mark would have established for itself by user or otherwise.</P>
    <P>One other remark in respect of user &mdash;the suggestion that 2-years' user within the State should be sufficient. Assuming a mark has all the elements of distinctiveness and assuming the trader can establish that it has been used for two years in the State, the extent of usage will be in question. If the Controller satisfies himself, if it is proved that it is in use, then the extent of that use either in scope or in relation to the sale of goods will matter because that user could be confined to a very small part of the State. A man might be making a small commodity on the Island of Cape Clear which is in the State.  He could have established a 2-year user of the mark in a small community like that.  The mark could be distinctive but, nevertheless, could contain certain elements over which a person could not be entitled to register a proprietary interest.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in all the circumstances, I think the law as now proposed is a better one than we have had up to this and I think the interests both of traders who seek to register the marks and of the public are better safeguarded in the Bill as it stands.  I regret that I cannot accept the Senator's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of what the Minister said, I should like to ask whether he or his Department had any evidence of hardship having arisen since the foundation of the State as a result of registrations in Part B without disclaimer.  I would be <Col N="418" /> very interested to hear if there had. I respectfully suggest that what the Minister is doing here is just accepting the British Act of 1938 in its entirety. I have no objection at all to following the British law, where that law is sound or where its procedure is desirable. However, I do not think, just for the sake of uniformity, that we should accept the British law without question.  A better thing to have done here was to accept the British law in so far as it is an improvement, but to retain our own law in so far as it has stood the test of time.</P>
      <P>I should also like to suggest to the Minister that a person might be better off not to register a trade mark at all than to register in Part B subject to a disclaimer, because if he registers in Part B subject to a disclaimer in respect of a substantial part of his mark, then he is debarred from becoming the owner of the mark by using it. Instead of improving his position he is putting himself in a worse position.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggested that the Incorporated Law Society has not called for the amendment I am seeking. I think there are about 1,300 members of the Incorporated Law Society and I do not think that any percentage of them would hold themselves out as experts on trade mark.  The number of times that solicitors are called to deal with trade mark law is, indeed, very, very seldom.  When we are, we usually pass on the case to one of the three gentlemen whom I introduced to the Minister yesterday afternon.  The Minister stated that as far as he can assess the number of disclaimers which would be insisted upon under Part B would be as low as four per annum.  I should like to know how the Minister arrived at that assessment.  I would say the very fact that the Controller presumably advised the Minister to put in this provision in the Bill means that the Controller intends to use it and that he thinks it is a good thing to use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said before, there are two sides to every story.  There is the official side; there is the administrative side, and, presumably, this disclaimer provision might make it more difficult for the Controller to make mistakes and might make the administration of the Act easier.  On the other hand, it is not <Col N="419" /> in the interests, in my opinion, of the commercial public, with whom we should be interested here.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Minister is quite correct when he says that to qualify for registration in Part B the mark must have a distinctiveness.  I think that only relates to registration in Part A and that it is enough for registration in Part B if the mark is capable of distinguishing.  That is the test for Part B.  To pass for part A it must have a characteristic distinctiveness of its own.  It is a much more severe test.  That is really the whole weight of my argument that the little protection that Part B gives&mdash;and it is not a very effective protection&mdash;is being taken away from it by this section, which I say will be used.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Senator did say is correct.  There are distinctions between the distinctiveness in the two Parts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The requirement for Part A is adapted to distinguish.  There are two degrees of distinctiveness.  As far as the disclaimer element is concerned, the Senator suggested that the person is more or less weakening the validity of his mark in respect of some part of which he has to enter a disclaimer, a mark which the Controller thinks, at the time of the application for registration, is not capable of being registered without a disclaimer, because the word, the letter or the number might be in common use.  It might be one that anybody else would feel he should have as much a right to as the applicant.  Nevertheless, that applicant who has to carry a disclaimer can, in respect of the disclaimed element, in time apply for registration separately of that element.  Therefore, the fact that a disclaimer is entered at a particular time does not rule a person out for all time if he satisfies the Controller <Col N="420" /> subsequently of its distinctiveness and of its distinctiveness as applied to his own particular goods, which may usually come about by usage.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the Controller cannot exercise the functions that he has in respect of these applications, particularly as to disclaimer, capriciously, arbitrarily or otherwise unreasonably. He must exercise them judicially. There is an appeal to the court. Therefore, if the Controller, whoever he might be, had been particularly difficult about demanding disclaimers, then his decisions in the course of practice are always appealable to the courts.  Therefore, no enduring hardship could possibly ensue even if it could be claimed that the Controller was unduly difficult in these matters.</P>
      <P>By and large, I think the Bill, as now proposed, will make it easier for people who have marks, which they apply to their goods, and want to register as capable of distinguishing these goods, to do so.  At the same time, it will protect the interests of the general public and of other traders.  I am afraid I can add nothing more to what I have already said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister has no evidence of hardship having arisen, because if he had he would have told me.  As I see it at the present time the Controller has to make up his mind on the application before him.  If we give this section into the hands of the Controller he will not have to make up his mind.  He will have an easy way out, and he can adopt the line of least resistance and say: &ldquo;I will register your mark, but I will register it subject to a disclaimer.&rdquo; The fact that the Controller wants this section in the Bill leads me to believe that he intends to use it, and use it liberally.  For that reason, and because there has been no case of hardship, the Minister has not convinced me, and I am sure he has not convinced the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 10, before &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to insert:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and the interest in an application to the Controller for the registration of the trade mark&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to make it possible to assign an application for registration of a trade mark. The Bill proposes to change the law regarding the assigning of trade marks. Up to the present it was not possible to assign or transfer a trade mark without transferring the goodwill of the business attached to the trade mark. The Minister has decided to make it easier to transfer or assign a trade mark, and under the Bill it is possible to transfer a trade mark without transferring the goodwill.</P>
      <P>I approve of that and I welcome it, but I think it is a great pity that the Minister did not avail of the Bill to make it possible to assign an application for a trade mark.  The whole point in registering a trade mark is to obtain protection for it.  As we all know, if a person has a copyright or a useful trade mark, the sooner he gets protection for it the better.  The date from which protection is afforded is the date of application.  If I apply on 1st January, 1962, to be registered as the owner of a trade mark, and my application is not finally dealt with until 1st January, 1964, two years later, I would still be registered as from 1st January, 1962, and I could sue anyone who used my trade mark during that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Bill it is not possible to assign that application.  Again, if on 1st January, 1962, I apply for registration of a trade mark in respect of some goods which I manufacture, and six months later I sell my business, I cannot sell the interest in my application for the trade mark.  I must do one of two things.  I must discontinue my application altogether and let it be started anew in the name of the purchaser&mdash;and if I do not do that, the purchaser loses valuable priority&mdash;or I can continue the application in the name of the applicant.  It is true that if the applicant is still in existence <Col N="422" /> when the mark is registered he can assign it to the purchaser.</P>
    <P>If the application is to be discontinued and started anew, as I said, priority is lost.  That is very important. It goes to the whole root of the registration of trade marks.  The date as from which protection is obtained is most important, and if the application is discontinued and I lose priority that is important.  The alternative is to let the application go through and for the original applicant to assign it.  That is where I say difficulties really crop up.</P>
    <P>At present many foreign companies are buying trade marks here.  There are big take-over bids as between one company and another.  A situation can arise in which the company which applied for registration of a trade mark may be defunct.  It may not be in existence when the trade mark is registered.  If that is so, that company cannot then assign the trade mark and it continues to be registered in the name of a defunct organisation.  That is not an imaginary case.  This business of companies becoming defunct occurs frequently as, for example, when one American company is merged with another.  The patent agents who deal with those matters tell me that has happened frequently and has caused hardship.  They tell me that between them they are asked on average once a week to advise on that sort of thing, and they say: &ldquo;You cannot assign your application,&rdquo; and the whole thing is dropped.  It may not come to the knowledge of the Controller and it may not come to the knowledge of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Up to about five years ago it was possible to assign an application in the Industrial and Commercial Property Office.  An application was made by A and if he sold his business and the interest in the application, he would merely go to the Controller for assignment in the name of the purchaser and the application was continued in the name of the purchaser.  That was the practice and procedure in the Industrial and Commercial Property Office up to five years ago.  I defy contradiction on that.  Whether it was right or wrong it was a convenient procedure, and it worked well and led to no abuses.  As from about five years ago, <Col N="423" /> the procedure was changed, and it has not since been possible to assign an application.  If an individual applicant dies, the Act and the rules provide that the application may be continued in the name of his personal representative. This is in the Act and it is in the rules.</P>
    <P>What I am really asking the Minister to do is to put a company in exactly the same position as an individual and to say if the company becomes defunct, or before it becomes defunct, it can assign the application to somebody else.  I do not think that is unreasonable.  The Minister and his advisers have followed by and large amendments of the law in England, where he has thought it advisable so to do.  There is law dealing with trade marks.  There is law dealing with copyrights and there is law dealing with patents.  I am told that the law in relation to patents was amended in England by an Act of 1949; that prior to 1949 it was not possible to assign an application for the registration of a patent, but the shortcoming of that was seen by the British and in their Act of 1949 they remedied that and it is now possible to assign an application for registration in a patent.  I ask the Minister and the House what is the difference between an application to register a patent and an application to register a trade mark?  Each of them is equally important in its own sphere.</P>
    <P>The Minister was good enough to receive a deputation and far be it from me to discuss in detail any interview that we had.  While we were received in deputation, I feel that this is an oversight in the Bill.  It is a great inconvenience and I personally&mdash;this is something that any practising lawyer will be able to follow&mdash;cannot for the life of me see what the objection is to continuing the application in the name of a purchaser.  The Minister told me on the Second Stage that the reason was that the trade mark, when it was registered, was registered as at the date of application.  In my respectful and considered opinion, that is the strongest possible argument in favour of the right to assign because it means <Col N="424" /> the date of application is important; it is extremely important.  I think that I am correct in saying that all sorts of rights which are in the course of being acquired can be assigned.  I think a squatter's title in the course of being acquired can be assigned.</P>
    <P>An action started in the High Court in the name of one person can, for the sake of evidence, be continued in the name of another person.  There is nothing fundamental about this amendment.  It is simply an amendment calculated to make this Bill work more easily and make the work of the people dealing with it easier.</P>
    <P>The Minister may ask how many cases of hardship have arisen because it is not possible to assign.  I asked the Minister that question in relation to my previous amendment and he did not answer me.  I take it, therefore, that there was none.  I do think that there are many cases of hardship resulting from it being impossible to assign applications.  There are, of course, degrees of hardship.  Applications have in many cases to be withdrawn; additional fees have to be paid; additional fees in the form of stamp duties have to be paid and additional fees have to be paid to professional people for making new applications.  That is a hardship.  Then there is the case of the defunct corporation.  That is a real hardship which crops up very often. When a person is considering selling out his business and his trade mark, if he is a company, it very often happens that the company is thinking of going out of business; otherwise it would not be selling.  It is very likely that the company is considering going out of business.  There may be long delays and even an Irish company could be wound up before the mark became registered.  It would not then be in a position to assign.  You have the question of a foreign merger.  There is one final point I want to make on this.  I understand that a foreign company which registers its trade mark abroad and then assigns it here can in some way or another&mdash;I confess I am not too clear about it&mdash;register this trade mark here as on the date on which it was registered abroad and in that way <Col N="425" /> can get priority that is not open to an Irish national.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that this is a desirable amendment.  It is an amendment which the Minister could very well accept.  There is no question of principle involved.  There is no hardship on anybody and it would at least make the work of the people dealing with this sort of thing a lot easier and, when passed, it would avoid serious hardship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Fitzpatrick in regard to this amendment.  Before doing so, however, I should also like to associate myself with what he said on the first amendment in thanking the Minister for his courtesy in receiving the members of the Patent Agents Association, which he did for a considerable time yesterday afternoon and at short notice.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that there are three main arguments which have already been debated here and in the Dáil against the amendment and I should like to summarise those for a moment. Senator Fitzpatrick has in part dealt with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first is that no real hardship is caused by not putting in the amendment. I think Senator Fitzpatrick has put particularly well the hardship that is caused.  The one case which I should like to underline for him is that of American companies.  As I understand it, company law here is that, when a company is going to cease to operate, it goes into liquidation. Liquidation takes some time.  The liquidator has to be appointed and although the liquidation may proceed, the liquidator is still able to make assignments of sales of property.  In the United States I understand the position is different in that the company, when it is taken over by another company, may, in fact, die completely.  It is not a question of shares being acquired and a company, or its subsidiary, being controlled by another company.  The company which is being taken over apparently dies completely. In such an event, I think a very great hardship is caused if the company put in application for registration and is then precluded from proceeding <Col N="426" /> with it because it has, in fact, died and the taking over company, the company which has bought its shares, is not able to proceed.  As the trade mark agents told us yesterday, they have requests to deal with this sort of problem on an average of one a week &mdash;50 a year&mdash;and that seems a great deal.</P>
    <P>Another argument against the amendment is that the amendment may not be able to stand by itself. That is probably true.  If the amendment were to be accepted in subsection (1) of this section it would be necessary for further amendments to be made to the section dealing with partial assignment.  Probably the whole of this part of Section 30 would need alteration in some form or another. That should not be an insuperable task if the amendment of itself is sound.  I would hope that the Minister would not be put off by the fact that this amendment will present some difficulty.</P>
    <P>Finally, the argument against the amendment seems to be that it is not in the British Act of 1938.  Senator Fitzpatrick spoke of practising lawyers. I might consider myself a practising lawyer, and I find it, quite frankly, a very humiliating experience and a very frequent one, when dealing with lawyers across the water, to have to say, in relation to companies' matters or trade mark matters, patent matters or quite a number of matters of law in general, &ldquo;We have not got that&rdquo;.  They say: &ldquo;Well you are rather behind the times&rdquo;.  It seems to me that here we have a chance to be able to say we are ahead of them on the other side.</P>
    <P>I understand that the British Association of Trade Mark and Patent Agents are very keen to see an amendment of this kind introduced into the next British Act.  We have to remember that the last British Act was in 1938 and normal trade practice has developed very considerably since that time, which is 25 years ago.  If the British are thinking now in terms of introducing some amendment of this kind into future legislation, I should like to see us at least for once one jump ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to mention two specific points Senator Fitzpatrick raised, apart from the generalities of his argument.  One was that there is provision for the transfer of applications for patents.  He suggested that there is no distinction, but a patent involves an invention, something positive, something tangible, created by somebody, and for that reason, I think, patents are in a different category altogether.</P>
      <P>Secondly, he said that what he proposed in his amendment was the practice in the office some time ago.  There was evidence of two cases in which the transfer of the interest in an application was granted&mdash;an application for a registration of a trade mark was granted.  There was such a case but it was a mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Several cases I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Two cases could be traced.  Since these statements were made in the course of the passage of this Bill through both Houses an exhaustive examination has been made and it is established, as near as possible, that this has been discontinued.</P>
      <P>On the general issue, a trade mark is something that is industrial or commercial property.  The application for a trade mark is a different matter altogether and my advice is that there is no provision in law for assigning the property right in an application. I sought the best advice available on this matter and I have been told that an application for registration of a trade mark does not, in itself, give rise to any assignable property right. Apart altogether from that, I am told the difficulties we might create for ourselves, if we permitted such an assignment, are by no means determined.  We do not know where we would go if we permitted this right in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the provisions on assignment of trade marks are new.  The assignment of trade marks without the goodwill of the business, is something for which there has been a demand, but I do not think it is wise to go this far to assign an interest in an application for the registration of a trade mark.  In the first place, as far <Col N="428" /> as a defunct company is concerned or an ordinary company continuing to trade relinquishing its right in the application for a trade mark, I do not think any difficulty arises.  If it is defunct, it may have assigned the mark itself which, at this stage, is not a registered trade mark but one for which an application has been made. The application continues in the name of the original company.  The company to which the mark has been assigned produces evidence at the appropriate time that this is their mark and, therefore, they are entitled to become registered as proprietors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what the amendment seeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  I am suggesting it is the interest in an application that the amendment seeks.  If, at the time of the registration, the person in whom the ownership of the interest in the trade mark resides, applies to the Controller, giving the appropriate evidence, then the new owner will be registered simultaneously with the original applicant.  I do not think that gives rise to any particular hardship or difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am aware&mdash;and I am in close touch with industrial and commercial organisations&mdash;none of them has ever complained to me that any hardship arises out of the lack of this facility.  The Federation of Irish Industries or any chamber of commerce with whom I have frequent contact have never complained in any way that any difficulty arises.  Senator Ross referred to the British patent agents and their interest in having a similar amendment to British law.  The fact is that British patent agents have not succeeded in persuading the British Board of Trade to change British law in this respect. There is no administrative body in the world more sensitive to the requirements and requests of the trading public than is the British Board of Trade.  We know what Napoleon called the British, and it was justified in the context.  By reason of their history, the British Board of Trade is very concerned about ensuring that the wheels of commerce and industry in Britain run smoothly.  I feel sure that <Col N="429" /> if they felt that there was something in the case made by the British Chartered Institute of Patent Agents, they would have conceded any points raised readily.  The fact is that they have not succeeded, but the British Chartered Institute understandably are interested in having this done here. The fact that they have not succeeded in convincing their own Board of Trade is a very significant point.</P>
    <P>As far as our being behind the times in our legislation is concerned, I shall readily admit that much of our legislation is behind the corresponding legislation in Britain, but as I said in introducing the Second Stage, this is part of our industrial and commercial property law which we are now splitting up into these separate components. We have the Companies Bill as well as the Trade Marks Bill and the Copyright Bill.  I think that when Senator Ross meets his British colleagues next time, he will be able to claim that our Companies Bill is ahead of the British legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>We will all be exhausted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As the House knows, I am dealing with that every week and I will be exhausted before I get into the House; but at least in that respect we will be in advance of the British as far as companies legislation is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To sum up, I do not believe that the difficulty that has been suggested exists in the Bill.  It is simply a matter of assigning a mark without assigning the application for the registration of the mark.  It is a simple matter to ensure that when the mark ultimately is registered as of the date of the original application in the name of the original applicant, at that time the new owner of the mark can ensure that his interest in it is suitably inscribed in the register.  This serves two purposes.  It preserves the property in the mark, which seems to be the intention of the amendment, and ensures that there is going to be no difficulty about the examination of the merits of the application.  In all the circumstances, particularly in so far as I have received no complaints about hardship accruing <Col N="430" /> either from the trade interests in this country or, indeed, from any American companies that seek to set up business here&mdash;and I am sure that if there were difficulties I would have heard of them, since those American companies, in my experience, are not slow to make their grievances known &mdash;there would seem to be no indication that this is necessary.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross did make one other suggestion, that the patent agents here say that about one of these cases occurred every week.  If that is so I should like to know how many of these cases occurred in Britain.  There must be scores of them every week if we have one here.  The law has not been changed in Britain, therefore, the law, as it stands, works reasonably well and the law as I now propose will work well.  There is no reason for the Senator's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand the Minister correctly he would not change the law here because he has not received any complaints about cases of hardship, but on the disclaimer question he has decided to change the law&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave more than one reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>On the disclaimer question he has decided to change the law although he received no complaints. On this question of patents and trade marks I should like to take up the Minister because I think he has been urged to argue an impossible proposition.  The registration of a patent protects an invention.  The registration of a trade mark protects the trade mark.  I may make an invention and until that invention is patented anybody else can make a similar invention and whoever gets in first has proprietary rights over the patent.  I think that is a fairly accurate summary.  I might think of a trade mark and if it is a new one it may be a good one but there is nothing to prevent another opponent in trade from getting to know about the same trade mark and whoever gets in first and gets registered is protected.  Therefore, the very same principle applies <Col N="431" /> to a patent as to a trade mark, and in this world of intensive advertising an eye-catching and attractive trade mark which will put my goods before the world over television and everything else can be every bit as valuable to me as a patent.  The principle is the same.  I cannot see any difference.</P>
      <P>The Minister's next point was that an application to register a trade mark is not a right of property and, therefore, it is not assignable, but it is not the registration I am assigning.  It is the trade mark, which is something which exists, and the registration of it only declares my ownership in it. What I want to do is to say: &ldquo;This is my trade mark.  I have applied for registration&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Registration does not declare ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>It protects my ownership.  It is my trade mark and I have applied for registration.  When I get registration I will be the exclusive owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite candidly on the Minister's last point, I should like to be clear about this and the record to be very clear. The Minister has stated that at the present time I can assign a trade mark, not an application for a trade mark, but I can assign a trade mark and I can take an assignment from the owner of the trade mark who has applied to be registered as owner.  I understand quite well what the Minister says, that it is not the ordinary application that is assigned to me, it is the trade mark.  I understand the Minister to say that, when a trade mark is being registered, if I produce to the Controller my assignment the Controller will register me as the purchaser. If that is so, then I thoroughly agree with the Minister that it takes a lot of my argument away.  But I should like the Minister to be very clear on it, because I understand that it is not the law, and that the Controller will, notwithstanding any assignment, in practice register the trade mark in the name of the applicant for it and in the name of the applicant alone.  I am advised that you can get it into the <Col N="432" /> name of the purchaser, but if the original applicant is defunct, the trade mark for all practical purposes is dead and gone with him.  If that is so, and if the Office of the Controller will act as indicated by the Minister that is certainly a way out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>May I re-state what I said?  A trade mark in respect of which an application for registration is made may be assigned, but the application is continued in the name of the original applicant and subsequent to registration the name of the assignee can be registered as the subsequent proprietor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The original applicant existed as of the date of application. The mark is registered as of the date of application and, therefore, it is in the name of the original applicant. It takes some time to process those things.  At the time of registration which dates from the original application, the new or subsequent proprietor can be entered in the register.  Therefore, two names will appear, the name of the original applicant because it is from the date of the original application that the registration is effected, and the name of the assignee of the mark or interest in the mark who is the subsequent proprietor.  Nevertheless, his rights are exactly the same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some concern about the use of the word &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; in this section.  It is not really clear what is meant by &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; in subsection (2) which reads:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this section, the use in the State in relation to a trade mark of the word &ldquo;registered&rdquo;, or of any other word or of a symbol referring whether expressly or impliedly to registration, shall be deemed to import a reference to registration in the register...</P>
      <P>There was a certain amount of debate in the Dáil about the use of a well-known American symbol, the letter R in a circle, and I think the Minister was questioned as to whether it might be excluded in the Bill.  I can see an objection to that because there may be other symbols from other countries which may be equivalent to the use of the word &ldquo;registered&rdquo; in this country to hold out that a trade mark has been registered in those countries.</P>
      <P>I think it would meet the point if the Minister would consider ruling on, or making an Order from time to time as to what symbols are referred to, under this subsection.  I would ask the Minister to consider that.  I know he was asked by the trade marks people to consider the addition of some third subsection, to the effect that for the purposes of the section, &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; meant such symbol as the Minister from time to time by Order prescribed, so that at least the people who have to work under the Bill when it becomes an Act would know what symbols refer to registration and what symbols do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="434" /> Otherwise, the difficulty will arise that a symbol may be used, innocently or otherwise, to hold out that a trade mark had been registered when it had not been registered, and the only way to decide on it would be to go before the Controller or before the courts.  If the Minister were to declare from time to time the symbols to which the subsection applies, which would be symbols holding out that the trade mark was registered, it would clarify and simplify the procedure very much.</P>

      <P>When I saw the agents yesterday with Senator Fitzpatrick, the Senator himself made this point.  I have been giving it some thought and while I would not like to facilitate any person who would have been innocently advertising goods and creating the impression in the minds of the Irish public that this case was the subject of a registered trade mark, as a result of my thinking on the matter, there is something in the case made.  I believe that the use of the word &ldquo;symbol&rdquo;, without any qualification, might create some difficulties for people who would be asked to advise whether a particular symbol would be within the law or be excluded.  Since then, I have been considering the possibility of meeting this by an amendment and I think it can be done.</P>
      <P>By a little juxtaposition of these words and importing the words &ldquo;or of a prescribed symbol&rdquo; in subsection (2), I think I can, if it is in order, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, have an amendment circulated quickly.  I should be glad to do so.  May I hand it in?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess to being in some difficulty, not being sure that I am in order in the sense that I have some general complaint about the Bill which I did not raise on Second Reading last week.  As most of my difficulties arise on specific points, I thought better to wait until Committee Stage.  Frankly, my chief difficulty is that I have not an idea in the wide world what Section 3 means. I would not mind so much, because it is a highly complex Bill and a layman like myself is not meant to know, except that, I take it, its purpose is to assist in the interpretation of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I have read Section 3 so many times that I have lost count.  Instead of helping me to interpret the Bill, it certainly makes confusion worse confounded. This business of saying that &ldquo;Except in so far as the context otherwise requires any reference&rdquo; means so and so, and then &ldquo;Provided that, for the purposes of the following provisions of this Act&rdquo; it does not affect it. Again, we have &ldquo;with regard to publication, the provisions of this subsection shall have effect&rdquo;.  Then you find in paragraph (b) of subsection (2) that that is true except in so far as, oddly enough, it may deal with what I thought the Bill would deal with&mdash; copyright.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know very well that a lot of my difficulty results from my not being a lawyer and, therefore, not being conversant with these phrases.  I thought the general purpose of this particular <Col N="437" /> type of legislation&mdash;something which is tidying up, bringing together, clarifying &mdash;would be to prevent litigation, that is, to make the law so clear that people would not be provoked into courts of law to get something interpreted. I also think it would be desirable that legislation should be reasonably clear to legislators.  It is not very nice to find oneself in the position of helping the passage of a Bill through the House and realising that most of it is incomprehensible.</P>
    <P>In paragraph (b), subsection (2), there is a phrase &ldquo;a publication which is merely colourable&rdquo;.  What that means I should like to know.  I would have thought that legislation demanded fairly distinct descriptions.  I cannot think of anything more vague and more readily interpreted in probably a dozen ways than a phrase like &ldquo;merely colourable&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Colourable&rdquo; alone would be bad enough but what &ldquo;merely colourable&rdquo; means I do not know.  If I say that something is a colourable imitation of something else I would intend to mean that it was a fair imitation, a recognisable imitation; but when I say &ldquo;a merely colourable imitation&rdquo; I do not know what I mean.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will probably agree with me that it would not be very difficult to envisage the probability that this one phrase could give rise to endless litigation in the sense that a great deal would depend on the court hearing it and the interpretation the court would put on vague phrases like &ldquo;merely colourable&rdquo;.  I should be glad, in relation to the whole section, if the Minister would not mind giving some résumé of what the intention is. I should like, in particular, to know what &ldquo;merely colourable&rdquo; is intended to mean.</P>

      <P>The most highly qualified lawyer is not necessarily a well qualified draftsman.  No matter how good a lawyer's qualifications are, he still requires a number of years training before he becomes a draftsman. For that reason there is a certain exclusiveness, supplied by words, that a humble lawyer like myself cannot assail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I refer generally to what the section purports to do?  Subsection <Col N="438" /> (1) provides that doing anything in relation to a substantial part of a work is the same as doing something in relation to the work as a whole.  It continues a principle laid down in the 1927 Act which is the existing law in this country.  In regard to subsection (2), I do not think I can satisfy the Senator with an explanation of what &ldquo;colourable&rdquo; means in this context. However, the subsection lists a number of acts which do not constitute publication for the purposes of the Act and it is again substantially as it is in existing law.</P>
    <P>Subsection (b) says: &ldquo;except in so far as it may constitute an infringement of copyright, or a contravention of any restriction imposed by Section 54 of this Act, a publication which is merely colourable, and not intended to satisfy the reasonable requirements of the public shall be disregarded.&rdquo;  The phrase &ldquo;not intended to satisfy the reasonable requirements of the public&rdquo; is intended I think to be a definition of what &ldquo;colourable&rdquo; stands for in this Bill.  I am afraid I cannot explain it further than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VictorCarton" hpid="Mr. Carton Mr. Carton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may say so, that was my difficulty.  I would have thought that it was a contradiction.  I thought that a colourable publication was a recognisable one, something that would probably satisfy the public that it was a publication.  Perhaps I am wrong, that colourable does not mean that, but I took colourable as meaning a reasonably fair copy.  There seems to me to be an odd use of the word here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that it is intended to be a technical phrase and it could refer to a token publication. A colourable publication would be a token publication which would not be publication that would satisfy the public.  Therefore, a token publication of a work first created would not be publication for the purpose of the Act. I think that is what the word &ldquo;colourable&rdquo; is intended to cover here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section there is a point I can see, which may possibly be the intention.  There is a reference in subsection (2) to the proprietor of a newspaper, magazine or similar periodical.  This is repeated.  Further down in the same subsection it says: &ldquo;Insofar as it relates to publication in a newspaper, magazine or similar periodical&rdquo;.  I am wondering what precisely this means.  Does it mean that if an article is published in a newspaper the copyright in that as far as it relates to the publication in any other newspaper, magazine or periodical rests with the proprietor of the original newspaper, or does it mean in its second reference &ldquo;the said newspaper&rdquo;? I hope that the Minister will follow what I am getting at.  To me as it stands it means that once a thing appears in a newspaper, magazine or periodical, publication in any newspaper, magazine or periodical rests with the proprietor of the original newspaper and not with the author.  If that is the intention I am not going to quarrel with it.  I do not know anything about copyright, but it struck me that the other meaning might be the one intended&mdash;that the reference to a newspaper, magazine or similar periodical is always to the same newspaper, magazine or periodical.  If so the word &ldquo;a&rdquo; in the third reference should be deleted and it should be &ldquo;the said newspaper, magazine or similar periodical&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to suggest that the insertion of a couple of commas in subsection (4) in lines 23 and 24 would make it more readily understandable. The subsection says &ldquo;where, in any case other than that mentioned either in subsection (2) or (3) of this section, a work is made in the course of the author's employment by another person <Col N="440" /> under a contract of service or apprenticeship, that other person shall be entitled to any copyright subsisting therein...&rdquo; and so on.  I read that several times, and I believe it would be easier to understand if in line 2 of the subsection there were a comma after &ldquo;made&rdquo; and in the next line after &ldquo;person&rdquo; so that it would be clearly understandable that &ldquo;in the course of the author's employment by another person&rdquo; was in reference to the work made and not to what comes subsequently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of subsection (2) of section 10 is, I think, fairly clear on the face of it.  I am not suggesting that the Senator has not grasped what it intends to provide, but for the benefit of the House and in case some Senators have not adverted to it the meaning is that if a man working in a newspaper or journal in the course of his ordinary work creates some literary work which is published first in the newspaper, journal or magazine, then the copyright in the article or work vests in the proprietor of the newspaper, journal or magazine.  Subsection (5) provides that an agreement between the author and his employer may provide to the contrary.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the letter &ldquo;a&rdquo; to which the Senator has referred in line 11 is proper draftsmanship to achieve the purposes of the subsection.  As far as the commas in subsection (4) are concerned, I am also advised that the good use of commas in drafting is the highest form of draftsmanship.  Again, I am afraid that I cannot comment on the effect of the omission of commas here, except to assume that where commas are omitted in a place where they would appear required I believe that they are omitted for good reasons, and I do not think there is any reason for us to doubt the draftsmanship here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words about subsection (4) of this section.  I would appeal very strongly to the Minister to reconsider this subsection which seems to make inroads into the rights of authors and playwrights without any corresponding benefit to the public.  This subsection originally appeared in the 1911 Copyright Act and it was included also in the Industrial and Commercial Property Act, 1927.  It now appears in this Bill, but with the words added &ldquo;or in a broadcast&rdquo;.  The previous form referred only to the reading or recitation in public of any reasonable extract from a published literary or dramatic work.  We now have added to that provision enabling it to be done by means of a radio broadcast.  This is a completely new provision.  I know that in the Dáil the Minister quite rightly pointed out that under the existing law reasonable user might extend to broadcasting though the 1927 Act did not specifically refer to broadcasting. That is a matter we might argue about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was, undoubtedly, a case brought under the 1927 Act by Andre Messager, and one of the things decided in the King's Bench Division was that the words &ldquo;in public&rdquo; could be held to refer to broadcasting.  That case was taken under a different section of the Act and different factors were involved. It is not necessarily certain that under this section the courts would have held that broadcasts were included.  However, the point is that quite obviously at the time when this provision was first introduced in 1911 the legislators had not got broadcasts in mind.  It is equally obvious that when these matters were being debated in the Dáil and Seanad it was not intended to include broadcasts either.  So <Col N="442" /> far as I know Radio Éireann have always gone on the basis that if an author's copyright were used his permission was asked and a fee was paid. In Britain the BBC took the same line until the provision was changed.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we are now, for the first time, deciding as a matter of definite policy that the broadcasting authorities should be permitted to use extracts from plays or other literary works without getting the permission of the author or the playwright and without paying a fee.  It is true that under this proposed subsection these extracts must be reasonable.  Subsection (4) provides for the reading or recitation in public or in a broadcast by one person of any reasonable extract from a published literary or dramatic work. What is a &ldquo;reasonable extract&rdquo;?  No one knows.  So far as I have been able to find out that is a matter which has never been considered in any court in Britain or Ireland.  We simply have no idea.</P>
    <P>If the subsection becomes law as it stands, we may take it that sooner or later&mdash;and probably sooner&mdash;this matter will be decided by the courts. They will be asked what in their view is a &ldquo;reasonable extract.&rdquo;  The difficulty I see is that I can visualise a long succession of court cases because, normally speaking, if a court decides on a point that is the end of it, and the other courts feel themselves bound by that decision, but in this instance no court will be prepared to consider the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; except in relation to the facts involved.  Any time, therefore, an argument arises with the broadcasting authorities about this question, if an author is so unwise as to take his case to litigation it would involve a completely new set of proceedings to decide it.</P>
    <P>The fact that no one&mdash;the Minister, or ourselves or the draftsmen&mdash;can have the slightest idea of what would be the meaning of a &ldquo;reasonable extract&rdquo; makes it difficult to know exactly what loss would be borne by the authors.  Obviously there would be some loss.  Until 1956 the law in England was much the same as it is here.  In 1956 a new Copyright Act was passed in Britain which re-enacted the <Col N="443" /> section about recitation and reading in public, adding the provision we have here, &ldquo;accompanied by a sufficient acknowledgment.&rdquo;  In this Bill that section has been copied exactly except that whereas in Britain they quite specifically exclude broadcasts we have specifically included them.</P>
    <P>In the course of the discussions on the previous Bill the Minister said that, while it was not by any means a conclusive reason for doing anything, at the same time we might bear in mind a provision relating to whatever the matter might be was in a relevant British Act, and that while we were not bound to operate it, it was something they had decided, after due consideration. I suggest that applies here also.  The British Act definitely excludes broadcasts.  They have far more experience of copyright and broadcasting than we have, and for that reason I suggest we should exclude broadcasts.  I have been unable to discover what benefit is gained by including broadcasts.  The gain to Radio Éireann in the fees they would not have to pay would be so small in relation to their total resources that I do not think it would be noticeable at all.</P>
    <P>The loss to the authors might be quite considerable.  There may be authors who could afford that loss but there are many others who could not because their income from their writings is so small that the money they get from Radio Éireann makes a difference to them.  Those authors stand to lose, but we do not know how much.  It might be suggested that they benefit from the fact that their work is broadcast with due acknowledgement and that that is an advertisement for them, but the question of how much they benefit is doubtful. That raises another question which is more serious.</P>
    <P>This power which is being given to broadcasting authorities to broadcast &ldquo;reasonable extracts&rdquo; without permission and without paying a fee will, of course, extend to sponsored programmes. I have nothing against sponsored programmes but I think that reputable authors should be in the <Col N="444" /> position of being able to refuse to grant permission for the use of their works in the course of advertising programmes.  Under this section as it stands, they will not be in that position. So far as &ldquo;reasonable extracts&rdquo; are concerned, if a commercial advertiser wishes to use portion of a poem, a play or a novel, in the course of a sponsored programme, so long as it is a &ldquo;reasonable extract&rdquo;&mdash;and I take it they would be short extracts in programmes of that kind&mdash;the position would appear to be that the author will have no redress whatever.  I think that is quite wrong, and that it is one of the most undesirable aspects of the section.</P>
    <P>After all, we have been broadcasting for nearly 40 years.  Why do we want to make this change after nearly 40 years?  So far as I know, there have not been any difficulties.  I do not know whether the broadcasting authorities have been complaining, and I do not see why they should.  In a Bill of this kind which is partly a tidying-up process, and partly a question of bringing old legislation up-to-date, it seems to me that we should make changes in the existing situation only because abuses have existed or because the change we are making is a definite improvement on the existing state of affairs.</P>
    <P>There may have been abuses but I have never heard of them.  I certainly do not think this is an improvement.  I do not see who gains and I certainly think that some authors will lose quite a lot.  In addition, this section is calculated to lead to a series of expensive and unnecessary pieces of litigation.  It is very difficult to say what a &ldquo;reasonable extract&rdquo; is.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter and perhaps we could have an amendment on Report Stage to delete the words &ldquo;or in a broadcast&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible that we could delete the words &ldquo;or in a broadcast&rdquo; without taking away in the slightest from an authority like Radio Éireann their right to quote reasonable extracts from published literary or dramatic works as they do at present. What I am saying is that recitation or reading in public is very likely to cover <Col N="445" /> recitation or reading by means of broadcasting and, therefore, I do not think it would help Senator Yeats's point of view in any degree if the words &ldquo;or in a broadcast&rdquo; were omitted. Assuming that the purpose of the insertion of the words &ldquo;or in a broadcast&rdquo; is to extend permission to Radio Éireann for this limited use of extracts from published literary or dramatic works, then I think it is not unreasonable.</P>
      <P>After all, in this country we have only the Broadcasting Authority.  The State has a certain interest in it.  The Houses of the Oireachtas had certain intentions regarding the functions of the Broadcasting Authority and I think we do not have to worry that the Broadcasting Authority would imprudently take extracts from published literary or dramatic works.  In any event, I do not think there would be any trouble about interpreting what a reasonable extract would be.  The word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; appears in all kinds of legislation and even in common law the courts find little difficulty in interpreting the words &ldquo;reasonable means&rdquo;. If we revert to Section 3, subsection (1) the following words are used: &ldquo;Except in so far as the context otherwise requires, any reference in this Act to the doing of an act in relation to a work or other subject-matter shall be taken to include a reference to the doing of that act in relation to a substantial part thereof&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, taking the interpretation of Section 3 and the likely interpretation of &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; as used in Section 12, I do not think there is any danger that any serious harm would be done to the copyright in a published literary or dramatic work by the use of these extracts by Radio Éireann. I note that the Senator may have some fears, if not about the Radio Éireann Authority, then about the promoters of sponsored programmes.  But then I think Radio Éireann are somewhat in the position of publishers in this respect. It is through their medium that the broadcast is made, and even if they were not construed legally as the publisher and, therefore, responsible for infringement of copyright, in any event, they have control of the subject <Col N="446" /> matter of their programmes.  I would again suggest that there is not any degree of serious intrusion on copyright in this respect.</P>
    <P>I do not think any difficulty has arisen, but, while British law specifically excludes broadcasts from the facility afforded by subsection (4) here, not to specifically mention broadcasts would not exclude them.  One must remember that the BBC are a fairly wealthy corporation and have resources that Radio Éireann have not and can, therefore, expend the money, the time and staff, on making inquiries and contacts with authors and making agreements with them in advance. Radio Éireann have not these resources but I presume&mdash;in fact, I am reasonably certain&mdash;that if an author made a complaint that his copyright in a work was infringed by an unreasonable extract being used in a broadcast by Radio Éireann or one of the sponsored programme writers, then Radio Éireann would ensure that reasonable payment was made in respect of it.</P>
    <P>Dealing, as we are here, with a single broadcasting body which is in the ultimate controlled by the State, I do not think there is any danger of flagrant breach of the rights conferred on authors by this Act.  In any event, I think it is only fair and sometimes of benefit to the authors that extracts might be used that would excite interest in the work the author has published and, therefore, lead to greater sales of that work.  I listened to many programmes on Radio Éireann, some of them sponsored, and I can assure the Senator if, before the performance was finished, the performer said: &ldquo;I will arise and go now&rdquo;, I would pay the infringement cost myself.  I think that the Senator's fears for which he put forward a certain amount of justification are not well grounded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I want to make on the Minister's reply. First of all, Radio Éireann, of course, have not the resources of the BBC, but the Radio Éireann fees also are very much lower than those of the BBC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know, for example, when it comes to musical copyrights that Radio <Col N="447" /> Éireann have refused to deal with persons who are not members of the Performing Rights Society or the Mechanical Rights Society.  There is no problem there and I do not think there would be any problem there. Radio Éireann would normally be dealing with authors who were members of the Society of Authors.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of sponsored programmes, I do not think the Minister understood my point.  I am not worried about the fees that would or would not be paid for the use of those works on the sponsored programme.  My point is that the author should specify for himself whether he wishes his work to be used on the sponsored programme or not. I know that in the case of any copyright over which I might have control, if asked for permission for a work to be used in a sponsored programme, I would say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the case of newspapers, if the author's work is used without permission, he can do something about it.  I have personal experience over the past year of a semi-State company which used a copyright work without permission in an advertisement, but it was possible to prevent them doing it again. The point I am making about a sponsored programme is that I think an author's work should not be used in the course of advertising without permission. I can well see that removal of the words &ldquo;or in a broadcast&rdquo; might still leave the matter vague.  But the Minister might have adopted the British solution of the 1956 Act, and inserted a subsection specifically excluding broadcasting.</P>

What I am objecting to is the provision in subsection (4) which amounts, in effect, to the confiscation of the copyright of the recording.  We are saying here that the recording can be produced in public.  It can be broadcast; it can be put through a diffusion service, provided that the person doing that pays equitable remuneration to the owner of the copyright.  Then we go on to provide that where there is a dispute in regard to equitable remuneration that that should be decided by the Controller.</P>
    <P>What I am suggesting in the amendments is that the owner of the copyright should be in the same position as the owner of any property to say whether or not he will allow the use of the recording.  If he does not, of course, that is his own funeral.  Presumably he would not get any payment. Radio Éireann, a diffusion service, or, indeed, any person can use that recording in public without the permission of the owners of the copyright, provided, of course, that later on they come along and make an equitable claim.  They can do that first without coming to any arrangement with the owner of the copyright.</P>
    <P>I object to that.  I do not know how the Oireachtas could say that, in effect, it is property, this ownership of the copyright and, in effect, that it can be confiscated, and that later on somebody can determine what is an equitable compensation or remuneration for the confiscation.  We are, as I said, at the start of the section, providing that the copyright shall subsist in the owner of the recording.  If it subsists in him, in other words he owns it, and he should be in a position to trade it, sell it, or do what he likes with it.  We are now allowing it, as I see by subsection (4), to be broadcast, used to entertain the public, put through a diffusion service, without the permission, without the authority and without any negotiation whatever with the owner of the copyright. That is wrong and ridiculous.</P>
    <P>I must confess, of course, that my <Col N="450" /> heart is not bleeding for the owner of the record.  Senators may not be surprised at that.  What I am concerned about is the continued employment, the value of the employment and the value of the capabilities of the artists who put their capacity into the actual recording.  If that recording can be used for broadcasting and for public entertainment, without the value of that being negotiable with the owner, I think the worth of the original performance put on to the record is less than it would otherwise be.  It could be allowed to interfere with the continued employment of these musicians and these artists who consent to make a recording.</P>
    <P>Before a recording is broadcast, before it is used for the purpose of entertaining the public, before it is put through a diffusion service&mdash;if we ever have one&mdash;the authority of the owner of the copyright should be secured.  I do not think that is unreasonable.  It is all right to say that by making a recording, by offering it for sale to the public, you are in a sense putting it out and making it broadcast.  You are making the records available for purchase normally for private entertainment, for the private use of the entertainer. For instance, you publish a book. A person comes along, buys that book and he can read it and enjoy it himself. He is not allowed to copy that book and distribute it&mdash;to broadcast it.</P>

      <P>A library can do it but that is different.  A record library, I think, can do it.  There are such things as library records.  I am not interfering with that: it is a completely different matter from broadcasting something, from using it for public entertainment.  The Minister in dealing with these amendments, I think, in the Dáil thought&mdash;if I may attempt to interpret him&mdash;that it would be unreasonable that the owner of a recording should be in a position to refuse permission to have it broadcast. I do not think so.  I think the other side of the coin is unreasonable.  It is unreasonable to say that no matter what the wishes of the owner of the copyright are you can broadcast it, you <Col N="451" /> can use it for public entertainment without his authority and without his agreeing on a price, and later on you can come along and say: &ldquo;We will pay you something and if there is a dispute about what that something should be the Controller will settle it.&rdquo; As Senator Yeats said on a previous section, the owner of the copyright may not wish to have it used like this at all.  He may not wish to have it used in a certain programme, for example, a sponsored programme.  I do not know whether the Minister ever sang a song or had it recorded down with Glen Rovers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>You might not like to hear it broadcast on one of those sponsored programmes.  It might be very embarrassing, but whether it is or not the point is that the owner of the copyright has the right to say what he will or will not do with it, and if he does not want it used in a broadcast, it may be unreasonable for him and he may have an objection to which we will not see any point, but he, as the owner of that copyright, should be allowed to retain the control of it. As I said at the start, this is a technical Bill.  I would hope that Senators would look reasonably at the problem created here and approach it as reasonable people.  I hope they will agree with me that it is quite right that we should put in a provision that before a recording would be broadcast or used for public entertainment the consent of the owner of that recording should be secured.</P>

      <P>I wish to support this amendment and before saying anything further about it I think I would be in order in suggesting that the House should be grateful to Senator Murphy for directing our attention to a very important aspect of this Bill.  Senator Murphy began his remarks by pointing out that the Bill was highly technical and we have good reason to know that is only too true.  I do not consider myself competent to prosecute this section as fully and capably as the <Col N="452" /> mover of the amendment has done. One thing I am assured of is that the amendment is eminently reasonable and I believe commends itself to every member of the House.  It is obvious that a vital right is involved in this section.  I do suggest that the House owes it, in fact, to the people whom we speak for here to make quite certain that that right is very fully preserved. I do not think anybody could quarrel with the suggestion that the owner of a copyright of this type should at least have the option of deciding where his work should be performed and in what circumstances or under what conditions.  I do not for a moment agree with the suggestion in the Bill that the owner of the copyright is adequately remunerated by payment subsequently of a fee which may or may not be open to arbitration at a later date.  The important thing we have to remember is that the amendment asks simply no more or no less than that the consent and approval of the owner should be sought before the work is performed in a given circumstance. It is equally important that he should likewise have preserved his freedom to withhold his consent if he so wishes.  Without belabouring the point any further, since I think that the case has already been made from the other side of the House, I commend the the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>Since I have been quoted so much in this regard perhaps I should say simply that I am afraid that this amendment appears to me to be aimed in the wrong direction altogether.  The position is not really on all fours with the discussion we had earlier, since the owner of copyright in records is generally the company that manufactures the records and I take it that their position would be entirely different to that of an author.  The author's claim is to be able to withhold or give permission.  I never heard of a record company proclaiming any such right or wanting to.  I think I am right in saying that a record company is only too pleased if its records are broadcast. The wider the broadcast the better from their point of view.  It is extremely unlikely, I think, that the owner would have such a privilege, because in each <Col N="453" /> case, of course, the radio station before broadcasting such a record might write off to the company and ask: &ldquo;May we broadcast this record?&rdquo;  From the point of view of the company it would be an undesirable position.  They would be delighted with it as it stands, for this is quite unlike the other point we discussed earlier.</P>

      <P>Ní h-ea sa bhfó-alt.</P>
      <P>With regard to the two amendments, subsection (4) sets out what copyright in sound recordings consist of.  It is the right, first of all, to prevent others from making a recording of the record itself.  Where a recording has not been published, there is also the right to prevent that record from being played in public and from being broadcast. If the record has been published, there is a right to equitable remuneration if it is played in public or broadcast. Therefore, there are three categories, and we are dealing with the third.</P>
      <P>Once a record is made and put on sale, the purport of the Senator's amendment is that before it can be used in a broadcast, the Broadcasting Authority should not only be responsible for payment of a just remuneration, but should seek out the owner of the copyright, who is the recording company or the person who commissioned the record, and get that company's or that person's consent to have it played.  I think it is not unreasonable to assume it would impose a very great burden on any broadcasting authority to have to seek out the owner of a record every time it was played.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on the last occasion, the person who makes the record, irrespective of those who contributed to the subject matter, puts it on sale, and offers it for public purchase to those who pay whatever the cost of the <Col N="455" /> record is.  If a person buys a record and plays it in his own house or for his friends without receiving payment, he is entitled to play it until the needle goes through the disc if he wants to, but if he wants to play it in circumstances in which the people who hear it pay him some money, then it is only just that, since he is making a profit in one way or another, he should pay a reasonable royalty to the owner of the copyright in the record.  I think that to try to go beyond that would put a very great burden on the person who uses the record, and would limit the right of the public to hear a record beyond what I think is reasonable.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to keep the purpose of the Bill as a whole in mind.  The purpose of the Bill is to protect and define property rights, and the property right we are now dealing with is copyright. In the case of sound recordings, the copyright is vested in the person who makes the recording.  Sound recordings together with films and broadcasts are included as subject matters in this part of the Bill.  This part deals with subject matters apart from original literary, dramatic or musical works, and the purpose of the section is to set out for each of those what the scope of the right to protection should be.</P>
    <P>It is true that in the existing law records were given copyright as if they were musical works; in other words, they were protected as intellectual works.  This Bill for the first time deals with recordings in their own right, and they may be recordings of any literary, musical or dramatic works.  The question of what right should be attached to recordings, including records of music which are issued to the public by the gramophone companies, has been the subject of investigation by many organisations including&mdash;which will appeal to Senator Murphy&mdash;the ILO.  The International Labour Office when concerning themselves with this subject, again like Senator Murphy, did not bleed for the gramophone companies, but rather intervened to protect the rights of the performers and the musicians, or whoever contributed to the making of the record.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="456" /> In 1961, eventually, after several years of examination of the subject, an international Convention was signed, to which the International Labour Office was a party.  That Convention dealt with the protection that would be given to the performers and the producers of the recordings&mdash;or the phonograms, as they were called in the Convention&mdash;and the broadcasting authorities.  In the matter of sound recordings, the Convention required all States which were prepared to adopt its full provisions on the subject, to accept that record producers should have the right over the copying of the records and that there should be payment to the performers or the manufacturers, or both, when the records were played in public, or broadcast.</P>
    <P>As I said on the last occasion, in their contracts with the record makers, the performers could provide for adequate payment in the knowledge of the places in which the records are to be played.</P>
    <P>That Convention was signed on behalf of Ireland and the enactment of this Bill gives effect to the Convention in this respect.  As I said on the last day, there will be a separate Bill dealing with the rights of performers, but in saying that, I am not suggesting that we could take care of the interests Senator Murphy has at heart in this new Bill without the performers themselves taking care of their own interests when making the recordings.  The point is simply that we are a party to an international Convention which has defined the rights of performers and record makers.  The International Labour Office were a party to the drawing up of the Convention and in doing so, it must be presumed that they had the rights of the performers primarily at heart.  We are doing no more in this section than giving effect to and adopting that Convention.</P>
    <P>I think that in all the circumstances the House will agree that the requirement in the amendment to get the consent of the manufacturer of the record in each case in which payment is involved would be onerous and that the provisions in the Bill and the Convention are adequate to safeguard the interests of the makers of the records.</P>
    <Col N="457" />
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his very full reply.  He probably brought us down to earth by his reference to the fact that the performers must look after their own interests, too.  Am I correct in imagining that this could be the position?  Suppose you have a dance band called &ldquo;The Limpets&rdquo;.  They earn their livelihood playing at dances round the country and would also make some recordings, if they were good enough.  The position could arise under the section we are asked to pass now that a dancehall proprietor down the country, asked to provide a dance band, could provide &ldquo;The Limpets&rdquo; through the medium of records already made by them and they have no come-back at all.  Their livelihood will be seriously interfered with.  That, I think under my reading of the section, could happen and &ldquo;The Limpets&rdquo; could of course get some compensation for it eventually but they would be unable to prevent this thing happening, which would be clearly and very much against their interests. The same could happen with other artists &mdash; say, Delia Gallagher if she made any records.  A concert promoter could provide a night with Delia Gallagher and her songs.  Her livelihood could again be seriously interfered with.  Is that or is it not the position? From my reading of the section, that could happen, as we are asked to pass it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the question of the broadcasting is too important.  I could very well envisage a situation where the artists, the performers who make the recording, would be very prone to object to that record being broadcast, although I imagine it may be thought to be in their interest.  The other aspect, the playing of those records in public for public entertainment&mdash;their playing at dances&mdash;would be dead against the interests of the performers who made the records originally.  I presume if this amendment were accepted what would happen is that these performers in making a record would make some provision with the owner of the copyright, would make some agreement with him that he would not, because of his ownership of the copyright, consent to those records being played in <Col N="458" /> public without consent.  That is all we are asking.  I think it very reasonable and I am pressing the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister to say that it would place a heavy burden on the broadcasting authority to get the consent of the copyright owner.  I do not think that is a good case against the amendment. All the amendment asks is to get in the word &ldquo;consent&rdquo; and if you object to the word &ldquo;consent&rdquo; because it will involve a burden for somebody, the first person who should be considered is the performer, the copyright owner. It is his property and he should be the person to decide what is in his best interests.  That is reasonably accepted in relation to any property. He will not be difficult, because he is involved and his future is involved in a number of cases.  Perhaps it is a source of his employment.  It may be the only source of his employment and he is entitled to be safeguarded.  It may appear a bit burdensome but it is most important to get his consent.</P>
      <P>There is another point, too.  It is quite obvious, where there is complete freedom to use the records, even where there are no charges by houses of entertainment, it might be done in such manner that the overall cost might be recouped in another way. That again would affect the copyright. The owner may, perhaps, prior to that have been engaged personally with his colleagues in giving the entertainment which the records give later on. That is another aspect that has to be considered.  Those points are important where the individual is concerned.  I fail to see how there can be any objection to putting it in such a way so that the copyright and performer will be safeguarded.</P>

      <P>May I say in reply to that that the copyright does not rest at all in the performer but in the person who made the record or on whose behalf the record was made, but modern trends seem to indicate that the more a record is taking, the more popular the person making that record becomes.  We have the scores of pop singers and dance bands all over the country and all over the <Col N="459" /> world and the playing of their records tends to make the performers more and more popular and tends, therefore, more and more to their employability.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That in the opinion of Seanad Éireann the Government, in order to make better use of the Seanad, should so order Parliamentary business (1) that advantage would be taken of Article 20.2.1º of the Constitution which provides that Bills may be introduced in the Seanad; (2) that business would come from the Dáil to the Seanad at reasonably regular intervals; (3) that there should be an end of the practice of presenting Bills to the Seanad at times of the year when no effective consideration can be given to them.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see the Taoiseach here this evening.  I am grateful to him.  It shows that he considers this matter to be a serious one.  The motion on the Order Paper is rather narrowly drawn but it is clear that every serious student of politics is dissatisfied with the existing parliamentary machine, both here and in Great Britain.  With the ever-widening scope of Government action <Col N="461" /> and State power, Parliament as it was conceived is proving unable adequately to perform its functions.  The parliamentary machine is creaking under the strain of conditions never contemplated by the people who gave us the type of Parliament we have.</P>
    <P>This motion, however, it not concerned with the powers of the Seanad, the personnel of the Seanad or the method of election to the Seanad. What I propose to do if I can is to take the Seanad as it is and to prove that it could be made far more useful than it seems to everybody to be.  If the Seanad is not used to the utmost, if its members cannot take a reasonable share of work and responsibility, then I think the Seanad should be abolished.  The House could be given more work to do and could be made to do that work more effectively.  I want to suggest some method by which that conclusion could be reached if the Government, perhaps with some co-operation, were willing to adopt these schemes.</P>
    <P>In the first place, it seems to me that the Government in arranging its Parliamentary programme should take the position of the Seanad into consideration and endeavour to see that the Seanad will get a fairly constant flow of business.  I know that there are difficulties about that and I am not suggesting that the Seanad could be made to meet as frequently as the Dáil, but if instead of laying out a programme for the Dáil and when the Dáil is finished, throwing Bills sporadically to the Seanad, the two Houses were to be considered beforehand, it would be possible to give us a fairly constant flow of business.</P>
    <P>More Bills should be introduced in the Seanad.  A considerable number of Bills are suitable for introduction in this House instead of in the other. Such introduction is permitted by the Constitution and, in my judgement, is desirable.</P>
    <P>When I speak of the arrangement of business, I mean that the position is that normally from now until the summer recess the Dáil is occupied, in the main, with the Estimates and other financial business.  Ministers bring in a certain amount of legislation.  That <Col N="462" /> legislation is dealt with by the Dáil, with various interchanges and threats between Governments and Opposition &mdash;I am speaking now in a non-partisan spirit&mdash;that they will have to meet into September, but the Dáil always concludes in July by passing a certain number of Bills, apart altogether from financial measures.  When the Dáil adjourns in July, a whole spate of Bills come over to the Seanad, appear on the Seanad Order Paper and have to be passed through all Stages in the Seanad very rapidly, so in the nature of things, they cannot get proper consideration. That situation could be avoided with some forethought.</P>
    <P>With regard to the relative number of sittings of the Dáil and of the Seanad, the Dáil in the nature of things sits more frequently than this House because the Dáil has to do Estimates. It is not for us to criticise the Dáil or give them any advice.  They do Estimates, all the Estimates, every year &mdash;this year they were not able to conclude the Estimates so they took another Vote on Account and postponed consideration of some of the Estimates until the Autumn.  Normally, the Dáil sits three times more frequently than the Seanad.  In 1962, the Dáil sat more than four times as often as the Seanad.  But although the Seanad sits so infrequently and allowing for the fact that it has no Estimates to consider, it still has to pass all the Bills which the Dáil passes.  When it gets a spate of Bills in the autumn, it naturally has to pass them perfunctorily.</P>
    <P>I have, for example, a list of Bills on the Order Paper for August, 1961. On 2nd August, 1961, there were seven Government Bills on the Order Paper for Second Reading and there were four more on the following day, 3rd August, 1961.  It is not a desire to go home on holidays that makes the Seanad dissatisfied with that state of affairs but that Bills are thrown at this House&mdash;I should not say that because Ministers of any Party are delightful to meet in the month of August.  They are full of charm and reasonableness. They say they are not responsible for this position, they cannot help it and occasionally they say the Opposition are to blame.  They regret very much <Col N="463" /> that the Dáil has adjourned but they always tell us that there is power to recall the Dáil.  There is of course power to recall the Dáil but no Government have done it and I do not think that any Government will ever do it.  Seanad discussion of Bills at that time of year is unreal and unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>It cannot but be unsatisfactory as I have said.  It is a humiliating procedure. It is quite futile and, indeed, as I have suggested on more than one occasion, it would be more honest procedure and certainly from the point of view of the Minister for Finance cheaper to pass all Bills through all Stages in one hour and go home.  But certainly no House of a Parliament should be asked to consider a list of Bills such as this in a hurry. It is not avoidance of work at all but the fact that you are considering something that you cannot amend because Ministers will accept no amendment and the Dáil, in fact, will not be recalled; that is one state of affairs which I think could be avoided.  I know that there is no magic wand which this Taoiseach or any other Taoiseach could wave, but a way to avoid it would be to consider the two Houses and not one House when Parliamentary business is being arranged.  I have thought that that state of affairs could be brought about only if there were a moratorium on legislation, if the parliamentary draftsman were let alone and if Bills were not introduced.  I have held the view &mdash;a personal view&mdash;that we have too much legislation because every Bill which is passed means more expense and very often more interference with ordinary people's lives.</P>
    <P>There is another thing which could be done.  In July, 1962, there were five Bills on the Order Paper and on 1st August one more Bill was added. I think that is a state of affairs which should be avoided.  It ought also be possible, it seems to me, to introduce here a great many Bills, including a number of those of which I have spoken, which are introduced in the Dáil and clutter up the Dáil Order Paper.  It would be an advantage to <Col N="464" /> the Dáil to receive Bills from this House.  The suggested procedure, first and foremost, is completely constitutional. It is not undemocratic.  It does not take in any way from the powers of the Dáil.  Whether it is introduced in the Dáil or in the Seanad, the powers of the Dáil under the Constitution over the Bill are absolute. But it would save Parliamentary time and would be an advantage not only to the Government but to the whole Oireachtas.  Two Bills, for example, which we had recently here could easily have been introduced in this House and discussed: the Official Secrets Bill and the Hotel Proprietors Bill.</P>
    <P>There are many Bills which could not and should not be introduced here.  Money Bills are one set, and there are also Bills which in the main are concerned with money such as the Bill I find here on the 1961 Order Paper, the Tourist Traffic Bill.  One might say at first sight that that seemed particularly suitable for introduction in the Seanad, but it was only a short Bill increasing certain grants and that is the prerogative of the Dáil. I do not begrudge that to the Dáil and I am prepared to accept all these limitations.</P>
    <P>Of course, apart from Money Bills or Bills mainly concerned with money, there are also certain types of Bills that could not be introduced here.  One obvious example at the moment is the Electoral Bill, dealing with the electoral law, which is so much the business of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>In the first period of office of the inter-Party Government from 1949-50, a considerable number of Bills were introduced in this House, and the present Government did introduce here the Bill setting up the television service.  I think that proved to be a very fruitful and satisfactory procedure from the point of view both of the Government and of the Minister concerned.  The Minister certainly was pleased with the reception the Bill got here and with its good discussion, and from every point of view, it was a satisfactory arrangement.</P>
    <P>The Seanad Standing Orders provide that when a Bill is introduced in <Col N="465" /> the Seanad and comes back from the Dáil, it is considered on Report, so if we got these Bills even late in the year instead of having the usual Stages, we would have only one effective Stage, the Report Stage.  We would then be in the same position, therefore, as if the Seanad had previously considered it, had sent amendments to the Dáil and had received these amendments back.</P>
    <P>There are other advantages about discussion first in the Seanad.  If a Bill is introduced here, it brings the matter to the notice of the public, and leaves time for interested bodies to make representations first in the Seanad and later in the Dáil.  I should like to suggest to the Taoiseach and to interested parties that that is a better scheme for them than making representations in the Seanad after they have read the Dáil Debates.  It would be a great advantage because when the Dáil has given its decision, like every other body it is reluctant to alter it.</P>
    <P>There is also this, that in spite of the number of ex-Deputies here, the atmosphere here is different from the atmosphere in the Dáil.  If I were asked to explain that, I would not be able to give a proper intellectual explanation, but it is so, and we give a different kind of consideration to a Bill from that normally given in the Dáil.  Again, very rarely&mdash;I am not speaking of any particular Minister or ex-Minister in this&mdash;very rarely do we vex Ministers here.  My friend, Senator L'Estrange, may be occasionally successful in that operation, but he is not typical in that particular matter.</P>
    <P>I think the proposed procedure, then, would be helpful to the Minister and to the public and would certainly serve the interests of the people involved in the Bill.  For example, our experience has often been that Ministers who resist amendments in the Dáil accept them here.  In the case of a recent Bill, we actually found that members of the Oireachtas came under the provisions of the Bill and the Minister agreed to an amendment taking them out.</P>
    <P>There is another point that comes up frequently, that is, the question of the urgent Bill.  I am sure the Taoiseach <Col N="466" /> shares my point of view that there is hardly any such thing as an urgent Bill, except perhaps dealing with finance and public order.  But that is not the Ministerial view generally, and when I use the word &ldquo;Ministerial&rdquo;, I mean the Minister of any Party and any Government Department.  A Government Department takes years sometimes to produce a Bill&mdash;sometimes ten years&mdash;but the moment a Bill is produced, it becomes urgent; the moment it comes into the Dáil it becomes not only urgent but also sacrosanct.  You cannot change a word of it.  It is very important.  They want it in a hurry and exactly as it is.  I believe that is all humbug.</P>
    <P>I am not putting this motion down in the form of an attack on the Government.  I do not think that any particular Government have been alive to this problem more than another. There are certain types of Bills that are very necessary but uncontroversial which could get good consideration first in the Seanad&mdash;consolidation Bills and Departmental tidying-up Bills.  I am anxious to see that the best value should be got in the interests of the country from our parliamentary institutions.</P>
    <P>The change I suggest might need co-operation from all sides.  I think that co-operation can be got in this House. As far as I am concerned, either in the position I occupy now or on the other side leading the House, I do not think the House has ever had any reason to complain of Ministers.  Ministers certainly from the very beginning as far as my experience goes have always been ready to attend and to come into the House.  I have no complaint about that.  I think that it could be carried a good deal further.  No Parliamentary system at all can work without intelligent co-operation.  We have had that here in this House all the time.  I do not want to occupy the time of the House any longer on the matter but taking this Seanad as it is, with all its faults, and I suppose we all agree that it has some faults, I think that steps could be taken to make more use of it. The changes would be for the good of this House, the other House and the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" /> A rather human feature which I suppose former Deputies have noticed and which I have noticed elsewhere is seen here, that the less you give people to do, the less they want to do.  People who have attended the Dáil regularly and become Senators sometimes seem to want to come here at 3 o'clock and to leave if they could at 4 o'clock. Without any diminution of the Dáil's power and any derogation of the sovereign status of the Dáil or any change in the Constitution, steps could be taken to give more work to this House, to make it more truly a part of our parliamentary institutions.</P>
    <P>I would like to end as I began, by saying that if that cannot be done, then the case for abolishing this House altogether is overwhelming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to second the motion moved by Senator Hayes who has, I think, put the case for it fully and clearly.  There is little for me to do in supporting him but to underline some of the points he has made.  The motion, as he pointed out, is based on the present powers and present membership of the Seanad.  I agree with him that he would rather not talk about what might be if this or that reform were introduced.  It is far better for all of us to take the Seanad as it is today, to take the 60 people who compose the Seanad and ask ourselves: &ldquo;Could they not play some more important role in the business of legislation in this country?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This motion asks that this question be examined, and mentions in particular three ways in which there might be a new look at the operation of the Seanad and a new departure in its procedure which if it were done, would not only have an immediate effect in increasing the usefulness of the Seanad but by making a start in this direction might well be a spur and give an impetus to further development of the Seanad as a second House which would act not as a replica of the Dáil but in a fashion complementary to the Dáil, together carrying out the legislative business of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we look at this problem, we must look at it in a particular way <Col N="468" /> because when we start talking about increasing the efficiency of anything, we must distinguish carefully between how it operates in a legal and formal fashion, and how it operates informally and in reality.  If we are to talk this evening here about how the Seanad could be improved, it is not a matter of the precise powers of the Seanad laid down in the Constitution or in our Parliamentary practice, but rather a matter of the manner in which the Seanad and the Dáil really act, of seeing whether or not the part played by the Seanad could be improved.</P>
    <P>If we look at the relative positions of the Dáil and Seanad regarding ordinary legislation&mdash;and that is the main concern of this motion&mdash;I think we will see certain things.  While it is true to say that in constitutional law the Seanad is in a way subordinate to the Dáil in respect of legislation, I think we must face the reality of the situation in both Houses today.  The situation is not so much that the Seanad is subordinate to the Dáil but that both the Dáil and the Seanad are subordinate to the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>In the passage of legislation through both Houses of the Oireachtas at the moment, the important point is not that the Dáil has greater powers of legislation, but that the Dáil and Seanad both stand in much the same relationship to the Cabinet.  In order to have an amendment accepted, it is not a question of persuading either House to agree; it is a matter of persuading a Minister to agree.  In the sense in which legislation can be amended and improved from the time it leaves a Government Department until it goes to the President for signature, there is not from the point of view of the effective working of ordinary legislation, any great distinction between the Dáil and the Seanad.  They approach Bills from two different points of view and they approach Ministers in seeking amendments from two different points of view and, as Senator Hayes said, it is immaterial which point of view is put first.</P>
    <P>The idea that the Seanad is essentially a revisionary Chamber in regard <Col N="469" /> to ordinary legislation is quite unreal and unnecessary.  The fact is that the Seanad need not be considered merely as a body which revises work which has been done in the Dáil.  As I say, the order in which most legislation goes through is immaterial.  As Senator Hayes said, there are certain Bills which quite obviously could not be introduced in the Seanad, certain Bills which of their very nature are highly controversial and which could probably only be introduced in the Dáil.  Most Bills are not of that type. Most Bills are non-controversial.  Most of the Bills which went through the Houses last year were non-controversial, so there does not seem to be any real reason&mdash;there does not seem to be any <i>a priori</i> objection&mdash;why a number of Bills should not be first introduced in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly there would be difficulties, but I think the effort which would be made to overcome those difficulties would be well repaid, not only by increasing the effectiveness of the Seanad, but also by allowing Dáil Éireann to make better use of its time.  The motion asks that business should come to the Seanad at reasonably regular intervals.  That, of course, is not something that could be done exactly or mathematically, but it is an ideal at which to aim.  Anyone looking at the situation will agree that it would not involve very much difficulty to come closer to that ideal than is the position at present.</P>
    <P>If we take the situation as it was in the past 12 months&mdash;and I take the past 12 months because they are the past 12 months and not because any particular Party had the arranging of Government business during that period&mdash;we find that from March until August, 1962, the Seanad dealt with seven Bills in three and a half months. Then, when the Dáil had adjourned, the Seanad dealt with seven Bills in a week.</P>

      <P>That is very far from what I think could be achieved. Absolute regularity is not what is looked for, but something better than <Col N="470" /> that could be achieved.  This is a recurring position.  The fact that the business of the Dáil gets into a certain condition and that at the end of the year a number of Bills come to the Seanad is something that appears to be always with us.  Indeed, before the Christmas recess in the Dáil, the Taoiseach indicated that it looked as if Government business, in his own words, would be in a mess this year, too.  Now is the time when something might be done to improve that situation for the remainder of this session, and then to rearrange things so that in future some of these difficulties might be avoided.</P>
      <P>What is the position at the moment? At the moment the Dáil has three complex Bills on its Order Paper: Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, the Companies Bill and the Electoral Bill.  All these are very large Bills which will require a fair amount of work on Committee Stage.  What can the Seanad expect in regard to those Bills?  The Planning Bill was circulated on 1st August, 1962, while the Seanad was still sitting.  The Second Stage was taken in the Dáil from November to February and the Committee Stage has not yet been taken.  I understand there are 100 amendments tabled to that Bill.  Is the Seanad to get the Planning Bill in the third week of July and be asked to give it a summary passage so that it can become law by the middle of August next?  Such complex Bills should not be handed to the Seanad at the end of the session.  The Seanad should not be told that these highly complex measures are to be passed before it adjourns some time in August.</P>
      <P>How do we fare in regard to other Bills?  Some relatively simple Bills were passed by the Seanad in the third week of July in previous years.  Something should be done in that regard by introducing a number of those Bills in the Seanad where they could be discussed and passed back to the Dáil, so that the Dáil could deal with them in exactly the same time as it would take anyway, but the Bills would have gone through the majority of their Stages in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, a start should be made <Col N="471" /> this year.  The appeal of the motion is for a start to be made towards some better regulation of the business of the Seanad.  If that were done, it would be the first move towards the Seanad beginning to play a distinct and more definite role than it does at the moment.  The Seanad could do a number of things and perhaps before I conclude, it might be as well to mention that there are instances already in which the Seanad has adopted a distinct role.</P>
    <P>The Dáil and Seanad have equal powers in regard to statutory regulations which are laid on the Table of the Houses; yet the Seanad has taken the step of setting up a Committee on Statutory Instruments and has taken over, in effect, through the setting up of that Committee, the special machinery for dealing with them. That is a good development.  It is something which the Seanad has taken on itself and, although it is the responsibility of the Dáil, has taken a greater part of the load on its shoulders. There may be further moves in that direction.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, the Taoiseach said he was willing at any time, if a motion were put down, to have the annual reports of the statutory bodies discussed. That is something which the Seanad might do.  Indeed the Seanad might do something along the lines of what is done in the House of Lords. If a motion were put down by a private member of the Seanad in regard to the statutory reports it would normally be interpreted as a motion put down in order to raise criticism.  If a member of the Front Benches on the Government side of the Seanad moves a motion that the Seanad take note of these reports, a certain time can be allowed for it and in this way the Senators would get an opportunity to discuss points which they make at present in this House, but which they make by slipping them into odd discussions on Bills which come up from time to time in regard to the question of money for these statutory corporations.</P>
    <P>I think what is wanted is, first, something in regard to the specific problem of business arriving in the Seanad in <Col N="472" /> the third week in July at a time when it cannot properly be dealt with.  A second point is that, apart from this specific problem, there should be a general question raised as to whether the Seanad could devise a method to stretch itself.  It should cease to occupy the role of a replica, numerically less strong and a somewhat pale replica of the Dáil, and that it could open up into certain specific functions which we could discharge.  The effect would be to increase the efficiency of Parliamentary work in Dáil Éireann as well as here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is divided into three parts.  The first part deals with the power to introduce Bills in the Seanad.  It is quite clear that the Constitution does allow of the introduction of Bills in the Seanad, but I believe that this was, and is, a very wise and far-reaching provision.  I think the Government should give serious consideration to the possibility of introducing Bills from time to time in the Seanad and, in particular, Bills of a technical character.  Quite obviously, there are controversial Bills which would not be suitable for introduction in the Seanad but there are non-controversial Bills, Bills of a technical character, which would be suitable for introduction in this House, particularly in view of the fact that there are quite a number of Senators with technical or vocational qualifications which would be very useful in considering Bills of this kind.</P>
      <P>I think it is true to say of a number of the Bills which were introduced here in the past, that the experiment was a successful one.  Certainly it could not be used as an argument for not doing so in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part of this motion suggests that Bills should come at reasonably regular intervals to the Seanad.  I agree of course that it would be very nice if we could have a regular flow of Bills but it is not a realistic proposition because the Government introduce Bills to the Dáil when Bills are ready, but once the Bill goes to the Dáil all kinds of factors affect the speed of the Bill through the Dáil and many of these factors are quite outside the control of the Government, so that <Col N="473" /> the Government are not in a position to time their Bills through the Dáil and to ensure that they will come to the Seanad at reasonably regular intervals. In the circumstances, the Government cannot be expected to do this, and I think this is quite unrealistic.</P>
    <P>The third part of the motion deals with the presenting of Bills to the Seanad at times of the year when no effective consideration can be given to them.  There is no doubt that Bills do come to us at times when it is very difficult to give effective consideration to them and there is no doubt that it is a pity that this should happen.  For the reason to which I have already referred on Part 2 of this motion, the Government really have very little control as to when these Bills will come here, and they cannot help the fact that some of them come here at times when it is rather difficult to give them effective consideration.  Consequently, I think the Government should give serious consideration to the first part of the motion, but I do not believe the remainder of the motion is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Ryan pointed out, this motion has three parts to it, two of which express criticism of the manner in which the Government and the Dáil do their work.  I think that criticism is both invalid and unacceptable.  The main function of the Houses of the Oireachtas is to give adequate consideration to and facilitate the enactment, with or without amendment, of Bills proposed by the Government. The present motion before the Seanad&mdash;at least Part I of that motion &mdash;seems to me, certainly, if I may judge from speeches made in support of it, as much concerned with the status of the Seanad as with the functioning of the Oireachtas.  The status of a Seanad is primarily that of a second House, a Chamber which has as its main function the revision of legislation which has already been passed by Dáil Éireann.  It is true that the Constitution permits of the introduction of Bills in the Seanad, but that is something which is done, has been done over the years and is likely to be done in future, only in exceptional circumstances in relation to and in <Col N="474" /> respect of measures which do not impose any charge upon the revenue, and certainly not as a normal practice.</P>
      <P>The normal function of the Seanad is, as I said, to receive, to review and, if desirable, to suggest amendments to Bills already passed by the Dáil.  We cannot and I do not think we should attempt to change that.  I do not agree at all with Senator Ryan that experience has shown that there is advantage to be gained by the introduction of Bills in the Seanad as a regular practice either in respect of the quality of the legislation or the time taken for the enactment of the proposals.</P>
      <P>This is, of course, an old issue.  It has often been discussed before and there is not much that can be said about it that has not been said before. Senators may, perhaps, be interested in the history of it.  Under the old Free State Constitution, three Bills were introduced in the Seanad in 1923 and then the practice was stopped.  From 1923 to 1932, no Bills were introduced except one.  In 1931, a Trustee Bill was introduced here mainly because, so far as one can judge from the records, it was originally suggested as necessary during the course of a discussion here.  The President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, Mr. W.T. Cosgrave, was personally strongly opposed to the practice of introducing Bills in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>When the first Fianna Fáil Government came into office in 1932, there was a new situation.  Perhaps it is not easy now to remember the strong political feelings of the time, but the fact is that there was a large political majority against the Government in the Seanad.  Our experience was that we introduced one Bill in the Seanad; it was defeated on First Reading and that was the end of that practice.  Shortly after that, the Seanad was abolished and remained so until the new Constitution came into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Hayes rightly remarked, Deputy Costello, as Taoiseach in the first Coalition Government, participated in a discussion here in which this matter was raised in 1949, and he indicated his intention of introducing into the Seanad Bills of a non-controversial and non-Party kind.  He <Col N="475" /> did that, in a speech in which he said that since he had become Taoiseach, he had discovered the Irish were a very cranky nation, and implied that was the situation which was reflected in the composition of the Seanad at that time.  His enthusiasm for the practice, if, in fact, it existed and was shared by his fellow members of that Government, apparently died away very quickly.  While six Bills were introduced here in 1949, only three were introduced in 1950 and one in 1951.  From that on, it is not easy to decide from the record whether any particular policy pattern was followed.</P>
    <P>After the end of the first Coalition Government in 1951, between then and 1954, four Bills were introduced in the Seanad: three in 1952 and one in 1953.  The second Coalition Government introduced two Bills in 1956.  As Senator Hayes said, since then only one Bill has been introduced &mdash; the Broadcasting Authority Bill &mdash; which was introduced here not because of any constitutional theory or any desire to establish a practice in that regard, but because it was desirable to get the Bill circulated at the time the Dáil was in recess.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That particular experiment worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think the experience of all Governments has been that this practice of introducing Bills in the Seanad does not necessarily shorten the period of their enactment or improve the quality of the Bills.  I do not think we should try to establish a practice or rule in this regard. I would not like to undertake that Bills of any kind would be introduced in the Seanad as a regular practice. There could be an advantage in introducing certain types of Bills in the Seanad at this particular time of the year when the Dáil is preoccupied with financial business.  The constitutional right which there is to introduce Bills in the Seanad will be exercised in these circumstances where a congestion of business in the Dáil, or any other type of special circumstances, make it an advantage to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" /> Of course, I am referring to Bills which could be described as non-contentious in the political sense and which do not involve a charge on revenue.  I do not propose to refer to the question of the procedures by which the statutory bodies could be made accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas, because I do not think that is relevant and it is not a matter on which I have a view to express. It is one which this and other Governments have considered on many occasions without coming up with any satisfactory answer.</P>
    <P>Regarding the second part of this motion, business can only come to this House from the Dáil after it is completed in the Dáil.  That is not necessarily under the control of the Government or under the control of anyone, as Senator Hayes from his experience knows better than anyone else.  Certainly, the flow of business through the Dáil cannot be regulated and will not be regulated just to make it fit in with the Seanad's agenda. Normally, I think the Seanad is not required to meet until there is a reasonable accumulation of business for its attention.  I certainly do not think there is any genuine ground for complaint on that score.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes's reference to Bills that appeared upon the Dáil's Order Paper in August, 1961, is a bit of special pleading, as he well knows.  I had announced at that time that a general election was going to be held. Senators are no doubt aware that when the Dáil is dissolved all the Bills upon the Order Paper at that time die and have to be reintroduced and started again on their journey to the Statute Book after the general election.  There was, therefore, a very special reason why an effort should be made to clear the Dáil Order Paper in the autumn of 1961.  Similarly, as Senator Hayes knows quite well, the practice of introducing Bills in the Dáil a couple of weeks before its summer adjournment &mdash;towards the end of July&mdash;is designed not to secure the immediate enactment of these Bills but to have a programme of business ready for the Dáil when it resumes after the summer recess.  It is in the nature of things that the Seanad must receive Bills from the Dáil after <Col N="477" /> the Dáil had gone into recess.  That is part of the normal work of the Seanad, and there is no way of avoiding it.  There seems to be no sense in complaining about it.  It means that the Seanad has to meet during August.</P>

      <P>If there is to be a contest as to which House meets in August, I think the Dáil will win that contest.  That is why I think it would be unreasonable to put legislation through the Seanad which would come to the Dáil after they had completed their long spring-summer session during which all the financial business has to be disposed of.  I do not think it is true to say that the Seanad is expected to pass all the legislation that comes to it, after the adjournment of the Dáil, within a week.  The Seanad may choose to do that but the enactment of these measures can proceed at a more leisurely pace, if the Seanad so wishes.  There is rarely, as Senator Hayes rightly pointed out, such urgency about any Bill that amendments to it cannot be considered here and, if passed here, held over for the consideration of the Dáil on its resumption later in the year, or have the Dáil resummoned to deal with these amendments if there should be any urgency for doing so.</P>
      <P>I do not think the fact that the normal course of events requires that Bills come to the Seanad after the Dáil has gone into recess restricts the power of the Seanad to consider these Bills or to amend them, if an amendment is desirable.  I do not think that it would be practicable so to arrange the business of the Dáil as to ensure that it would be occupied with some other class of business in the weeks immediately prior to going into recess, which is what would be involved in any arrangement designed to prevent the Seanad receiving these Bills when the Dáil was not meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To summarise, therefore, so far as the introduction of Bills in the Seanad is concerned, I do not think that that <Col N="478" /> can be arranged as a regular practice. I think there can be some advantage gained in the disposal of the time of the Houses of the Oireachtas by introducing Bills at this particular time of the year, from the beginning of the debate on the Vote on Account in the Dáil until the end of May, so that Bills then coming to the Dáil after the conclusion of the financial business there will not have to go back again to the Seanad after the Dáil has adjourned.  I think it is completely naïve to think that the output of Bills from the Dáil can be so arranged as to fit in with any predetermined timetable of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Government are concerned, while the practice is to try to arrange legislation so as to fit in with the other business the Dáil has to do, their intention is often frustrated either by delays in the parliamentary draftsman's Office or by the time that other legislation takes in securing passage through the Dáil, or often by second thoughts about some detail on a Bill before it comes up for circulation. It is inevitable that some accumulation of Bills will occur on the Dáil Order Paper towards the end of the summer session.  There is at that time a fairly rigorous division of these Bills into those which, for some reason, must be enacted within a stated time, and those which can be left over for the Autumn session.</P>
    <P>Where Bills must be enacted&mdash;and I do not agree with Senator Hayes that that never arises&mdash;there are often statutory limitations on expenditure or on the times within which expenditure must be effected, which have to be dealt with by new legislation whenever the time or amount is running out&mdash;I can see no possibility of a situation which is going to avoid Bills coming to the Seanad after the Dáil has adjourned for the summer recess and after Christmas.</P>

      <P>It was very good of the Taoiseach to come here this evening but I do not think he is in his usual form.  He was not as good as usual.  His speech was a mixture of bias and special pleading and did not deal with the motion at all.  The Taoiseach has plenty of practical <Col N="479" /> experience and he was good enough to say that I had plenty of practical experience.  We both have plenty of practical experience, but later he went on to explain that what I wanted was naïve.  In my experience of politics, I have been called many things but nobody has ever said that I was naïve and if anybody succeeds in proving that either the Taoiseach or myself is naïve he will be a very clever fellow.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's idea seems to be that a good Seanad is a body which he selects and which agrees with him all the time.  He did not like the Seanad he met in 1932.  He expressed his dislike in extremely violent language about individuals in the Seanad. I remember, but unlike some of my colleagues here, I do not propose to quote.  He did not like it, so he abolished it.  Fundamentally, it is a wrong view of Parliament that you must have a Parliament that agrees with you and that if it does not agree with you, it is bad and must be abolished.  He went on that basis and has a Seanad now that normally agrees with him.</P>
      <P>He went on to point out that there is power under the Constitution to introduce Bills in the Seanad but that it is not meant to be used.  I have said things about that Constitution in my time but I have never said it was as much of a fraud as the Taoiseach did tonight when he said that it contained a provision to introduce Bills in the Seanad which was never meant to be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He disagreed with Senator Ryan and myself but having expressed his disagreement, he came around to much the position I wanted established: that at certain times of the year certain types of Bills could be introduced in this House.  In spite of what the Taoiseach says, there is nothing undemocratic, nothing unconstitutional, nothing derogatory to the Dáil about introducing Bills in the Seanad.  Contrary to what people generally outside the Oireachtas think, neither the Seanad nor the Dáil&mdash;and particularly the Dáil &mdash;is usually engaged in wrangling. There is a big number of Bills about the principles of which there is no <Col N="480" /> substantial disagreement and which might be introduced in this House.</P>
    <P>I am putting this matter entirely on a practical basis and putting it to the Taoiseach because as a general rule when he is not putting an argument in which he does not believe, he is a practical person.  If it is a help to the Oireachtas to bring in a Bill here instead of in the Dáil, the Taoiseach agrees that it should be done.  That is what I want but he likes to express general disagreement before he expresses particular agreement.</P>
    <P>He is quite right in saying that such a Bill should be non-contentious and should involve no charge on public funds.  I agree with the second argument but when he says it should be non-contentious, it should be non-contentious in a Party political sense, but perhaps there could be disagreement about the Bill.  We disagreed strongly on one provision in the Officials Secrets Bill and this was not from a Party point of view but because powers were being assumed by the Government which we thought they should not assume.</P>
    <P>He has a bias against any Seanad because he did not like the Seanad we had in 1932, but as Head of the Government with long experience of Government and of politics, the Taoiseach, I suggest, is taking up a childish attitude. He should get over it now and not follow it up.  If the business of the two Houses of the Oireachtas could be better transacted, more efficiently transacted, by the introduction of Bills in the Seanad, then they should be introduced in the Seanad.  No history, no episodes between Fianna Fáil and a particular Seanad in the past should be allowed to stand in the way of this Oireachtas doing business in the best way possible.</P>
    <P>It is the business of this House to take Bills from the Dáil&mdash;the Taoiseach was too polite to say to take the Bills at any time they sent them and no fuss about it.  Technically, that may very well be so, but my suggestion, and I think it is an intelligent suggestion&mdash; and I know a considerable amount about the way Dáil business is transacted&mdash;is that it would be possible for any Government in office&mdash;and I <Col N="481" /> did not bring in this motion to criticise the Taoiseach&mdash;in considering their business to bring in their business in the Dáil in such a way that with reasonable agreement the Seanad would be likely to get more business than it got last year.  It does get reasonable agreement.  Every Government get reasonable agreement in the Dáil from the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Last year, in 1962, the Dáil met on 77 occasions and the Seanad met on 17 occasions.  I would suggest that most certainly the Taoiseach might take a kindlier, gentler and less biased view of this House than he does.  There is a majority in this House who agree with him and 11 members are nominated by him, but it does seem to me that he does not like them.  I do not dislike them myself, bad and all as they are, and I think it would be possible for any Government in office so to arrange their business that it would be likely that the Seanad would meet more frequently than 17 times a year and get more done.  I would suggest quite seriously to the Taoiseach that if he does not try to do that, if he does not try to plan that, this House is of very little use to anybody.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned about the status of the Seanad or about my own status. I have had a fair amount of status all my life but in my old age I am not concerned about my status.  That is one thing I am not concerned about at all.  I am concerned that this House does not fulfil any useful purpose at present.  It does not fulfil the functions it should fulfil.  If the Taoiseach were to think of two Houses when he is making out the parliamentary programme, it could be arranged in such a way that the Seanad could get things more regularly.</P>
    <P>He thinks, with Senator Ryan, that this idea is unrealistic.  It is not a bit unrealistic.  One of the strangest things about Irish politics is the way in which the first Government of Saorstát Éireann is invoked to prove everything right.  The Taoiseach does not like bringing in Bills in the Seanad.  What is his argument?  It is that Liam T. MacCosgair, the first President of the Executive Council, did not like it <Col N="482" /> either.  That is an extraordinary state of affairs.  I would hate to quote all that was said about Liam T. MacCosgair by Seán T. Lemass, but now in his ripe old age, when he is in power, he says: &ldquo;I do not like the Seanad; neither did Liam T. MacCosgair&rdquo;.  Is that not right?  Perhaps both of them were wrong and I am not so sure that the opinions which he attributed to Mr. Cosgrave were exactly the opinions Mr. Cosgrave held.  In any event, the position is more difficult now than it was then because now we are 30 years forward from 1932 in point of time, even if we have gone backwards in certain directions and certainly since 1922 we have had more and more Bills, more and more legislation, more and more stuff being poured into the parliamentary machine and turned out, some of them very badly mangled. The case therefore for a division of legislation, for some better attempt to arrange our parliamentary programme so that the two Houses would not be in the strange position they are in, is overwhelming now, and there is much more argument for it now than there was in 1932.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is not usually as theoretical as he was tonight.  He charged me particularly with being concerned about the status of the Seanad, and he curiously enough seemed to be concerned about the status of the Dáil and indeed of the country.  None of the things that I asked for and that were supported here&mdash;one of them by a member of his own Front Bench&mdash;in this motion would in any way take from the power of the Dáil.  He told us that there were special circumstances in 1961.  There was a general election.  There was no general election in 1962 and there were several Bills brought in on the 31st July, 1962.</P>
    <P>If we are a revising Chamber, we ought to get a chance to revise.  In the position that Minister are in at the end of July, when their officials and their families and they themselves want to get away on holidays which they deserve, and when the Dáil has gone into recess and they are pressed by the Department to get the Bill at all costs, when they come to the <Col N="483" /> Seanad, they always want the Bill without any amendment.  It is, as I indicated in my first speech, quite foolish&mdash;I do not mean to be offensive &mdash;for the Taoiseach to suggest that of course we could amend it if we liked. The Taoiseach and the people who framed the Constitution have taken elaborate steps to see that there is a majority in this House here so that we cannot amend it.  While, on the one hand, we are told that we are a revising Chamber, on the other hand, the Taoiseach says that he will continue to give us business in such a way as to thwart our efforts to be a revising Chamber.  I do not think that we could revise anything in those conditions. I am not saying that the Taoiseach could bring about a perfect solution.  I know all the troubles of the Dáil and the way programmes which may be adopted by the Government and the Opposition can be upset, but he could make an effort, and I am surprised that he did not say he would, because if the position is that we cannot do anything to remedy the present situation of the Seanad, then it seems to me that the Taoiseach has abandoned the Seanad altogether.</P>
    <P>His position is that we must take measures from the Dáil, whenever the Dáil likes to give them to us.  One of the things he said was at this time of the year when the Dáil is occupied with financial business, certain measures could be introduced in the Seanad. Perhaps the Taoiseach would make a beginning, therefore, this year on that. I would like to suggest to him as a practical man of long experience in politics, in Parliament and in Government that it is nothing short of balderdash to say that it is all right to bring in Bills in the Seanad in March but it is quite wrong to bring them in in the month of November.  Nobody would believes that.  If I said anything like that, the Taoiseach would have great fun talking about me.  If the Taoiseach believes that there is a period when Bills might be introduced in the Seanad, then he must surely agree that at any period that is convenient a Bill may be introduced in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>My plea is that this House as at <Col N="484" /> present treated and geared and working is not worth very much, and the Taoiseach, I am afraid, has been quite adamant in his adherence to the <i>status quo</i>.  I think he is quite wrong and I must say that I am very disappointed. I am not unrealistic myself and I am not asking for miracles.  I know that you cannot set down a number of Bills and say: &ldquo;We will have this passed by 2nd February, this by 2nd March, and this by 4th April&rdquo;.  I know you cannot do that, but I also know that there is a great deal you can do and that is what I am asking him to do.  I suggest that if he does not do it, it will be very bad for this House and bad for parliamentary government.  I am concerned and I am sure he is most concerned about the preservation of parliamentary government.  We are all concerned with it.  If parliamentary government is to survive here and to wax stronger, some effort must be made to create a second House which can be respected, and you can do that only if it gets work to do.  If it does not get work, it cannot get any respect and will be in the process of abolishing itself with the help of the Government. I regret that the motion did not get a better reception.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which provides that publishers must supply copies of books published by them to certain libraries.  The change made in this section as opposed to the corresponding section in the British Act is the addition of the library of St. Patrick's College, Maynooth.  Obviously I have no objection to that.  I am entirely in favour of giving this right to the library at Maynooth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section again raises the question of whether this is the right method of dealing with this problem.  Generally speaking, Irish publishers are not in a big way of business and they cannot afford, as well as the English publishers can, to supply 11 copies of every book they publish to libraries in Ireland and Britain.  English publishers who have far more resources supply five or six copies, I think.  Obviously it is a good bargain for us to supply books to those five English libraries because, whereas perhaps 100 or so books are published in Ireland every year, somewhere around 18,000 books are published in England and the library in Trinity College is entitled to a copy of every one of them.  Obviously that is a good bargain, but I <Col N="486" /> wonder is this the best way of dealing with it.</P>
    <P>It was suggested on Second Stage that it might be better if the State, the Arts Council or some such body gave a small money grant to Irish publishers to enable them to supply those copies but I think that is not the way to deal with it.  This provision seems to me to be a sign of a certain meanness on the part of Governments to Irish libraries.  Surely the answer is that Irish libraries should be provided with sufficient money to enable them to buy the few books that are published in Ireland?  I am in favour of the Bill as it stands, but I think the idea should be considered on a future occasion in suitable legislation that it might be better to subsidise our libraries adequately.</P>
    <P>It is ludicrous when one considers the few books which are published in Ireland that our libraries should be in a position that they are apparently unable to buy copies of these books. If they cannot buy copies of the few books published in Ireland, they are much less in a position to buy copies of the 18,000 books published in Britain every year, not to speak of the books published in the United States.  While I support the section, I think that is an example of a wrong approach to our libraries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Bill is about to pass, I think this is an appropriate time to say something I might perhaps have said during the earlier stages either here or in the Dáil.  When this Bill passes, I think we will have a good, up-to-date piece of copyright <Col N="487" /> legislation which will be in the best tradition of the protection of copyright in Ireland.  I think we can claim that copyright was first established by a judgment made in Ireland in the sixth century.  There is an old manuscript in the Royal Irish Academy which contains an account of the judgment given in the sixth century by Diarmuid McCarroll against Columcille. I think it is worth reading, and putting on record, an extract from that judgment.  It is an extract from a Royal Irish Academy manuscript, No. 24, page 25, and it is reproduced in the International Bureau at its headquarters in Geneva.  The extract reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time Columcille (521-597) went to the house of Finnian of Drum Finn and sought the loan of a book from him, viz. Finnian's copy of the Four Gospels, as it were to correct a book thereby.  Finnian gave him the book, and Columcille copied it at night unknown to <Col N="488" /> Finnian.  Finnian learnt of the copying of the book in theft and was angered, and set about bringing him to law for it.  &ldquo;I will give you the judgment of the king of Ireland on it,&rdquo; said Columcille, &ldquo;viz. Diarmuid Mac Cearbhaill.&rdquo;&ldquo;I will accept that,&rdquo; said Finnian.  Both sides went then to Tara where Diarmuid was and told him their tidings, and Finnian alleged the copying in theft, and that the copy of his book belonged to him.  Columcille said that Finnian's book was none the worse for his copying from it.  Said Diarmuid: &ldquo;To every cow its calf, and to every book its copy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In old Irish, that is: &ldquo;Le gach boin a laog agus le gach leabhar a leabran.&rdquo;  That, I think, we can properly claim was the first copyright law.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
