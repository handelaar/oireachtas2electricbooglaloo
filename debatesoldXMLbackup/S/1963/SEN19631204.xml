      <P>There is a meeting of the Dáil Whips some time this evening to make arrangements with regard to rising for the recess and the business to be transacted.  I have not yet got a definite indication of what Bills are expected but I understand they will include half a dozen of the smaller Bills which appear on the Dáil Order Paper.  I will probably know before the House adjourns this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make a small comment on that?  There are a number of Bills in the Dáil which have not been touched and which are not the subject of controversy.  They could very well have been introduced in this House with benefit to all concerned and to both Houses.  I should like to register an objection right now to the <Col N="85" /> fact that at the mouth of Christmas even six small Bills should be thrown at the Seanad and we should be asked to consider them.  I think we should get them after Christmas rather than before.  It would have been much better to introduce in the Seanad such non-controversial Bills as Funds of Suitors Bill, 1963, Adoption Bill, 1963, Firearms Bill, 1963 and even the Criminal Justice Bill, 1963.  If they had been introduced here it would have been a great help towards streamlining our parliamentary procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, this is a very bulky measure and it came before a Special Committee of the Dáil and was dealt with very fully there.  I think that a lot of useful work has been done on this Bill by various Deputies on that Special Committee of the Dáil.  The Minister co-operated very fully with the members of that Committee and accepted several amendments.  It was not handled on a political basis.  I think the Minister accepted various suggestions put forward by Deputy Sweetman from this side of the House and, of course, by other Deputies on the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, when the Bill came before the Seanad it was a measure that had found general agreement and, unlike many other Bills, it was not put through the House by the Minister's majority without consideration for suggestions from members on the other side.  It was to be expected then that there would not be a great lot of work to be done on the Bill in this House.  Nevertheless, the Minister kindly accepted the suggestion that it should again be referred to a Special Committee of this House.  That Committee sat on two occasions.  Its report is now before us and has been accepted.  Again, the Minister was in a very reasonable frame of mind when he attended before that Committee and I am glad to say that an amendment <Col N="87" /> put down by myself was accepted in principle and I think that amendments put down by other Senators were also accepted.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was before the Dáil the Minister introduced an amendment to exempt companies incorporated under Acts of the Oireachtas, particularly the Industrial Credit Company, from publishing certain particulars which other companies are obliged to publish.  In face of opposition the Minister withdrew that amendment when the Bill was before the Dáil but he reintroduced it before the Committee of this House and again the Minister's amendment was opposed rather strenuously by certain members of the Committee. The Minister did go some way to meet the objections raised and not alone are companies incorporated under an Act of the Oireachtas exempt from publishing these particulars but any company whose objects are covered by the section are exempt if they hold a certificate from the Minister. I personally would have liked the Minister to go further and to have done away with the necessity of that certificate but he has not seen fit to do so.  However, the amendment, as amended, is an improvement on its original form and I am obliged to the Minister for that.</P>
    <P>The only other section in the Bill to which I would refer is Section 196 which requires all letters on which a company's name appears to state various particulars regarding its directors unless it was registered before the 26th November, 1916.  We are dealing with the Companies Bill in conjunction with the Registration of Business Names Bill and Section 18 of the Registration of Business Names Bill requires similar particulars on all letters and the business name registered by a limited company unless it is covered by Section 196 of the Companies Bill.  That means that companies which register a business name, if they were established after 1916, must publish the particulars on their letters but a company established before 1916 is exempt from publishing particulars on its own letters but must do so on the business names register.</P>
    <P>There would not appear to be any <Col N="88" /> reason for the differentiation and I think that most businesses would rather publish the names of directors, if they must, on the company's letters than on the business names register and I think the exemption for pre-1916 companies should be done away with.  That would mean that all companies whenever registered would have to publish the names of their directors on their letter heading.  As it is, what we might describe as some of the old English companies are exempt from this obligation while truly Irish companies and companies formed since 1916 are obliged to publish that information unless they get a certificate of exemption from the Minister.  If the exemption were done away with it would make enforcement easier since every company would have to publish the names of its directors unless it had a certificate.</P>
    <P>The way this highly technical piece of legislation was handled in both Houses is an example which could quite profitably be followed in many other cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join the previous speaker in a tribute to the manner in which the Bill was handled and also to the end product which is a most impressive volume of legislation.  I discussed portion of it with some friends who were interested in it.  They, too, were highly complimentary of the measure and, in fact, could find nothing to suggest apart from one item.  I refer to Section 65.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 65 grants power to redeem preference shares issued before the 5th May, 1959.  That was the first time that it became possible to issue redeemable preference shares.  This provides that preference shares issued before 1959 can be redeemed subject to certain safeguards but at the end of those safeguards there is an additional one in relation to private companies only.  All companies have to comply with safeguards, a,b,c,d,e and f but g applies solely to private companies.  It says that in the case of private companies redemption must be sanctioned by the court.  I should like to know if there is any good reason why a differentiation should be made.  Why should this additional safeguard be required in the <Col N="89" /> case of private companies and not in the case of other companies?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Senator Fitzpatrick is practically new to me in that I did not have an opportunity of going into the pros and cons in the detail I should have liked.  It is no use saying that it is a pity he did not raise it at the Committee or I would have had a better opportunity of dealing with it.  Nevertheless, in the short time I have had to consider the point I am satisfied that to do what he suggests would create certain difficulties.  The 1917 Act which governs the particulars of business names gave this exemption to companies in existence before the 23rd November, 1916.  This section continues that exemption and certainly at this point&mdash;I know it is not possible to do it now&mdash;I would not like, without careful consideration, to undertake an amendment even if it were possible for us to do so within Standing Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the point raised by Senator Quinlan, Section 65 does give the power to redeem preference shares. The redeemable preference share is a comparatively new feature of company transactions.  It has been found very useful, in this country certainly as far as the Industrial Credit Company is concerned.  The provisions of the section apply to all companies except in the case of private companies where, as pointed out by the Senator, sanction must be obtained from the court.  In the case of private companies it is known that they do not have to publish their accounts as public companies do.  Therefore, shareholders in private companies, or the public, do not have access to the same knowledge as in the case of a public company so that the obligation to have the redemption of preference shares sanctioned by the court is to ensure that directors of private companies, if they want to redeem shares, will do so in a manner that will not be prejudicial to shareholders or people having an interest otherwise in the company.  I think it is perfectly reasonable and it was suggested that it be done in this form by the recent Special Committee of the <Col N="90" /> Dáil.  This Bill has been remarkable for the extent to which the recommendations of the Special Committee of the Dáil and the Committee on Company Law Reform have been adopted and incorporated in the Bill. These Committees comprised people who were very erudite in company legislation and put forward many desirable changes in the law.  This was one of them, as I said, and one that I would not like to upset without very close examination, even if it were possible, and even then I do not think it would be desirable to change the Bill or Section 65 in particular.</P>

    <P>Sections 1 to 3, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 4 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two points to raise on this section.  One is in regard to subsection (1) (d) and the other relates to subsection (1) (e).  We followed the 1916 Act here but we have put in that one of the particulars required is that in relation to nationality, if not Irish.  The existing form requires particulars of nationality and there is no question of whether it is Irish or not Irish.  The words &ldquo;if not Irish&rdquo; should be deleted because there seems to me to be a danger that if the nationality of every partner in the firm is not Irish there might be a blank and there might be an opportunity for someone not to put in the nationality.  It would be far better if the nationality were stated quite categorically rather than to have the opportunity for someone to opt out and say: &ldquo;I did not notice what was there.  I just left it blank.&rdquo;  I think it is a mistake to insert the phrase &ldquo;if not Irish&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I think there should be a further subsection to Section 41 requiring all other trading names under which any person is trading to be entered.  We have in the Companies Bill a similar provision requiring directors to state their other occupations. <Col N="91" /> They must state all the other directorships they hold.  It is highly desirable that any person registering under either of these Bills should state all his other activities; otherwise someone may be able to hide himself under a variety of business names and there would be no means of linking one with the other.  It should be possible to turn up the other activities of any person who is registered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the first point the format in Section 4 of this Bill is the same as that adopted and now passed in Section 195 of the Companies Bill and it is desirable, if for no other reason than for the sake of consistency, that we should have the same form in both Bills.  With regard to the merits of the point, I do not think any serious difficulty is created by having the nationality of the director in the case of the Companies Bill, or the partner in the case of the Business Names Bill, written in if it is not Irish; if it is Irish that would be obvious from the fact that it is not mentioned.  In any event, to avoid having a litany, as we might have in the case of some companies or partners following the word &ldquo;Irish&rdquo;, after the names of the directors and partners, only in the case of a person whose nationality is not Irish will the nationality appear.  I think that is all that is required and even if I accepted that there was a real need for the suggestion made by Senator Ross for the sake of consistency it would be better to leave it as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">

      <P>Would the Minister deal with my second point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, I almost forgot the second point.  Again, I must refer back to the Companies Bill in order to deal with the second point. The Companies Bill, as the Senator pointed out, requires a director to include in the documents filed with the Registration Office for the purpose of the Companies Bill the names and particulars of other directorships or bodies corporate of which he is a member. That is for the protection of shareholders. In the case of the Registration <Col N="92" /> of Business Names Bill, the purpose is td give an indication to people who would be trading with the particular partnership or firm who the owners of the firm are.  I am advised that the same degree of protection is not necessary.  Therefore, I do not think the point made by the Senator is sufficient to justify the introduction of an amendment to the Bill at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the position in the Companies Bill is that not merely are the shareholders protected but people trading with the company are protected? The same is valid here.  It is not shareholders here but people trading with somebody who is trading under a business name.  I think it is a valid point that the same protection should be given to someone in respect of registration under this Bill as to someone trading with a company and inspecting the Companies Register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I should like to repeat that the purpose of this Bill is to indicate to the public generally who is doing the business in the case of a person or a group of persons using a business name.  I cannot say I see the necessity here for that close degree of examination and disclosure of all other information as is required in the case of the Companies Bill. There is a part of the Bill which requires that the other business occupations of a person who is one of the partners or a person trading under a particular business name will be shown.</P>
      <P>Section 4 refers to the type of registration to be effected&mdash;</P>
      <P>...the present Christian name and surname, any former Christian name or surname, the nationality, if not Irish, the usual residence, and the other business occupation (if any) of each of the individuals who are partners, and the corporate name and registered or principal office in the State of every body corporate which is a partner;</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 5 to 17, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 18</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 18 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to come back to the point I was making on the Companies Bill.  Section 196 of the Companies Bill imposes on a company the obligation of putting on its letters, circulars, and so on, particulars of its directors unless it was registered before 23rd November, 1916.  If a company were registered before 23rd November, 1916, then a company entitled &ldquo;XY, Limited&rdquo; can get out all the literature it likes on notepaper headed &ldquo;XY, Limited&rdquo; and it need not give any other particulars of any description.</P>
      <P>It appears that for some reason it is thought desirable to put pre-1916 companies in a privileged position.</P>
      <P>Section 18 of the Bill with which we are now dealing imposes on a limited company using a business name the obligation of giving full particulars of its directors, and so on, unless it is already covered by Section 196 of the Companies Bill.  Therefore, while the pre-1916 company enjoys the exemption as a company it is not given the same exemption when it uses a business name.  It is hard to see why there should be differentiation.</P>
      <P>In reply to a point by Senator Ross on some other section, I heard the Minister say that for the sake of consistency it was necessary to do so and so.  Here you have, I think, the height of inconsistency.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 195 of the Companies Bill continues in effect what was existing law.  I think I might go <Col N="94" /> back to what I said when introducing the Registration of Business Names Bill.  I said its original purpose was to provide for war-time conditions when in this country, as in Britain, it was necessary, because of these war-time conditions, that the people should know&mdash;and by &ldquo;the people&rdquo; I mean the authorities as well&mdash;who exactly was carrying on business under a business name.  Therefore, the requirement then was of general application.</P>
      <P>Section 18 continues that requirement, and as is indicated in paragraph (c) of subsection (1) there is an exclusion, as the Senator pointed out, of companies referred to in Section 196 of the Companies Bill but I do not really understand that there is any lack of consistency with what I said a while ago although perhaps at first sight it might appear so.  The consistency I am talking of here is the consistency with what has been the practice and what is being continued in Section 18.  The 1916 Act was to an extent less onerous because it related only to documents sent to a person &ldquo;in any part of his Majesty's dominions&rdquo;.  These words have now, of course, been omitted, so that the section applies to a business letter sent to persons in any part of the world. Subject to that the section continues in the main what the position was under Section 18 of the 1916 Act, so there the consistency lies.  It is a continuation of a practice imposing certain conditions which was found to be useful and, therefore, it is only right that we should keep it of general application.</P>

      <P>It may be consistent in preserving an inconsistency, but as I see it a company entitled AB Ltd which was registered in 1915 can send out letters to any place it likes under the heading &ldquo;AB Ltd&rdquo; with no particulars of its directors and that is considered to be safe and unobjectionable, but if the company AB Ltd registers the business name XY and sends out letters under that heading it must give particulars of its directors on that notepaper.  I cannot see the necessity for that, because you can find out the directors of a limited <Col N="95" /> company by searching in the company's office and you can find out the proprietors of a business name by making a search of the Business Names Register. It is inconsistent that once it registers a business name a company has to give particulars of the proprietors of the business name.  I cannot see the necessity for this while not making a company do the same.</P>

      <P>That the Wexford Gas Order, 1963, proposed to be made by the Minister for Transport and Power and laid in draft before Seanad Éireann on the 20th day of November, 1963, under subsection 4 of Section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, be approved.</P>

      <P>Gas undertakings generally operate under Special Acts which authorise them to manufacture and distribute gas in certain specified areas.  Modifications in these Special Acts required by the undertakings from time to time are made under Section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, which enables me to make by Order the required modifications. Before an Order of this kind is made <Col N="96" /> it has to be laid in draft before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Houses of the Oireachtas may, by resolution, approve the draft Order in the form submitted or may approve it with modifications or additions.  When such approval is given I may make the Order in the form in which it has been approved.</P>
      <P>The Wexford Gas Consumers' Co., Ltd., have applied to me for a Special Order.  The object of the proposed Order is to enable the Company to extend the present limit on their borrowing powers from £20,000 to £60,000 to facilitate the purchase of up-to-date gas manufacturing plant, to extend the limits within which the Company can supply town gas, and to allow the Company to deal in bottled gas.</P>
      <P>Notice of the proposed Order was published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in a local newspaper.  Copies of the draft Order were sent to the Wexford Corporation and to the Wexford County Council and to other public bodies who might be concerned.  No objections to the proposed Order were received.</P>
      <P>The powers requested by the Company are no more than are necessary in order to make improvements in their gas manufacturing and distributing processes which will be required if the gas undertaking is to survive against growing competition from suppliers of other fuels.  I am satisfied as to the need for the Order and that there is nothing in it repugnant to the public interest.  I, therefore, recommend the Order for the approval of the House.</P>
