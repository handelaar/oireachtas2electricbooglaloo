    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is concerned with the duties, liabilities and rights of innkeepers or, as it is more apt to describe them nowadays, hotel proprietors.  It is one of the measures foreshadowed in the Government's published Programme of Law Reform and its purpose is to amend the law relating to innkeepers so as to bring it into closer accord with modern social needs and conditions. In addition, the opportunity is being availed of to clarify and restate the law in a single comprehensive statute, which will obviate the necessity to refer to previous enactments.</P>
      <P>The obligations and rights of innkeepers are based on the common law and their origin can be traced back to the Middle Ages.  Whether the rules derived from mediaeval views on causation or on the nature of a public calling, or from a commonly held suspicion that innkeepers were in league with highwaymen to pillage travellers, must remain a matter of speculation and controversy.  What is beyond question is that the rules exist today and that basically they serve a useful, and, indeed, essential, purpose in modern society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the common law duty of the innkeeper to receive and lodge every traveller at any hour of the day or night, unless he has reasonable grounds of refusal, and to receive any property which the traveller brings with him, provided there is accommodation for it at the inn.  Breach of this duty renders the innkeeper liable to criminal as well as civil proceedings.  The innkeeper is under a strict liability for the loss of all property brought to the inn by a traveller irrespective of whether it is lost by theft, through the negligence of another guest, or by the acts of the innkeeper's servants. The only cases in which the innkeeper can escape this liability are where the loss arises from an act of God or of the enemies of the State or the guest's own negligence.  The Innkeepers' Liability Act, 1863, modified the liability by providing that an innkeeper shall not be liable to any guest for the loss of property to an amount greater than £30, unless the property is lost through the negligence of the <Col N="289" /> innkeeper or his servants or has been deposited expressly for safe custody with the innkeeper.  This limitation does not extend to horses or other live animals or to any carriage, motor car or other vehicle.  The innkeeper has the right to detain the property of a guest who fails to pay his bill and, under the Innkeepers Act, 1878, he has the right to sell the property after six weeks in order to satisfy the debt.</P>
    <P>Social and economic conditions have undergone considerable change since the existing law relating to innkeepers first took shape and, as might be expected, it is now out of date and anomalous in a number of respects. With a view to remedying this situation, I have had a detailed study of the matter carried out by my Department in the course of which consideration has been given to the research and ideas of experts in this field and the legislation of other countries.  The present Bill represents the outcome of that work.  It restates the fundamental principles of the existing law, but in a form which should prove more adequate and appropriate to our times.</P>
    <P>Senators will notice that the term &ldquo;inn&rdquo; is being discarded in favour of &ldquo;hotel&rdquo;.  This is a necessary concession to modern usage, although there are some who may regret that the lovely old English word &ldquo;inn&rdquo;, with its subtle hint of the charm and hospitality of a bygone age, is being pushed into virtual oblivion.  Such is the penalty we must pay for progress. The Bill imposes on the proprietors of hotels, as defined in Section 1, new statutory duties, liabilities and rights in substitution for those at present attaching to innkeepers under the common law.  The definition of &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; reproduces the substance of the present common law concept of an inn and automatically includes every establishment registered as a hotel with Bord Fáilte Éireann.  This latter provision is new and is designed to remedy one of the unsatisfactory features of the present law, namely, the difficulty of ascertaining whether a particular premises is an inn.  In future, persons staying at registered hotels can be certain that they will enjoy the <Col N="290" /> benefit of the protection accorded to them by the Bill.  Apart from registered hotels, the question whether a particular premises constitutes a hotel for the purposes of the Bill will be a question of fact in every case.  In can be taken, however, that, in general, guest houses, boarding houses, and similar establishments do not come within the ambit of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 re-enacts the duty of a hotel proprietor to receive all persons presenting themselves and requiring sleeping accommodation, food or drink and to provide them therewith, unless he has reasonable grounds for refusal.  In that connection, I notice that one of the columnists in our daily papers expressed some anxiety that this ancient privilege, which the ordinary citizen has, might be taken away from him and I would like to assure that particular columnist and the House that this is not so.  It may be observed that the duty applies to all persons whether or not they come to the hotel under a special contract.  It is very common practice nowadays for people to book hotel accommodation in advance, and, although by doing so they acquire a contractual right to the accommodation which they have reserved, I am satisfied that it is desirable that they should also enjoy the benefit of the statutory protection accorded by this Bill.  Section 3 provides that, subject to the terms of any special contract, the hotel proprietor must supply the desired accommodation, food, or drink at the charges for the time being current at the hotel.  This provision is necessary to ensure that a proprietor will not be able to offer a prospective guest facilities at a price which he knows will deter the guest from accepting and in that way evade his statutory obligations.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that in modern times the duty to receive all comers is an anachronism and ought to be abolished.  I am unable to accept that point of view.  It seems to me that, if the proprietor of a premises holds himself out as prepared to cater for all and sundry, it is only reasonable that he should be bound to receive every person who comes in a fit state to be received and who is willing to pay for <Col N="291" /> the services and facilities of the hotel. I am sure the House will agree with me that it would not be in the public interest or in the interest of the tourist industry that hotels should be able to reserve their hospitality for selected guests.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that the duty to receive imposed by Section 3 will extend to all persons who seek admission to the hotel as guests.  The existing common law concept of confining the duty to travellers is being abandoned.  I am satisfied that this concept is unreal and no longer of any significance under present day conditions. In England, the Court of Appeal has admitted as much by holding that a person who visits his local inn for a drink is a traveller even though his home may be only a short distance away.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides that it shall be the duty of a hotel proprietor to receive property brought by a guest provided there is suitable accommodation for it at the hotel.  This will oblige the proprietor to admit the luggage and other property normally brought by a guest but it will leave him free to refuse items of an exceptional character such as, for example, dangerous or cumbersome articles or articles likely to cause inconvenience or offence to other guests.  A proprietor will, for example, be entitled to refuse to admit dogs or other animals if he has no proper accommodation for them.  In other words, you will not be entitled to have an elephant admitted to the hotel unless the proprietor has special accommodation for it.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill provides that the proprietor shall be strictly liable for any damage to, or loss or destruction of, property brought to the hotel by a guest.  Although the historical circumstances which gave rise to the concept of strict liability have largely disappeared, there is clearly still good reason why a hotel proprietor should be under a special obligation in regard to the safety of the goods which guests bring with them and upon which, in return, the proprietor has a lien for his charges.  The visitor to the modern <Col N="292" /> hotel is, as much as in the past, exposed to the risk of loss through negligence on the part of the proprietor or his servants, but it would often, by the nature of the case, be difficult for him to prove negligence, as he would have to do if strict liability were abolished. For the overseas visitor the difficulty of obtaining legal redress in such a case would be even greater.  I have considered this matter very carefully and I am satisfied that it is entirely fitting that the principle of strict liability should be retained.  I am confirmed in this view by the fact that the principle is accepted in most Western European countries and that it has long been enshrined in most legal systems throughout the civilized world.  If we in this country were to abolish strict liability, visitors to Irish hotels would be placed in a much less favourable position than in other European countries and I have no doubt that such a situation would react unfavourably on the tourist industry here.</P>
    <P>Although the Bill preserves the basic obligations of innkeepers in respect of property, it makes an important change by confining those obligations to the property of guests who stay overnight. I think that it is entirely inconsistent with the original notion on which innkeepers' liability was based that the obligations in respect of property should extend to articles brought to a hotel by casual visitors who merely call for a meal or a drink.  Indeed, the present law has led to the anomalous situation wherein a casual visitor dining at a hotel is indemnified against the loss of any property which he brings with him, including a motor car, but is not so indemnified if he eats at a restaurant.  To remove this anomaly and to restore the law to what was clearly originally intended, the obligations imposed on a hotel proprietor by Sections 5 and 6 of the Bill will extend only to the property of a guest who has booked sleeping accommodation.</P>
    <P>The liability imposed by Section 6, that is to say, the strict liability for loss or damage, is being extended to property of which the proprietor takes charge outside the hotel, as, for example, where he sends a servant to collect the luggage of a guest from a <Col N="293" /> railway station.  This is a logical extension of the scope of strict liability. In so far as a motor vehicle is concerned an important new safeguard is being introduced for the proprietor in that his liability for loss or damage will not apply unless he has been previously notified that the vehicle has been brought to the hotel.  This, I submit, is also a logical amendment of the existing law, as it is manifestly unfair to a hotel proprietor to burden him with liability in respect of a motor vehicle of the presence of which he may be totally unaware.</P>
    <P>In a Circuit Court case some years ago it was held by the Court that by virtue of the Accidental Fires Act, 1943, a hotel proprietor was not liable to a guest for damage caused by accidental fire occurring on the hotel premises.  The Act in question was framed to deal with liability for damage caused by fire accidentally spreading from one premises to another and I am satisfied that it was not intended to apply to the liability which a hotel proprietor has towards his guests.  For the avoidance of doubt, therefore, Section 11 of the Bill makes it clear that the Act of 1943 does not apply in such cases.</P>
    <P>The strict liability of a hotel proprietor will not apply where the damage to, or loss of, property can be shown to be due to an unforeseeable and irresistible act of nature or an act of war.  This follows the existing common law rule.  In the case of contributory negligence by a guest the position will be governed by the Civil Liability Act, 1961, which provides for the apportionment of liability having regard to the relative degrees of fault of the parties.  If the hotel proprietor is found to be guiltless of what may be called moral fault, while the guest is guilty of negligence, the whole loss will be borne by the guest.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill increases from £30 to £100 the existing limitation on innkeepers' liability in certain cases. This change is necessary in view of the fall in the value of money since the Innkeepers Liability Act, 1863, was enacted.  In fact, the view was expressed in Dáil Éireann that the figure of £100 is not high enough and that it ought to be increased substantially.  While I <Col N="294" /> would be prepared to consider any suggestions which Senators may have to make in this regard, I personally feel that a limit of £100 is, on the whole, reasonable in relation to present day values.  As under existing law, the limitation will not apply to motor cars or property which is deposited with the proprietor expressly for safe custody or property which is damaged or lost through the negligence of the proprietor.  In order that a proprietor may obtain the benefit of the limitation, a notice in the form prescribed in the First Schedule of the Bill will have to be displayed conspicuously in the hotel premises.  This notice will have to be in both Irish and English and it will replace the existing notice prescribed by the British legislation of 1863.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the outset, the duty of innkeepers to receive travellers and their property is an obligation under the criminal law as well as a civil responsibility.  While the threat of civil proceedings is likely to be adequate in most cases to ensure that hotel proprietors will fulfil their obligations, it is possible to envisage circumstances arising in which, on grounds of public policy, the State would wish to be able to enforce compliance with the obligation.  Accordingly, Section 12 of the Bill provides that a hotel proprietor who commits a breach of this obligation will be guilty of an offence and will be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £100.</P>
    <P>The question of the strict liability of hotel keepers in respect of the property of their guests has been under examination by the Council of Europe in recent years and a Convention on the subject aimed at securing uniformity of the law among member countries has been drawn up.  The Convention was signed last December on behalf of the Irish Government, and the changes in the law which are provided for under this Bill will enable us to ratify the Convention in due course.  There will, I think, be general acceptance of the fact that unification in this particular branch of the law is most desirable from the point of view of the development of international tourism.  Because of the great importance of this industry <Col N="295" /> to our economy, we in Ireland cannot afford to lag behind other European countries in this matter.</P>
    <P>To sum up, therefore, the Bill is a step in the process of bringing our law up to date so as to make it reflect current outlooks and fulfil the needs of modern society, at the same time enabling us to enter into commitments for the harmonisation of our law with that of other European States.  The Bill adopts the basic common law rules relating to innkeepers which have proved beneficial to the community in the past, discards such of the rules as have outlived their usefulness, and resolves certain questions of law which are at present in doubt. Lastly, the Bill collects all the law on the subject into a single document, thereby facilitating the task of making the law known to the people, and indeed, to the legal profession.  I believe that these are worthwhile objectives and I feel confident that the measure is one which will commend itself to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Anything in relation to the codification of the law in any aspect of our social life is always welcome.  As a codification and a bringing up-to-date, this particular piece of legislation is welcome.  However, in my respectful view, it falls very far short of being a necessary all-embracing piece of legislation, in view of the international tourism to which the Minister referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I saw the Bill first and saw that it was to be confined to those buildings known as hotels, classified under lists kept by Bord Fáilte, I immediately thought of another list which, I think, almost certainly is kept by Bord Fáilte, a list of guesthouses. Now I understand that these guesthouses and boarding houses are not within the scope of this Bill.  Tourism alone has taken on such magnitude in this country that it is not confined to the hotels kept in the list prepared by Bord Fáilte.  In fact, I would say that the visitors who stay in that list of hotels would certainly not form half of the percentage of our local tourist traffic.  We have guesthouses; we have <Col N="296" /> the ordinary boarding houses, and, in fact, it is well-known that Bord Fáilte have also got a list of approved private houses to which guests are sent by the local tourist office or, indeed, in many cases, by the over-full hotels themselves.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that that vast amount of room available to tourists should be left out of the ambit of this Bill, and that, when the Minister took the time and the trouble to prepare it and bring the law up-to-date and make certain modifications and changes, he did not give us a more comprehensive measure. Indeed, as it stands, the Bill is one that will require a good deal of serious thought and study prior to its ultimate passing through the House.</P>
    <P>It is true, of course, as the Minister said, that times have changed.  Social conditions have altered so considerably since the first requirement of all that compelled the notice we see &ldquo;pursuant to Queen Victoria...&rdquo; decorating the hallways of our hotels at the present time.  He did mention in regard to a conspiracy as between innkeeper and highwayman for the pillaging of travellers, that these conditions no longer exist.  I admit that they no longer exist because in a great many cases, particularly in relation to prices charged by our semi-State owned hotels, the highwaymen have become the managers of these places and the travellers are still pillaged.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that the figure of £100 is sufficient to cover what might be the amount recoverable for property deposited in any hotel.  In relation to the old figure of £30 I do not think it is a fair reckoning, because nowadays, I think, people can bring more with them; there is more accommodation for transport, private property and belongings. I do not think that this provision about not extending the Accidental Fires Act to hotels in this case is a good thing.  If a person takes a car to a hotel and has it kept in the hotel garage&mdash;he has only a certain kind of insurance&mdash;and if there is a fire in the hotel which is proved to be accidental and in which that car is lost, where does the onus for remedy rest if he is not comprehensively covered himself?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>On the whole, I would say that we would welcome this Bill, but it still is one that requires a considerable amount of study.  It is with a certain hesitation that one would give it a full welcome seeing the number of houses that are left out. Perhaps, the Minister may have another Bill in mind dealing with guesthouses, boarding houses and those private houses that are used so extensively during the season.  If he has and if one is coming pretty quickly out of the stocks to bring these things up to date, this measure will be complete in itself.  However, as it stands it is most inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill as it brings the law into line with the changed circumstances of modern times.  It is also a good example of codification of law where a good deal of litigation could take place and where decisions are hard to reconcile with one another. From the point of view of simplifying relations between people and enabling people to recognise their rights and obligations towards one another the Bill is a move in the right direction.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that the hotel business nowadays has become much more important than it was in the past as it forms an important part of the tourist industry and the tourist industry is one of our growing export industries in the country.  Therefore, it is very important that people who come here as tourists should be properly protected against people with whom they have contractual dealings.  Hotels receive considerable assistance from public funds and have almost become a type of public utility.  Therefore, it is right that they should have corresponding duties towards their customers.</P>
      <P>Also, as the Minister stated, there is an international Convention of the Council of Europe and it is important that Ireland should fall in line with other countries.  As the Minister stated at the end of his speech, it will now be possible when the Bill is passed for us to ratify the Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="298" /> Another reason for welcoming the Bill in the House is that the position of innkeepers at common law is very onerous indeed.  It is a very long time since I was a law student but I do remember that there were two types of people who are insurers: innkeepers and common carriers; when an injury is inflicted on customers it is not necessary to prove negligence on the part of either innkeepers or common carriers.  This is an extremely onerous obligation but it may be justified&mdash;and certainly it can be explained&mdash;by the circumstances of the Middle Ages when people were so much at the mercy of innkeepers and common carriers.</P>
    <P>Innkeepers' liability was to some extent reduced by an Act of Parliament of exactly one hundred years ago, 1863, which limits in certain respects the liability of the innkeeper, to the sum of £30.  The position of the innkeeper is still that of the innkeeper in common law, the insurer of goods of people residing in the premises provided that he is an innkeeper within the strict meaning of the term and not merely a person who keeps guests or a boarding house keeper.</P>
    <P>As the previous speaker says, the question was raised in the Dáil whether the new amount of £100 is appropriate to the changing circumstances of modern times.  There is no question but that the value of money has fallen by more than that in the past hundred years, but at the same time the principle, I think, is correct and the principle is maintained in the Bill.  The exact amount is of secondary importance. It is only the liability of the innkeeper as insurer which is limited to one hundred pounds.  As far as damage to guests' property is caused by negligence of the innkeeper or when the guest becomes a depositor, his liability is still unlimited.  It is quite clear that Section 7, therefore, means that only his liability as insurer in the strict sense of the term is limited to one hundred pounds by this section.</P>
    <P>It is quite right, I think, that the distinction between travellers and lodgers should be abolished.  The ordinary inhabitant of a hotel today is <Col N="299" /> not a traveller staying only one night and moving rapidly from night to night but a person who stays perhaps for a considerable period or certainly for several nights.  From the point of view of the tourist trade I think such people, although they may be subject to special contractual rights, should be quite clear that their full rights are preserved.</P>
    <P>As the last speaker said, the exclusion of boarding houses and private houses accepting lodgers is rather questionable. Tourists who stay in premises which are not hotels or inns within the definition of the Bill have not got the same protection as those who do stay in hotels or inns within the definition of the Bill.  It could still be a matter of considerable litigation as to whether premises constituted a hotel or not.  It is provided that premises registered as hotels by Bord Fáilte should be taken to be hotels but it might be a matter of some difficulty to draw a line between premises as to whether they were hotels open to receive all travellers or merely guesthouses or boarding houses.  I agree with the previous speaker that now in an age of tourism where people stay for considerable periods under the same roof the rights of such people should receive special protection.  I think this is a matter to which the Minister might direct his attention on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  It could be a matter of considerable litigation at the present time whether premises are, in fact, hotels or not.  If premises are registered under Bord Fáilte, then they are hotels, but if they are not registered it becomes a matter for decision whether they are hotels or not and this could involve considerable litigation or in certain circumstances a certain amount of injustice.</P>
    <P>The Bill imposes many obligations on hotel proprietors but it does not impose more than they had before.  It rather reduces their liability than increases it but from one point of view it might be regarded as a one-sided Bill.  All the liability I think is on the hotel keepers' side and there is nothing in the Bill to protect hotel keepers against customers.  There could be a considerable amount of possible loss <Col N="300" /> if people who booked rooms failed to turn up or cancelled at the last moment.  In cases of this kind I wonder whether an action for breach of contract would lie by the hotel keeper against the prospective customer.  It would impose a loss on the hotel keeper in that he could not rent the room to somebody else and I should like to ask a question whether an action would lie in circumstances of that kind.  The Minister might clarify the point.</P>
    <P>Subject to these few observations I welcome the Bill and I think it does bring the law up to date and codifies it in a desirable manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speaker, I feel that when the Minister had this question under consideration he should have had the Bill include all those guesthouses and boarding houses and deal with all at the one time.  Judging from his opening remarks, I feel that this Bill has either gone too far with regard to hotels or perhaps has not gone far enough regarding the whole position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the point of what are termed hotels, inns or boarding houses, I might, first of all, refer to the Title of the Bill itself which is rather misleading for one thing; &ldquo;an Act to amend the law connected with inns and innkeepers and for purposes connected with that matter.&rdquo;  I would think a suggestion like an Act to make provision in respect of the law in relation to hotels or anything like that would be much more appropriate.  I know this is a small point.  This whole question of inns and innkeeper law is of ancient origin.  I think the earliest Act mentioned is the Act of 1652 relating to horses only.  There was obviously an innkeeper law before that time.  Times then were vastly different from what they are now.  There were dangers not alone in relation to hazards on the roads but also from other users of the roads such as robbers and highwaymen.  In addition, men in those days had to carry, by reason of there being no banking facilities, large sums of money on their persons and in their luggage.  It was against this sort of background that <Col N="301" /> the whole law of inns and innkeepers grew up in respect of travellers only. The present Bill refers to any person presenting himself at a hotel.  The whole law grew up as regards the traveller only and it was definitely unreasonable for an innkeeper in those days to refuse accommodation to a traveller if it could be avoided.  For one thing, the roads and the hazards of the roads constituted a considerable danger for the traveller, and the possibility of his getting into another hotel or inn was remote.  Probably his only mode of travel was on horseback. In those days probably each town had one inn with one or two inns in the larger towns, but it was very difficult to get accommodation.</P>
    <P>Nowadays I think hotels to a certain extent are falling over themselves looking for customers.  Even in small country towns where railway stations existed the hotels used to send representatives to these stations looking for customers and actually caused annoyance to people getting off trains by approaching them to stay at some particular hotel.</P>
    <P>In most country towns now we have quite a considerable choice of hotels&mdash; all looking for clients.  It is not the case now, except for a few weeks in the summer, that the hotels are full.  It is not the case that they will refuse anybody.  The Minister should have another look at Section 3 of the Bill to see if it is necessary in this present day and age.  Having regard to the number of hotels, the mode and speed of travel nowadays, it is unnecessary to retain that sort of legislation.  I think it should be left to the hotels themselves to consider what is reasonable.  After all, no two judges, no two Ministers, or no two people will come to the same conclusion as to what is a reasonable excuse for a hotel to make.  Is the condition of the guest, shall we say, a reasonable excuse?  It has been held in the past that a person obviously suffering from an infectious disease was entitled to be admitted to a hotel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the proprietor of that hotel prepared to receive guests?  He may have rooms available and no staff. Would that be reasonable?  I think there will be difficulty.  The important part of this Bill hinges on what is reasonable and what is not reasonable. I feel, having regard to the present competition between hotels, the Minister should, despite his opening remarks, take another look as to whether we should retain the part about liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same to a certain extent applies to the type of client.  Take a small private hotel.  I do not know whether the Minister can say whether there is now such a hotel as a private hotel. They still have it stated as such over the door and probably they hold themselves out as hotels proper.  Are those people compelled to receive the remnants of a late night party who <Col N="303" /> have decided they will not go home, demand a room in the hotel, and ask to have the bar opened and be supplied with food?  These are probably unreasonable grounds.  If they are reasonable grounds, they are excluded and what other unreasonable grounds are hotels going to suggest?</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister how many prosecutions have there been under this section in the past five or ten years in this country. I remember one such, in a large hotel in Dublin, where an undesirable person was turned out.  Surely if at a rather expensive hotel an obviously undesirable person&mdash;a tramp&mdash;turns up and says I want a room, food and drink for tonight, payment is demanded beforehand and he says he will pay, he must be taken in.  Is that a reasonable excuse?  It will be very hard to get a general view on it and the whole matter should be left open to the hotels who receive what guests they wish.</P>
    <P>The other question I want to refer to is the liability of the innkeeper for goods up to the £100 level.  I am not quite sure that I would not see a lot of good ground for doing away with that also.  It is the usual custom that the guest is given a key to his room and it is locked by him.  Provided there is no negligence on the part of the innkeeper by having duplicate keys freely available, I feel it is unreasonable to expect an hotel keeper to be liable if, shall we say, an experienced thief breaks into that hotel, and is able to open those doors or comes in some other way.  The hotel keeper is liable up to £100 for objects in those rooms. Nowadays, travellers can for a very small amount insure, if their own insurance company does cover it, their own private property.  If they have not that cover I feel it is adding to the expenses of the hotel to compel the hotel proprietor to take out an insurance policy to cover all that sort of thing.  But it is the other matter, the unreasonable refusal that I should like the Minister to consider again.  I presume he has not had a very forceful argument on behalf of the hotels to do away with that, perhaps because <Col N="304" /> there was not much hope of getting him to do it.</P>
    <P>At the present time when hotels are looking for clients and having regard to the number and variety of hotels, guesthouses and boarding houses, I feel that hotels should be allowed to develop, perhaps, a certain type of hotel for a certain type of guest &mdash;perhaps old people, perhaps young people.  The proprietor should be allowed to keep or reserve his hotel for the possibility of that type of guest turning up on the same evening or the same day.  He should not be compelled to take in guests who do not conform with the type of client that he has been accustomed to keep.</P>
    <P>The only other point I should like to ask the Minister to consider is this. Supposing a guest arrives in a hotel with very little, if any, luggage, does the lien that the hotel proprietor has entitle him to act after the first night or must he leave that guest there for a week in the hotel knowing that he has nothing; that it is very doubtful if he is going to be paid and knowing that he has nothing worth while which he can seize?  Can he say after the first night: &ldquo;I want to get paid or else out you go.&rdquo;  I would support what Senator George O'Brien said that a hotel keeper should have some rights against his guest, but particularly he should have the right&mdash;stated by statute&mdash;to eject guests who behave in an indecent, obscene or unseemly manner in the hotel.  I should like to see that in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, this Bill could be regarded as a most welcome step in the right direction. There is no doubt we should not relent our efforts to ensure that the tourist is properly treated, having regard to the value of tourism to our national economy.  But, I think there are some shortcomings in the Bill because I notice that there is no difference whatsoever in it as to the way the employees in the hotels may be treated.  Now, the industry is very important.  It is very important that the proprietors should operate the industry properly and the employees in the hotels are also a very important element of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="305" /> I assume that one of the reasons for bringing in this amending Bill was to improve the position generally, and as a result, the tourist industry would profit.  There is no doubt about that and everybody agrees that it is important to further the tourist industry because of the effect it has on the economy of the country.  I should like to see the Minister at some stage bringing in an amendment to deal with the points I have made, that is, in so far as the workers in the industry are concerned.  There is, of course, accommodation for tourists, the safeguarding of the tourists' property&mdash;the customers' property.  Everybody who goes to a hotel is a customer and in most cases he could be regarded as a tourist going from one part of the country to another or coming from some other country.</P>
    <P>Now, a very important element of the hotels is the employee.  There is no reference to accommodation for employees in the Bill.  It could be claimed that if there is no reference to them in the Bill that proprietors could regard themselves as free from having any kind of major obligations to have accommodation up to a standard.  Of course, quite a large number of hotel proprietors, or guesthouse proprietors, as they might be termed, will do the right thing but being free, with no obligations under the Bill, there is the temptation not to worry about the matter.</P>
    <P>What is the position of an employee who dutifully carries out his orders as regards what is in the Bill?  The employee, in the interests of tourism, finds himself in trouble with the employer for doing so.  That can easily happen.  Somebody might say that he can go to his trade union but it is not so simple to take up the matter because there is a considerable number of catering workers employed in hotels outside places like Dublin and Cork who have not got the opportunity of being organised to any extent.  They live in the hotels and can be easily threatened with dismissal, as they have been from time to time, if they take up the affair, and operate through the ordinary working class movement, which is the trade union.</P>

      <P>I shall just make this point.  I should like to see the Minister bringing in an amendment to cover the points I have made.  In that way the people concerned may be able to be made part of the Bill.  The employees I have referred to are not covered, even by the Conditions of Employment Act.  The Minister is aware of that, of course, and that it is a big handicap to workers because most workers in industry in the country are covered by the Conditions of Employment Act.  As far as I know those employees are not.  Then, would we not need to safeguard them in some way?  If the Cathaoirleach says I cannot proceed on that line I cannot do so.  I would ask if the Minister would be prepared to bring in an amendment to have them covered in some way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the intention of the Minister in introducing this Bill was to define the obligations of hoteliers to their guests and the obligations of guests to hotel proprietors in one piece of legislation. In so far as that was the intention of the Minister and in so far as the Bill achieves that object, I, of course, welcome it.  I think it highly desirable that the law should be brought up to date and that the law relating to any given subject should be codified and be readily available in one Act.  I think, however, that the Title of the Bill is very misleading.  It says: &ldquo;An Act to amend the law relating to inns and innkeepers and for purposes connected with that matter&rdquo;.  I could sympathise with Senator Desmond in the points he was making, because if we were to take the Bill at its face <Col N="307" /> value, so to speak, as outlined in the Title, one would think that the Bill should deal with these matters.  However, I think that in the Dáil the Minister made it clear that it is really only a Bill to define the legal obligations of hotel-keepers to their guests and guests to their hotel-keepers.</P>
      <P>There has been some considerable discussion as to whether this Bill applies to hotels properly so called or whether it applies to hotels, guesthouses, boarding houses and private houses that keep paying guests.  From what I have read of the Dáil debates I am of the opinion that the Minister intends that the Bill should extend to establishments other than hotels, that it should extend to guesthouses or other establishments that hold themselves out as prepared to accept all comers who require sleeping accommodation, food and drink.  My own opinion is that the definition in Section 1 of this Bill will lead to endless trouble and litigation, if anybody thinks it worth his or her while to pursue the matter.  The only thing that is clear from the section is that the definition &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; includes every establishment registered in the register of hotels kept under Part III of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939.  That is the only thing which is perfectly clear in the Bill.  It would appear from the section that some other establishments other than those registered under that Act are intended to be covered by the Bill, because if that were not so the definition would merely say that &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; means every establishment registered in the register of hotels kept under Part III of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree but I am putting the Minister on notice.  I do not intend to go into it any deeper than that, but I certainly think that it is anything but clear and that the Bill badly needs to be tidied up.  It has a bearing, too, on something I shall say later on.  I entirely agree with Senator <Col N="308" /> Cole's views on Section 3 which is the section which makes it incumbent on hotel-keepers to receive guests at any time of the day or night.  As the Minister said in his opening remarks, the law relating to innkeepers goes back to the Middle Ages.  Obviously, this provision must be one of the earliest obligations ever placed on hotel-keepers by common law or otherwise.  It is obviously a provision that was intended to ensure that travellers would not be stranded in the middle of the night, in the days of slow travelling, far away from any shelter.  In the days when this rule was introduced, inns, I am sure, were few and far between. Travel was very slow.  It was quite impossible to arrange accommodation in advance unless one knew a very long time in advance that one had need to travel.  It was reasonable then, I suppose, to impose a legal obligation on inns to receive guests.  That was all in the days gone by, which were entirely different from the present time.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his opening speech made a point which, I think, supports my argument.  He said that the traveller is now a thing of the past.  One of the courts in England has apparently held the view that if you move round the corner to the local to have a drink before bed that you are a traveller, and they have in so many words abolished the definition of &ldquo;traveller&rdquo; as we know it.  I cannot see why there is any more necessity to impose an obligation on a hotel to do business, because that is what this section is doing, than to impose on, say, a draper the necessity to sell clothes.</P>
      <P>We do not impose an obligation on a solicitor to act for all clients nor do we impose an obligation on an accountant to do business for everybody who chooses to instruct him and to pay him.  Not alone are we going to impose in this Bill an obligation on hotel-keepers to receive guests, but we are going to make it a criminal offence for them to refuse to do so.  That is going very far.  It will show you how out of date the law was until the passing of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time it is an offence for a hotel-keeper to refuse to receive a guest unless he has reasonable <Col N="309" /> grounds for refusing him.  It is a very serious offence; it is an indictable offence, on which he can be returned for trial and charged before a judge and jury.  I suppose he can get penal servitude.  I do not know.  That is really absurd.  This Bill recognises the absurdity of that because it says that it will not be necessary to send a hotel-keeper for trial before a judge and jury.  He can be tried in a summary fashion before a district justice.</P>
    <P>I repeat that that is quite absurd and unnecessary because the country is now well catered for with hotels. The ordinary law of supply and demand ensures that nobody will be left out in the cold.  There is keen competition between hotels.</P>
    <P>I wish to come back for a moment to the Definition section.  It is not too clear whether this Bill merely deals with hotels which are registered under the Tourist Traffic Act or whether it deals with those establishments and with guesthouses, boarding houses, <i>et cetera</i>.  I think the probability is that it deals only with the larger hotels which hold themselves out as prepared to receive all comers. If that is so Section 3 is all the more objectionable because it means that the person who is prepared to stay in the more expensive hotel, the better class hotel, the more exclusive hotel, can insist on his right to be accepted and provided with food and drink at reasonable prices but if a man who comes up from the country to a football match wants to stay in a modestly priced guesthouse or boarding house in the city of Dublin he has no such right.  He cannot say: &ldquo;I demand to be admitted and under the law of the land you must admit me and provide food and drink at reasonable prices.&rdquo; It may be argued that he can go to one of the hotels which hold themselves out as being prepared to receive all comers but that may be out of his class and beyond his resources.  He may be put up from, say, 15/- for bed and breakfast to more than double that.  Unless the Minister can very clearly tell us before he finally asks us to pass this <Col N="310" /> Bill that Section 3 deals with hotels, guesthouses, boarding houses and every establishment of that nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not a great deal to say on this Bill and what I have to say is prompted by a few remarks which have already been made. Following what Senator Fitzpatrick has just said it seems to me strange that Irish hotels are singled out to be an industry bound by such strict regulations under the law.  In fact, it is the only trade I can think of&mdash; apart from the licensed trade which seems so <Col N="311" /> much under the eye and finger of legislation.</P>
      <P>I have always advocated consultation between the Government and relevant vocational bodies as one of the best forms of preparing and introducing legislation and in this connection I should like to ask the Minister what the hotel keepers themselves say.  I am sure that the Minister has consulted the hotel-keepers themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have and I might say that I made substantial amendments to meet their points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>If so that is as good as asking if they are satisfied.  The line I always take is that it is all right for us to argue the different points but the main thing is whether the hotel keepers who will be subject to this law are going to be satisfied.  It would be a pity that we should waste our time fighting for something they will not fight for themselves.</P>
      <P>A point just struck me when the Senator referred to rules and regulations. It deals with the workers connected with the hotel industry&mdash;they were fighting it in a big way in connection with the White Paper.  The idea of organised labour is that a lot of these things should be settled by collective bargaining.  You cannot have it both ways.  You cannot use the law to impose rules and regulations on employers if at the same time you insist that they have the right to do these things by collective bargaining.</P>
      <P>I made a speech last night at the FUE annual meeting in which I suggested the development of the system in this country of individual agreements as well as collective agreements. If that were made the system of employment all over the country it would cover not only collective bargaining on a national basis but individual agreements as in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to thank the Minister for his gracious acknowledgment of the assistance his Department got from the Council of the Law Society in the drafting of this Bill.  I assure him on behalf of the Law Society that we should be only too happy to give any assistance possible at all times on any matter regarding codification or bringing up to date our present legislation.</P>
      <P>In my view the Bill is to be commended and the Minister is to be congratulated for introducing it.  It has two important hallmarks.  It codifies the legal position and bears in mind the altered circumstances of the Bill. All the old Acts and decided cases&mdash; the whole lot are brought up to date and provision is made for the altered circumstances of today.</P>
      <P>Likewise, the Bill is another instance of our country's determination to take a part in the Europe of the future.  It enables us as a country to do something we should have been unable to do unless the Bill were passed: to be a party to the Convention of the Council of Europe.  In many respects and in many of its details the Bill follows that Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been criticisms of the Bill which at first glance would appear to be commendable.  On reconsideration, however, I doubt if they would commend themselves to the Senators who made them.  It has been suggested that the duties and the obligations placed by this Bill on the owners of hotels should likewise be imposed on the owners of guesthouses and lodging houses.  The owners of hotels, guesthouses and lodging houses in this country have been placed in a very special and privileged position, first, under the Tourist Traffic Act and their registration thereunder and, secondly, by reason of the very generous grants and loans which they have got from the State.  That privileged position must be paid for, or at least should be acknowledged to the public, and one of the obligations which hotels should undertake, particularly having regard to the generosity with which the hotels have been treated, is that they should at all times and in all reasonable manner, and un-unless <Col N="313" /> there is a justifiable excuse, provide food and lodging for all travellers requiring such.</P>
    <P>To suggest that this is an obligation which is placed on them and not on other members of the community is to suggest also that traders and other members of the community have received from the State the same privileges and the same generosity which the hotels of our country have received. Furthermore, to avoid that obligation would possibly lead to the introduction of a system which exists in other countries of an unfortunate discrimination between people because of colour bar or because of some other reason which would be objectionable to our inherent sense of the dignity of man.</P>
    <P>With regard to the boarding houses and the guesthouses which exist throughout the country, some are merely for the accommodation of people who can ill afford to pay high tariffs; for the accommodation, in many cases, of extra builders' labourers who are drafted in and who have to send home money for the support of their wives and families and for the accommodation, even in the city, of people&mdash;young boys and young girls&mdash; in moderate position with moderate incomes.  In many cases these boarding houses and guesthouses are kept by widows who thereby endeavour, through the summer months, to ameliorate their economic position and add a little to what, perhaps, is a very moderate income.  I think it would be most unreasonable to suggest that these people should be under the same obligations as hotels, and I am sure that, on reconsideration, the Senators who criticised the Bill for that reason will feel that, far from this Bill providing one law for the rich and one law for the poor, it does endeavour to facilitate everyone according to his particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill has been criticised because it imposes a paradoxical liability on hotelkeepers irrespective of contract or irrespective of negligence up to a certain moderate limit.  There is just one feature regarding that section to which I <Col N="314" /> should like to draw the Minister's attention.  The Civil Liability Act entitles the hotel to a reduction in the liability if there is any negligence on the part of the guest.  Let us take, for example, the hotel which refuses to provide, or which has lost, the keys of the various rooms, or does not provide a key for a room.  A lady is staying in that hotel and instead of locking her fur coat in the wardrobe she leaves it on the bed.  It is worth, say, £200 or £300.  The coat is stolen. First, there is a liability on the hotel for £100, which may be only one-half or possibly one-third of the value of the coat.  In the second place then the hotel should be entitled, I think, as the section stands, to argue that this lady, appreciating that she had no key for her room, should have taken her coat down to the office or should have locked it in her suitcase so as to ensure that it would not be stolen. She is thereby guilty of some contributory negligence to a fifty-fifty extent and so instead of getting £300 she would get £50 for a coat worth £300.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not work that way.  The contributory negligence would be assessed in relation to the total value of the coat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, it would meet the difficulty in that respect. I thank the Minister.  I have nothing further to say on the Bill except to express my own personal view that I feel it is a most essential piece of legislation.  It will go far towards assisting our tourist industry. It is a very welcome step&mdash;a further step I should say&mdash;in the codification of our law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should say that I fully agree with Senator Nash that this is an excellent piece of legislation. I should like at the outset to deal with the main, and possibly the only real criticism which has been made of the Bill.  That is the fact that boarding houses and guesthouses have not been brought within its scope.  To criticise the Bill on these grounds is to completely misunderstand its purpose and intention.  I want to make it clear that this is not a tourist traffic Bill. <Col N="315" /> Tourist traffic and its regulatiton is a matter for the Minister for Transport and Power and all matters of that sort and in connection with our tourist traffic fall to be regulated by and legislated for by him if necessary.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals with a particular and special legal relationship, namely, the relationship between a hotel proprietor and his guest.  In so far as the general regulation of hotels is concerned, their standards of accommodation, the prices they charge, cleanliness, hygiene, and so forth, that is a matter which falls under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Transport and Power as Minister responsible for tourism and his agent in these matters&mdash;Bord Fáilte Éireann. If hotels, boarding houses and guesthouses have to be controlled in that sense, with regard to cleanliness, standards of accommodation, and so on, this also is a matter for tourist traffic legislation and for Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be completely inappropriate to include boarding houses and guesthouses within the scope of this Bill because there is this essential difference. Boarding houses and guesthouses do not hold themselves out to receive all comers and the distinguishing characteristic of what is in this Bill, or outside it, is simply that.  If an establishment holds itself out as prepared to receive all comers it is brought within the ambit of this Bill and, incurs all the appropriate liabilities.  The normal guesthouse or boarding house does not hold itself out to receive all comers.  It is only in business to receive its own customers, people to whom it is under special contract.  If, for one moment, it sets itself up to receive all comers, it is no longer, for the purposes of this Bill, a boarding house or guesthouse.  It is a hotel and it becomes liable.  But it would be unfair to impose on the ordinary boarding house or guesthouse, which merely caters for its own guests under special contract, the liabilities which the Bill places on hotel proprietors. Most of these establishments would be unable to, and indeed should not be expected to, assume such obligations. In contrast to the views expressed by Senators, one of the principal worries which members of the Dáil had <Col N="316" /> was whether by some chance or other, the obligations and liabilities under this Bill would be imposed upon these establishments.</P>
    <P>Most of the points raised by Senators were I think more appropriate to the Committee Stage, but, perhaps I might deal with one or two specific queries which were put to me.  First of all, Senator Cole asked about private hotels.  Of course, there can be no such thing.  An establishment can only call itself a hotel if it is registered as such with Bord Fáilte.  That is laid down in the tourist traffic legislation. If a premises is so registered, then by definition it comes within the scope of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien raised the question of the loss which hotel proprietors would incur by virtue of a person making an advance booking and then not taking it up.  That is a matter which can be dealt with in two ways.  First of all, the hotel proprietor can regulate his business in such a way as to protect himself against loss, as, for example, by refusing to take bookings unless accompanied by a deposit.  Over and above that, the hotel proprietor has the same right of action against a person who is in breach of a contract in that regard, as that person would have against the hotel.  Admittedly it is a right of action which would be difficult to enforce as a rule but, nevertheless, it is there.  It is almost certain that in a large majority of cases the hotel would be entitled to sue a person who made a booking and then did not take it up.  That of course would not be a matter for this Bill. There are no provisions in this Bill in regard to that but it would be covered in what I would call the law of contract.</P>
    <P>I reject, of course, the suggestion that this is a one-sided Bill.  Several Senators have referred to the fact that we appear to put onerous obligations on hotel keepers and single them out as a particular business for the imposition of legal disabilities.  In that connection I want, first of all, to point out that the hotel business is a unique business.  It has been regarded as such down through the centuries and for a variety of reasons I think the hotel <Col N="317" /> keeper is in a very special position in relation to his guests.  People staying in a hotel are, in a peculiar way, at the mercy of the proprietor.  They are at his mercy as regards their personal convenience and safety and as regards their property, and it is illogical to compare hotel proprietors to drapers, grocers, or anybody of that nature. They are in a unique position and it is only proper and right that the law should step in and regulate and control the relationship which exists in this unique business.  As I say, it has been a tradition down through the centuries and I see no reason to alter the position.  So far as I have altered it, what I have done is to make the position of the hotel proprietor less onerous than it has been under the common law and under the various Innkeepers Acts.  I have met the hotel proprietors and have discussed the Bill with them.  I have listened to their suggestions and their problems as sympathetically as possible and have gone a fair distance to meet a number of suggestions they have put forward.</P>
    <P>Senator Cole mentioned a number of points.  May I say with respect to Senator Cole that he seems to be getting his lines crossed.</P>
    <P>On the one hand he says this Bill is placing unnecessary and onerous obligations on hotel-keepers as such and at the same time he wants to have it applied to boarding-houses and guest houses.  Surely if the Bill is onerous and unnecessary in the case of hotel keepers, who, by and large, are bigger, wealthier, and better established, it would be far more so in relation to boarding houses and guest houses?  However, I think Senator Cole may have fallen for the general line of argument which was put forward by the Senators who preceded him and that that is not really his case at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think like many a better man before him he has been misled by the Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad.  Senator Cole did refer to the case of a guest coming to a hotel with an infectious disease.  I understand <Col N="318" /> there was an old case in 1701 where it was held that such a person was entitled to be admitted, but I do not think that decision would be followed today.  In any event the position of the hotel keeper in that regard is surely protected by the Public Health regulations.  Over and above that, I think any body of reasonable men would regard as a reasonable ground for refusing admission to a hotel the fact that somebody was suffering from an infectious disease.</P>
      <P>Any other points which I think were made can be more effectively and thoroughly dealt with on the Committee Stage.  But, I want to say again that the Bill is designed to deal with a specific legal relationship and that legal relationship only comes about because certain establishments hold themselves out to receive all comers. If they do not hold themselves out they are not within the scope of the Bill&mdash;unless they are registered as hotels&mdash;and this legal relationship does not arise.</P>
      <P>There is a criterion which must be applied to them if they set themselves up to receive all comers.  If they do they automatically incur all the obligations and liabilities which the Bill imposes.  If they do not set themselves up to receive the public at large, the Bill does not apply to them and they are more or less private establishments dealing with their customers on the basis of contract.  If any provision has to be made in regard to these establishments it should be under Tourist Traffic legislation.  This particular Bill sets out, as I said, to deal with the specific legal relationship between the hotel proprietors and their guests and is not a Bill which purports to regulate tourist establishments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no such records. I shall explain why it is proposed to keep this particular criminal element in the Bill.  Generally speaking, I think the relationship between a hotel proprietor and a guest would be decided on the basis of civil law <Col N="319" /> and any action which would arise would normally be a civil action. However, it is, as I said in my opening remarks, desirable that the provisions with regard to criminal proceedings should be retained.  The State, by means of prosecution, will be able to insist that the hotel proprietors face up to their obligations and liabilities as laid down in the Bill.  One can readily think of an instance, as mentioned by Senator Nash, where there would be an attempt to establish a colour bar and it might be desirable, as a matter of social policy, to see to it that such a development did not occur in our Irish hotels.</P>

    <Title>National Gallery of Ireland Bill, 1963 &mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill relates to one matter only, the lending of works of art from the National Gallery collection.</P>
      <P>In the Act of 1854, under which the National Gallery of Ireland was established, no power was given to the Board of Governors and Guardians to make any loans from the collection. Limited powers were conferred on the Board by the National Gallery of Ireland Act, 1928.  These powers related only to lending works of art for inclusion in public exhibitions held in Ireland or abroad under the management and control of public or local authorities, or of educational institutions, or of institutions or associations founded and maintained for the promotion of art, science or literature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of extending the scope of the Board's powers in the matter of lending has been under consideration for some years.  In 1961 the Governors and Guardians recommended that they should be authorised to make loans of works of art to the official residence of the President, to the Houses of the Oireachtas, to Irish diplomatic or consular missions and <Col N="320" /> to approved Irish institutions in Ireland.  The present Bill covers all these matters.  In addition it empowers the Governors and Guardians to lend works of art for display in any other premises or property in Ireland or abroad belonging to the State or held in trust by the Commissioners of Public Works.  Without this additional provision the Governors and Guardians would not be in a position to lend works of art, for example, to the Irish pavilion at New York World's Fair if it should be thought well to display there some pictures by Irish artists or of Irish interest, nor would they be in a position to consider any display in places such as St. Stephen's Green.</P>
    <P>The Bill extends also to exhibitions which were not covered by the 1928 Act, namely exhibitions in Ireland or abroad sponsored by An Chomhairle Ealaíon, the Advisory Committee on Cultural Relations or other bodies approved of for that purpose by the Governors and Guardians.</P>
    <P>I should like to say, finally, that the additional powers for which this Bill provides in the matter of lending works of art will be exercisable by the Board of Governors and Guardians at their discretion.  In every case the final decision to make a loan will rest solely with the Governors and Guardians and it will be a matter for them to attach to each loan such conditions as they may consider necessary in the interest of security.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill appears to me to be an excellent measure, particularly in the light of what the Minister has said in conclusion.  It is entirely permissive; it preserves the authority, discretion and the judgment of the Governors and Guardians, presumably in consultation with the Director, as to whether they will issue on loan either pictures or other works of art.  The Bill, indeed, is very brief. It might, I think, have been made more brief by giving general powers to the Governors to lend works of art. I gather from the Minister that there was never power to do that before, but I can give two instances&mdash;I should not like to mention the first&mdash;where pictures were lent.  The pictures that are now in the restaurant in Leinster <Col N="321" /> House were taken from the Gallery and put up there, in conditions where files were not so regularly kept as they are now.</P>
      <P>When the Inter-Parliamentary Union met here, in 1949, I think&mdash;I happened to be Chairman of a joint committee which was dealing with the Conference &mdash;a suggestion was made that, for the purpose of entertaining these parliamentarians from various places, we might put portraits of Irish parliamentarians in this building.  The Director was consulted and he was most helpful in sending and hanging pictures from the Gallery which were exhibited in this building.  It is so near the Gallery and is so completely a public building that I suppose there were plenty of genuine reasons for that. However, the position is now regularised in that the Governors have power to lend pictures or other works of art.</P>
      <P>That would only be done, of course, when proper conditions exist with regard to housing, light and staff. Indeed, pictures in themselves do not gain by being scattered about.  They are best seen in a gallery where one school can be contrasted with another and where there can be juxtaposition. Diffusion may be democratic but the best impact of a library or a gallery is made by its being together.  One picture does not suffice, though indeed, in the case of local people who have set up a museum or picture gallery, it is entirely desirable that they should be encouraged by being given examples and, if possible, more than one example.</P>
      <P>There was some talk in the other House of a basement.  There is a basement in the National Gallery but it is only right to say that the word &ldquo;basement&rdquo; is misleading.  The pictures in the National Gallery that are not on display are on racks.  There is a register showing when they were bought, what price was paid and to whom they are attributed.  The place is well lighted and well ventilated. Much of what is in that could easily and profitably be lent in the country. When I say that, I do not mean that nothing else should be lent except pictures of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point I should <Col N="322" /> put to the Minister.  I think he said the number of attendances in 1962 was 80,000; is that correct?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>53,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Merely 53,000. The attendances at galleries in Britain and on the Continent have increased enormously in the past twenty years. That does not seem to be the case here.  I have looked at figures and, as far as I can gather, in 1887, 75,000 people attended the gallery including over 22,000 on Sunday and if the figure for last year was 53,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry; I should have said 61,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Even that is not good.  When one considers the immense population increase in Dublin between 1887 and 1962 and the transport facilities from the country to Dublin now, it would appear that the gallery is not as well attended by any means as it might be.  There is an immense increase in Britain in the number attending galleries.  That is true also on the Continent and I understand from booksellers and libraries that books on art are in greater demand than they used to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the buildings that surround us here are, I think, the result of private enterprise: the Museum by the Royal Irish Academy, the Library by the Royal Dublin Society and the National Gallery was begun to be built as a memorial to the man whose statue stands outside it&mdash;Dargan.  Up to 1899 it was under the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction and when the Government set up here in 1922 the then Minister for Agriculture &mdash;Patrick Hogan&mdash;a very direct-spoken person, came to me&mdash;I happened to be the Minister for Education&mdash;to say that he had just discovered the National Gallery, the National Library and the National Museum were under the Department of Agriculture; that he had enough to do without bothering about them and that they should be under the Department of Education. He proposed, in so far as it was legally possible, that decisions about them should be made by the Minister for Education and if his signature were <Col N="323" /> necessary he was prepared to sign anything the Minister for Education put up to him.  That was my first acquaintance with them from the formal point of view, but I think it is worth saying with regard to the National Gallery that when the Act of 1899&mdash;a British Act for Agriculture and Technical Instruction&mdash;was passed and when taken in conjunction with the Local Government of Ireland Act in the previous year, it marked the beginning of the exit of the British from administration in this country.</P>
    <P>There is one other minor point, which does not concern the Minister, but he may use his good offices in regard to it.  Up to 1922 there was a passage from the National Library and the School of Art right through to the National Gallery right into the whole of Leinster Lawn which was then open to the public.  In the circumstances of the Civil War that particular passage was closed.  It is not for me or for the Minister to say whether the military guard should be retained here, but I understand the reason for not opening the passage is that certain accommodation for the military has been found necessary.  I would suggest that it would add considerably to the use of the National Gallery and would assist visitors to it if by any process, say a railing right along through Leinster Lawn, a passage from Kildare Street to Merrion Square, were made available.  The passage from the National Library and the School of Art to the National Gallery should be restored.</P>
    <P>Perhaps students, too, are now deprived of access to the Gallery. Students of the School of Art have to go right around via Kildare Street and Merrion Street instead of a few hundred yards.  A number of people call to the School of Art in the belief that they are at the National Gallery which, of course, is not so.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could use his influence to improve that situation.  I have no doubt at all that restoration of the right-of-way would increase the number of visitors to the Gallery.  The retention of the military is a matter of Government policy and I express no <Col N="324" /> view on it.  A new building is being erected and, perhaps, accommodation could be found for the military in that new building.  In that case it would be of great advantage to the citizens of Dublin generally, the Gallery, the Library and students if access could be granted again as it used to exist more than 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>I should like to end as I began by saying the Bill is an excellent one, and I am sure the Governors and Directors will use the power given to them in the best possible way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill extends the use of some very valuable and very lovely treasures.  In fact, some of the most valuable things in this whole country are in the National Gallery, just a few hundred yards from here. It is a store house of treasures that attracts visitors from all over the world, and inquiries, too, from all over the world.  Everyone in Ireland has, I think, good reason to be grateful to those who formed this magnificent collection.  For a very brief moment here I venture to say perhaps an unpopular word for the body of people who did so much to bring treasures into our city.  Most of those people are now beyond any censure or praise.  I refer to those who were called, and are called, the Old Ascendancy.  Whatever we may think of some of their thoughts and opinions, varying a good deal, we must admit that they did enrich and beautify our country in their own way.  Most of our museums, most of our treasures of art and antiquity, were established or collected by them. Senator Hayes referred to this magnificent group of buildings at the centre of which is Leinster House.  As he said, they were largely due to, again, people who at that time were the old Ascendancy&mdash;the Royal Irish Academy, the Royal Dublin Society and others of the kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that at all.  Dargan, in whose memory the National Gallery was built was, I think the son of a small farmer from the County Kildare, and I think he could be described as everything else except a member of the Ascendancy.  Dargan was certainly different, though perhaps the Ascendancy had their merits too.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that many of those who subscribed to it and who gave pictures to the National Gallery belonged to that much maligned body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the Royal Dublin Society, it was founded by two graduates of Trinity College, and I think it would be fair for us to say here that they took over the tradition of Grattan's Parliament.  Grattan's Parliament did try to enrich the architectural and artistic treasures of Ireland. When it was abolished by the ill famed Act of Union I think in many ways the Royal Dublin Society stepped into its place, so far as they could, and we owe a great deal to them.  This is not a line which I intend to follow any further, except to offer one more illustration.  As I was reading through the debates in the Dáil on this Bill I came across a statement in a very able speech made by Deputy A. Barry.  This is what he said at column 1097 of Volume 199: &ldquo;It is understandable how they have come to be there&rdquo;&mdash;he was referring to the art treasures&mdash;&ldquo;Dublin was the capital city and was and is the seat of government and did inherit a Patrician tradition.&rdquo;  Now, the word Patrician is spelt with a capital &ldquo;P&rdquo; in the Official Debate.  We, in the classical schools of Trinity College and the National University and elsewhere are trained in what is called textual criticism.  Here it seems to be perfectly clear from the context that what was intended was patrician with a small &ldquo;p&rdquo;.  I simply refer to that fact because it brings out the point I want to make.  We have in Ireland of course the Patrician tradition with a capital &ldquo;P&rdquo;, going back to Saint Patrick and the original civilisers of Ireland.  But we also have, and I like to emphasise that, another tradition, a patrician tradition with a small &ldquo;p&rdquo; and we have it all round us in our city here, and it was the patricians <Col N="326" /> of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries who gave us much of what we are talking about here this evening.  I feel it is no harm occasionally to say that kind of thing in the Oireachtas of this country because generally references to the people to whom I have been referring tend to be derogatory.  To turn to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The native Irish made their contribution to the Ascendancy. They were compelled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course: that is the very point I wish to make by referring to the Patrician tradition in both senses.  I hope we may agree on that point.  Now, to turn to the National Gallery.  It is, of course, one of the great glories of our Nation, thanks to its magnificent treasures. What we are all conscious of here is that these treasures could be much more fully used.  In recent years the Gallery has been lamentably understaffed. If we look at the estimates for the current year we will find just how many trained people are there to look after these splendid treasures. The answer is two.  There is the director and an assistant&mdash;not another single person who is trained in the history and technique of art.  I believe it is only within the last few years&mdash; two or three years even&mdash;that an assistant has been brought in.  I believe it is only in the last couple of years that a typist has been brought in.  Now, imagine one of the best galleries on a small scale in Europe being staffed by one director and one assistant.  In contrast, the National Museum, which itself is sadly understaffed, has a director, three keepers, three assistant keepers and nine assistants. I suggest that this is a deplorable contrast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all value our museum very highly, but we should also value our art gallery more highly than at present. It is partly a matter of money, too.  The amount of money spent on these magnificent treasures last year, in keeping them and so on, was £15,130.  Now, I have looked at the British estimates for their care of their national galleries and I find that they spent <Col N="327" /> £525,000 altogether.  That was in looking after the National Gallery in London, the National Portrait Gallery, the Tate Gallery, the Wallace Gallery and the National Galleries of Scotland. Let us compare those two figures. The British spend £525,000 for a population of approximately 51,000,000. We spend £15,000 for a population of less than three million.  It seems to me, then, by fairly simple arithmetic &mdash;but I am liable to go wrong in these things, I confess&mdash;that while the British are spending just £10,000 per million people on art, we are spending just a little over £5,000 per million people on art.  In proportion to the population we are spending half the amount that the British Government are spending.  The obvious answer, which I am sure is rushing through the Minister's head at this moment, is that Britain is a rich country in many ways and we are a poor country in many ways.  But we are not a poor country in art.  We are not a poor country in culture, whether Patrician with a capital P or patrician with a small p, and I think that since we are not poor in those special respects we ought to spend proportionately more on art than perhaps even Britain spends. Secondly, if you take into account the fact that we spend very little on defence compared with the colossal expenditure that Britain spends on defence I think we should be able to afford more than £5,000 per million of the population on art.  I could urge this more strongly, but I do not think it is necessary.  I hope everyone here is conscious that one of the great strengths of our country&mdash;it is part of our moral strength&mdash;is this tradition of high art.  If you walk into the National Museum and look at the gold ornaments and the sculpture there, just as much as if you walk into the National Gallery, you can see it proved.  I do not think that it is justifiable for us to neglect our artistic traditions to this extent.</P>
    <P>Now, to turn to the present Bill.  It goes a little way towards using our treasures of art more fully.  But, let us consider for a moment how many other ways are open to us, or would be open to us if we spent a little more <Col N="328" /> money.  The National Gallery could, and should, if it had the staff, organise many special exhibitions.  It has not done that at all in recent years.  In contrast, the Municipal Gallery has done wonderful work in recent years along those lines.  If the Municipal Gallery can do it then the National Gallery could do it with a little more State expenditure.</P>
    <P>Secondly&mdash;this has been referred to already in the Dáil&mdash;there is a crying need for better catalogues from the National Gallery.  I will not spend time over this.  It was debated in the Dáil, but I do want to emphasise a point which was raised there.  At the moment in this country we have some very fine printers, and some very good work is being done.  It would be a great opportunity for our Irish printing firms to have the chance of producing a really good illustrated catalogue or even a selection of our paintings in the National Gallery.</P>
    <P>The third point is this.  Here are these treasures, these wonderful treasures, lying unseen except by some 60,000 of our population all the year round.  Why do we not have wider publicity for them?  Again, this was mentioned in the Dáil.  Telefís Éireann and the other centres of national publicity should do much more for the National Gallery.  The fourth point is that there is clear need for greater space, more room for storage and more room for display.  A fifth point, and this is one perhaps which will be most readily accepted in this scientific age, is that we need far more scientific assistance in looking after our national treasures and in particular our paintings.</P>
    <P>Just contrast for a moment the position in the British Museum or in the National Gallery of London. There they have highly trained experts, skilled in cleaning and examining.  In the British Museum at the moment one of the heads of that team is a graduate from Dublin.  He has described the work to me; it is most important and most valuable.  In fact, if any member of the House would like to see a clear proof of the value of that kind of work, he can look at the <i>Illustrated London News</i> for last week.  There <Col N="329" /> he will find the Ardagh Chalice and the Tara Brooch, as they are now, after having been cleaned and repaired by the experts in the British Museum. It is a magnificent thing to see them there, even in photographs.  When they come back to our Museum I hope we will all go and see them, restored almost to a new condition.  It is a sad thing that we have to send treasures out of our country for that kind of treatment.  It may be that we will always have to do it for very special cases, and the Ardagh Chalice and the Tara Brooch are cases of that kind.  However, the fact is that at the moment we can do nothing in the National Gallery from the higher scientific point of view.  There is no scientist attached to it; the work is being done elsewhere.  Again I do think there is need for progress along those lines.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal more that can be said on that, but I shall not delay the House.  I do urge the Minister to do all he can to make more use of these magnificent treasures.  The primary need is staffing.  We have the goods; we cannot display them properly; we cannot even handle them properly.  Here, I should like to ask him a question.  We are all very grateful to the Shaw Bequest&mdash;and to the producers of <i>My Fair Lady</i> incidentally, too&mdash;for the amount of money that is put at the disposal of the trustees of the National Gallery.  Is it not possible that some of that money could be spent on staffing?</P>

      <P>The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo; I take it.  It cannot be spent on staffing.  Then I think the Government are morally bound, since they are saving a great deal of money that they would normally spend on buying pictures&mdash;since they are saving that on the Shaw Bequest&mdash;to pay more for staffing.  The total amount spent on the maintenance and acquisition of pictures last year was only £2,500, largely because of the Shaw Bequest, presumably.  I do think there is a moral obligation to spend more money on the staffing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes referred to the <Col N="330" /> pictures in Leinster House.  We all, I believe, hope that this House will be greatly enriched by loans from the National Gallery.  The House was designed to have pictures on the walls. They are enormously valuable as historical lessons.  I bring a good many people into the House to admire it, and the few pictures we have are very helpful merely as talking points.  You can stop there and bring home to them episodes in our history that you cannot do unless there is some actual talking point.</P>
    <P>Personally, it is a great source of gratification to me and perhaps to one other person present here this evening that out of six portraits in the House two, I think, are of graduates of the National Unitversity, two were members of Trinity College, Dublin, that is Emmet and Tone in the vestibule here, and two belong to what is often very rightly called &ldquo;the university of the world.&rdquo;  I think Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins, if I am not mistaken, were of &ldquo;the university of the world.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Similarly, in the Dáil Chamber at this moment, the rather heated discussion that may be going on is being calmly surveyed by two bronze heads, one a graduate of the Catholic University, Pádraig Pearse; the other, I am glad to say, a graduate of Dublin University, Thomas Davis.  Here, I should like to thank the anonymous person who had the magnanimity to set in the Chamber of our National Parliament a TCD man beside a UCD man.  It is a symbol, I hope, of something that we want to do&mdash;this cooperation, this working together of the best we can produce in the country.</P>
    <P>Whenever I show people round the Dáil Chamber, when there is not a debate on, I stop in front of Pádraig Pearse and Thomas Davis.  I tell these visitors from England, or Greece, or wherever they come from, that I, personally, as a TCD man, am very grateful that we, as well as University College, have a permanent representative, so to speak, in the Dáil, even though our electoral representation has been abolished.</P>
    <P>I must not go on further, but I do want to emphasise that these treasures <Col N="331" /> need to be used more fully and freely. I appeal very strongly to the Minister, as Minister for Education, to do all he can to go on further from this Bill so that all the treasures we have may be more fully at the disposal of our own citizens and of the citizens of the world who do want to see them.</P>

      <P>Senator Stanford covered all the real points that can be made about the National Gallery.  I am slightly tongue-tied here.  I happen to be Vice-Chairman of the Board of this Gallery.  I think I am permitted to say certain things such as how much this Bill is welcomed and how much it is necessary.  Pictures were made to be seen and not to be hidden away, and not only not to be hidden away in cellars but to be even confined to one place where they are all cluttered up, not properly shown and not properly available.  Therefore, this legislation is absolutely necessary in order to give the Board of Governors power to hold these treasures&mdash;and they are all treasures; even the ones in the cellars&mdash;because we must remember that no picture gets into the National Gallery unless under the scrutiny of the Director and with the approval of the Board.  Every picture there, even the most insignificant one, has at least come under the scrutiny of people who are qualified to judge pictures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, pictures at any time, except some picture that has stood the test of time, can be the subject of fashion and taste changes at different times so that pictures which were at one time regarded with great esteem are later on rather despised.  It has often been shown that the pictures despised at one particular period in the course of fashion later on came to be recognised.  That has happened <Col N="332" /> many times.  For instance in connection with the pictures in the cellars of the National Gallery, before this legislation came in giving the Governors the power to lend them at a very wide discretion people often asked why the gallery was not allowed to sell these pictures and buy other ones: that they are no good and were cluttered up.  I even heard it said by such esteemed people as directors because at a particular time some pictures were out of fashion, such as those by Landseer, who was a great 19th century painter.  Until quite recently his pictures were completely discredited.  This has now been changed and he is coming into favour again.  For that reason it was very wise that power was never given to the Gallery to sell any of its pictures. The correct way to deal with the matter, if we have a lot of pictures in our cellars in the Gallery, is to enable the Gallery to lend those pictures out to all the places enumerated in the Bill which really means the Governors can lend the pictures anywhere at their discretion.</P>
    <P>In the past it did not seem sensible that we could not even lend pictures to the President's Residence&mdash;Arus an Uachtaráin&mdash;or to this House.  I have many times tried to get some pictures on loan for this Chamber.  Over the mantelpiece is an obvious place for either portraits or landscapes by George Barrett, our 18th century landscape painter.  All that has been changed now and under this legislation power is given to distribute pictures to places where more people will see them, not only in this country but even in our Embassies abroad where they can do credit to Ireland and show people the kind of things we have and with which we live.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford referred to this question of special exhibitions.  That is a subject which I think should really receive attention.  If pictures are enabled to be distributed now it will leave more space in the Gallery itself for the pictures which are chosen to remain there.  In that way we may arrive at a situation where there will be space for special exhibitions especially having regard to the new buildings <Col N="333" /> which are contemplated at the moment.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the great numbers who go to museums and galleries in England, in Italy and other countries is because attention has been drawn to their collections through special exhibitions.  They are a well-known feature now in museum life in England and all over the Continent and America.  You will remember the Picasso Exhibition in the Tate Gallery some years ago which drew thousands if not millions.  We hope that in the future we will be able to have these special exhibitions, especially in view of the fact that we very often in Ireland lend some of our greatest masterpieces to these exhibitions in other countries.  Last year we lent our Matenga to Mantua.  This is a picture of world importance.  We lend pictures to Burlington House over and over again for all the current exhibitions that go on year after year, 18th century English paintings or whatever it may be, but we have never been in a position to ask them back. One of the conditions under which we are working now&mdash;and which this new Bill replaces&mdash;is that we could only lend to public exhibitions and to people who were in a position to lend us back.  I cannot recollect over a great many years any occasion on which we had pictures back in exchange merely because we did not run exhibitions here for one reason or another.  Space was supposed to be one reason.  Another was lack of staff. It was said that we had not sufficient staff to handle exhibitions of that kind. As well as that it was said that we had not sufficient money.  We have not solved this question of staff and sufficient money yet.  But perhaps that will come in time.  I must say there has recently been a very great improvement in the staffing situation in the National Gallery.  Steps have been taken to improve both the number and the quality of the staff coming in there. We trust this will be a feature that will continue in the direction of giving us full staff.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons the Gallery is not open on Saturday afternoons is because of the necessity for giving the existing staff their half-day.  It may <Col N="334" /> seem at first sight that Saturday was a funny day to choose to close the Gallery because it is a day on which many people have their half-holiday, but, rather surprisingly, on examining the attendance figures, when the Gallery was open every day in the week, it was found that the lowest attendance was on Saturday afternoons. I hope that in the future it will not be necessary to close on Saturday afternoons if there is sufficient staff to carry on right through every day in the week.</P>
    <P>I do not want to give a long dissertation on the National Gallery except to make these general remarks. I think we seldom get an opportunity of talking about this Gallery of ours or of saying that it contains some of the finest pictures in the world.  At a time when pictures and old masters were plentiful and cheap and only few people understood fine things we were fortunate in having directors in our Gallery of the calibre of Sir Hugh Lane, Professor Bodkin and others. These were people who picked up pictures at a time when they saw the quality in those works of art and were able to buy them at low prices, which today would be out of the question. For instance, the portrait of Mr. King by Gainsborough was bought by Sir Hugh Lane for £400.  Today it would we worth £25,000 or £30,000 if it came on the market.  We have one from the Italian school and a very great Dutch painting, all of which were bought for comparatively small sums of money.  Therefore, we, as a comparatively poor country today, have inherited something which cannot even be bought by countries which can be called millionaire countries.  These things just do not exist.</P>
    <P>It is a happy thing that we are now in a position of not only having these pictures and works of art generally stored away in one place in Dublin but, as Senator Hayes says, they have become less accessible than they were 40 years ago.  I remember walking through this passage from Kildare Street into Merrion Square.  It was used by many Dubliners, not only going from one place to the other but going to the National Library itself. <Col N="335" /> I think it was a pity it was closed because often day after day at the gate of Leinster House here I have met people looking for the National Gallery and the man there has to tell them how to go down Kildare Street and up Merrion Street and a lot of them just give up.  It would be very important to have that passage reopened.</P>
    <P>I must say how wise and necessary this Bill is and I know from my experience with my colleagues on the Board that it will be well and usefully used.  Now that we have got this freedom to act, I hope it will be freely used and with discretion and due care for the preservation of the pictures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also should like to add my voice to the voices of those who have welcomed this Bill.  I do think it is a very important provision, for two reasons.  First, it will make outstanding works of art available for viewing to more people in our own country by allowing them to be displayed in various buildings and also it will make these paintings available to people abroad.  These reasons are most important.  I think the second reason is the more important aspect because we are at a stage in our history where we have to build up the prestige of the country in the eyes of the world.  If one goes abroad to conferences one often observes that people have a very strange picture of the citizens of this country.  Many people think we are still in a cave drawing stage and it is important to bring to the notice of the people of other nations that we have these very important treasures here in Ireland, works by Irishmen and works created by Irishmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important to create a good image of our country throughout the world.  On one occasion at a World Confederation of Teachers' Organisations, in Amsterdam all the delegates were brought to the Town Hall to the reception by the Burgomaster and saw on the walls of that building, some of the finest paintings in the world. Really, it was an eye-opener to every delegate.  It really put the Netherlands right before people from practically <Col N="336" /> every country throughout the world, people who could pass on the information to their fellow citizens, and the pupils, especially.  It had been of value to everybody who visited that Town Hall.  It is very important that when receptions might be arranged here in this country at the Department of External Affairs, Iveagh House, Dublin Castle, that the finest works of art would be made available for such receptions so that these paintings would be seen by people from overseas.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should create the best possible image of our people in the eyes of the world at the present time so that we might to some extent destroy the ideas which people have of us abroad.  Speaking to delegates from Canada and even from Britain, they are amazed very often to learn that the finest writers of English were Irishmen&mdash;Shaw, Brinsley Sheridan, Yeats, Wilde, Goldsmith and many others.  Similarly, many people have peculiar ideas of our capacity to create in the realm of art.  It is important that these wonderful paintings should be made available to the world in general and to our own people here so that greater interest might be taken in art generally.</P>

      <P>There are just a few points I should like to get clear.  I note from the Minister's statement that he said the final decision rests with the governors and guardians in regard to lending the works of art to any place. Throughout the country there are a number of vocational committees which may have galleries.  If they require to get works of art a question of finance is involved.  For instance, Cork has a School of Art and also has an Art Gallery but the committees in charge would have no funds for dealing with a matter of this kind.  I understand that there are certain finances.  For instance, there is a substantial sum of money in the Shaw bequest.  In the event of places such as I have mentioned being loaned the pictures, the works of art&mdash;it is bound to cost a considerable sum of money&mdash; would the governors and guardians who are in charge of this be prepared to use some of the funds to get the works of art to such places where they have art galleries?  If that was done it would be of immense benefit, otherwise I do not know how we could get the pictures to various important centres where accommodation and art galleries are available.  I would like to see something done in that direction from the point of view of finance <Col N="338" /> because, locally, there is no finance to deal with a matter of that kind.</P>

      <P>Ar dtúis báire, ba mhaith liom a rá go n-aontaíom leis An Seabhach gurab é an slí is fearr chun cúrsaí ealaíona a thabhairt do dhaoine óga ná leigint dóibh na seoda atá againn sa gailéirí a fheiscint ar fúd na tíre agus tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh sé sin as an Bhille seo atá againn.  Táim ana-shásta a chloisint ón Seanadóir Magh Uidhir go mbeidh an Bord sásta gach úsáid a bhaint as an Bhille seo.</P>
      <P>The discussion has got a little away from this Bill which is <i>ad hoc</i> to deal with the lending of pictures, but since it did go away from that I should like to say I agree that the best way of raising the cultural tastes of our young people and promoting a further interest in matters artistic, and, perhaps, developing the natural artistic talents which must lie in our young people, is to let them see works of art.  While the Seabhac is quite right in saying that our national pride would be well served by showing the national treasures, I think works of art from any country of a high standard on exhibition throughout the country can do only good and must be of a high educational value.  Many of the matters raised by Senator Stanford would be matters which should be initiated by the board of governors and guardians in the first instance.  While I would not like to comment on what they should do, I would say that their recommendations are always received with full sympathy by the Ministers for Education and Finance.  Senator McGuire mentioned that the staffing situation has been improved recently. I might say that the wider questions which arise, apart from what this Bill is intended to deal with, are being considered by an interdepartmental committee which will report to the Taoiseach in due time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if there is any particular question that needs answering. There is a building programme in development at the moment which may cost £300,000.  As for the popularity of the Gallery, I do not know whether they had turnstiles in the far off period of 1887.  Perhaps <Col N="339" /> they over-estimated the numbers coming in.  We have turnstiles now so we will have to stick by exactly what we count.  The reason for the drop may be that there are other attractions now for public entertainment and, indeed, what is helping the Gallery in one way may be taking away in another.  The type of entertainment from which the last windfall came to the Gallery was Shaw's <i>Pygmalion</i> and the musical arising from it.  I do not think there is any drop in the interest of people in the Gallery except that they are attracted, perhaps, to other places.  There is quite an interest among people, such as teachers, who conduct educational tours in the Gallery and in the Museum.</P>
    <P>I doubt if there would be enough work of a highly scientific nature in the Museum to warrant the appointment of a scientist for the type of work referred to&mdash;the work which has been done on the Ardagh Chalice and other treasures.  It was not just a matter of cleaning it; it was a matter of repair and study.</P>
    <P>I understand that a good deal of new information has been discovered about this.  I doubt if it would be worthwhile for us to have a person capable of doing this but, at the same time, we must be very grateful to the people in London who have done the work for us.</P>
