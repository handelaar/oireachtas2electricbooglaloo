    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to increase the limit imposed by the Irish Steel Holdings Limited Act 1960 on the acquisition of shares in the company by the Minister for Finance from £4 million to £6 million, and on the guarantee by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the repayment of moneys borrowed by the company from £500,000 to £1,000,000.</P>
      <P>Senators will, no doubt, recollect that during the debate leading to the enactment of the Irish Steel Holdings Limited Act, 1960, I said that it was expected that the total cost of the work necessary for the implementation of the company's development and expansion programme would be of the order of £3½ million.  During the course of the work, however, unforeseen circumstances have arisen and the cost of the development works is now estimated by the company at £5,020,000, of which they will provide £131,268 from their own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="700" /> The factors contributing to the increase can be broadly classified as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  As the works progressed it was discovered that the subterranean conditions were very bad and more and deeper excavation was found to be necessary, and the foundations on which the new machinery was to be mounted had to be greater and more complex than originally foreseen.  These foundations are, of course, an essential part of the development programme and could not be curtailed.</P>
    <P>(2)  Wage increases granted to the building and allied trades since 1959 increased civil engineering costs.</P>
    <P>(3)  Certain additions and extensions were found necessary to provide for improved efficiency and economy of operation.</P>
    <P>(4)  The company were unable to recruit the number of skilled Irish tradesmen required, and in consequence they were forced to utilise the services of a considerably greater number of foreign technicians at increased cost.</P>
    <P>(5)  The revaluation of the Deutschmark in March, 1961, further increased the cost of certain subcontracts.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is necessary that a further £250,000 be provided for working capital in the exceptional period between the installation of the plant and its coming into full commercial operation.  Certain parts of the new plant are undergoing protracted tests, and this will occur as each unit of the new mills is installed.  In addition, certain teething troubles are to be envisaged.  The cost of material and labour on this unproductive but necessary development work is accepted as a commissioning cost which should properly be provided out of capital.</P>
    <P>The sum of £6 million includes provision of a reserve of £750,000.  This provision is being made in case the advance of free trade should lead to proposals for adaptation of the works to fit into an economic framework wider than, and different from, that at present envisaged.  This money is not committed to any purpose, and none <Col N="701" /> of it can be used until a fully detailed plan involving its use has prior examination and approval by the Government.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed that the limit of £500,000 imposed by the 1960 Act on guaranteed borrowings by the company should be increased to £1 million. When the figure of £500,000 was fixed in the earlier Act, it was in mind that this figure would be additional to the then existing limit of £300,000, guaranteed under the State Guarantees Act. The legal position is, however, that the total guaranteed borrowings under the 1960 Act are limited to £500,000, which is insufficient to provide working capital for the extended operations of the Company.  A margin is also required to cover, temporarily, further plant extensions, if such should prove necessary, in the event of free trade conditions arising, either by reason of our joining the European Coal and Steel Community or otherwise.</P>
    <P>In this connection the company were asked to examine their possibilities in free trade conditions and have stated that they are satisfied that it was essential to press on with their plan to expand but that in free trade conditions it might be necessary to rationalise or specialise to a greater degree than is now visualised.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, a matter of concern to me that the original estimate should have been so far short of eventual requirements and I can assure the House that every possibility of confining expenditure to the original estimate has been thoroughly explored. I have gone even to the extent of considering the possibility of curtailment of the development scheme.  I was satisfied, however, that this course was not practicable.  It is clear that Irish Steel Holdings Limited are in business in a highly competitive field and the viability of the company, and the security of the employment of their labour force of some 700 workers, can be assured only if their operations can be carried on at the highest level of efficiency.  The development works now in progress are designed to bring about this position.</P>
    <P>I have also satisfied myself that all <Col N="702" /> reasonable steps were taken by the Company throughout to obtain the best advice available and to endeayour to keep expenditure as close as possible to the estimate.  It has proved that they were exceptionally, and un-foreseeably, unlucky in regard to foundation conditions which could not be examined beforehand.  This is a hazard of large-scale foundation work, particularly in conditions, as here, where the site concerned was occupied by existing heavy plant which had to be maintained in operation to the latest possible moment, in order to minimise interruption of output.</P>
    <P>The other factors of wage increases, labour shortage and currency revaluation were equally unforeseeable.</P>
    <P>As regards the modifications of the original plans, these arose under various heads: it was hoped to use certain existing electrical equipment, but this proved to be impossible; the steel-making department buildings were strengthened to make them suitable for handling hot metal, as the future availability of this material has come to be considered possible; some additional electrical equipment was provided to cope with extra mechanisation which was considered desirable. The company's basic plans, as approved by the Government and described to the House, are unchanged.</P>
    <P>While the House, like the Government, will be concerned at the large increases in the cost of these works, I am sure it will be agreed that there is no practical alternative to completing the developments as planned.  I believe that the proposal to continue the development of this nationally important industry even at the increased costs will meet with the same general welcome in this House as it did in the Dáil.  I confidently, therefore, seek the approval of the House for the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the kind of Bill about which it is very difficult to speak.  It involves the employment of a certain number of people and the argument is always used that if the State does not go further than it has gone already, that employment will be imperilled.  It seems to me at the same time that we should give the matter <Col N="703" /> more consideration than it apparently has got.  What is happening is that a private company was taken over a few years ago with permission to invest £4 million of public money in it.  Now after three years the Minister desires to increase that amount by 50 per cent from £4 million to £6 million and to increase the guarantee on the part of the Government from £500,000 to £1 million, that is, to increase the possible amount of investment by 50 per cent and to double the guarantee for loans which the company may be successful in getting elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Does the additional expenditure in a State company make this company capable of surviving?  The Minister's speech was very carefully drafted and his answers to questions in the other House were very careful also.  I hope he will forgive me for saying that it seems to me from having read them that he is himself by no means convinced that what he is doing now will, in fact, make the company capable of surviving. For example, a certain amount of money, £3½ million, was first invested and it was said that certain subterranean borings and experiments could not be carried out to make sure that there was a proper foundation for the factory, but an unskilled person like myself certainly would come to the conclusion that if private people were investing £3½ million in something, they would find a method of getting engineers to tell them whether the foundations of their factory were sound or not.</P>
      <P>One of the Minister's arguments is that it is necessary to put the company into a position that would fit into a free trade framework.  That is something we do not really know much about.  I wonder is this company capable of surviving in a free trade framework.  For example, has it ever paid dividends?  What percentage of its production is exported? What provision is made for paying interest on the money that has been invested? Is there any provision for repayment of capital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I say that, I am not from the point of view of doctrine or <Col N="704" /> philosophy opposed to State enterprise. I entirely agree that there are certain things in this country which will not be developed by private enterprise and which should be developed by public enterprise.  There are some people who are now in favour of public enterprise as opposed to private enterprise.  If we get many more examples like the present one the very idea of public enterprise may become very distasteful.  If we invest a certain number of millions of money in public enterprise and after a couple of years we find that we have to increase the amount by 50 per cent, the whole idea of public enterprise will suffer considerably.  If State enterprises such as this are in preparation, and if it is proved that it is more and more costly and less and less remunerative, the whole idea of State enterprise will suffer considerably.  Those who advocate it should remember that.</P>
    <P>I should like to see State enterprise being successful.  The desirability of this kind of thing is undeniable; to me, the desirability of giving employment, and particularly to men, is undeniable, but I do not think we are quite clear&mdash;and I doubt if the Minister is quite clear&mdash;whether this kind of thing is business enterprise or social service.  If you are going to invest millions of public money merely for the purpose of giving employment, you will always be in the position which we find in more than one enterprise already that at a certain point you are confronted with the dilemma that if you do not spend more money, people will be put out of employment, a situation which no one contemplates calmly.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if you have enthusiasm for public enterprise and a loose investment of public money in State enterprise without a cold examination of the facts and without sufficient preparation, that will be harmful in the end to the whole idea of State investment.  I do not know whether the Minister can tell us if any dividends have been paid.  Am I correct in saying that the Minister stated that only three per cent of the company's products are exported?  Is that correct?</P>
    <Col N="705" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I hazarded that as a guess in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  For example, how does the price of the product compare with the price in other very large companies?  I am unskilled in this matter but I know&mdash; and I suppose everyone knows&mdash;that we may possibly be in a combination with Britain and other countries. Britain has immense steel companies with immense resources and great experience and, I presume, with low production costs.  I wonder how this company compares with them?  I wonder has it paid any dividend?  I wonder when we invested this money in the company was any provision made for interest on it, or for repayment of capital?</P>
      <P>I say that not as a hard-faced businessman, which I am very far from being, but because it seems to me that if State enterprise of this kind cannot be made more remunerative than this appears to be, the whole notion of investing public money in this way will become repugnant to a great many people, including some people who are by no means opposed to it at the moment.  The Minister might clear up that point for us.  When you begin that kind of thing there does not seem to be any end to it. You lose the money you have already invested if you do not go on.  It seems to me that we are not quite clear in our minds as to the difference between business enterprise and a social service.  Perhaps the Minister could clear that up for us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place, I should like to say that in a matter like this I am not persuaded in any way by ideologies.  As I said before, I am a supporter of State enterprise only in circumstances in which private enterprise is unwilling or unable to undertake certain necessary economic tasks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this is a case in point.  In this case private enterprise was in possession of the steel producing plant in Haulbowline for many years.  The State, seeing first of all the necessity and, secondly, the opportunity for State enterprise in steel purchased that plant at a very low price.  It set <Col N="706" /> up a company and financed them by way of guaranteed borrowing.  In other words, the company themselves did the borrowing under State guarantee.  That was some 15 years ago and ever since, the company have been making progress, albeit they first of all concentrated on the home market and then succeeded in getting export outlets.  I am told that the percentage I gave in the Dáil is about the extent of their exports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is three per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>With the reasonable degree of success the company attained they were able to repay borrowings and make certain profits which it put to reserves.  It was coming to the point when, with the limited resources and equipment they had in Haulbowline, there was a danger that, unless there was an injection of new capital and pretty major re-equipment, the industry would not survive. Senators will remember that in 1958 in the White Paper on economic development this was one of the ventures which it was suggested could be worth while as a State investment from every point of view.  In the first place, we have very very few basic industries in this country.</P>
      <P>There are certainly very few basic engineering industries.  We have always been bemoaning the fact that we have none of these basic industries from which private enterprise industries might flow.  This is one of those basic industries which the Government think it very desirable to have.  It was for that reason that the project was included in the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and that the £4 million, which was provided three years ago, was put into the industry.  There is no question of paying any dividend yet on that £4 million because, while it is share capital subscribed by the Minister for Finance, the development programme is still under way and it will be some time before that programme is completed and some further time before the company can make any profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I came to the House on the last occasion asking for the £4 million <Col N="707" /> for investment by the Minister for Finance, I mentioned that the company themselves were able to put up some £90,000 out of their profits.  It is indicative of their progress that they have been able to increase that contribution out of their profits by up to 50 per cent notwithstanding that there has been a huge excavation operation going on in Haulbowline. Haulbowline is an island of rather limited space and it is occupied by the Naval Service.  In order to carry out this re-equipment and development programme it was necessary to interrupt current production but it was sought to interrupt it only to the least possible extent so that I think it was a good achievement on the part of the company that they were able to keep going and even able to make money to the extent of increasing their investment, moderate though it may be, by up to 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Senator asked what provision there was for repayment of capital.  I think what I said answers that.  It is investment of share capital by the Minister for Finance.  As to costs, it is difficult at any time to say how the costs in a particular industry compare with the costs in another industry in the steel business because, as Senators know, most steel concerns on the Continent and throughout the world have a dual pricing system: a somewhat higher price for home markets and a lesser price for export markets. As I said in the Dáil, I asked Irish Steel Holdings to make a survey of how their prices compare with the Common Market countries and the answer they gave me was that their prices are higher than the lowest Common Market home prices and lower than the highest prices in the Common Market countries.  I would not attempt to deny either that the price of steel products, mild steel bars and angles as they are produced now, and galvanised sheet is somewhat higher than could be imported from abroad.  Again, one would not be very sure whether our home consumers would be able to do much better if they had access freely to foreign markets and if there were no steel producing plant in this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> We all know that those big cartels which are prevalent in steel and for investment by the Minister for fertilisers, in connection with which I was here recently, can manipulate prices to suit their own production and to suit the kind of competition they might have to face in particular countries.  I am not making any charge against any of the people who export steel to this country but I think we are businessmen enough to know that if there is not a steel plant in this country the tendency might be to increase import prices.  As far as expansion is concerned, as I said, the stage has been reached when not to invest more capital, not to provide more equipment and not to expand production in the Haulbowline Steel Mills would mean that it would not be competitive in the freer trade conditions towards which we are moving. Therefore, the decision had to be taken either to increase the capital investment or let things grind to a standstill.</P>
    <P>The decision was taken to increase the capital investment.  Unfortunately, as I said, the amount envisaged and the amount which we thought would be required has, in fact, been exceeded. I mentioned the various factors involved.  The Senator mentioned in particular one of them, the foundations. The position in Haulbowline is, as I said, it is an island.  It has restricted space and during the year borings were carried out in advance of the new development.  Unfortunately, as we know too well in many other respects, trial borings never present a complete picture of what is under the ground. As in mining, so in excavations only actual operations can disclose what is really underground and trial borings are often erroneous and do not present a true picture.  Unfortunately, this happened in this case but it was rendered more difficult by the fact that the sea invaded parts of the excavations and rather expensive coffer dams had to be provided which were not envisaged in the original plant.</P>
    <P>There were other factors as well.  I mentioned the devaluation of the deutschmark and an increase in wages as a result of the eighth round and more so a sufficiency of Irish skilled <Col N="709" /> men in the very specialised trades concerned was not available, even though it was anticipated they would be.  There was a certain local competition at the time for these skilled men and the alternatives had to be provided by the sub-contractors from Germany at a very much increased cost.  I mentioned a figure of the difference in cost as the difference between £10 and £3 a day, when speaking in the Dáil.  I should like to point out at this stage that that does not represent a difference in wage rates being paid to the German and Irish technicians but rather a very substantial element of subsistence and travel charges.</P>
    <P>That is the picture.  I think the position now has been reached, even though I do not like to see extra capital involved in this undertaking, that if this operation is to survive, if we are to maintain employment for the 500 men who have been maintained heretofore, if we are to make provision for the 700 men who will be employed ultimately, not by way of social welfare but in circumstances in which they can be expected, in ordinary conditions, to earn their living in a reasonably competitive undertaking, then I think there is no choice open to us but to go ahead. I think, everything considered, that is a good choice and one which the Seanad should be confident about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is the operative section of the Bill.  I am like the Minister from the point of view of ideology.  I am not a doctrinaire supporter of public enterprise against private enterprise.  Like the Minister, <Col N="710" /> when private enterprise fails I would support public enterprise.  A beginning was made in establishing the Shannon Scheme and the establishment of the sugar beet factories.  But my concern is that we should not get ourselves into the position that such an enterprise would appear to be something which means spending more and more money possibly for less and less results.  It is worth while remarking that although the Minister, myself or any of the two principal Parties of the State are not committed to public enterprise, the State here is actually more socialistic than Britain which had a Socialist Government for a number of years.  I am entirely in favour of this kind of factory in Haulbowline or anywhere else that is suitable, particularly from the point of view of providing variety of employment for our people, employment not only in agriculture but in industry.  A variety of employment would mean a variety of interests, a variety of culture and a general improvement.  The Minister is right in saying that the money is being invested as share capital and the company are not supposed to pay interest.  At the same time, invested capital nearly always gets a return.  Perhaps the Minister would say whether the company, in the circumstances in which they have not to pay interest on capital, are making suitable provision for depreciation, because it is presumably in a business where depreciation is heavy.  I presume that suitable provision is being made in that regard.</P>
      <P>So far as I am concerned and so far as we are all concerned we would hope that this enterprise would be successful and that the Minister's hopes&mdash;because that is all they are&mdash; for its success in the difficult circumstances that seem to be almost certain to arise will be realised.</P>

      <P>It might be interesting to recall, in connection with Senator Hayes' queries, that at the last annual general meeting of the company at which the accounts for the financial year ending on the 30th June, 1962, were considered, the Chairman described this development project as <Col N="711" /> leading to the creation of a new industry&mdash;not merely the extension or addition to an old one.  Apropos the query in regard to exports, it is interesting to recall from this statement that in the year ending on the 30th June the company did an export business valued at almost £200,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hayes, earlier on, referred to the loose investment of public money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I used the phrase: &ldquo;loose investment of public money&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your correction. I took a note of it at the time and I certainly thought you did.  I wish to say that whilst my Party are committed to public enterprise, we are not committed to the loose investment of public money, even though the expression was not used by Senator Hayes.  I should like the Minister to be a little clear in his explanation about the large increase in the capital required.  After all, we are not talking about hundreds of thousands of pounds or tens of thousands of pounds.  We are talking about an increase of 50 per cent in the capital required.</P>
      <P>To what extent is that 50 per cent increase related to wrong judgment&mdash; maybe excusably wrong judgment, wrong assessment of the facts originally, and to what extent is it related to a subsequent decision to expand further the development of this company? I am not very clear on this at all.  There has been a variety of excuses put forward as to the reasons for the necessity to increase the capital required by 50 per cent but there has been no attempt to relate those excuses, to break them down or to allocate the cost involved in each item.  I know that would be difficult.  However, I should be somewhat reassured if the Minister could say that a large percentage or a large proportion of the increased capital was related to further expansion of the company rather than possibly a wrong assessment, wrong judgment of the people engaged on this original capital expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" /> In this connection the Seanad, like the other House of the Oireachtas, is in some difficulty.  The Minister comes along and says it is necessary that the House should vote authority to the Minister to increase the share investment in this company.  He says why but the House itself has no independent assessment of it.  Would it not be possible in circumstances like this that some committee of the House should be able to examine the position and report back as to whether or not they thought this was really essential, really desirable and well merited?  At the moment the Minister comes along and says: &ldquo;Well, it is necessary in order to continue the expansion of this company and in view of the employment involved that the capital should be increased by 50 per cent.&rdquo;  That is all very well.  I should like to have far more evidence as to why this is necessary and whether or not it could have been avoided by better management originally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>At about the same time as the Irish steel development was going on, a huge British company went into another development of their particular lines.  The amount involved was much higher than is involved here.  Their original estimate was up literally by tens of millions of pounds. I am not using that as an excuse.  I am giving an indication that in a business like this close assessment or close estimation is not always possible.</P>
      <P>So far as the suggestion of Senator Murphy is concerned that there is a 50 per cent increase in the capital, that does not mean that there is a 50 per cent error in estimation.  The capital originally envisaged exceeded £3½ million.  This is the actual capital in the new development, irrespective of the working capital and irrespective of capital for certain contingencies.  The new cost is estimated at £5,020,000, so, in effect, the increase is not £2 million over £4 million, but £1.3 million roughly over £3.8 million or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might suggest to the Seanad that I could get a dozen people of this House to go into these figures and it would be very difficult for them to be able to put up a report either justifying or <Col N="713" /> damning the project, with all due respects to his recommendation.  I gave the figures in the Dáil as to the details of increased costs.  The major one was the foundation and civil engineering costs caused by the invasion of the sea into the excavation.  The increase in that case was about £300,000.  The plant and buildings increase was £119,000.  The increase as a result of the deutschmark devaluation was about £55,000.  Anticipated increase or actual increase&mdash;I am not sure which it is&mdash;is due to the operation of an escalator clause of £140,000.</P>
    <P>These are the main items.  As well as that, a figure of £750,000, which is built into this £6 million that I have referred to, which is covered in this Bill, is for contingencies in the event of greater specialisation that may be required in the event of our entry to the Common Market or to some other free trade arrangement.  Therefore, that £750,000 is not committed at all in the present development programme.</P>
    <P>There is one other factor involved, too, that I should mention.  I did mention it in my opening statement. There was certain electrical equipment in Haulbowline which was thought, initially, would be sufficient for the new operation without replacement and as time went on it was found that this was not possible.</P>
    <P>Let me come back to the major reason for the increase in the cost of foundation and civil engineering works. These are increases that I am assured could not possibly have been foreseen at the time the original estimate was given.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister satisfied himself on behalf of the Minister for Finance that the provision of depreciation is adequate, because I think it is very necessary that adequate provision for depreciation should be made?  Here we have a large sum of money, something in the neighbourhood of £6 million being invested in this company in share capital.  Therefore, of course it does not bear any interest and it is quite likely that this company might not pay dividends for a very long time.  It is also, I think, clear that there must be a lot of extremely expensive machinery and equipment in this company and it appears to me that unless adequate provision is made for depreciation that the Minister for Finance may be called upon from time to time to inject more money into this company for replacement. I think that if that were so then the employment given by this company would certainly be something in the nature of a social welfare operation.</P>

As he remarked, there is very heavy and expensive machinery, some of which will depreciate quickly, but I can assure him that all the ordinary considerations with regard to depreciation for capital of that nature have been taken into account by the company.</P>

    <Title>Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Bill, 1963&mdash; Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Col N="715" />
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to continue for three further years from 1st April, 1963, the period in which the buildings may be erected, enlarged or reconstructed in order to qualify for the rates remission under the Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Act, 1954.  It also proposes to extend for the same period of three years the time in which farm buildings may be constructed or improved in order to qualify for the twenty year remission of rates under the amending Act of 1960.</P>
      <P>The Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Act, 1954, provided for the granting of a two-thirds remission of rates for seven years on the valuation of new buildings and on the increased valuation of existing buildings that were enlarged or improved, where the work on the erection, enlargement or improvement was completed not later than the 26th July, 1956.  This completion date was extended up to the 31st March, 1963, by amending Acts passed in 1956 and 1960.  The rates remission so provided applies to all buildings, such as factories, offices, shops, houses, etc., which do not qualify for a remission under any other Act.  Local government legislation granting rates remission has been operative for over 40 years and is an accepted and effective form of encouragement of constructional development. It is considered that the existing concessions in this regard should now be continued for a further three year period, and this is proposed by Section 1 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 14 of the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852, an exemption from rates for seven years was given in respect of the erection, enlargement or improvement of farm outhouses and outoffice buildings.  In view of the steps being taken by many farmers to effect necessary improvements in their farm buildings, particularly in connection with the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme, it was felt that there was a case for making a further concession in relation to the rating of these buildings.  Accordingly, Section 2 of the Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Act, 1960, extended <Col N="716" /> the period of rate remission under the 1852 Act from seven to twenty years in respect of farm buildings erected, enlarged or improved between the 1st April, 1960, and the 31st March, 1963. The numbers and amounts of the grants paid under the Department of Agriculture farm buildings scheme have increased since this extended rates remission was introduced and construction work on farm buildings is now proceeding at a high level.  It is considered, therefore, that the period for the completion of such buildings to qualify for the twenty year remission of rates should be extended up to the 31st March, 1966.  Provision to extend the period accordingly is made in Section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill relate to one aspect of the law on rating which, in turn, is only one facet of the complex structure of local government finance.  The whole question of local taxation and finance is being methodically reviewed at present and it is possible that the examination may, in due course, result in substantial changes in rating law, both generally and especially in regard to remissions of and exemptions from rates.  The completion of the investigations and the consideration of the findings will necessarily take some time.  In the interim, it would, I think, be undesirable to make any drastic alteration in existing rating practices.  The present Bill proposes to maintain the existing position in relation to an important body of rates remissions for a limited period within which the general issue of such rating concessions can be examined.  Accordingly, I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say in the first instance that I am very pleased that the Government have introduced this Bill in this House following the recent discussion here on Senator Hayes' motion.  It is not a very important Bill, and is not a contentious Bill.  It is the type of Bill that can well be introduced in this House; I hope this is only a beginning and that it is an indication of Government policy on this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, this is largely <Col N="717" /> a Bill to continue existing legislation and existing reliefs granted under various Acts in the past. Clause (b) of subsection (1) is really only continuing a relief that had also been given in the past and it is necessary because the grant for water and sewerage is now given under the Sanitary Services Act, 1962, instead of the Housing Acts.</P>
    <P>The Bill in itself is not of very great importance but the Minister's statement to the effect that the Government have local government finance and taxation under consideration is of great importance.  A complete overhaul of the system of the valuation of premises and the levying and raising of rates is long overdue.  It is long past time that local authorities should be relieved of a lot of the expenditure which is thrust upon them at the present time.  When local government was first introduced in this country, I think at the end of the last century, local bodies had considerable control over the expenditure of money.  They had the power to decide in a lot of cases what schemes they would proceed with, what schemes they would not proceed with and what they would spend money on.  Therefore, I suppose it was reasonable that the money for these schemes and projects should be provided locally, but we have come a long way from that.  At the present time a county council is nothing more than a council to put Government policy into operation.  The county council must pay the fiddler but it has no opportunity of calling the tune and county councils should not be called upon to provide the money for a lot of things such as health and the maintenance of major roads.</P>
    <P>When the Minister does come to introduce a Bill to deal with local government finance and taxation, I hope he will attack it in a realistic manner in keeping with conditions prevailing in 1963.  There is no doubt whatever that the Valuation Act of, I think, 1852 badly needs overhaul. Premises are now valued and people are made liable for rates and to some extent for income tax under an Act passed more than 100 years ago.  One <Col N="718" /> of the methods which are supposed to be used in valuing premises is their letting value but I think a lot of people, including the Commissioner of Valuation, have long since given up attempting to value premises on the lines laid down in the Valuation Act and are simply doing the best they can.  I know it is a very big problem and that a lot of thinking, a lot of planning, is needed to give us a proper valuation code, but it certainly is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The present system is unjust and inequitable.  If a person with one premises in a town keeps quiet and does nothing about it, his valuation may be £20 but because his neighbour makes some minor improvements to his premises and draws the attention of the Commissioner of Valuation to them his may be increased to £60. That is not fair, just or equitable but there it is and the problem will have to be tackled at some time, sooner or later.</P>
    <P>To give an example of the type of absurdity to which I refer, the Minister replied to a question in the Dáil on valuation increases put down by Deputy Ryan.  It is very short and I think I can read it:</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan asked the Minister for Finance whether it is the practice of the Valuation Commissioners to increase the valuation of a house which has central heating installed; if so, if he will indicate why, and under what authority; and whether he will introduce legislation to prevent such increases being made, having regard to the fact that they discourage modernisation.</P>
    <P>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Malley): It is the duty of the Commissioner of Valuation to ensure that the valuation in regard to buildings is made on an estimate of their net annual value, as stipulated in Section 11, Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852.  I am informed by the Commissioner that he would regard the installation of central heating as a factor enhancing the value of a building, so that the valuation made would normally be <Col N="719" /> higher by reason of the central heating.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to introduce legislation as suggested by the Deputy, not do I accept that such valuation increases discourage modernisation any more than increases arising from other improvements which must be taken account of in a system of taxation on property values.</P>
    <P>A person who owns a house in the country built 30 or 40 years ago decides for his own comfort and convenience or because he is suffering from rheumatism or because the house is damp that he wants to instal central heating and under the law as it stands at present his valuation is increased from, say, £20 to £30 and he becomes liable for an additional £25 in rates a year.  I say that is not reasonable.  I say it discourages improvement and I would say that it is bad economy.  This is a damp country where a lot of people do, in fact, suffer from rheumatism and central heating of private houses and, indeed, of all buildings should be encouraged so I think the Minister might very well have included a provision in this amending Bill exempting central heating from valuation.</P>
    <P>There is another little absurdity to which I should like to refer and which I think could be amended on this Bill. Perhaps the Minister dealt with that in the Dáil today.  I do not know.  This Bill provides, as the Minister has told us, that new houses will be exempt from valuation for a certain number of years, and if a house is reconstructed or improved the reconstruction or improvement is also exempt.  If a man has a house with a poor law valuation of, let us say, £10, and because of old age, dampness or bad foundations it really is not possible to reconstruct it, if the owner wants to build a new house on the site of the old house, and he proceeds to build the new house from the ground up, as I understand it, if the valuation of the new house is £20 the individual will get exemption only in respect of the difference between the old and the new valuation: in other words, on the second £10.  He <Col N="720" /> will have to pay his full rates on the first £10 and get exemption only on the second £10.  I am told there are cases where that has actually happened. If that is so, I respectfully suggest to the Minister that the position should be remedied.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this is strictly relevant to this Bill, but it is certainly a question of valuation and I think it could be dealt with here.  As we know, under the Housing Acts supplementary grants are now payable to farmers with a valuation not exceeding £50.  It can very often happen that the valuation of the land of the farm might be £45, and the valuation of the dwellinghouse on the farm might be £7, making a total valuation of £52, and thereby making it impossible for the farmer to get a supplementary grant, or to qualify for a loan under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  If that farmer builds a new house from the ground up it means that he, at any rate, considers that the old house is beyond repair and not fit to live in.  I think the valuation of £7 on the house should be disregarded in testing whether or not he is eligible for a supplementary grant or a loan.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill is so far as it extends the desirable reliefs which are in force at the moment, but I regret that the Minister did not avail of it to make good some of the defects I have mentioned.  I certainly hope the Minister will overhaul local government taxation and financing and the system of valuation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Fitzpatrick I am very pleased that this Bill has been introduced here as it is one of the first Bills introduced here during the present session.  Any Bill of this nature which reduces the burden on the ratepayer must be wholeheartedly welcomed not only in this House but in the other House and by all members of local authorities.  Not only does it reduce the burden on the ratepayer but also by giving concessions it gives an incentive to people to improve their farms, their business houses, their shops and their private houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the second Bill that has been introduced here by the Minister within <Col N="721" /> the past year which has given concessions to the ratepayers.  We had the Bill dealing with revision of rates on agricultural land last July, and we have this Bill which is an extension of the 1954 and 1960 Acts.  This is general Government policy and we hope it will continue because, as has already been stated here, valuations which are based on a very old Act can be hurtful to certain sections of the community.</P>
    <P>While, I was glad to hear in the Minister's statement that the system of valuation is being revised, until that revision comes along the only possible way in which the Government can ease the burden of the rates is by bringing in temporary Bills of this nature dealing with valuation to encourage the improvement and erection of buildings. I have little else to add except to say that I am sure the local authorities and the other House will welcome the Bill as a help to the ratepayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with the two previous speakers in welcoming the provisions of this Bill.  Senator Fitzpatrick raised a point in connection with central heating.  I appreciate that we are not now discussing the change in the valuation structure but that we are discussing the continuation of grants for the remission of valuation on certain buildings erected with the aid of State grants.  In subsection (b) of Section 1 the Minister is providing for remission in the case of water supply and private sewerage facilities.  I suppose that is a satisfactory method of dealing with enlargements and improvements and the resulting assessment of valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite sure that the new difficulty which has arisen because of central heating being taken into account by the Commissioner of Valuation when assessing the value of a house should be tackled now.  I feel that the provision of a central heating system in any house is more than a desirable amenity.  It is more or less a necessity in modern times, particularly because of the shortage of domestic help.  It merely replaces in part the provision of open fires and an open heating system, and provides a <Col N="722" /> continuous warming effect with satisfactory results to the construction of the house.</P>
    <P>The point I am trying to make is that a house equipped with a central heating plant is likely to have a longer life by many years than a house which is not fitted with such a plant.  That in itself should influence the Minister to take into account that a building of that kind will not call for replacement as quickly as a building which has not been fitted with a central heating plant.  I know that in this Bill the Minister cannot make provision for the elimination of the factors which evidently are taken into account by the Commissioner of Valuation when striking a valuation for a house in which central heating has been installed.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Minister examine the possibility of including the provision of central heating in the category of improvement, or enlargement, as the case may&mdash;I suppose &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; is the correct word to use&mdash;for the purposes of qualifying for remission of valuation for the limited period that applies in regard to other improvements such as sanitary services and reconstruction generally.  The statement made recently in reply to a Dáil question&mdash;it was referred to here by Senator Fitzpatrick &mdash;had some repercussions already. Quite a number of people in recent years have been making arrangements for the provision of central heating plants not so much in new houses as in order houses because the central heating plant is more necessary in old houses with a view to keeping them habitable and keeping them in that state of repair necessary for ordinary use.</P>
    <P>As it has come to notice that the provision of that type of amenity is liable to cause an increase in valuation and, perhaps, a substantial increase, householders who intend to instal these plants will be completely discouraged and this type of activity will come to a standstill.  I appreciate that in a Bill of this kind the Minister could not delete that type of amenity from the provisions of the Valuation <Col N="723" /> Acts because we are not dealing with that, but I do suggest that it might be possible for the Minister to regard the provision of central heating as a type of improvement similar to private sewerage facilities or water facilities and enable him to give what would be equal to an interim remission for a period of 7 or 10 years, as the case may be, as he gives in respect of water and sewerage.  Long before that period will elapse we hope that there will be a general reassessment in the general basis of local taxation and, of course, of valuation and that, when that takes place, an opportunity will then be provided to argue the fact that it is unjust or inequitable, as the case may be, and that central heating in a house should be a factor to be taken into account for the purpose of increase in valuation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>Businessmen often complain that, when they carry out improvements to their premises, they are forced to pay much higher rates.  Many of them do not seem to realise that under the 1954 Act, which was introduced by the present Government, they can enjoy two-thirds remission for seven years of that increase. The Minister is to be congratulated for introducing this Bill today and so stimulating building for the next three years.  The 20 years' rate remission for agriculture is one of the many hidden benefits that Irish farmers are enjoying in this country today.  It is an excellent way to encourage the improvement and erection of new buildings.  In many parts of rural Ireland, byres, piggeries and other farm buildings are not in as good a condition as we would like and now with this rate remission extended for three more years, coupled with £6 per cow grant for byres, there is no excuse for many of our farmers not improving their byres.  I feel that this section will be of particular interest to farmers engaged in the pig industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now generally agreed that if farmers are to survive in this highly competitive industry that new measures must be adopted.  The approach to the pig industry in future <Col N="724" /> will be based on a more scientific and technical basis and it is generally admitted that proper housing is most important in that respect.  In different parts of the country today people who have pigs are erecting, with the help of substantial grants announced last year, large piggeries and so are in a position to breed and fatten pigs on a more economical basis.  With this extra incentive they can erect these piggeries and enjoy rate free remission for 20 years.  I feel that will go a long way to encourage others to adopt similar procedure.</P>
    <P>I hope, in conclusion, that many Irish farmers will not make the same mistake they made some years ago when money was made available and the £12 per cow grant was given to them for the erecting of byres.  After the money was spent, many farmers found that this grant was not then available and were disappointed.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this measure.  There have been complaints from farmers, business people <Col N="725" /> and others about the revaluation of property over the past number of years, and particularly the farming community, were complaining that when they carried out improvements on their premises that their valuation was increased.  For that reason, I think that this a very generous gesture on behalf of the Minister in bringing in legislation that will relieve the farming community of the danger of increased valuation if they improved their outhouses and outbuildings.</P>
      <P>Something has been said here about central heating valuations and all that. As far as I understand it, the Bill does not propose to make any changes in that side at all so far as dwelling-houses are concerned.  I may be wrong but that is what I imagine to be the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that arising out of the references to improvements in property which I presume includes houses, that any improvement will cause a rise in the valuation, I surely think this is a very unjust thing.  A rise in valuation of course means a rise in the rates which you will have to pay.  There does not seem to be any sense at all in asking people to keep their premises in order and appealing to them to beautify the districts in which they live and telling them to enter Tidy Town competitions and things of that kind.  Central heating has been referred to as another matter likely to raise the valuation of property.  Again, this is surely ridiculous? <Col N="726" /> It is trying to hold back progress. We have been talking about clean air Bills and air pollution.  The installation of central heating will do away with smoke and all the damage smoke causes.  I think it would be just as stupid to put up your valuation if you had a very good turf stack in the back garden as it would to tax you for having central heating in your house.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of the women in the house, fires and all that cause a terrific amount of work.  I think every housewife would welcome central heating both from the point of view of easing her housework and giving a more healthy atmosphere inside and outside the house.  It seems to me like raising your valuation because you put wallpaper on the walls instead of painting them.  If central heating does, in fact, cause a rise in valuation, I think the Minister should have another look at it, because very shortly we shall all be moving towards central heating.  If the rates go up very much further we shall have to sell the house, never mind central heating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we all support the extension of these concessions. What interested me particularly in the Minister's statement was that he foreshadowed substantial changes in the rating law.  There is no doubt that working on the 1852 legislation is not very satisfactory.  It seems to me that we need to go a good deal further than a change in the rating law.  Rating law is only the first stage.  We need an entire change in our rating practice.  The present rating practice, as you, Sir, pointed out from the floor of the House earlier in the debate, is completely haphazard.  What happens if you put up a new house or a new factory building?  The Commissioner of Valuation values as of, at the present time, on the basis of net annual letting value, which is completely fictitious. The valuation as it is fixed at the present time is probably fair.  What happens if you do nothing with your factory, your old factory?  What happens if you do nothing with your old house?  It is very unlikely that there will be any change in value; so that your old original value will remain as it was fixed, possibly ten, <Col N="727" /> twenty or one hundred years ago&mdash; certainly fifty years ago.  It will remain as it was fixed then.  An artificial value then and an even more artificial value now.</P>
      <P>What happens if you improve your factory or your house?  The Commissioner of Valuation comes in and assesses a new value on the basis of your improvements.  I can think of a case of a house which was valued a good many years ago at £17&mdash;a good substantial house&mdash;and that valuation is probably not a very realistic value now.  The owner of that house improved it because when he moved into it the roof was falling in and he had to put on a new roof.  He had to make some improvements to the house but, in fact, he decreased it in size.  When the Commissioner of Valuation came along he increased the valuation of that house from £17 to £45.  If the owner had done nothing to his house and had not improved it, no change in valuation would have been made, so that by the improvement he was penalised later on the rates which he had to contribute and on his Schedule A income tax.</P>
      <P>It is perfectly true that under the Bill and under the principal Act and earlier Acts there are concessions&mdash;the concessions under the 1954 Act of two-thirds remission and under the 1960 Act of 20 years' remission in the case of farm buildings.  But they are only concessions and they do not alter the principle of valuation in the long run, because eventually the time of the concessions runs out and the new valuation comes in and the owner must pay on the basis of the new valuation.  He is ultimately penalised for making his repairs.  It seems to me that the only solution in the long run is a complete revaluation of the entire country on the basis of a true valuation as of now or at the time the valuation was made. That would have to be followed up by annual reviews every five or ten years or some other such period of time.  The valuation cannot continue to be haphazard as it is at the present time.</P>

    <P>I would ask the Minister, when he is replying, to elaborate on the point <Col N="728" /> which was made about substantial changes in the rating law and what changes are likely to be made in rating practice.  I appreciate that he cannot give us a firm answer on this but all I would like to know, perhaps not the findings of any commission he may set up are likely to be&mdash;he obviously cannot do that&mdash;is how soon he is putting his inquiries into force and how soon he expects to get some answer, because this is a very vital problem and one which is holding up a certain amount of industrial development and is also I think a discouragement rather than an encouragement to householders and to factory owners to repair and improve their premises.</P>

      <P>The interest displayed in my passing reference to a possible revision of the taxing code on a local basis is encouraging, though not new. So far as answering the Senator's question as to what, in any precise form, we intend to do about the whole basis of local taxation, I am afraid I cannot oblige by giving any clear indication at this stage for the very good reason, which I think will be appreciated, that at this stage the matter which is fraught with difficulty, requires a very widespread and intensive examination.  It has been under very real scrutiny for the past couple of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Economic Research Institute took this matter up some considerable time ago and an interim report was prepared by a Professor Walker. Further reports are awaited.  In addition, I indicated in the Dáil very recently, and indeed, on many other occasions that my Department and other interested Departments are also considering simultaneously, this whole problem.  It is a difficult problem and one in which all of us, probably, have our own very distinct views.  What the overall complete investigation being carried out by the Economic Research Institute, together with our own Departmental inquiries and considerations, will be is something I would not even attempt to forecast at this moment.  Nor would I like it to be understood that I can promise that we will be in a position to indicate even in the near future what the outcome will <Col N="729" /> be because these considerations are still going on and just how long more they may take I cannot say.  However, the House can be quite satisfied and secure in the knowledge that, in so far as the Government, and my Department in particular, are concerned, we are fully alive to the fact that the whole system, possibly, requires revision.  It is on that wide front that we are approaching the matter and not merely picking out the obvious faults that all of us can see and making piecemeal proposals to remedy these situations.</P>
    <P>I hope that I shall have the opportunity of being able to do my part, as Minister for Local Government, in whatever steps may be found best to remedy this whole local taxation system.  More than that I should prefer not to say.  I do not intend to go further than that just now.  I should say that the references to the valuation system as it is applied are not really very relevant to this discussion. It is not within the realm of my jurisdiction really and I am afraid I cannot talk very authoritatively on the points made, in particular with reference to increasing valuations because of central heating installations.</P>
    <P>Central heating has been taken up, I think, by most of the speakers.  It has been lauded for what it is: of great benefit and advantage and as being almost an essential rather than merely a luxury.  That may be so.  I am not going all the way with those who say it is the very thing we want, that it is an essential and is so very good for our health.  Candidly, I cannot stand the thing.  That is neither here nor there.  There are others like me.  The majority, perhaps, would like to have it and would prefer it to the trouble of open fire-heating which we have had traditionally down the years.  In so far as central heating is concerned and within the framework of the existing Valuation Act, as I see it, it may seem strange that a valuation should be increased where it is installed but, neverthless, I think that within the Acts and within the law the valuation people have kept within their terms of reference.  Central heating, as an improvement, must enter <Col N="730" /> into their calculations when valuations come to be revised.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that I agree with that, but I am saying that it was not really within my authority, nor is it something that it would be for me to correct in this particular way.  It might well be said that if we allow other improvements and give exemptions we should do so in so far as central heating is concerned.</P>
    <P>While central heating may yet become an essential part of probably every dwelling in the land, that stage has not yet been reached.  It is true that if we want a new roof on a house we have to have it and we are providing grants from public funds to encourage improved roofing and improved housing generally, but we are not giving grants, nor do we think we are called upon yet&mdash;nor would we be able financially to do so in all the circumstances&mdash;to enable people to put in central heating.  I think probably the people who instal central heating at the moment or who can afford to purchase houses with central heating laid on are probably better able to carry that additional burden that is reflected in the rate of that particular house than would be the general ratepayers and taxpayers in the country. That will be a changing situation I have no doubt and the whole approach may change in the future but I do not think we have reached that stage yet. Therefore, the question of exemption in order to encourage this particular practice, which might have its advocates, is not a very real approach at the present juncture.</P>
    <P>The question of these exemptions applying to particular farm buildings and to pig farms and any other such matter, would, so far as I am aware, be answered by saying that such buildings would be exempted and would get the concession as outlined here in this Bill and which will operate for the next three years as it has done for the past three years as we know.  The purpose would be the erection of any farm house or out office building and in that way I think it comes within the realm of the old Act of 1852 to which our later Acts <Col N="731" /> have reference.  In that regard while pig farming could be possibly said to exist on the holding that might not be described in the normal commonly accepted sense as a farm, nevertheless, it would in all earnestness be a farm building and as such would be entitled to the concession as we intend it to operate for all farm buildings.</P>
    <P>In regard to this question that was raised in regard to an anomaly that exists in the exemption of new house valuations, I want to make it clear that where an old house has been pulled down and immediately a new house is erected on the same site, it had been impossible up to 1962 to get remission on the full valuation of that new house.  Since the Housing Act of 1962 was passed that defect, as it were, has been remedied and the remission of rates granted under the Housing Acts will apply, and has applied, from the passage of that Act in 1962 to the full valuation of the new house even though it may have been built on the site of an old house.  Prior to 1962, if the old house having been pulled down the site on which it was immediately built upon and the old valuation was not removed from the valuation lists, then the situation has arisen to my knowledge as well as those who have spoken here that only the additional valuation created by the new house over and above what was there on an old house has been getting this remission.  In the few cases in which it has arisen it has been difficult, I admit, for those affected to understand or accept or comprehend, but the fact is, and it has been the law up to 1962, that in the 1962 Act we have remedied that situation and got over it and it no longer should arise in the future.  The law is now there to enable it to be got over.  I am sure in all cases it will be got over. In so far as what went before is concerned, I cannot give any great assistance at this particular time.</P>
    <P>A remark was made on the possibility of removing certain charges from the rates.  This is a very wide question. That major roads could be <Col N="732" /> taken away entirely from them is mentioned specifically as an instance of what could be done.  This is something we would all like to see if it were financially possible.  It may well be it will in the future and if it should be certainly the Minister for Local Government, whether it be I or somebody else, would be behind it, from the point of view of local government at any rate.  For the moment it is a matter of general concern, general principle, and is not really something that we can do anything useful about here, other than express our opinion on it.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the House generally has welcomed this particular measure, which is, as I say, making no real change other than to extend the time within which certain benefits enjoyed for the past years will continue in regard to new buildings which may be erected in the next three years.  I believe that that assistance and that encouragement is something that is necessary and useful.  In particular, I think the 20 year remission to the farming community is not only an encouragement to this particular category of our people but is also probably one of the few ways in which we can try and help them in their everyday lives and reduce the impact of increasing costs on those who cannot in the ordinary sense recoup themselves for additional expenditure by merely asking for a raise in pay because there is no boss around to give it to them, or refuse them for that matter.  It has that in it as well as encouraging in a very direct way the improvement of farmsteads.  According to the NFA who approached us quite a few years ago on this, a national survey which they had carried out indicated that farm buildings left a great deal to be desired and that a a great deal needed to be done before the most productive methods of turning out agricultural produce could be employed.  They sought a complete wiping out of valuation and taxes on farm buildings.  They proposed a 25 year remission and in 1960, as Senators know, subsequent to that discussion with those people and with <Col N="733" /> other interested farming groups, we brought in a remission for 20 years. That exempts all buildings built in the next three years as well as all farm buildings completed within the past three years.  All in all that is of very great significance to those people.</P>
    <P>Without casting any aspersions or reflections on any other group in the community, I would say that this benefit is well deserved by this section because of their difficulties in passing on increasing costs.  This is a way of helping them to improve production methods and to relieve them of the impact of increased taxes because they have improved their way of working. The Bill has nothing new in it really except extensions.  I am glad of the welcome the House has given it and I know it will not create any difficulties as far as acceptance is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be in a position to give Senators some idea of the extent to which our coasts are being damaged by the encroachment of the sea but there is very little up-to-date information on the problem available.  The last general examination of the position was made thirty-two years ago when an inter-departmental committee reported to the then Minister for Local Government and Public Health that there was no conclusive evidence of any really grave erosive action and that much of the erosion was of little practical importance; there were, however, a small number of cases in which erosion was taking place with so much damage or danger to property as to assume, what might be termed, &ldquo;public importance&rdquo;.  I doubt if there has been any material change since and I think it could safely be taken that the committee's assessment still holds good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide machinery under which county councils and county borough corporations can have cases of erosion in their areas investigated and protective works carried out if protection is possible at a cost which bears a reasonable relation to the value of the property being damaged or endangered.  The word &ldquo;erosion&rdquo; is not used in the Bill but the terms of the Bill make it quite clear that only genuine and serious cases of erosion will be eligible for treatment.  Works may be carried out only when land &ldquo;is being progressively damaged by the continuing encroachment of the sea, as distinct from occasional or abnormal storms&rdquo; and <Col N="735" />&ldquo;the encroachment is liable to endanger the safety of a harbour, the buildings or amenities of a residential area or other valuable property&rdquo;. Storm damage is specifically excluded and this is of some importance as there is very often confusion between storm damage and erosion.  Storm damage is an isolated occurrence but erosion, even though it may be aggravated or accelerated by storms, is a continuing process.</P>
    <P>Within the past ten years State aid has been made available for coast protection works in three areas &mdash; Bray, Wicklow town and Rosslare Strand.  In these cases it was known that the danger to valuable property was imminent and it was possible in each case to put the work in hands without administrative or other difficulties. At Bray the work done was the underpinning of a sea wall which was being progressively undermined.  At Wicklow the work was also straight forward consisting mainly of the dumping of heavy protective rubble.  Rosslare is the best known and most important of these cases and Senators may be interested to learn something of the work which has been done and is still being done there by the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The Wexford County Council had, for many years, made representations for Exchequer aid to arrest erosion at Rosslare Strand, but no positive action was taken.  On 3rd May, 1955, they offered to provide £3,000 annually for four years provided that a substantial grant from State sources would be made and the work carried out by the appropriate State Department.  In June, 1957, the Government decided, as an exceptional measure, that a programme consisting of a survey and some experimental and direct protection works should be proceeded with by the Office of Public Works.  It was agreed between the Wexford County Council and the Office of Public Works that the work should cover the portion of the beach, approximately 3½ miles long, from a point near the churchyard, immediately south of the village of Rosslare Strand, to a point approximately halfway along the Spit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> Works were commenced in 1957, and after experimentation, in which various types of groynes and protection works were tried, a scheme of works was evolved.  Under this scheme, a length of about 6,000 yards of beach was covered by a series of groynes, of different types.  In general, the groynes were spaced at 150 yards intervals along the beach.  The groynes are in the main constructed of round timber stakes.  This type of construction is very economical and allows the use of native timbers.  The Village section over a length of 650 yards has, in addition, been protected by 5½ ton concrete blocks laid along the beach head; over the parts where erosion was most severe, these blocks are in double rows.  Seriously threatened parts of the Golf Course section have also been given direct protection by the erection of stake breast works.  The denuded part of the Spit has been reinstated by the construction of a double line of ridge works to back the groynes, and by the use of wind breaks and by grass planting.  The beach has also been nourished by transferring material from low water to above High Water Springs to speed up the action of the groynes, and to give immediate protection to the banks.</P>
    <P>As foreseeable, the works necessary to complete the scheme include the following:&mdash;The general duplication of the present system of groynes, i.e. to give a system of groynes spaced at 75 yard intervals; the extension of stake breast works, if necessary over those sections which up to now have not been given direct protection; the construction of windbreaks and grass planting on the Spit; and the construction of low water protection works on the Spit&mdash;if such are found to be necessary.  The works will probably be completed in 1964 and the total cost will be about £120,000.  The Wexford County Council, who have contributed approximately £30,000, were informed that their contribution would be examined, and a refund made if it exceeded the proportion determined by this Bill to be contributed by local authorities towards the cost of Coast Protection Works.  Any <Col N="737" /> refund to the council can be dealt with as an administrative matter and will be entirely outside the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The type of protection works adopted is simple and economical, and it is expected that the works when completed, will give reasonable protection under the present conditions of erosion on that portion of the beach where they have been undertaken. The Commissioners' engineers have learned a great deal from the Rosslare works and this knowledge can be profitably used in the planning and carrying out of future coast protection schemes.  I might mention that in 1937, at the request of the Wexford County Council, an English expert on coast protection, Mr. S.W. Mobbs of Lowestoft, East Suffolk, made an investigation at Rosslare and recommended that groynes and an extensive system of retaining walls should be erected at a cost then estimated at £340,000&mdash;the equivalent of about £1,000,000 now.  As the present scheme is so very much simpler and less costly it was considered desirable to obtain up-to-date advice from Mr. J. Duvivier, a well know London expert. Mr. Duvivier visited Rosslare and expressed the opinion that the works being carried out were on the best lines.  The works will, of course, have to be very carefully maintained and in the Bill provision is made for maintaining them in the same manner as works which are carried out under the Bill.  This provision is necessary because otherwise the county council would have no authority to pay the maintenance costs.</P>
    <P>Although in the three cases I have mentioned it was possible to put the work in hands without any special coast protection legislation, it is by no means certain that in other cases problems of access or interference with privately owned property could be overcome without special powers.  Some statutory machinery for dealing with the whole problem is clearly needed and as I have already said the aim of this Bill is to provide the machinery required.</P>
    <P>Senators may be aware that this is not the first Coast Protection Bill <Col N="738" /> which has been prepared.  In 1956 our predecessors in Government introduced a Coast Protection Bill in Dáil Éireann and it was under discussion when the Dáil was dissolved and the Bill lapsed. This Bill is generally on the same lines as the 1956 Bill but with some important variations, particularly in the financial provisions.  The maximum State grant for a coast protection scheme is raised from 50 per cent to the very generous figure of 80 per cent of the cost.  Only half the costs incurred by the Commissioners of Public Works on a scheme which does not proceed to execution will now be recoverable from the local authority concerned while under the older Bill the local authority were liable for the full amount of these costs.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the Bill provides that if the council of a county or a County Borough are satisfied that land within their area is being progressively damaged by the continuing encroachment of the sea and that the encroachment is liable to endanger valuable property, they may promote a coast protection scheme.  If the encroachment affects land in two or more counties, the councils are required to name one council as the authority to promote the scheme.  The council or councils shall cause a report on the encroachment to be prepared before a council as a promoting authority under the Bill requests a preliminary examination to be made by the Commissioners of Public Works.  If, following the preliminary examination, the Commissioners report that a coast protection scheme is feasible&mdash;which is intended to mean practicable within economic limits of cost&mdash;they may at the further request of the promoting authority and subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance prepare a scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme, which will show the percentage grant available&mdash;not more than 80 per cent&mdash;will be exhibited by the promoting authority.  They will notify any person affected and consider any observations received and report to the Commissioners on the observations and any alterations which they propose should be made in the scheme.  Having considered that report, the Commissioners <Col N="739" /> will submit the scheme to the Minister for Finance with their recommendation. The Minister may refuse to confirm a scheme, or may confirm it with or without alterations.  Should he confirm it the Commissioners will be empowered to carry out the works.  The difference between the cost of a scheme and the State grant will be payable by the promoting authority subject to such contributions by other local authorities, harbour authorities or other beneficiaries as may be arranged.  At any stage before a scheme is submitted to the Minister the promoting authority will be free to decide that the scheme should not proceed and they would then be liable for half the costs and expenses incurred up to that stage.  All decisions by a county council on the promotion of a scheme or withdrawal from a scheme will be reserved functions&mdash;in other words, within the compass of the elected Representatives as opposed to an Executive function of the State or the county managers.</P>
    <P>Powers are provided for entry on lands, etc., for compulsory acquisition or interference with lands or other rights; for payment of compensation; and for the holding of a public inquiry in relation to proposals for a scheme.</P>
    <P>Maintenance of completed works will be the responsibility of the Commissioners of Public Works but costs and expenses incurred by them on maintenance will be refunded by the authority who promoted the scheme.</P>
    <P>Certain necessary provisions of a miscellaneous nature are made, e.g., to make bye-laws, to abandon protection works no longer capable of being maintained at reasonable cost and to employ contractors.</P>
    <P>As the extent of the coast protection work needed is not known and as the initiation of schemes is left to county councils it is not possible to give any estimate of the expenditure which will fall to be met from the Exchequer.  I can only say that in planning coast protection works, the aim of the Commissioners will be to secure reasonably effective protection at the lowest possible cost.  I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill seems to be an entirely reasonable and practical measure.  I think it lends itself more to Committee Stage discussion than to a general discussion on Second Stage.  It is interesting to hear that a problem which many people think is very grave was considered more than 30 years ago not to be a matter of the first importance, and according to the Parliamentary Secretary that position still prevails.  I am aware that in Wicklow and Wexford there has always been considerable talk about this problem, and considerable pressure on the Government to get something done.  Outside of that I know of only one area in Waterford &mdash;which I have visited for more than 50 years&mdash;where erosion seems to be working very hard, that is, in the parish of Ring.</P>
      <P>The procedure outlined in the Bill as far as I can see combines local knowledge with practical experience from the top, and with the assistance of the Commissioners of Public Works. I noticed that Wicklow County Council have consulted with outside experts, and we can be assured that the work which will be carried out will be worth doing.  The Parliamentary Secretary made no allusion to the fact that in the Dáil the only aggrieved people seemed to be the very important people who come from the County Cork.  However, I would not like to argue about these people or say anything about them or about what is happening to the coast in County Cork. Whatever is happening they are not satisfied with what the Parliamentary Secretary is doing and I am sure they will talk about that themselves.  Meanwhile, the Bill seems to me to be a practical and useful one and the details of it can safely be left to further discussion on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming as I do from a maritime county with a very big and a very serious coast erosion problem. I should like to say a few words on this measure.  It is very difficult, I think, for Senators living in inland counties, or, indeed, for councillors or other people living inland, to realise the magnitude of this coast erosion problem or to understand the importance <Col N="741" /> of this measure.  In drawing up the measure, the Parliamentary Secretary seems to have used the expert county council Rosslare Strand works and the procedure followed there as a model for the framework of future schemes and to provide that the Commissioners of Public Works will carry out the schemes.  This seems to be an ideal method of carrying out this coast erosion work, that a central agency should carry out the work required and that a pool of experience should be established here in the city.</P>
      <P>Before I leave that, I should like at this stage to express my congratulations, and I am sure the congratulations of Wexford County Council, to the young engineers engaged on the scheme at Rosslare Strand.  I believe that those young men&mdash;they are very active, very able and very keen young engineers&mdash; will be of immense value to the Commissioners of Public Works in carrying out future schemes and in establishing this pool of experience here in Dublin. Rosslare Strand has been mentioned very often in connection with the Coast Erosion Bill and the Parliamentary Secretary, both in the Dáil and here, has referred to a report received by Wexford County Council, not in 1937, I think, as he states, but some seven years earlier.  Actually, in 1930, there were two reports submitted in Wexford, one report from a firm of civil engineers in Dublin, Delap and Waller in Grafton Street&mdash;I do not know if that firm are still in existence or not but that firm were asked in January, 1930 or somewhat earlier, to report on the coast erosion problem at Rosslare Strand by Rosslare Development Society.  They reported in January 1930.  In the same year, apparently the Wexford County Council were not very happy with the report submitted by the Dublin people and they asked an English expert to report on the coast erosion problem at Rosslare Strand. This was mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary.  This gentleman, Mr. Sidney Wilfred Moss of Lowestoft, Suffolk, reported in October, 1930.  It would seem that he was quite an expert with regard to coast erosion because he did invent the groynes used in coast protection works on the east coast of England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="742" /> I went to the trouble of digging out both reports from the pigeonholes of the County Hall and the council offices in Wexford and I found that both reports agree on the seriousness of the problem that existed there.  They refer to the rapidity of erosion on that coast and they deal with a length of coast extending from Wexford harbour to Rosslare harbour.  The works carried out in recent years point to one thing and that is to the wisdom of the reports submitted by our two engineers in Dublin, Delap and Waller.  At that time they suggested that a scheme could be carried out at Rosslare Strand that would help to save the village of Rosslare and that would cover 1½ miles of coast there and they suggested that that scheme might be carried out at an initial cost of £1,500 plus a maintenance cost of £500 for a number of years.</P>
    <P>The English expert surveyed the same coastline but he gave a figure of £340,000 for a seven mile stretch of coast from Rosslare harbour right up to Wexford town.  I am afraid it was that figure of £340,000 that frightened off the Wexford County Council at that time, and, as a result, they did not carry out any work there.  He did recommend that a sum of £12,000 spent at Rosslare Strand would have protected the coast.  Again, I feel that had that £12,000 been spent then, if there was any provision or any agency by which that work could have been carried out at that time it would have saved a very considerable amount of money that has had to be spent there at the present time.</P>
    <P>The position, of course, went from bad to worse over the years.  In 1955, Wexford County Council in desperation asked that something should be done.  They agreed that those who help themselves are entitled to help from outside.  They proposed that they would put up a certain sum of money annually for protection work at Rosslare Strand and, as the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, the sum agreed on was £3,000.  We were wise, of course, at that stage.  We insisted that, when this coast protection measure would be introduced, Wexford County <Col N="743" /> Council should be compensated or refunded&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>£3,000 per year over a period of years.  They insisted that if the provisions of the new measure, when it came, were more favourable to the county council than the provision of one-third of the £3,000 granted at that time that they would be compensated or refunded.  That is what has happened in this case.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to Section 16 (a) of this measure which states that:</P>
      <P>the Minister for Finance shall contribute, out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas, the amount which represents such percentage of the said moneys as is equal to the percentage shown, in the scheme as confirmed, as the percentage which the Minister for Finance is prepared to authorise.</P>
      <P>Subsection (b) of the same section states:</P>
      <P>the balance shall be contributed by the promoting authority.</P>
      <P>As Senators will see, this safeguards the Minister for Finance.  The promoting authority, the county council or group of county councils, will get together; they will promote a scheme; they will send it up here.  A figure as to what the scheme will cost will be decided on.  The Minister at that stage will decide the Departmental contribution. The position can arise that, due to several factors, increase in wages, increase in cost of materials, damage by storm and other incidental factors that may come into the picture, the cost of the job of protection of the coast may be much more than the original figure dicided upon.  As I say, the Minister has already covered himself and protected himself in this section but there is no provision by which the county council can protect themselves so far as I can see.  I should also like to refer to this question of maintenance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  Now in regard to this question of maintenance, in his statement in the Dáil the Parliamentary Secretary did say, in a two sentence paragraph, that maintenance of completed works is so important that it is proposed to make it the responsibility of the Commissioners of Public Works.  That is the first sentence.  I agree fully with that.  He goes further and says that the costs and expenses incurred by the Commissioners on maintenance will be refunded by the authority who promoted the scheme.  That is all right.  The thing is in the second sentence.  The costs will be refunded.  It does not seems as if the county council had to carry out the maintenance themselves. I agree that the people who did the job in a case of coast erosion are the proper people to maintain it and look after it.  I feel that there will be many difficulties arising in the future as to <Col N="745" /> where construction work ends and maintenance begins.</P>
      <P>This coast erosion problem is not like the building of a house or the construction of a bridge.  It is not something with finality to it at any particular stage.  It is a type of job that will go on for years.  To illustrate my point, I should like to refer to a paragraph in the Delap and Waller report that I referred to.  It says: &ldquo;The method I suggest as the cheapest, simplest and quickest for securing the sand as it comes in is to form low groynes of concrete bars which can be raised again and again as the sand level rises, moved in position or in alignment as experience shows how best results can be attained.&rdquo;  That is right, of course.  It is what is really happening in Rosslare.  You are building up one set of groynes on top of another.  You are planting this type of grass known locally as &ldquo;bent grass&rdquo;, which holds the sand and builds up the coast line.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out, it is a continous process and where the construction work will end and the maintenance begin will be a very big question in those jobs in the future.  I said, at the beginning, that I had certain reservations with regard to the measure.  One of them is this.  I feel that this should have been made a national charge.  I agree that inland counties will find it very hard to become enthusiastic about paying for coast protection works. They will not realise the problem, but I feel that the preservation of our coast is really a matter for the country as a whole.  Possibly, I am looking a long way ahead.  I can conceive of a time when, if something is not done now and done on a very large and a very big scale, that some Senator Nolan of the future or some Senator Fitzpatrick or L'Estrange will come in here asking that we carry out protection works on the coasts of Carlow, Westmeath or Cavan or some place else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, that may be 500 years hence but that position can arise and I think we should have made it a national charge rather than put any portion of the charge on the local authority.  I know that the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="746" /> will say to me that a maritime county, as a result of its coastline, has certain advantages, and I agree.  I have the greatest sympathy for people who are 60, 70, 80, or 100 miles inland and are so far removed that they are unable to get to the beautiful resorts and beaches of a county like Wexford but, nevertheless, I will say that having a long coastline also has its disadvantages.  If you meet a year like last year the losses to hoteliers and traders and people living in those seaside resorts can be even as great, if not greater, than the losses in agriculture.  If you are like Wexford and have a good football or hurling team going to Dublin or some inland centre nine or ten Sundays in the summer bringing all the people of the county with you then, again, the loss in such a year will be considerable to the seaside people who depend on their visitors for their livelihood.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It has its disadvantages as well as its advantages.  However, I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that the present measure is a very big improvement on the measure introduced by the previous Government and which fell by the wayside when the election of 1957 came along. We in Wexford and possibly the people in the other seaside counties concerned with coast erosion problems should be very grateful to the late Deputy Allen of Wexford and to Deputy Corry of Cork for the manner in which they held up that Bill in the other House and prevented its going through until such time as the general election of 1957 intervened, which meant that it fell by the wayside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that measure the State contribution was up to 50 per cent and a State contribution of 50 per cent would be <Col N="747" /> of no use and certainly would not encourage a county like Wexford, or any other county with a coast erosion problem, to tackle that problem.  As I have said, coast erosion is a very big problem and a very difficult one.  It is not confined to one area in Wexford alone.  It certainly is not confined to any one county in Ireland.  Actually in Wexford we have a coast erosion problem on the whole east coast.  During my lifetime I have seen large stretches of the Wexford coast between Wexford town and Courtown&mdash;a very long distance up&mdash;disappearing with its houses. I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary when he said that it would be unwise to spend huge sums of money to save a small portion of land or to save a few houses.  That suggestion is also made in one or other of the two reports before me.  As I see it, the big problem that arises is that you must save the cliffs or banks by the seaside in a lot of cases.  On the Wexford coast some huge sea banks are being eaten away year after year and if you go out you will see large tracts of low lying country on the inland side of these cliffs or banks being gradually washed away by the sea.</P>
    <P>As I said in the beginning, I welcome the measure and I would express the hope that the present Parliamentary Secretary next year, or the year after, or possibly in future years when he becomes Minister for Finance, will amend the measure so as to provided 100 per cent State aid to counties carrying out coast erosion works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from a maritime county, I welcome the Bill and the only objection I have to it is that it applies really to large works and possibly some of the effects that I would like to see arising out of the Bill cannot be achieved in my own county. I notice that the measure is designed to protect in cases in which property is progressively damaged by continued encroachment of the sea as distinct from occasional and abnormal storm damage and where encroachment is liable to endanger the safety of the harbour, the buildings or amenities of <Col N="748" /> a substantial area or very valuable property.</P>
      <P>The only loophole I see would direct me to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to be generous in his interpretation of what constitutes valuable property.  In a poor county like mine people who live on the coast and who have the only pieces of arable land which they possess being gradually washed away by the sea from year to year look on that piece of property as being very valuable.  I do not think it comes within the scope of the Bill. What the Parliamentary Secretary has in mind is property which would be of considerable national value or considerable value to the State rather than to the individual property owner.</P>
      <P>As a person who has had to carry out works under various Bills and who has seen the difficulties of operating measures introduced and passed through the Oireachtas.  I can really commend this measure from the point of view of covering every possible eventuality in connection with its implementation. I think the difficulties that have arisen in connection with the implementation of other Bills have been fully taken into account in connection with the preparation of this measure and for that reason I see that the measure can apply and be brought into operation and carried out with the minimum amount of delay. Furthermore, the local authorities are consulted at every step.  In the beginning, the local authority initiate the scheme.  It is sent forward to the Commissioners.  The Commissioners make a report after a casual examination. That report goes back to the local authority.  It is sent back again to the Commissioners who carry out a more intensive examination and prepare an estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a point on which it is absolutely unnecessary for me to delay because the Parliamentary Secretary understands as well as I do that there is no such thing as a rule of thumb in dealing with coast erosion or the measures to be adopted to counter it. Every single problem is a problem in itself.  If you are to have success in dealing with and counteracting coast erosion in any particular area, you <Col N="749" /> must have the most intensive investigation before you prepare a scheme and estimate.  You must take into account all the consequences which may arise from the work you propose to do.  You must take into account also the effects of slowing up the currents along by the coast and take into account also whether, in fact, drawings which have been successful in one case will be suitable for use in another.  In some places drawings are effective; in other places they are completely and entirely ineffective.  It all depends on the direction of the currents along the coast.</P>
    <P>All that will, I am sure, be dealt with.  There is not very extensive work to be carried out in my own county but, at the same time, there is coast erosion which is of considerable importance to the local people.</P>
    <P>One of the things that strikes me as being quite inequitable is that the cost, as another Senator said, of any scheme should be 20 per cent of the local charge.  The problem of the western seaboard and all the maritime counties is a problem of a high density of population in restricted areas.  For the most part the counties are wild and mountainous and vast areas have very few people, and then there is a concentration of people in small areas with high valuation.  In addition to that, the cost of our services are relatively high as compared with inland counties for the reason that we have vast distances to travel and vast areas with low density of population.  If we examine the rates, we find that in all the maritime counties they are higher than in any of the inland counties.  In my own county at the present time the county rate stands at 63/- in the £. Even at that, the amount available per head of the population for health services is considerably less than the amount available per head of the population in any of the inland counties, so that we are really at the present time completely at a disadvantage and I do not know that the fact that a short journey can take us to the enjoyment of the seaside compensates for what we have to put up with in the matter of heavy rates and poor local housing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> There is one point in connection with the implementation of measures of this kind which has always given me trouble and has given trouble in my own county.  That is not exactly when a job finishes and when maintenance begins, but to accept that, when the Commissioners of Public Works say a job is finished, that it is finished. For this reason the Commissioners of Public Works have the responsibility for carrying out the particular job; at the time they complete the job the county engineer is authorised to go along to inspect the work and he is supposed to be satisfied with it before he takes it over on behalf of the county council.  If the county engineer from his local knowledge considers that the work is not complete, that it does not 100 per cent meet the requirements of the county council, that it is not 100 per cent satisfactory from his point of view, the Commissioners of Public Works can say: &ldquo;Yes it is. It is quite satisfactory.  Your objection is of no avail.&rdquo;  This matter should be dealt with.  It is not a matter in the Bill but it is one which arises in connection with works carried out by the Commissioners of Public Works for county councils.  When the Commissioners say &ldquo;that is that&rdquo; any points the county engineer may raise are of no avail.</P>
    <P>There is only one other point which I should like to mention.  Although county councils have to pay half the cost of examination and preparation of a scheme right up to the time when the work comes to be done, the Commissioners of Public Works may come along and say the job is not satisfactory and abandon it.  The local authority have already contributed to it half the cost of investigation up to the point where work is started.  They have contributed 50 per cent possibly or more towards carrying out the job. Then something happens and the Office of Public Works say it is no longer possible, it is a failure, they are drawing out of it and the local authority has no redress.</P>
    <P>I agree, of course, that the maintenance of any scheme that is satisfactorily completed should be carried out by the Commissioners of Public Works <Col N="751" /> because, having carried out the scheme in the first place, they should have a better knowledge of its maintenance requirements and they have suitable machinery.  The full cost of maintenance, however, has to be met by the local authority.  Coming from an unfortunate western county.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see if any relief could be given in connection with maintenance to the maritime counties.</P>
    <P>A point which is not covered in the Bill but which is of very considerable importance in our county is the erosion which takes place on rather a smaller scale but which is very serious for people who have only a small portion of arable land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If a portion of arable land is taken I understand&mdash;and I think I am right&mdash;that the Land Commission can re-assess the amount of rent to be paid.  They can make a reduction in respect of land attacked by erosion.  I think that is correct but what strikes me, however, is that notwithstanding the fact that a considerable portion of land may be washed away the valuation of the holding remains the same.  The valuation is never reduced so a person continues to pay rates on the original valuation, on a portion of land which no longer exists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is generally <Col N="752" /> agreed that this measure is over-due and I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary has brought it in because we can all see how necessary it is to deal with coast erosion.  Every year, every winter in particular, some portion of the soil of the country is eaten away by the sea.  It depends on the weather.  If we get a mild winter it may not be just so bad but mild winters are really scarce.  People living in counties bordering on the sea, as quite a lot of people do and people living inland who at some stage visit the seashore, all know that portions of valuable land are disappearing and it is a good thing that an attempt is being made to prevent it.  Even so, we are still bound to suffer coast erosion to some extent.</P>
      <P>Now that arrangements have been made to try to prevent it and public funds used, the Department should see that seashore which is used by the public in summer time and at other periods will be safeguarded.  I have no doubt that it will be so that people will still be able to visit these places.  These places should be protected so that there will be no interference with their use by the public.  It is very valuable for people to be able to visit these seaside places even though they may not be as good as they were in previous years.  I hope that this investigation which is to be made now will not be prolonged and that at least the places with a prior claim will be attended to immediately or as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place, I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary for the practical and generous manner in which he introduced the Bill and on the substantial improvement in the financial position as far as local authorities are concerned in comparision with previous measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a Bill which has been sought for many years.  There are quite a number of acute problems of coast erosion in various parts of the country. In this statement to the Dáil, when introducing the Bill, the Parliamentary Secretary referred to a number of problems but mentioned only three places, all on the eastern coast, Bray, <Col N="753" /> Wicklow and Rosslare.  I am quite sure it is unnecessary for me to remind them that on the west and south west coast there are a number of very acute problems too.</P>
    <P>From time to time complaints have been made to his Department&mdash;which seems to have been the only Department in a position to give at least advice&mdash;in connection with extensive damage in Ballyheigue, Ballybunion and the Magharees.  I hope those complaints which have been registered and which have been followed up in various ways over the years will now get some priority from the Office of Public Works when claims are made by local authorities.</P>
    <P>The co-operation of local authorities, particularly of the engineering staff of local authorities, is very essential in this matter and I was inclined to avail of this opportunity to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should arrange a conference at the earliest date possible after the Bill becomes law for the county engineers of the particular local authorities which seem to be involved in this matter.  I feel there is quite a lot of explanation which could best be given by a verbal exchange of views in connection with the various provisions of the Bill and the interpretation of certain passages contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate that the Parliamentary Secretary had to insert a section to provide for the payment of the expenses incurred in preparing the schemes on a 50/50 basis.  That in itself, will bring home to the local authorities the necessity for submitting schemes which come strictly within the terms of the Bill, and are likely to commend themselves to favourable consideration when they reach head-quarters.</P>
    <P>One Senator said that it would be too bad if, after a local authority in their wisdom had submitted a scheme, that scheme had to be withdrawn, particularly after some investigatory work had been carried out. The local authority would be, so to speak, stuck for 50 per cent of the expenses involved if, due to no fault of their own, the scheme had to be abandoned.  I am sure the Parliamentary <Col N="754" /> Secretary will give a reasonably wide interpretation to the provision and that the local authorities will not be disappointed too often.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to coast erosion in the west and south west has worsened considerably within the past 10 years.  I disagree to some extent with the Parliamentary Secretary when, in introducing the Bill, he suggested that it was probably true to say that the conclusions reached by the inter-Departmental committee, set up 30 years ago, largely still held good.  That may be so in certain parts of the country, but in at least two of the places I mentioned there is a very great problem. The village of Ballyheigue, with 1,100 people, is in danger of being washed away.  Various efforts have been made to get the local authority to do something about it, but the only contributions they were able to make was to erect a wall in part of the threatened area under, I think it was, a Local Authority (Works) Act scheme.  They probably got around it by saying they were preventing flooding, but they were preventing coast erosion.  That, in itself, was only a very interim arrangement but it did a vast amount of good in keeping the sea at bay in that area.  Further down, the damage still continues to take place and the position is very serious.</P>
    <P>I suggest again that conferences with the county engineers of the counties which will have schemes forth-coming would be a very good arrangement, and would help to short-circuit a lot of the anomalies and difficulties that may otherwise present themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to pose one question to the Parliamentary Secretary. We have heard instances and complaints in recent years about the foreshore being closed to the inhabitants in certain areas.  I should like to be assured that, as public money will be spent under this Bill for the prevention of erosion, when the protective work is finished the foreshore which will have been saved by the spending of public money will be kept open to the general public.  I want to ensure against public money being spent to preserve private beaches for latecomers <Col N="755" /> to the country.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to reassure me on that small point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senators on both sides of the House for the co-operative manner in which they dealt with this Bill.  Senator Hayes mentioned the problem that exists in Ring in County Waterford. We have had representations in the past in that regard.  I want to say to Senator Hayes and to the House that it is not a question of having conferences with county engineers&mdash;which were mentioned by Senator Moloney&mdash; but it is a question of each county council concerned ascertaining if there is progressive encroachment and erosion in their areas.  I suggest that they should make an examination of any case within their own bailwick.  It is possible that at this stage a considerable sum of money could be saved if action were taken now.  No matter how small a scheme may be, we will be prepared to have it examined and to pay our contribution, because we appreciate&mdash;and I have no doubt the Minister for Finance appreciates also &mdash;that a substantial saving can be made by taking early action in regard to what might in years to come prove to be very costly and serious erosion.</P>
      <P>It is true, as Senator Hayes said, that local knowledge and practical experience from the top do count.  The local knowledge of individuals and the knowledge of the county engineers will be of great assistance.</P>
      <P>In regard to the point raised by Senator Browne, it is not possible to have a hard and fast rule or a system of design in coast erosion.  Each case will be, like a medical card, dealt with on its merits, and I trust that we will be successful in coming to an equitable solution.  While a system of groynes and the planting of grass may be appropriate in Rosslare, that type of construction might not be appropriate in Kilkee or in Ballybunion or on the west coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to endorse Senator Browne's compliments to the young Irish engineers engaged on that work in Rosslare.  They are definitely very <Col N="756" /> deserving of congratulation.  The experts who advised us spoke very highly of their capabilities.  I should like to take this opportunity&mdash;as I said in the Dáil on one occasion&mdash;of pointing out to Senators that the standard among Irish engineers, and particularly the engineers in our public services, is very high indeed.  So much so that Governments from abroad, from the Continent, from Britain and America, have sent their engineers here to see what they could learn from our Irish engineers, with particular reference to arterial drainage.  We can be justifiably proud of that fact.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne mentioned Section 16.  The Senator might read the section agains carefully.  The Minister might, for example, confirm a scheme costing £200,000.  It might be that when the job was finished, throught wage increases, increases in materials and unforeseen circumstances the job might cost £250,000.  The same proportion will obtain.  The State will contribute up to 80 per cent and the local authority will contribute 20 per cent of the final cost.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne and other Senators also regretted the fact that we could not see our way to give 100 per cent of the cost of these schemes.  In the first instance, he said that, when the previous Government brought in their measure, they gave only 50 per cent of the cost of a scheme and that the present Government were giving 80 per cent but that was not enough.  I am sure the Seanad will appreciate that were this to be a national charge and the local authority were not under a statutory obligation to make a contribution, we would have a flood of feckless schemes with no merits, economic or otherwise.  The question of the local authority having to pay a contribution of 20 per cent of the ultimate cost will certainly, in our opinion, be a reasonable restraint and they will think twice, possibly, before they will send us stupid schemes&mdash;at least that is what we hope.  If they send us stupid schemes they will not get much assistance from us.  We will deal with them and send them back again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> There is another thing.  While the State pays 80 per cent and the local authority pay 20 per cent of the ultimate cost it should be borne in mind that that 20 per cent contributed by the local authority can be obtained by borrowing from the Local Loans Fund.</P>

Now it is of no concern of ours if the Kerry County Council can collect half that sum, 10 per cent, from the people who are benefiting.  For instance, in Wicklow, there is a railway which was being threatened by the sea and if the local authority could get a contribution from the Board of CIE, I am sure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The question of maintenance is, I think, quite clear.  It is only right that the Commissioners of Public Works, a completely outside independent body, having contributed in the main a high proportion of the cost, should see to it that the work will not be brought to nought through lack of proper maintenance.  It might be asked why the local authority, with their local knowledge, are not empowered to carry out this maintenance work.  Human nature being what it is, when the annual rate is being struck&mdash; and we are all trying to bring them down to round figures and reduce them by 8d. or 1/- &mdash;the local authority might be of the opinion that the provision <Col N="758" /> for maintenance charges should be cut, if they were to do the work themselves or the work might be done in a skimpy manner.  That is the reason the Office of Public Works do the work themselves and recover from the local authority.</P>
      <P>Senator, Flanangan mentioned the position in Mayo.  It is not a question of the area of land in respect of which we will consider contributing.  As I said before, each case will be dealt with on its merits and the consideration will not be on the basis of the size of the scheme a local authority put up.  We are quite satisfied, in the main, that county managers, city managers, county engineers and responsible members of local authorities will not send up schemes unless they are of reasonable economic merit.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of valuation, it was suggested by Senator Flanagan that where a coast erosion scheme is carried out, the Land Commission might come along and increase the valuation fixed on a holding.</P>

      <P>Increase the land annuity?  The Senator is wrong whatever he meant.  There is no case.  The Land Commission might do a lot of things but it does not do that.  We can use the same argument in respect of the Arterial Drainage Act.  It does not arise.  I am glad Senator Flanagan raised the matter because it is of interest.</P>
      <P>Senator Desmond urged us in certain areas, such as important beaches generally, to carry out works as soon as possible.  We have not the right of initiating any scheme, much as we might wish the Office of Public Works to do so.  We shall give all the co-operation possible but the proposal in the first instance must be initiated by the local authority and we will be only too glad to examine any suggestion by the local authority that would not cost very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Moloney suggested that we should have conferences of the county engineers dealing with maritime counties. I do not think really that there is <Col N="759" /> such a great number of coast erosion cases in the country and certainly if the Kerry county engineer or Cork county engineer wants to have discussions with our officials at any time, he is very welcome.  I do not know what would be achieved by the county engineers of Wexford, Wicklow, Kerry or Clare coming together.  As I say again, each case is dealt with on its merits.</P>

      <P>We have a standard pattern of operations.  I do not understand how you could have a hard and fast rule.  Perhaps the Senator might let me know what he has in mind.  As I say, each case is definitely different and you could not have a hard and fast rule.  The only hard and fast rule here is the method of procedure by a local authority.  With regard to the actual construction work, it would not be feasible.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy wished to have an assurance that the rights of way for the public to the beaches will be kept open when work is done.  &ldquo;Kept open&rdquo; would suggest that they were open at one time.  I presume what he means is that if the State makes a substantial investment or carries out substantial works, no landowner could, as has been suggested has happened in fact, keep people from enjoying the amenities of the beaches.  That is a sentiment with which we all agree.</P>
      <P>I think it does not need any amendment to ensure that such is the case, but I can assure Senators that so far as our Department are concerned, that will be a primary consideration.  I am very glad the matter was raised.</P>
      <P>I very much appreciate the valuable contributions and suggestions made.  I intend to look into the matter to see if any further action is necessary.  I do not think it will arise.  Again I wish to thank Senators for their suggestions.</P>

    <Col N="760" />
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government, as a matter of urgency, to institute legislation to control, register and otherwise keep under close supervision, premises described as nursing homes, convalescent homes or some such analogous term or purporting to be institutions, homes or rest centres for infirm and/ or aged persons in some of which premises conditions of neglect amounting to cruelty have been discovered by professional and other persons when visiting inmates.</P>
      <P>At this stage in our civilisation, it fills me with sorrow and shame that anyone should have to move a motion such as this.  It is some years since I first got a slight inkling that there were places where the aged and sick, more particularly the incurable cases, were taken in, dumped in deplorable conditions and then forgotten.  On that occasion, I felt that the case mentioned to me was an isolated one and would soon be put in order as at that time I was under the impression that all such places were considered to be nursing homes, were registered and, therefore, subject to inspection.  I also felt that, in her distress, my informant was exaggerating the conditions she had found in trying to find accommodation for her young husband&mdash;an incurable cancer case&mdash;whom she had been advised not to try to nurse at home.</P>
      <P>This motion has been on the Order Paper for a long time.  It was tabled following approaches made to my colleagues and myself on the subject of these places.  The facts made known to me by those who asked me to help were so shocking and revolting that I felt it my duty to report the matter.  I sent the facts I had to the Minister for Health who informed me that he had no function in regard to what he described as, &ldquo;alleged nursing homes&rdquo;. The Minister very kindly indicated that it might be useful if I discussed the matter with the officers of his Department and I arranged to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Feeling, however, that I had perhaps approached the wrong Department, <Col N="761" /> before talking to the officers of the Department of Health, I contacted the Dublin Health Authority and discovered that unless the premises housed a patient for whom the Authority is called upon to make a payment from its funds, there is no inspection and no control of any kind.  It is possible, according to my information, for anyone who has a house with spare rooms, with even an attic, a basement, or outbuildings, to take in persons discharged from hospitals as incurable, the aged or the sick, and literally dump them into beds and leave them there, while collecting fees from relatives for their keep.  I subsequently discussed the problem with an officer of the Department of Health and learned that the situation was as I feared&mdash;that it was considered to be impossible to do anything to control such places or to register or supervise them in any way.</P>
    <P>I know all this sounds like the incredible statement of a crank but I assure you I am no crank; neither am I likely to be misled by wild statements.  The information I have comes from reliable sources, including relatives, professional persons who have actually seen the conditions and in some cases have removed, with much difficulty, people who were consigned to these places before their relatives had made a proper investigation as to the conditions obtaining in them.</P>
    <P>In the interval since the motion was tabled, I have spent much time interviewing persons, professional and otherwise, who have had experience of the conditions existing.  I have been given facts that have confirmed the necessity for supervision of these places and I have been besought to do everything in my power to have some form of inspection introduced.</P>
    <P>As I have already informed the Minister, some of the conditions discovered were: room doors tied with stout cord to prevent any escape; numbers of beds crowded into very small rooms; bed clothes very sparse &mdash;this is in icy weather; no floor coverings and no heating arrangements of any kind&mdash;in one case, four elderly patients were found locked in a room and one of these unfortunate souls was quite insane&mdash;no attendance on bedridden <Col N="762" /> patients and many of these found suffering from bedsores.  Sanitation in practically all these places was bad, linen dirty and food inadequate. I could elaborate much further on this aspect on the neglect of patients, but ordinary delicacy prevents me from doing so.</P>
    <P>These are but a few of the complaints about these money-making premises but a more serious aspect is the fact that there seemed to be no difficulty whatever in these unregistered, uncontrolled establishments obtaining huge supplies of sleeping tablets.  I have given the Minister full details of the careless way they are kept and the immense quantity on hand.</P>
    <P>I have read carefully the replies given by the Minister to questions in the Dáil on the registration of these places and I realise that it might require new legislation to confer a right of inspection of nursing homes generally. I hope he will now change his views as expressed in June, 1961 in Vol. 190, No. 7, of the Dáil Debates:</P>
    <P>I am compelled to the conclusion that the case for doing so is not proven.</P>
    <P>I would impress on the Minister also that these places are not nursing homes in the accepted sense but merely money-making establishments that have sprung up because of the difficulties that can arise in relation to incurably ill persons discharged from hospital or people through age becoming bedridden and relatives having no way of caring for them, no place to keep them, or indeed not wishing to undertake the task.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out to me against my arguments that the unfortunate sick people would themselves complain if their treatment were such as I have described, but if the owner of the premises or some other person is present at a visit or if the patient is kept in a doped condition, a vigorous protest is very unlikely.  In many of these cases, however, it is a sad but true fact that once the relatives have got rid of the burden, there is very little visiting.  Again, as mentioned at the beginning, many of these people <Col N="763" /> have been discharged from hospitals incurable.  They are weak and some of them are even in their dotage.  They do not require medical or nursing care in the ordinary sense and when a doctor requires to be called in, it is easy to put on a show of care and comfort for a time.  These helplessly sick or old people can do nothing for themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said it would be impossible to provide in legislation for minimum standards of care and skill, that it would require the imposition of minimum standards which would impose additional hardships on the persons whom registration is intended to benefit.  I do not think this is so. I would agree with the Minister that minimum standards should be fixed and that he should draw up a suitable scheme, but what the motion deals with is a problem of urgency where something must be done now to control a deplorable situation which exists, even if it is only an interim measure until the Minister and his Department can proceed to build a proper scheme to deal with this problem.  We cannot delay.  Something must be done at once.</P>
    <P>I might be disposed to tolerate the Minister's approach if the establishments catered for persons for whom there was hope of a cure and a return to normal life, but in the main this is not the case.  Many of these places could better be described as resting places for those who are dying and all that would be required would be cleanliness, warmth, the provision of proper meals, an occasional check on their comfort and safety, a kind word from time to time and, when necessary, something to ease the pain administered in accordance with a doctor's instructions&mdash;as would happen in their own home if they had one.  I would describe the treatment and care I am seeking for these poor invalids as what one might expect in a very ordinary Christian home, a home where all that was possible would be frugal comfort. I want the Minister to put some control on the existing establishments, while he and his officers think out a proper scheme to meet the present needs which <Col N="764" /> would give us a system under which these establishments would be under control and open to inspection.  It seems reasonable also to expect that a trained nurse should be in charge of such places.</P>
    <P>I believe it is possible for the Minister to do this and to put an end to the hardships and cruelties which these unfortunate souls are enduring by the introduction of a Bill or an amendment of existing legislation which will, in the words of the motion, &ldquo;control, register and otherwise keep under close supervision, premises described as nursing homes, convalescent homes, <i>et cetera.</i>&rdquo; I believe that if registration and inspection are made compulsory for all establishments of the kind of which I speak, many of the abuses will cease because the owners will not risk the publicity of a prosecution.</P>
    <P>If we can afford an inspection staff to examine hotels and guesthouses to ensure that they provide certain amenities for healthy people who are well able to fight for their own comfort, then we can surely afford a small staff with power to examine homes where infirm people are taken for reward.  It is, however, essential if the Minister agrees to an inspection and that system is to give satisfactory results, that it must be what is known as &ldquo;spot inspection&rdquo; such as takes place in local government audits, with no opportunity for the owners to cover up abuses and so defeat the purpose of inspection&mdash; which it to protect the old and infirm from those who are willing to make money out of the helplessness of invalids and the difficulties or indifference of those to whom they belong.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is aware of, and sympathetic to, the needs of the infirm aged and the chronic sick.  When opening the new geriatric unit attached to Our Lady's Hospice in July last he said&mdash;and I quote from the <i>Irish Press</i> of 19th July, 1962:</P>
    <P>Provision of services for the elderly and the chronic sick must command more concern and practical public effort than it has in the past.</P>
    <P>He further stated on that occasion that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> Among the European States our country was one of those which had a very high proportion of people aged over 65 years in the national population and even with a downward trend in emigration, it was likely that this position would continue for many years.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I believe the Minister is sympathetic to the needs of those on whose behalf I am now appealing to him to take action.  However, his reference to the fact that the position is likely to continue for many years should drive him to support my plea that those who are making money from the needs of these people should be made to run their premises in a proper and humane manner.</P>
    <P>I am certain that if the Minister would, pending the setting up of a proper scheme to meet the problem, introduce a Bill to register places such as are described in our motion, which take infirm or aged persons for reward, he will not find as many obstacles as he fears, and the horrible practices I have mentioned will diminish and eventually cease altogether.  I make this very sincere appeal to the Minister to take strong action without further delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel very inadequate, indeed, in seconding the motion so eloquently proposed by Senator Miss Davidson.  I must confess that up to the time this problem was drawn to my attention I had quite innocently supposed that there was some form of control, that some minimum standards were laid down, determined and enforced for these establishments calling themselves nursing homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we all have a certain respect for the people who provide medical services.  If we go to a doctor, inherently we trust ourselves to him as the man best qualified to help us and we put our health and our lives in the hands of the doctor.  The position is the same in regard to hospitals.  If we go to hospital ourselves, or if a relative goes to a hospital, we have faith that in that hospital everything possible will be done, and that our own individual judgment should not enter very much into it, that they are the <Col N="766" /> people who know best and that they will do the job.</P>
    <P>The same, I suggest, applies to the establishments mentioned in the motion.  I have met people whose parents have been put into these establishments.  They went on the same assumption.  These places advertise themselves and set themselves up as nursing homes, or whatever they are called.  People putting aged relatives into them assume because of that that there are qualified people in them who are best able to look after the sick, the infirm or the aged, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>I have some friends who were equally as innocent as I was in this respect, and who learned to their horror that in fact what they thought were the groundless complaints of aged parents&mdash;the crankiness which comes to us all, even the Minister occasionally&mdash;were justified, that there were no minimum standards in those establishments, and that the people running them had not necessarily any qualification whatever.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is very well aware of the problem of the aged in this country.  The quotation which Senator Miss Davidson gave underlines that fact, but it might be no harm to remind ourselves that the modern tendency in the family, particularly in the city, is that usually the family disperses when the children marry.  Someone is left with the aged parents.  It is usually a girl who has not married, and that girl usually is working to keep the home going.  The problem becomes very real when the parents get old, perhaps bedridden, and require attention.  It is quite impossible for the daughter to provide that service.</P>
    <P>I have met the same problem in wage negotiations.  There seems to be a notion in this country that when you employ a woman in a job, you are giving her pin money, that she does not need any adequate wages, that all she has to do is support herself and buy clothes.  The problems I have come across in my own trade union show that that is not the case.  The daughter who stays at home and is in employment is usually keeping the house going for the aged parent or parents.  Very obviously, such people <Col N="767" /> must stay in employment and cannot provide the continuing attention the old or bedridden parent needs.</P>
    <P>I know there are many excellent charitable establishments which provide for aged people, but the Minister knows better than any of us that there are simply not enough such services and not enough beds and accommodation available.  The problem then is what to do with the aged parents.  The children look around and say: &ldquo;Well, as best we can afford it, we shall put our parents into one of these places. It is a nursing home and we are quite sure that in a nursing home our parents will be well looked after.&rdquo; From what Senator Miss Davidson has told us, that is not the case.  She has more knowledge of and she has certainly spent far more time on the problem than I have.</P>
    <P>I am sure there are very many excellent homes run for profit also which provide good service and proper attention to the inmates, but I am told by people who have actual experience of them that there are very many which are quite inadequate, where no proper attention is given and the accommodation is not suitable at all for bedridden patients.  I do not think it is any answer to say in such circumstances that the relatives of the patients should make themselves aware of the position and remove the patient, if the accommodation and other amenities are not adequate.  That would be very fine if there were a choice of accommodation, but usually with people who are not necessarily sick, who are just old, infirm and not able to look after themselves, it is a terrible struggle to get them into any sort of hospital or accommodation at all.  In many cases, all the relatives can do is get them into this sort of establishment.</P>
    <P>I am told on very good authority that at least some of the homes in the city of Dublin are run and owned by quite undesirable characters.  There is no control whatever over these people. A front can be put on maybe for the visiting relatives but the position generally in those places is quite unsatisfactory.  I do not know to what extent that is so.  I do not know <Col N="768" /> whether there are half a dozen unsatisfactory establishments or a dozen or 30 or 40 but even if there are only one or two, I think the Minister would be justified in imposing certain minimum standards and providing for some form of inspection.  I cannot accept that there is any great administrative difficulty in, first of all, laying down minimum standards, and, secondly, in enforcing those standards. Is there any particular difficulty in providing minimum standards, in providing for inspection of maternity homes?  There does not seem to be and maternity homes can operate, and operate very satisfactorily, with that form of control.  What is the great difficulty in adopting a similar approach to the problem of the sort of homes we are talking about?</P>
    <P>I join with Senator Miss Davidson in making a very sincere appeal to the Minister.  I can quite imagine that, like any Minister, he is reluctant to have more legislation and more controls.  I suppose any Minister would have that natural reluctance to engage in further legislation and further control, the employment of more people to enforce these standards.  But, for the sake of the aged, for the sake of the infirm who, unfortunately, are in these sort of homes, I hope that he will accede to Senator Miss Davidson's appeal and as quickly as possible introduce legislation to provide these minimum standards and for a periodic or some form of inspection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to say too much about this matter but, having listened to Senator Miss Davidson, and having discussed the matter fairly thoroughly with her before signing my name to the motion, I am quite satisfied she has sufficient evidence to give the Minister something to think about.  Coming from an area outside Dublin, I can say this much, that in any of the provincial towns in the country, we have no such cases.  It would not be possible to run a home on such lines in any provincial town because there would be too much gossip in a couple of days.  The attention of someone would be brought to the people trying to run such a home <Col N="769" /> and it would be a failure right away.</P>
      <P>In the country, we have our problems all right with old people but people in the lower income group and people in the middle income group more or less solve their difficulties in one of two ways.  They send the old people to the county home and if they are not kept in the county home, because they are a little too troublesome there, they end up in the mental hospital.  I think young people at the present time do not show sufficient consideration for old people and it is a shame for us, as Irish people, that we should try to get rid of old people in this way when they become a little troublesome in their old age.  In our own mental hospital at Mullingar, we have scores of people who should not be there and we have scores of people in the county home who should not be there.  The particular type of person who comes from a rural area to one of these homes in Dublin is a person who is not in either of the groups I speak of, that is, the lower income group or the middle income group. They are people with a fair amount of property, people who have money who would not like it to be said that they sent an old person to the county home or to a mental hospital.  They come to Dublin, get in touch with one of these homes and the aged person is sent into it.</P>
      <P>I had one experience of a man who was sent to one of these homes two or three years ago.  When he had been there for some time, I decided to visit him.  I had quite an amount of difficulty about getting in to see him.  I was told he was asleep and I would be disturbing him if I saw him.  I said I would come back later in the evening and eventually I got in, under protest. I was determined to see him because his wife had asked me to do so.  When I met him he was in a deep coma. When I went home, I told his wife how I had found him.  I said I believed he had got some drugs that kept him in that condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I began to make inquiries then as to what doctor was attending him.  I could not find out what doctor was attending him.  Eventually, I brought his wife there.  We asked to be allowed to bring the patient away with us.  It <Col N="770" /> was with the greatest difficulty we removed the patient from that home. We actually brought the patient to St. John of God's.  I would not like to have anyone belonging to me in the home where this man was.  That person was paying something in the region of four guineas per week.  It is this type of home that Senator Miss Davidson is trying to deal with.  I would urge on the Minister, as Senator Miss Davidson has done, that if these abuses exist, if there are people cashing in on the difficulties of this type of person, it is high time he took some action to prevent such activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the views of previous speakers in asking the Minister to accede to the spirit of the motion and, if necessary, introduce legislation to do what is set out therein.  We know what human nature is.  We know that the people referred to in the motion are generally old people.  Old people who are put into homes are in most cases fairly helpless.  Many people put into homes of that kind are not what might be regarded as active.  They may not be physically very fit to move around or sufficiently active in mind and body to be able to look after themselves reasonably well.  If they were, they would not be in such a home.  They are put into homes because of some physical disability or ill-health.  There is generally some reason anyway for putting them there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is then a tendency for such homes, which are not under any kind of control&mdash;they may be described as nursing homes or institutions of various kinds&mdash;if they so decide, to exploit the patients.  Where the patient is not sufficiently active to be able to look after himself, with the best will in the world there can be a temptation for the person in charge to take advantage of the situation.  If you have legislation to deal with it, it is a different matter.  There can be a check on the management and a check on the conditions. When the place is open to inspection by some Department of State, the position is completely changed.  For that reason, I hope the Minister will indicate to the House that this matter is worthy of serious <Col N="771" /> attention and that something can be done about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this motion.  I think Senator Miss Davidson is to be congratulated on putting this motion on the Order Paper.  She is also to be congratulated on the amount of research she has obviously put into the case she has presented to the House this evening. I agree with Senator McAuliffe that, by and large, the type of institution complained of is not common in the provinces, in provincial towns.  Probably, public opinion would put it out of business in a very short time. Apparently, the motion refers particularly to the city of Dublin and to other large cities.  I am satisfied, from what Senator Miss Davidson has said, that there is ground for complaint in the cities.</P>
      <P>Unless the Minister can say he is satisfied that no such abuse as that complained of in the motion exists, then I think an unanswerable case has been made for the motion.  I do not think it would be very hard to provide an inspectorate consisting of a few officials to check up on these places and if they did not measure up to certain minimum standards, they should be put out of business.  In this country, we are not thin-skinned about inspections. Since I came into this House this evening, I have been trying to think, at random, about the type of institution and the type of person who is subject to inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Miss Davidson said, hotels are subject to inspection and a hotel cannot hold itself out as a hotel unless it fulfils certain minimum requirements.  The Senator also said that the people whom it is sought to protect by inspection of hotels, are, by and large, well able to look after themselves. Factories are subject to inspection for the protection, safety and comfort of workers.  Offices employing five or more people, I think, under a recent Act of the Oireachtas, are subject to inspection and unless they provide certain minimum comforts for the staff, they are liable to prosecution. Dancehalls, since the year 1935, are subject to licensing and to inspection. <Col N="772" /> Unless they fulfil certain minimum requirements for the safety and health of their patrons, they will not be allowed to continue to cater for the dancing public.  Again, I think the dancing public are, by and large, well able to look after themselves and to boycott such places if they do not measure up to minimum requirements. Shops which provide, sell and distribute food are subject to inspection under the hygiene code.  If they do not measure up to certain standards, they are put out of business.  Cattle lorries are subject to inspection and unless they are kept clean and comfortable, so as not to cause unnecessary suffering to the dumb animals which they haul through the country, their owners are subject to prosecution and penalties.</P>
    <P>Houses in this country which look after unwanted children for reward have been subject to strict supervision for many years past, and very rightly so, because helpless children have been treated badly.  Maybe people have exploited the parent or parents of these children by taking money under false pretences.  Again, the Legislature has seen to it that anybody who takes a child and accepts payment for it has to keep that child in comfort and look after it properly.</P>
    <P>I am sure I could not exhaust the list of people and things that are subject to inspection if I were to talk for the next hour.  Mental hospitals, dog tracks, <i>et cetera,</i> are subject to inspection, but I shall not bore the House with the list.  It is only right that minimum standards should be required.  As I have said, if the case made by Senator Miss Davidson is correct, or if there are even one, two or three of these institutions in the city of Dublin or in Ireland, the Minister should intervene and intervene quickly.</P>

      <P>I should like to add my voice in support of the motion so ably proposed by Senator Miss Davidson and seconded by Senator Murphy.  A great deal has been said by the previous speakers and I am sure that, as a result of what the Minister and the members of the House have heard, we all agree it is necessary that there should be some registration <Col N="773" /> and examination.  I am sure that as a result of this discussion there will be an improvement and that the Minister will do all he can.</P>

      <P>So far, the speeches which have been made by Senators in support of the motion have been based upon an uncritical acceptance&mdash;I use the word advisedly&mdash;of the statement made by Senator Miss Davidson.  Let me recount the history of my relations with the Senator in regard to this particular matter.  On 5th March of last year, she wrote me a letter in which she set out certain complaints made in relation to, I think, five specific establishments.  I replied to that letter and told Senator Miss Davidson that if she cared to do so, I would be glad to arrange a discussion with my officers.  At this discussion the Senator could have elaborated on these complaints and furnished the officers with the information necessary to identify the establishments, which was not contained in her letter to me.  We have heard a heartrending speech from Senator Miss Davidson describing the conditions which are alleged to exist in these five cases.  What Senator listening to that speech would understand that, when Senator Miss Davidson delivered it here, she was speaking from hearsay, that when she wrote the letter to me she was writing from hearsay?</P>

      <P>I am at a loss as to how to proceed and to keep within order, and that I seldom am.</P>
      <P>I was saying, and I repeat, that according to the official record of the discussion which followed on a letter from her, the statements which Senator Miss Davidson has made in the House today were made from hearsay.  I say that the Senator was asked to give information which would enable these complaints to be investigated and that the Senator failed to do so.  I say that the Senator was advised to go back and consult her informant and ask the informant in turn to consult her colleagues familiar with conditions in nursing homes in her district and to get in contact with my Department again.</P>
      <P>That suggestion was made towards the end of March of last year.  I regret to say that despite the speech which she made in this House this evening, and which cannot be construed otherwise than as being an attack upon me for lethargy and indifference, Senator Miss Davidson has not communicated to me the results of those researches for which Senator Fitzpatrick lavished praise upon her.  I am sure Senator Miss Davidson was very zealous in pursuing this matter, but I should be in a much happier position today in addressing this House if the fruits of her researches had been communicated to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick recited a great <Col N="778" /> many cases in which premises are inspected, dwelling houses which are seen to be in an insanitary condition or in respect of which a complaint has been lodged, dwelling houses which are inspected because there is a revaluation taking place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Senator's pardon; I misunderstood him.  The health authority stands <i>in loco parentis</i> to the children involved and has a common law right to enter these houses.  In the case of shops and offices, these are ordinary places of public resort where privacy is not prized and where the inmates concerned do not very strenuously object to an inspection, if that happens to be a statutory requirement.  Premises where food is prepared and served are inspected for public health reasons because food can be quite a ready source of infectious disease and, because of the grave menace that would constitute to the health of the community at large, the Legislature has decided that premises where food is processed and sold will be open to inspection.  That is quite a different matter, as I hope to show, from throwing open to inspection nursing homes and similar institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to get back to the terms of the motion, terms which any person reading them will agree, in my opinion, are more emotional than rational.  I must confess that on first reading of the motion, I was rather at a loss to grasp what precisely was intended.  It seemed to me overladen with ambiguities.  It asks, for instance, for legislation &ldquo;to control&rdquo;&mdash;but control in what sense?  &ldquo;Control&rdquo; as a verb has manifold and highly diverse meanings.  It may mean to dominate, <Col N="779" /> or to command, or to check, as a runaway horse or an unruly child; to operate, as with a machine; or to subject to restrictions.  I have assumed that in the motion it is used as a synonym for &ldquo;regulate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Register&rdquo; caused me less difficulty. I take it that in the context of the motion, it means to compile a list of establishments of a particular type to which the motion refers and compel the owners of such premises to have details of their property and their business recorded there.</P>
    <P>As for &ldquo;supervise&rdquo;, as I interpret the word, it means to oversee works or business, to direct such works or business and the persons engaged in them, superintend them, inspect them and if need be to pry into the conduct of the work or business and all persons engaged in them.  And all this, in the terms of the motion, is to be done &ldquo;closely&rdquo; like an inquisition or, as Americans have it, a &ldquo;probe&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Perhaps some of the Senators who have put their names to the motion do not intend anything like that but nevertheless that is what their motion demands.  What sort of institutions are to be &ldquo;controlled and kept under close supervision&rdquo;&mdash;I am quoting from the motion&mdash;in this way?  Here again I am dumbfounded by the imprecision with which these are indicated. It would appear from its terms that those responsible for the motion intended to bring everything into their net so that every institution, not being a public hospital, in which nursing in any form is carried on is to be subject to superintendence, control and close supervision.  It would appear therefore that the whole spectrum of nursing establishments is to be covered, from nursing institutions of the highest repute.  Mount Carmel, the Bon Secours&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Is this really intended?  Is it really intended that private hospitals&mdash;which is another designation for nursing homes&mdash;such as those attached to the Mater Misericordiae or St. Vincent's are to be controlled, superintended and subjected to close supervision by the State?</P>

      <P>Fifty years ago, when I was a young man in Northern Ireland, no public meeting of the Loyal Orange Order ever disbanded until a motion was adopted calling for the registration and inspection of conventual institutions, hospitals, schools and laundries.  The motions were never effective for the simple fact that the British Government dared not do what the motion before the Seanad calls on the Government of the Republic to do in relation to a very great number, comparatively speaking, of nursing establishments.</P>
      <P>It is of no use to try to disclaim the consequences of this motion.  It is no use in this connection to say that the motion is directed solely at the prevention of abuses alleged to be prevalent &mdash;and I have had no proof of that yet&mdash;in some, but in fact very few, of the more obscure institutions and establishments.  If one institution describing itself as a nursing home is to be subjected to control and close supervision, as the motion demands, then all must be similarly dealt with, no matter how reputable they may be.</P>

      <P>That is the difficulty you find yourself in for appending your name to a motion, the significance of which you did not appreciate. As I said, if one establishment, calling itself a nursing home, is to be inspected, then every other establishment of the same kind must be inspected also.  This follows from Article 40 of the Constitution, which provides that all citizens, lay persons equally with religious, are equal before the law.  Who is to determine whether a place is reputable or not? The law must determine it and the law must determine it when it is brought before the court and every one of them, on the motion, could be hailed before the courts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if they happened to infringe any of the conditions you prescribe for them.  You have set out in the wide and vague terms of your motion that you desire to supervise nursing homes.  And in the meaning and context of this motion, nursing means tending a sick person.  Though this does not necessarily mean to give him drugs and medicine, it does mean to keep him clean and comfortable; to assist him, when he requires it, in his bodily movements; to cheer him if he is downcast; and to ensure that he is fed.</P>
      <P>Any type of nursing outside this, the simplest form of sick care, is specialised nursing, and is nursing which comes under close scrutiny, either by statutory prescription or by members of associate professions. Thus, maternity nursing and maternity homes, and mental nursing and mental hospitals and homes are regulated by statute.  This is done for special reasons. Maternity homes are registered, not only because maternity patients need specialised care, particularly in view of the danger of puerperal sepsis, but also in order to prevent illicit practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mental homes are registered, not only because mental patients require specialised nursing, but in view of the <Col N="782" /> restrictions which it may be necessary to impose on the liberty and freedom of individual patients.  For some patients, such homes are places of confinement and custodial care&mdash;not, of course, for every patient, not for the majority, but for some&mdash;and it is necessary to ensure that the powers of restraint and confinement which are permitted to those responsible for the management and administration of those institutions will not be unnecessarily or unduly availed of.</P>
    <P>Moreover, maternity homes, like mental hospitals and homes, belong to categories which may be readily defined, and for those who nurse in them special qualifications are required. It is accordingly easy to deal with maternity homes and mental hospitals on a statutory basis.  This, it is true, is not the case with general nursing homes, such as are intended for the treatment of serious medical or surgical cases, but in these general homes, the nursing is undertaken under the direction and supervision of the patient's medical attendant or attendants.</P>
    <P>In view of the traditions of the medical and nursing professions, and of the responsibility of the physicians or surgeons for the treatment and wellbeing of their patients, it is not reasonable to believe that the physician or surgeon in a particular case would be so negligent of his professional and personal obligations, as to send a patient to a nursing home where he would be the subject of careless or incompetent nursing.  This view is borne out by the result of a study of the problem which, at my instance, as Minister for Local Government and Public Health, was undertaken in 1945 and 1946.</P>
    <P>I may say that the question of the registration of the general nursing homes had been considered long before that time by my predecessor, in 1933, in connection with the preparation of the Registration of Maternity Homes Act, 1934.  It was decided then that registration would be inadvisable, if not, in fact, impracticable.  The study of the matter, in the letter years which I have mentioned, was made in relation to a proposal submitted by the Irish Nurses' Organisation, on <Col N="783" /> which I asked the Hospitals Commission to report.  In the course of its inquiries, the Commission got in touch with two other bodies, the Irish Nurses' Association and the Irish Medical Association.</P>
    <P>The first of those expressed the opinion that the suggested regulation of nursing homes would reduce employment for nurses, as it would result in making nursing homes too expensive to operate &ldquo;and the demand for their continuance would decline&rdquo;.  In passing, may I say that the continuing decrease in the number of nursing homes managed or administered by private individuals has been a marked feature of latter years?  The association considered that the best safeguard for patients lay in the fact that treatment and conditions generally were under the observation of the doctors attending the patients, and of the patients' relatives, and that in the circumstances it was very unlikely that serious abuse could exist.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medical Association who had been requested by the Commission to send a deputation to discuss the subject, declined to do so, stating that, &ldquo;it is not clear from your letter of 6th February, 1946, that the proposals contained therein deal with matters directly concerning the welfare of our patients&rdquo;.  Eventually the Hospitals Commission reported in June, 1946, that, &ldquo;in the absence of guidance from the Medical Association of Éire the Commission considers that no <i>prima facie</i> case has been made on the grounds of urgency for the registration and inspection of private nursing homes&rdquo;.  It went on to express the view that private nursing homes, as distinct from private maternity homes &mdash;which are already registered&mdash;include various types ranging from those dealing with acute medical and surgical cases to those devoted exclusively to the care of senile cases.  The report went on to say that all those homes serve an extremely useful function in meeting the hospital needs of the people.  It concluded:</P>
    <P>In the meantime it seems to the Commission that it would not be unreasonable to leave to the medical <Col N="784" /> profession the responsibility of indicating when conditions in such homes require supervision.</P>
    <P>Senator Miss Davidson mentioned the letter which she wrote to me in March of last year referring to five particular homes or establishments.  I do not think I am wrong in saying that the information contained in that letter was given to Senator Miss Davidson by a member of the medical profession.</P>

      <P>That is what I am getting at.  Apparently, so far as that particular member was concerned, the confidence of the Hospitals Commission when it said it would not be unreasonable to leave to the medical profession the responsibility of indicating when conditions in such homes require supervision was not well founded, because I understand, and Senator Miss Davidson has led me to believe, whether I am right in that or not, that she has not the permission of that member to disclose the names of the homes in order to enable the conditions in them to be investigated by my officials.</P>

      <P>The onus of making a case for the &ldquo;control and close supervision&rdquo;&mdash;to refer again to the words of the motion&mdash;of any enterprise, occupation, or activity, in which members of the community have engaged themselves rests on those who advocate such &ldquo;control and close supervision&rdquo;. So long as their activities are not contrary to public morals, do not endanger the State, jeopardise public peace, or encroach on the rights and liberties of their fellow-citizens, men and women should be free to engage in whatever occupation or business most appeals to them, or comes readiest to their hands.  It would be a gross violation of their natural rights for the State to subject its people to unwarranted regimentation and regulation.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Prima facie</i> these constitute an evil and, therefore, before they are resorted to, it should be demonstrated that they are a necessary, indeed an unavoidable evil.  I submit that in the light of what I have said here in relation to the statements upon which this motion apparently has been founded, this consideration and the other considerations which I have outlined make it clear that the case for &ldquo;legislation to control, register and otherwise keep under close supervision&rdquo; the premises described as nursing homes is not sustainable.</P>
      <P>Finally, the motion makes the allegation that &ldquo;in some premises conditions of neglect amounting to cruelty have been discovered&rdquo;.  Discovered by whom?

      <P>I am merely saying that on the facts the Senator has recited to the Seanad, I do not agree that cruelty has been manifested in a particular instance.  The Senator may have a very tender heart.  I am a little bit more hardheaded.  I hope in the light of what I have said that the case for the motion is not going to be grounded on the solitary statement which Senator Miss Davidson has made, supported, to the extent to which it could be regarded as being supported, by the statement of Senator McAuliffe.  For one thing it will be noted now that this charge is rather vague and uncircumstantial.  The names of the homes, the names of the premises, have not been given.  The name of Senator Miss Davidson's informant has not been given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We can at least ascertain whether the homes exist.  We can at least ask Senator Miss Davidson's informant to come in and discuss the matter with my officers.  If necessary, if there were no other way open to me, and the matter were of sufficient gravity to warrant it, as Senator Miss Davidson seems to think, I could ask both Houses of the Oireachtas to agree to set up a judicial <Col N="788" /> tribunal to investigate these allegations. But here I am without any scintilla of evidence to go on.  The Seanad is being asked to accept this motion on the basis of something which Senator Miss Davidson heard from a friend&mdash;a friend whose name Senator Miss Davidson is unwilling to disclose&mdash;in respect of five premises the names of which, the addresses and location of which are not known to us.</P>
      <P>Some premises we are told in this motion offend&mdash;not even the generality of premises or how many of them.  Just some premises, a few premises, are unsatisfactory; and, because of these, everybody, no matter how blameless, or how reputable, who is engaged in the management, administration and control of a nursing home, is to be regimented, regulated and subjected to control and close supervision.  That is what the motion in the name of Senator Miss Davidson and other Senators asks for.  Surely it is all contrary to natural justice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But allow me to probe a little further into this allegation &ldquo;of neglect amounting to cruelty&rdquo;.  In the course of many years of service as the Minister directly concerned with this question, first as Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and more recently as Minister for Health, I have from time to time received a few complaints relating to nursing homes but such complaints have been very few indeed.  The last occasion on which specific complaints were brought to my notice was in April, 1960, when a deputation from the Irish Nurses' Organisation was received in my Department.  In the course of the discussion with my officers, the deputation laid particular stress on the subject of nursing homes for the aged, a subject on which it must be assumed the representatives of the Irish Nurses' Organisation were fully briefed.  The conditions in three establishments, described as nursing homes, were specifically referred to, while two others, one long-established and of high reputation, were criticised in general terms.  An examination, however, was made of the three specific complaints by the organisation representing the nursing profession in Dublin, representing the nurses engaged in nursing in <Col N="789" /> Dublin, who might be assumed to be fully aware of the conditions existing generally in nursing homes.</P>
    <P>Let me say what the examination of these complaints disclosed.  One of the establishments animadverted upon was, in fact, a registered maternity home, which suggests that registration is not, in itself, an effective barrier against the development of unsatisfactory conditions. The complaint in another case related to the question of the insufficiency of trained staff.  That is a complaint which arises in connection with a great many industries and professions which are not even registered at all for the purpose of their practice or conduct of their business.  In the third case, the question of trained staff was again raised, and also the question of food.  The question of food of course is of such a nature as would not be affected by any scheme of registration or inspection which we could devise because the cheaper homes are likely to provide the cheaper dietaries.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that in these three complaints made by an authoritative organisation representing the nursing profession not one allegation of cruelty was made.  Not merely that, but the persons who made the complaints, unlike Senator Davidson's friend, were prepared to stand over them and have them made the subject of an investigation.  As against these three exceptional cases, however, it is estimated that, excluding mental homes and maternity homes which do not take in cases for general nursing, there are about 60 general nursing homes in the country.  A considerable number of these are under the management of religious communities or of reputable, charitable organisations.  I do not recall, in all my experience, that I ever received a sustainable complaint against any one of these.</P>

There is no use trying to burke this issue, no use saying: &ldquo;we do not mean what you say,&rdquo; because it is here in black and white what you did say.  Whether you mean it or not is not my business but yours.

      <P>I am coming to that, I hope.  To be fair to those who backed the motion, it is quite possible that&mdash; allowing for the penchant which those who framed it have manifested in this debate for saying more than they mean &mdash;it is more closely aimed at institutions, homes or rest centres for infirm or aged persons.  This being so, I suggest to the House that in institutions catering for the elderly and infirm what is required is kindly and intelligent attention rather than highly skilled nursing&mdash;in short, the sort of care and attention which, if the facilities were available, would be given in his own home by a dutiful son and daughter to an aged parent or relative.  It is because most often such facilities are not available in the home that elderly people find refuge in nursing homes and rest centres.  We must not, no matter how emotional-minded we may become, ignore the hard fact that these centres meet a social need for comparatively inexpensive establishments where the elderly may be card for at the expense of their relatives.  In many cases, such an expense is no light charge on the resources of the family concerned.  Therefore, we must avoid doing anything which would increase it unnecessarily.  In my opinion, we would increase it unnecessarily if we were to legislate to control and keep <Col N="792" /> under close supervision nursing homes for the aged and infirm.</P>
      <P>I do not deny, despite what I have said here, though I have no knowledge of them and no factual information has been furnished to me in relation to them, that there may be exceptional cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of nursing homes or homes for the chronic sick where conditions are below what would reasonably be regarded as minimal.  Doubtless, it is in respect of such exceptional cases, of which a great deal is sometimes said, much more indeed than can be substantiated, that the demand for a scheme of registration applying generally to nursing homes arises.  Naturally, one must sympathise with the sentiments which have prompted such a demand.  The difficulty, however, is to devise some procedure which would check and prevent the exploitation of the aged and infirm, without, at the same time, involving unnecessary interference with those establishments, the great majority of nursing homes, which are well-conducted and provide a satisfactory service for the sick and infirm.</P>
      <P>I have had for some time proposals under consideration which I believe will meet these requirements.  What I have in mind is not a registration scheme but an arrangement for official intervention confined to those cases where there is reason to believe that conditions are unsatisfactory.</P>

      <P>What you were looking for is not necessary.  Health authorities under the procedure which I hope shortly to propose would be empowered by legislation to inspect any premises in which sick or infirm persons are kept for reward, and, if the conditions disclosed are such as to justify such drastic action, the legislation would provide machinery to require the occupier of such premises to desist from the practice of taking in and looking after such persons.  It is <Col N="793" /> proposed to exclude from the scope of the legislation any premises in which only close relatives, and these would be strictly defined, are maintained. The legislation is at present being drafted and I hope it will be introduced in the near future.</P>

      <P>Because of the shocking attack on me in the opening of the Minister's speech, I feel I must say something in my own defence.  In political terms, compared with the Minister, I am a complete greenhorn and I could not in any satisfactory way fight back against the horrible attack he made on me.  He accused me of making a personal attack on him.  I made no such attack on him.  I realised his difficulties from my correspondence with him and from other correspondence and copies of questions with which the Minister supplied me.</P>
      <P>It might surprise many members of the Parties here to know that I always have cherished an affection for the Minister for Health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been connected with politics in this country for a great many years.  I have heard very few say anything nice about the Minister but I always stuck up for him, probably for a sentimental reason&mdash; because he was a pupil of my late father.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to go back now and say that the only desire I have in bringing forward this matter is to clear up this horrible situation which I assure the Minister was brought to my attention by nurses, doctors and people who had visited the homes.  I am not as eloquent as the Minister in any sense and I find it difficult to speak without notes, but I say he is quite wrong when he says that his officers asked me to disclose the names of homes.  They did not and I am prepared to face them in his presence.  They were extremely nice to me.  They interviewed me in the anteroom of the Seanad and it was a very short discussion <Col N="794" /> indeed because they made it quite clear to me that they could do nothing to help me for the simple reason that the Minister had no function in the matter. They did supply me, as I said, with the questions asked in the Dáil and the replies, and they supplied me with a list of nursing homes.  I pointed out to them that the homes on the list they gave me were entirely reputable homes and had no connection whatsoever with the homes of which I was speaking.</P>
    <P>In fact, there is something I do not like to say but I am going to say it because of the Minister's attitude.  I felt so hopeless about the whole thing, and it was so obvious that there was no use communicating any further with the Minister because he said he had no function and could not help me, I mentioned to the officers from the Minister's Department that I had thought of putting a motion down in the Seanad. I was very strongly advised not to do so.  I discussed the matter with my colleagues later and they insisted that I put it down.</P>
    <P>In regard to the drugs, I told the Minister how these drugs were stored in one particular home.  In the correspondence, the Minister never mentioned my reference to the drugs, never asked me where I got the information.  I told him the facts and he never queried them.  His officers never referred to the question of drugs.  I was satisfied the Minister accepted my word because I think I made it clear in my letter that the information was from an unquestionable source and I have in my hand now the doctor's letter with the information in it.</P>
    <P>I think it is really shocking that I was attacked in this fashion.  The Minister quoted the nurses' organisation.  I have here a letter addressed to Senator Crowley, who was not able to be present, from the Irish Nurses' Organisation referring to our motion when it appeared first in the papers.  It is dated 28th May, 1962:</P>
    <P>With reference to the report which appeared in the <i>Evening Mail</i> of the 22nd May about the shortcomings of nursing homes, this Organisation has for years been requesting the Minister for Health to introduce <Col N="795" /> legislation for the registration and inspection of nursing homes.</P>
    <P>In a recent issue of our Journal, copy of which I enclose, we published the last reply we received from the Department of Health.  Our private nurses section&mdash;the Chairman of which is Miss H. Mackey&mdash; has a very keen interest in this whole question and has consistently campaigned for legislation that would afford some protection to old people who are often in no condition to look after themselves.</P>
    <P>The Section suggests that as from our forthcoming Annual General Meeting we should again request the Minister for Health to introduce the necessary legislation for the registration and inspection of all nursing homes.</P>
    <P>I am not the only person interested in this business of the doubtful nursing homes.  In the British House of Commons on 21st November last a Private Members' Bill was introduced entitled &ldquo;Nursing homes&mdash;a Bill to authorise the Minister for Health to make regulations as to the conduct of nursing homes and to repeal Section 192 of the Public Health Act, 1936...&rdquo; and so on.  From that it is clear that even in Britain they are anxious about their old people.  In my speech I did not give the Minister all the information I could have given him.  I have information here that really would shock him or make him go stark staring mad, seeing that what I did say moved him so much.</P>
    <P>I have interviewed people who had relatives in some of these homes.  They did not want their names used because they felt the time might come for them where, having no relatives and becoming infirm, they would be obliged to go somewhere and they would find all doors closed against them if they made complaints.  One very highly educated, very gently-reared lady told me that she visited her friend in a nursing home in Dún Laoghaire.  The old lady in the home was 93 years of age and there was some reluctance about allowing her in to see the patient.  When she eventually pushed her way in, she found the old lady had been attacked by a maid in the <Col N="796" /> establishment because she had made some slight complaint.  To be fair, the maid was not quite normal.  The visitor saw the patient's face scratched and noted her worried state.  She asked the staff what had happened and was put off; told she had had a slight accident and so on.  The result was that the door was closed to her friend on her next visit.  She was informed that as she was not a relative, she had no business there, that she had upset the patient and was not to be allowed in.</P>
    <P>In another case, the person in charge, described as &ldquo;the drunken matron,&rdquo; left a helpless patient alone overnight in the same room with the body of a patient who had died in the afternoon.</P>
    <P>Almost everyone who gives you information on these places uses one phrase, that is &ldquo;an atmosphere of fear.&rdquo;  If there is any suspicion at all that a patient might make a complaint, some member of the staff is planted to prevent any communication.  As I said in my opening speech, in the majority of these cases, there are very few people who bother their heads to visit these old people.</P>
    <P>In spite of the way the Minister treated me, I am delighted to hear him say that he is going to do exactly what he is asked to do in the motion. Nobody knows better than the Minister that we have no intention in this motion of making the slightest reference to the Bon Secours home which the Minister mentioned, Mount Carmel which the Minister mentioned, or the Mater nursing home which I think the Minister mentioned.  We all know they are splendid institutions, but the homes we are concerned with are those where people go who could not afford these. The Minister said&mdash;not quite in these words&mdash;that people who can afford only second-class payment can expect only second-class treatment.  That is quite true, but they should be treated with humanity.</P>

      <P>Not in those terms, as I explained, but it is a handy way for me to describe it.  They cannot pay <Col N="797" /> for the highest treatment, but I think the conditions which I gave the Minister constitute cruelty and if the Minister thinks they must tolerate such conditions because they pay small charges, I cannot agree.  The Minister says it would close these homes if he insisted on improved conditions. I say, close these horrible homes.  Close them and then the State will have the job of seeing what it can do with these people in the county homes where there would be supervision. It would be more humane than leaving them as they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall be grateful, in spite of all the Minister has done to me, if he does what he says he is going to do and does it quickly.  I want again to say <Col N="798" /> firmly, strongly and clearly, that I was not asked either for the name of my informant or for the names of the institutions of which I was complaining.</P>
