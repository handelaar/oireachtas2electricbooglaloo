      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this year, in the course of a debate in this House on the need to regulate the manner in which elderly, sick or infirm persons were maintained in premises commonly and loosely referred to as nursing homes, I announced that it was the intention to introduce legislation to confer on health authorities powers in respect of places of the kind, and to enable the Minister to regulate the standards of care provided in them.  The present Bill proposes to give effect to that intention.  Subject to certain specified exceptions, it provides broadly that where more than one incapacitated person is being maintained for private profit, the person in charge of the premises must notify the health authority in whose area it is situated of the fact; and the health authority, being thus notified, will be empowered to inspect such premises in order to ascertain that the conditions obtaining in them comply with regulations made by the Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not have full information about such premises, nor how many incapacitated people are maintained in them.  There is no reason to doubt, however, that the number of the latter is not insignificant.  Where such persons are properly tended and cared for, those who undertake the task provide a useful service.  Therefore, where their obligations to those in their charge are fulfilled reasonably well &mdash; and in this context I would like to stress reasonableness cannot be assessed without reference to what patients or their relatives can afford &mdash; the State should not interfere.  In the course of the debate to which I have referred some Senators evinced suspicion and anxiety that the care and attention generally <Col N="3" /> given falls short of what it should be; and no doubt in this they reflected the views of others.  The purpose of this Bill is to remove so far as may be, all reasonable occasion for such anxiety and to give health authorities powers which should enable them to eradicate abuses where they exist.</P>
    <P>I would now like to mention a few things that the Bill does not purport to do.</P>
    <P>First, I should make it clear that registration of nursing homes is not provided for.  Under a system of registration the proprietor of a home would have to apply to the health authority, which would then be called upon to inspect and register the place before business could be carried on. But I suggest that the important things which should be considered when determining whether a home of this kind should be permitted to carry on are not so much the amenities attached to the premises, but rather the human qualities of the staff; the kindness, care and attention which they extend to their patients, and which is reflected by these in the degree of happiness and contentment which they manifest in their environment.  Moreover, with a system of registration the description &ldquo;registered&rdquo; could be included in the title of a home.  This might be taken as implying that because the undertaking had fulfilled certain rigid standards&mdash;and rigidity is the last thing we want in dealing with this problem &mdash;a special seal of approval had been conferred on it by the health authority.</P>
    <P>Secondly, Senators will note that nowhere in the Bill is the term &ldquo;nursing home&rdquo; used.  Some of the premises which it will cover could, perhaps, be legitimately described as nursing homes, that is premises in which professional nursing is provided, but not all of them are or, indeed, need be of such a standard; so that it would be inappropriate to designate such places as nursing homes and misleading to allow them to apply the style to themselves.</P>
    <P>Accordingly in directing the preparation of the Bill, I laid it down that a fair degree of elasticity in administering <Col N="4" /> it should be provided for and that the minimum standards prescribed under the Bill must not be such as to put out of business any home in which accommodation, feeding and care suffice for the frugal comfort of those staying in it.  If an attempt were made to impose higher standards very many undertakings which meet in a reasonably satisfactory way the needs of an invalid whose family circumstances are modest would be faced with the option of closing down or making their charges prohibitively high.  I am sure that those who have been anxious that something should be done in the matter of such homes would not desire this.</P>
    <P>And now for the details.</P>
    <P>Section 1 defines the premises to which the Bill will apply.  It will be noted that there are exemptions in certain circumstances.  There is, for instance, an exemption in respect of the maintenance of close relatives, as defined in the section.  Then there is the case of the home where, say, the proprietor was a trained nurse and, having the necessary skill and perhaps free time, she agreed to take in an incapacitated friend on the understanding that the latter would pay for the care and attention she got there.  To meet this case, a home where only one person is kept is exempted.  Maternity homes obviously had to be excluded from the provisions of the Bill, since there is an effective system of registration and control in respect of them under the Registration of Maternity Homes Act, 1934: the same is the case also with institutions for the care of the mentally ill, which are already subject to surveillance under the Mental Treatment Acts.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that Section 1 also provides that the measure will be construed with the Health Acts, 1947 to 1960 and, in particular, that a reference in the Health Act, 1947, to that Act will be construed as including a reference to the new Act.  These are most important provisions.  By reason of them it will be possible to apply to premises covered by the Bill the adequate powers of inspection of premises which health authorities and their <Col N="5" /> officers already have for the purpose of enforcing the Food Hygiene Regulations and other enactments relating to-health.</P>
    <P>Section 2 specifies the matters on which the Minister may make regulations. These may include the numbers and qualifications of staffs, the design, maintenance, repair, ventilation, heating and lighting of the home, the amount of space in bedrooms and wards, washing facilities and sanitary conveniences, the quality of the food served in the home and the standard of cleanliness.  This list may appear intimidating, but I would repeat that it is not my intention that the standards prescribed should be excessively difficult to reach.  Contravention of a provision of the regulations will, however, under sub-section (3) of this section, be an offence punishable by substantial penalties: in addition to provision for fines and imprisonment, there is to be a power for the court to disqualify a person convicted of an offence under the Act from carrying on, or taking part in the management of, a home for the incapacitated.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the notification to health authorities of the names and addresses of homes to which the Bill applies and of the names of the persons in charge of them.  This will apply both to homes in operation when the Bill becomes law and to new homes opened thereafter.  It is hoped, by the operation of this section, to ensure that the health authority will be fully informed of the existence of all homes in their area.</P>
    <P>Some concern may be felt for the home where, upon inspection by the health authority's officer, it emerges that conditions are not all that they might be.  The proprietor of such a home may be quite willing to rectify defects, if reasonable time were given for him to do so.  Since the initiative in taking prosecutions for offences against the provisions of the regulations will, under Section 4 of the Bill, rest with the health authority, it may be assumed that the health authority in such a case would allow the proprietor of the home such an opportunity.</P>
    <P>Many elderly, infirm or other <Col N="6" /> incapacitated persons who cannot be cared for by their families, need no special nursing care apart from some little assistance in the ordinary physical functions.  One thing, however, must be assured to them, their food must be kept fresh and uncontaminated and handled and served with no less consideration for standards of hygiene than is demanded in the case of hotels and boardinghouses.  Under Section 5 of the Bill, the provisions of Section 64 of the Health Act, 1947 will accordingly be applied to those premises to which the Bill applies; so that those concerned with the preparation, keeping and serving of food in them will be required to comply with the appropriate provisions of the Food Hygiene Regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill is a saving clause in respect of the care and treatment of persons who are mentally ill. It is aimed at ensuring that, though a person who is&mdash;to use a homely word &mdash;&ldquo;bothered&rdquo; may be maintained and cared for in a home of the type with which this Bill deals, there will not be conferred on such homes any right to receive or care for a person suffering from a mental illness which should properly be treated in a statutorily approved mental institution.</P>
    <P>Under Section 7 regulations made under the Act must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  Since the livelihood and freedom of individuals conducting these homes might be affected by the conditions imposed upon them under the regulations made under Section 2, it is important that the Houses of the Oireachtas should have the opportunity of seeing and approving of these conditions before they become obligatory under the law.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to An Seanad for a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this Bill gives some hope for our desperately sick and for our aged citizens.  I thank the Minister sincerely for bringing in the measure and I am sure he will forgive me if I say that I feel proud that my efforts and those of my colleagues to get such a measure on the Statute Book contributed in <Col N="7" /> some degree to the decision he has taken.  In any case, I offer him sincere and genuine congratulations.  If there had been provision in the Bill for registration it might have been described as a charter for the helpless.  Due to the publicity following the earlier discussions on the subject many of these alleged homes have already been cleaned up and made somewhat more cheerful but much has still to be done. All these reforms hinted at in the Bill still require to be done from the patients' point of view.  Food is still inadequate, skilled attention is absent, the new look has not yet reached the inmates.  With this Bill, with the Minister's further co-operation we might be able to measure our standard of civilisation by the condition of the less fortunate of our citizens and stand before the world with our heads erect.</P>
      <P>The points set out in Section 2 (2) (a) to (f) inclusive seem to cover much of what is necessary to approach the problem of the inmates of these homes.  I should like to hear the Minister enlarge somewhat on paragraph (b) of the section which refers to the qualifications of staffs of the homes.  Will the Minister require proper nursing qualifications or will his regulations put an end to the prevailing practice of dressing up untrained persons and giving them the title of nurse or matron and so forth?  I should also like the Minister to state in his regulations the ratio of trained, qualified personnel to the number of patients.  Another point to which I should like to refer is that, generally speaking, there is no regular visit of a doctor to these homes.  He is only called in when there is an emergency.  It should be necessary that when any person has to administer drugs, even ordinary sleeping tablets, it be done only under medical direction and by a person who would understand the strength and effect of the substance being administered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The source of supply and the stocks kept on hand should be registered and this register should be open to inspection. The Minister felt that I exaggerated in my reference to stocks of <Col N="8" /> sleeping tablets kept in some of the homes but I can assure him I did not. At column 775, of volume 56, No. 9 of the Seanad Debates the Minister said, referring to me:</P>
    <P>She has told us about barbiturates in a bottle, quite forgetting to remind the House that barbiturates can be supplied only on a prescription and that the supply of them is very carefully controlled.</P>
    <P>I do not want to bring the Minister thundering down on my head again because I fully appreciate what he has done in introducing the Bill but I should like him to make sure of his information in regard to barbiturates. What he says is in effect what the position should be but is it the position existing at present?  As an example of why I am so worried about this question of barbiturates let me quote from the <i>Irish Press</i> of 23rd May 1963, just about six weeks after the Minister wiped the floor with me for what he felt was my lack of correct information in regard to the availability of drugs.  The report in question gives details about an unfortunate woman whose death, according to the coroner, was due to barbiturate poisoning. This poor creature, described as being of no fixed abode, had taken sufficient tablets to cause her almost immediate death.  In her handbag were found 20 capsules and 75 tablets and in her room in the house in which she was employed two further bottles of barbiturates were found.  Surely this poor woman did not get her large supplies of barbiturates from &ldquo;a carefully controlled supply&rdquo;.  I make this reference merely to impress on the Minister that there must be some source from which these substances can be got without control and that this source should be traced and closed up.</P>
    <P>I confess to being disappointed at finding that the aim of the Bill is not to register these homes but merely to give the Minister power to make regulations to bring about reforms.  As we all know, a Minister need not act under the powers or he might make inadequate regulations and the only redress the members of the House would <Col N="9" /> have would be to annul the regulations when they are eventually presented.  I do not think we have power to amend them.  I do not believe for one minute that the Minister proposes to ignore the regulations when he has made them but I can see no real reason why he should not write specific regulations and requirements into the Bill so that we could all help him to improve the measure rather than have the House pass a mere skeleton Bill and then find the regulations inadequate or find, at some date, a Minister not willing to see them through.</P>
    <P>The success or failure of this Bill, to my mind, rests on the questions of inspection and supervision.  Therefore, Section 2 (2) (g) troubles me a bit.  It says that among the things the Minister's regulations will do is to &ldquo;(g) provide for the enforcement and execution of the regulations by health authorities and their officers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Would the Minister say (a) if there are available in the local authorities, officers who could be allocated to this work; (b) would such personnel have the necessary training and the experience to enable them to assess the condition of patients, the adequacy of their diets and treatment, the cleanliness of the premises, including the kitchen and food preparation quarters, and also be able to judge whether, in general, the inmates were being properly cared for, and (c) would there be any provision that a person or persons authorised to inspect the homes would be enabled to interview in private any person in the home for the purpose of investigating any complaint as to his or her treatment or where the inspecting officer himself had reasonable cause to believe the person was not receiving proper care?  A visit, say, to the carpeted reception area of homes would serve no useful purpose.  The actual patients' rooms must be visited and if they were visited around mealtime so much the better.</P>
    <P>I have made some inquiries regarding inspections.  I find that, while the Minister has power to appoint officers in the local authorities for certain inspection duties, in some authorities at least there have never been any such <Col N="10" /> specific appointments made and such visits and inspections as are made are generally carried out by &ldquo;visiting commitees.&rdquo;  So far as my information goes these visiting committees are committees such as visit prisons and so on.  I particularly want the Minister to realise that I am not using this reference to inspection officers or visiting committees in any slighting manner but only to direct his attention to the fact that such inspecting officers would need very special training if they are to do what I believe the Minister wants done &mdash; in relation to subparagraphs (a) to (f) of Section 2(2) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I referred briefly on an earlier occasion to the British Nursing Homes Bill which was an extension of existing legislation there.  I should like to refer to part of the discussion which took place on that Bill when it was before a Select Committee of the House of Commons.  The following is an extract from the report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons dated 23rd January, 1963, at column 5. Mr. Kenneth Robinson, Labour M.P. for St. Pancras, said:</P>
    <P>It is clear ... that the existing regulations are inadequate or that they are not being, in all circumstances and in all areas, properly discharged by the local authorities on which the responsibility for the inspection and control of these nursing homes lies.  It may well be that local authorities have not the staffs necessary to do the job.  If this is the case, this Bill may go only a very small way towards rectifying a situation which I think has been revealed as being altogether unsatisfactory in many respects...</P>
    <P>Discussing the problem further, in the same report, as reported at columns 8 and 9, Mr. Norman Dodds, Labour M.P. for Erith and Crayford, said:</P>
    <P>I welcome this measure as being a step in the right direction.  But we should be &ldquo;kidding&rdquo; ourselves if we believed that a satisfactory solution to the problem can be provided by this Bill.</P>
    <P>My Hon. Friend, Mr. Robinson, said that much of the present dissatisfaction <Col N="11" /> exists because local authorities do not possess the necessary staffs to undertake proper supervision.... There are too many elderly people to be accommodated by the existing nursing homes.  Local authorities are aware of the severe limitations of some of the homes but they are also aware&mdash;as this Committee should be&mdash;that there is no other accommodation available for the patients in those homes...</P>
    <P>He continues:</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Government should take a lead in providing a solution to the problem.  It is wrong to suggest that the local authorities are fully to blame, for the problem is too big for them to tackle.  The matter must be dealt with before it is too late.  I suggest that such a course of action might be regarded as a form of &ldquo;insurance&rdquo; because some Hon.  Members may one day find themselves in need of such accommodation... I support the Bill but let us go on to something which is bigger and better...</P>
    <P>In a later discussion of the Nursing Homes Bill in the Standing Committee, Mr. Kenneth Robinson, M.P., used words which I think are worth repeating.  They are as follows:</P>
    <P>This measure represents a valuable potential safeguard.  It is potential only so long as local authorities have inadequate staffs, as is the case with most local authorities today. Staffs are inadequate in number, qualifications and experience.  Since this Bill empowers the Minister to lay down regulations, there is clearly a responsibility upon him to see that his regulations are complied with.  I hope we shall receive an assurance ... that unless the Minister is satisfied that inspections are being properly carried out, he will use his powers to see that the local authorities obtain the necessary personnel to carry out inspections...</P>
    <P>I have used these quotations to help the Minister to appreciate the difficulties which the members of the House of Commons met in a country where most nursing homes&mdash;and homes for <Col N="12" /> aged people&mdash;were already registered&mdash; the Bill being discussed was merely to extend the scope of existing legislation.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if it is the intention that inspection would be carried out without any previous warning to the owners or persons in charge of the homes&mdash;spot inspections. I think such procedure is essential if the maximum results are to be achieved.  It should be impressed on all inspectors that they do not, as I said earlier, remain in the reception area but enter into the patients' rooms, into the kitchen quarters and, if possible, to time their visits to coincide with meal hours when they could inspect the patients' food.</P>
    <P>Another question I would ask is this.  Will homes have regularly to send in details showing the number and ages of the patients?  Will regard be taken of room temperatures?  Will precautions be taken against fire? Will notice be taken of fire escapes, floor coverings, screens, night services, and so on?  Will any form of registration certificate be issued stating the number of patients who may be accepted into the home?</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would help the Minister to appreciate my misgivings about some points in the Bill if I mention the difficulties experienced by a local authority which came up against grave difficulties in dealing with unsatisfactory homes for aged and disabled persons and which overcame these difficulties by promoting its own Private Members' Bill.  That Bill is now known as the Hertfordshire County Council Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>As Senators probably know, Hertfordshire is an area of England where there is a lot of residential development within reach of London.  It has tended to have a large number of nursing homes and old persons' homes privately run.  The county council found that some of the homes were unsatisfactory and that standards were poor.  The management, in some cases, were completely unco-operative and in these circumstances it was difficult for the council to do anything.  The homes were registered under the <Col N="13" /> National Assistance Act, 1948.  While these Acts provide for a person to be registered to run a home, they do not allow for conditions to be attached to a registration and the only remedy in the case of an unsatisfactory home was for the council to cancel its registration. There was, however, an appeal to the magistrates' court.</P>
    <P>Cancellation of registration was considered an extreme remedy: not only did it deprive proprietors of their livelihood but, more important, it had the effect of turning out of the premises a large number of old and sick people who had no other place to go. There was the difficulty also that whilst it was one thing for the medical officer and the social worker to be certain that the home was unsatisfactory, it was very often a completely different thing to be able to prove it in a court of law to the degree that the extreme remedy of cancellation of registration should be upheld in that court.</P>
    <P>The Hertfordshire County Council felt, therefore, that what was needed was a provision which would enable a registration to be granted subject to a number of detailed conditions designed to establish and secure the maintenance of reasonable standards within the homes in question.  This they did by having their Private Bill passed into law and incorporating their conditions of registration in certain sections of the Act.  A breach of any condition amounted to an offence punishable by a fine in a magistrates' court.</P>
    <P>The Clerk of the Hertfordshire County Council, Mr. Neville Moon, said in October of this year, that as a consequence of the passing of their Act&mdash;and I quote him&mdash;</P>
    <P>We have had a firmer control over private homes in the county and any new applications for registration have been tied up most carefully with properly designed conditions.</P>
    <P>It might be no harm for me to add that in August this year the British Minister of Health made regulations under the Nursing Homes Act, 1963, which deal with the problem nationally in much the same way as do the <Col N="14" /> appropriate sections of the Hertfordshire Act, in that they lay down standards to apply to all nursing homes and to provide that a breach of any particular standard leaves the management of the home open to prosecution.</P>
    <P>I would make an appeal to the Minister on this measure and at this stage, when it would be easy for him to do so, to follow the good example of Hertfordshire County Council and, instead of relying on regulations, to write his specific requirements into the Bill and make it a bigger and a better Bill than that we have before us.</P>
    <P>When I was seeking information concerning the needs of our aged and incurably ill people, there was always the shadow which lay over the scene.  It was agreed that extensive reforms were needed but the question to which the Minister has already referred was how far could we go before we priced the refuge beyond the means of the sufferer and his family?  That is where I would repeat the British Labour M.P.'s words: &ldquo;The Government should take a lead in providing a solution to the problem.&rdquo; I think the Government can do this.  Tuberculosis is today, happily, almost a thing of the past.  Great institutions were built to deal with that scourge.  They are not needed any more, thank God.  Newcastle Sanatorium and soon, I think, Blanchards-town, will be unoccupied.  Could not these fully equipped hospitals be used to take a very large number of our aged and incurable citizens, keep the staffs in employment, relieve the pressure on private homes and reduce the temptation to overcharge for skimped services?</P>
    <P>I am always interested in new employment openings.  The need for the right type of inspection staffs set me thinking on how that problem might be met.  There are very many young people anxious to enter the nursing and medical professions, most of them well educated.  Competition for entrance to the medical schools is very keen and most of us will know of young persons who have failed to get a place because they could not quite make the grade in, say, French, mathematics or some other subject.  We also <Col N="15" /> know many good doctors who have not a word of any foreign language and who are poor enough at other non-medical subjects.  The young people to whom I refer would, in many cases, find a useful and rewarding career if they, with their leaning towards medicine, were trained not to practise medicine or undertake nursing duties, but trained to know and appreciate what was right treatment for sick persons, what constituted proper hygiene and cleanliness in hospitals, nursing homes, what was adequate sanitation, <i>et cetera.</i>  These young persons would not displace any of the necessary nursing and/or medical staffs.  Their new occupation would constitute an outlet for Irish youth with a desire to work among the sick. They would become a hospital inspectorate service which, after full training and under Government or Local Government control, would in due course provide the staffs necessary under Section 2 (2) (g) of the Bill we are discussing.  They would be the officers to ensure the enforcement and execution of the things necessary to make the Health (Homes for Incapacitated Persons) Bill much more satisfactory.</P>
    <P>To be effective, the contemplated inspection staffs will need to be active and energetic.  There will be much climbing up and down stairs if their job is to be done properly.  Every part of the establishment must be looked over.  How often have we been struck by the beauty of the rooms and appointments of an ocean liner only to be shocked by an outbreak of discontent among the crew because of the dirty, insanitary, over-crowded accommodation allocated to them in the floating palace?  How often, too, have we admired the tasteful refinements of hotels to be horrified when labour discontent highlighted the far from acceptable conditions prevailing in the staff and kitchen quarters.  I often wonder how many boards of directors, discussing the affairs of their industries, make it their business to go down and see the conditions under which their lowest grade workers do their jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to say that the same thing would apply to institutions and the boards of directors that run them.  I was wondering if such boards of directors, or members of such boards, ever leave the elegant boardroom to nose around wards, workshops and kitchens where the real functions of the institution are being performed.  After all, we do hear many grumblings concerning things that could easily be rectified by adequate inspection staffs or vigilant boards of directors.</P>
      <P>Before concluding, I would again like to stress the views of the members of the House of Commons, when discussing their Bill, and to say it is my belief that at the moment our local authorities have not the inspection staffs available with the special training necessary, and the available time, to take on this extra work of inspection under this new measure.</P>
      <P>I notice in Section 1 (1) line 19 at (a) that premises in which no incapacitated person is maintained for private profit are excluded and not subject to inspection.  Would the Minister say if this means that a home run by a charitable organisation would be excluded? What prompted me to ask the question is that surveys made by a team from the London School of Economics, who inquired into this problem, have shown that on the whole the best care of old people has been in the voluntary and charitable homes.  All of these homes, however, might not be of equal excellence and, indeed, some of the institutions might be glad of guidance.  I am sure such institutions would have no objection to inspection.  I should just like to hear the Minister's views on that point.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will give consideration to the points I have mentioned and, where possible, meet me on them.  I would repeat my congratulations and thanks to him for introducing the Bill, and express the hope that as a result of its passing a horrible blot will disappear from our national life.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with Senator Miss Davidson in congratulating the Minister on having introduced this Bill.  I do not propose to go into the Bill in the detailed manner in which Senator Miss Davidson dealt with it.  She has obviously given us a full review of requirements in relation to the system of inspection, the desirable standards in various regards and so on.  I do not think there is any need for me to cover that ground.</P>
      <P>I have two reservations about this Bill.  The first, as has already been voiced by Senator Miss Davidson, is in relation to registration.  I think it would be more satisfactory if the Minister could see his way to have some system whereby there would be a list of recognised nursing homes or recognised homes for incapacitated persons, if you like to put it that way, and not leave the position so much in doubt as I think it is now and will be in the future.  There is provision in the Bill that anybody wishing to start such a home has to inform the local authority and get recognition for the premises in which this home is to be run.  I do not see how this avoids the difficulty the Minister mentioned of having a certain amount of official recognition for that particular home.  I do not see that there is any great difference between the home that has been started anew and one that already exists in that regard.  Such conditions do not apply to the home already existing.  In any case, how is the local authority to know about those already in existence? There is now no list of nursing homes, or any other kind of homes, for incapacitated people.  It is very difficult if one has to tell medical students about these places.  For instance, it is a matter of research to find out how many there are in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of assessing their standards and the form of regulations the Minister is going to lay down, we are starting with the difficulty of not knowing where to send our inspectors.  In fact, we have to wait for complaints.  There are some who send complaints to the local authority and then the local authority can send the inspectors around to find out what <Col N="18" /> is the nature of the complaint and have a general look around.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is the position about those in respect of which complaint has been received, nor do I feel that because no complaint has been received, one can assume that everything is in order.  There are many incapacitated people who do not know when they are not being cared for. Many do not know when they are being underfed.  Medical people constantly come across cases in which the only complaint is insufficient food and the patient is unaware that this is the only thing that is wrong.  If that condition exists in a home of which the local authority has no knowledge and in respect of which no complaint has been made, then I do not see what is going to be done about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the debate on Senator Miss Davidson's motion in volume 56, column 792 of the Seanad Debates that there would be an arrangement for official intervention in cases where there is reason to believe conditions are unsatisfactory. Could the Minister tell us the circumstances in which there is reason to believe &ldquo;that conditions are unsatisfactory&rdquo;? I think this is difficult. Therefore, I think all this will disappear if there is a list of those places and if they are, in fact, registered.</P>
    <P>The second reservation I have is in relation to the definition of incapacitated. The Bill says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;incapacitated&rdquo;, in relation to a person, means suffering from&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  physical infirmity or a physical injury, defect or disease, or</P>
    <P>(b)  mental infirmity or a mental handicap</P>
    <P>that renders the person incapable of looking after himself;</P>
    <P>Am I in order in referring to old people who are not, in fact, incapacitated according to that definition? There are many people in this country, and in all countries, who are not able to look after themselves but who could not be said to be suffering from &ldquo;physical infirmity or a physical injury, defect or disease, or mental <Col N="19" /> infirmity or a mental handicap&rdquo;.  This is a section of the population that we have to consider.  Everybody knows that the old people in the population constitute an increasing problem for two reasons.  There are more of them because people live longer on account of the more effective treatment for diseases from which they died formerly. They also constitute a problem because the family is less able to look after them.  The absence of domestic help, the increasing tendency for mothers to have some kind of gainful occupation, are factors which make it impossible very often for an elderly person, even when he is not disabled, to stay at home.  I think these people are a problem and if they do not come under the definition in this Bill, then I suggest the Minister should think of some means of covering them either in this or some other measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedOSullivan" hpid="Mr. Ted O'Sullivan Mr. Ted O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ted O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister has satisfied himself of the necessity for this Bill.  As far as I know at any rate in Cork and the south generally there is no necessity for it.  Our big problem is that we have not got the nursing homes suitable for accommodating people of this type.  We have, of course, our county homes in west, south and north Cork. There is St. Joseph's and St. Patrick's for very sick people, and St. Kevin's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know of any homes in Cork, city or county, on a par with the homes here in Dublin described by Senator Miss Davidson and the Minister as requiring this legislation.  Our big trouble is that there is not sufficient accommodation for people who are senile and cannot look after themselves with the result, as everybody knows, that our mental hospitals are over-crowded with people who, I think at any rate, are not fit cases for a mental hospital, people who do not require restraint but who yet are unable to look after themselves.  If we had more nursing homes, in the South at any rate, to cater for aged people we would be better off.  There is a big demand at the moment for homes to cater for those people.  The time will come when these homes will have to be established, when the county home and these <Col N="20" /> places to which I have referred are overcrowded.  Then people must turn to private nursing homes to get accommodation and the private nursing homes are not there.  Then the cost of maintenance in a private nursing home is beyond the capacity of ordinary people.  Only people with considerable private means can get this accommodation, but when these private nursing homes are inspected and passed by the health authority is there any reason why the health authority should not contribute something towards the maintenance of people with smaller means?  If they were maintained in the county home or in a mental hospital the health authority would pay for them in full.  If they have slender means and can contribute something in a private nursing home then the health authority should also contribute something.</P>
    <P>However, our big trouble in the south is that there are not sufficient nursing homes to cater for the aged and mental hospitals are overcrowded. For that reason we do not see any necessity for the Bill so far as that part of the country is concerned.  I realise from what I have heard from the Minister and from Senator Miss Davidson that there is a necessity for it in Dublin and if there is I am sure the Bill will deal with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on the Bill, I should like to direct my remarks almost entirely to the problems of old age and especially to the people who are incapacitated through old age.  This is clearly a growing problem in all our Western civilisation. I quote a research worker in the field, Dr. Martin Gumpert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Around 1800 we discovered the Rights of Man.  Around 1900 we discovered the child and his rights and we have done much good and some bad to make up for our previous neglect.  We should not have to wait in this accelerated century until the year 2000 to discover the aged and their rights....  We can do it here and now.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem is going to face us more and more as the Minister well knows in this country.  Further, it <Col N="21" /> happens that in this country the proportion of aged people is higher than in many other countries in the Western world.  There are two reasons mainly for that: one is emigration of our younger people; the other is the fact that Irish people on the whole live longer than people in more hectic countries than our own; to quote one piece of statistics, the proportion of old people, people over 65 in 1959, was 10.7 per cent here, and in the United States it was 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>In this country we are going to have more and more people incapacitated through old age.  On the other hand, the existing provision in hospitals and homes of various kinds is undoubtedly not up to the standard of many of our neighbouring countries.  Dublin Corporation has done a certain amount. Recently we had a private Bill from the Iveagh Trust to set up a home for elderly people near the canal in Rathmines. Many religious and secular bodies provide homes on a voluntary basis.  On the whole, however, the provision is totally inadequate, and there will be more and more demand for some kind of provision for elderly people.</P>
    <P>As Senator Jessop said, it is not easy to draw the line between &ldquo;incapacitated&rdquo; and &ldquo;not incapacitated,&rdquo; and I would ask the Minister to consider the definition once again.  It would be very hard to say in certain cases that this or that old person is fit to look after him or herself, or not, and I would like to know what the Minister has in mind regarding the meaning of &ldquo;incapacitated&rdquo; here.  Will people who are senile but who are not suffering from a definite physical infirmity, injury, defect or disease come under the Bill or will they not?</P>
    <P>On the other hand, as Senator O'Sullivan said, there is a large degree of State responsibility here.  These citizens of ours have deserved well of the Republic.  They deserve as much care as sick people.  This is an urgent and a growing problem.  In general, before I turn to the Bill, may I suggest that the Minister consider setting up a commission to inquire into the problems of old age in the Republic? There are some voluntary bodies at <Col N="22" /> the moment who are facing the problems and which are trying to meet them, but I believe they should be faced on a national scale and that a commission of this kind might do very much good.  Again, we might need subsidisation on an increasing scale, increasing because, as is generally recognised, the proportion of elderly people will steadily increase.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Bill itself, my first complaint is that it is not nearly strong enough, that there is not nearly enough bite in it.  First of all, it is simply permissive. We read in one section &ldquo;the Minister may&rdquo; that, I am certain, should for the good of the country be &ldquo;the Minister shall&rdquo;. It should be a mandatory Bill.  I should like to know what the Minister's intentions are if it remains &ldquo;may&rdquo;. I should like to hear why he has not used the stronger word.</P>
    <P>This Bill in other words, only promises action on a matter to which the Minister's attention has been repeatedly drawn over many years. Nothing may come of this clause of the Bill so far as I can see if the Minister does not decide to act.  I would appeal to him to consider changing that &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (a) of the Bill says that the regulation should govern all nursing homes except those which are not run for private profit.  I do not think that this is a good exemption.  We know that there are many excellent homes run by religious and charitable bodies and that no profit is made, but it may well be &mdash; and information I have received tends to make me think so &mdash; that there are homes run by bodies of this kind in which conditions are not satisfactory.  That may be untrue, but it should be looked into, and the only way that can be done is to have inspection and registration of these homes &mdash; where charitable or religious bodies through no fault of their own lack funds perhaps &mdash; to see that conditions are fit for our elderly people.</P>
    <P>I do not like this exemption of premises which are not maintained for private profit.  Although run by the kindest and most well-meaning people, sometimes the premises may constitute <Col N="23" /> even a danger to their patients.  The law should be the same for all in this matter.  This loophole should not be left.</P>
    <P>In Section 1 (b) we have an exemption of premises in which not more than one incapacitated person is maintained. Why should one person suffer when two people, say, will not under this law?  Why do we not think in terms of one unfortunate person?  &ldquo;If one sparrow falls to the ground&rdquo;, is the phrase in the new Testament.  Why should we consider legislation for two sparrows and not for one, so to speak. There could be hundreds of people in separate homes, one at a time, suffering from unsuitable conditions.  There may be some administrative difficulty, or other difficulty, but personally I do not like it.  I do not think one person should be thrown open to be the victim of any kind of extortion or ill-treatment. I am not saying these things are happening in our country.  Some people say they are.  I am saying that there is a possibility, and we should legislate against that possibility.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Jessop and Senator Miss Davidson that all nursing homes should be registered, and that a list of them should be available to the public.  I believe, and I think this is what they imply, that no nursing home should be allowed to receive patients unless it is registered.  No home should be registered until it has been inspected by a qualified officer as to the suitability of the premises and the adequacy of the staff.  I know this is a big question.  I know there may be difficulties.  But I believe that this is where justice lies.  When registration has been effected a certificate of registration should have to be, by statute, visible in the entrance to the home, as has been done in maternity homes.  In hotels the same thing happens.  Why not here?  It would be a good safeguard.  Why not include it in the Bill?  We should also provide, perhaps not in the Bill, but by regulation, for occasional inspection, as in the case of shops, hotels and schools. Every home should be registered, and every registered home should be subject to occasional inspection.  People may <Col N="24" /> say that this might be a grave imposition on fine institutions which do not need inspection.  Certainly it would be if it was misused.  But how many of our schools which are subject to inspection are, in fact, interfered with in that way?  The Minister or his assistants will know when there is reason to suspect a place.  When they know that a place is running well the inspection will not be a burden to the institution.</P>
    <P>I come now to a final point which was mentioned already by Senator Miss Davidson in her very detailed speech, and one which I think needs emphasising.  The administration of sedatives and injections by nonqualified persons is a grave danger.  It would be very well, either in this Bill or by some regulation, to forbid that absolutely.  If we could go further it would be better still.  The best thing would be that every nursing home should have at least one qualified nurse and the proportion of nurses to patients should be laid down specifically by the Minister.  The House may think that these are counsels of perfection; I do not think so.  When we are passing a Bill like this we should make it as strong and effective as we can. Although the Bill is welcome, it is weak on these points.  I should like the Minister to say why it has not got the bite we hoped it would have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will probably be known by many of us in years to come as &ldquo;Senator Miss Davidson's Bill&rdquo;.  It is a pity that it has become so incapacitated after handling by the Minister.  The Minister has been frank enough to tell us what the Bill will not do and my fear is that people running these nursing homes, about which Senator Miss Davidson and others have been so concerned, will take comfort from reading the Minister's speech.  They will say &ldquo;we are going to be all right; the Minister is not going to be very serious about this matter and we can hope to carry on as we have up to now.&rdquo;  Neither Senator Miss Davidson nor anybody else has been saying that all nursing homes are badly run, that the people are badly treated, that the conditions are intolerable.  What she and many <Col N="25" /> others have been saying is that some of them are badly run and they are operated by people of bad character.  Under the Bill as it stands that situation will continue.</P>
      <P>Surely it would only be right and just in this day and age that any person engaging in this business should have to register with the local health authority and that authority should be satisfied that a person is fit to run such an establishment.  The Minister was quite right when he said that one of the really important things in running these homes was kindness in the people operating them.  Kindness for these aged people is as important as having a skilled person there.  What I have been complaining about is the character of some of the people operating these homes for profit.  Many families, because of their circumstances, have no alternative but to leave their aged parents in this sort of home.  They are not sick enough to be maintained in hospital; they are sent home from hospital.  Perhaps the only person in the family has to go out to work every day and the only way of looking after the aged parent once he or she becomes frail is to put that person into one of these so-called nursing homes. Surely the children of these parents, as well as the parents themselves, are entitled to some protection.  There should be some authority to say whether these homes are adequate or not.  The people themselves are not able to check.  When you visit an aged parent he or she, by reason of age, is inclined to be cranky.  That is something you must accept.  They will complain about anything and everything and the person visiting them is not able to check on the merit of those complaints, whether or not the food is adequate or whether or not the other facilities, such as toilet facilities, are adequate.</P>
      <P>I think we are entitled to the protection of the Minister and to have authority in this respect.  I agree utterly with the other speakers who say that this Bill is too weak and that, instead, it should provide for the registration of this kind of home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome this Bill.  It is a very important measure in <Col N="26" /> relation to homes over which we appear to have no control or supervision and in some cases we are not sure where they are located.  Although I do not think it is clearly set out in the Bill, it is desirable that there should be a register.  Before anybody or any organisation will be permitted to set up a home, I should like to ensure that they will have the permission of the local authority and be registered properly.</P>
      <P>I assume that this Bill will apply not only to the types of homes which have been mentioned over which there is no supervision at all but also to hospitals which are operated by health authorities. I also assume that the requirements stipulated in the Bill will apply to these hospitals and institutions.</P>
      <P>In some hospitals, in particular some mental hospitals, there is severe overcrowding. Discussions have been taking place in that regard.  The Minister is, no doubt, aware of it all and may be waiting to see how the matter will be finalised.  Undoubtedly, the conditions of severe overcrowding are being examined.  Perhaps some 2,000 patients are occupying space intended for, say, only so many hundreds.</P>
      <P>It is not anybody's fault that there is not adequate accommodation but fortunately the matter is being examined. While the position in certain kinds of hospitals has improved immensely &mdash; those dealing with what might be regarded as general ailments &mdash;hospitalisation for mental patients seems to be a separate problem.  Everybody is anxious to see what can be done about it but there is no final decision in relation to some of the hospitals I have in mind to have sufficient and proper accommodation.  You can hardly have proper accommodation unless you have the required accommodation and a hospital of the size that is required.  If the provisions of this Bill are to apply, it will mean getting down to proper hospital accommodation. Perhaps this measure will speed up the present examination and bring some finality to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My remarks might also be applied to our county homes where there are many aged and infirm people.  Because the amount of accommodation in <Col N="27" /> them is pretty limited, more people go into those other places &mdash; with which this Bill is primarily intended to deal.</P>
    <P>The matters to which I have referred are not ones for which the Minister can be blamed.  The problem that arises is to surmount the difficulties that face us.  Furthermore, there is a question of finance involved in this, too.  However, it is essential to deal with this because some health authorities at least, have problems in this regard.  I do not know the general position throughout the country but it is a serious matter in some of the places with which I am familiar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to those members of the Seanad who were good enough to express their appreciation of what I have tried to do in the Bill yet some of them do not seem to appreciate what the problem is.  This Bill is not designed to deal with recognised public institutions. It is designed to deal with undertakings which exist at the moment and with those which may come into being in the future, where care is provided for people such as given to those who are inmates of public institutions but do it for private profit.</P>
      <P>It has been, I think, admitted by Senator Stanford, for instance, that there does exist the problem in this regard of the elderly person who because of age is infirm or who suffers from some physical infirmity or is in some way incapacitated but who, because of family circumstances, cannot be cared for and attended in the family home.  Therefore, in order that he may receive even rudimentary attention, such a person must find a place in some home.  I suppose the degree of comfort which he will enjoy there will naturally be related to what the patient himself or his family can afford.  That is the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use, in relation to that problem, in preaching counsels of perfection.  We just have to deal with the fact that there are people who do not want to place their parents or their immediate relatives in a public institution to be looked after at the <Col N="28" /> expense of the ratepayers, who feel that, because of the self-respect of the individual concerned, he himself would hate to go into one of these places.  Such people, therefore, have to find somewhere to stay and some persons who for fee or reward, will look after them.  That is the problem with which we are dealing.</P>
    <P>Institutions have been established to deal with this problem.  There are, I suppose, numerous such places &mdash; certainly in the city of Dublin &mdash; of which the public know very little but which are known to those who have had to avail of their services.  The point is, how are we going, first of all, to make the health authority aware of them and where they exist?  That is what I am doing in Section 3 of the Bill, which provides that persons who are in charge &mdash; mind you it is not the person who owns it &mdash; of places where incapacitated persons are maintained for private profit, will notify the health authority.  The provisions of that section have been objected to by Senator Jessop and Senator Stanford on the grounds that we are not compelling these institutions to register.  The institutions do exist.  Supposing we did say that such institutions must be registered, would we not have to have, if we were making that provision in the Bill, some provision on precisely the same lines as there is in Section 3, to the effect that a person in charge of an existing institution must apply for registration, and must, as a practical fact, notify the authorities that he is in charge of such premises?</P>
    <P>If Section 3 is defective in respect of premises of the kind covered by the Bill, would not the provision setting up a register and compelling the person to apply to be so registered be equally defective by reason of the fact that unless you do not know that such premises exist you cannot go after the person who is in charge of them and compel him to apply for registration, and compel him, as in this instance, to notify the authority that he wishes to be registered?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I might clarify the situation.  I should just like to know whether it is possible to make it a penalty not to register?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="29" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just coming to that point.  It appears to me that the only way in which one can enforce such a provision is to make it an offence not to comply with it.  Subsection (3) of Section 3 imposes a very substantial penalty on any person who fails to notify that, in fact, he is in charge of such premises &mdash; the person who is in charge, not the person who owns it.  Therefore, I cannot see how it should be more difficult to secure notification, and, therefore, to become aware that such premises exist, by the manner in which we are dealing with it under the Bill, than it would be to obtain knowledge that such premises exist, if we were to compel these people to register.</P>
      <P>The only advantage of the Bill regarding registration is that it does enable the administration of the Bill to be more elastic &mdash; less rigid, than it would be if we were to set up a register and enforce absolute compliance with the prescribed terms before a home could be registered.  The important thing I should like to stress in relation to the problem with which we are dealing is that persons who are infirm or incapacitated and require attention, aid and help from other people are more concerned with the human qualities of such people than with the amenities to be found in the place where they are lodged.  It is not whether they are going to have foam cushions under them when they sit, or whether they are going to have so many cubic feet in the room in which they live that will keep them happy and contented, but whether the persons running these institutions treat them, and are anxious, willing and enthusiastic to treat them with ordinary human kindness.  That is what they want.  These people are not ill in the sense that they are suffering from acute illness.  They may be suffering from a chronic illness and do require physical care and attention.  They are not people who are acutely ill: they are people who only require to be looked after and tended with the same care and kindness as they would expect to be given if they were in their own homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a wide variety of circumstances to be met with in the ordinary <Col N="30" /> family home.  If we are to deal with this problem, which is a pressing one, particularly where there is such a scarcity of help and aid for young people in the existing conditions of our society, we cannot deal with it in a rigid way.  I should have thought that any person listening to Senator Miss Davidson's speech would have been convinced that registration in the sense in which it was being sought for here is not the answer to this problem.  The British have no fewer than four Acts of Parliament dealing with this problem of registration and I suggest to any Senator who feels that I am in any way wanting in consideration for these people to read Senator Miss Davidson's speech and see what the members of the British Parlament, who have experience of the administration and operation of these four Acts dealing with the registration of nursing homes for the aged and infirm, have to say about the imperfections of their system.  I am not saying that what is proposed will produce a perfect system but it is one which is much better adapted to our circumstances than registration would be. Therefore, I think that we shall have to try it out.  As time goes on and we become acquainted with the conditions which exist in these homes, we may be better able to plan and formulate the regulations which should apply to them.  It may be that we will change, but at worst we are laying the foundation with this Bill.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that we ought to have skilled nursing in these homes; that we ought to have a very high standard in them.  Most of the people I am providing for in this measure&mdash; in fact, the vast majority of them &mdash; do not want the attention of professional nurses.  They want the same sort of care and attention as would be given to them if they were elderly persons, rich enough to employ a companion. That is the sort of thing which is required.  There is no use setting standards which will make it impossible for the ordinary family beset with a problem of this sort to deal with it at all, except by trying to get their aged and infirm parents or incapacitated relatives into one of our <Col N="31" /> county homes, or into homes which are run for charity, homes which are already overcrowded.  Let us start with this present Bill and see what emerges from it.</P>
    <P>Another thing suggested by Senator Miss Davidson, and Senator Stanford, to some extent, is that there is insufficient control of barbiturates and sedatives in some of these homes.  If there is, that is a violation of the provisions of existing statutes.  If any person knows that these drugs are freely available they can furnish information to me and I have power under the Health Act of 1947, and other health legislation, to deal with it.  But I cannot deal with a vague and unsubstantiated statement that in these places there is general laxity in the control of barbiturates.  I can deal with specific cases.  Everybody knows we can make laws and that people can break them but you cannot enforce the law unless in some way or other the knowledge comes to you that it is being violated.  That is the position in relation to barbiturates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think that there must be an overall looseness in regard to barbiturates when we see so many cases of overdoses of sleeping tablets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to say there is a looseness in relation to these matters.  The Senator quoted one instance.  I think I have a vague recollection of that case.  The unfortunate woman concerned was a person who was quite obviously, if I may say so without any disrespect to her memory, hardened in a certain way of life.  We know the circumstances. She had been going from situation to situation.  There had been pilfering anyway from some of her employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no indication of that in the report I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The unfortunate lady died in police custody and somehow or other she had smuggled these <Col N="32" /> barbiturates into her cell; she must have been collecting them as she went from situation to situation.  She was not an inmate of one of the homes we are dealing with.  She died in police custody.  On the basis of that incident Senator Miss Davidson wants me to accept it as an established fact that in general in nursing homes or rather in these institutions which call themselves nursing homes &mdash; whether they are properly entitled to do so or not I do not know &mdash; there is a looseness in the control of drugs.  If there is, and any person knows it, it is their civic duty to inform me of the matter or to inform the local health authority so that we may try and put a stop to this abuse. There is no use coming to me and saying the licensing laws are being abused unless you can say: &ldquo;I know that such and such a person is doing this; will you look after it?&rdquo;  The person who tells me that will be treated very confidentially by me, and to tell me would at least enable me to find one instance.  I have not been able to find one where there is justification for and substance in the allegation which Senator Miss Davidson has made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Jessop took exception to the definition in the Bill of incapacitated persons and he seemed to imply that under it a home in which persons who are merely frail and elderly would be maintained for profit could not be dealt with.  I think that the definition of &ldquo;incapacitated&rdquo; is fairly wide.  It means incapacitated in relation to a person suffering from physical infirmity. I cannot see how anyone can draw the line of demarcation between frailty and physical infirmity.  If a person is frail must he not be physically infirm?  Perhaps &ldquo;frailty&rdquo; and &ldquo;infirmity&rdquo; are terms which have a particular connotation for the medical or surgical profession. I thought that the definition in the Bill was wide enough to cover any disability arising from age, physical defect or injury.  As I said, we are in any event not dealing with public institutions.  We are dealing with places where people have to go, because, if they do not go into these places there is no person to look after them.  If the definition is lacking in any way, I would be quite prepared to amend it if, on Committee Stage, some <Col N="33" /> person suggests to me how it can be improved.  That applies to the whole Bill.  There is no more I can say than that any suggestion offered will be considered.  That will be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to confirm three Orders made during 1962 under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, which provides that Orders made by the Government under that Act, imposing or amending duties, must be confirmed in the calendar year following that in which they are made.</P>
      <P>The Orders are:</P>
      <P>(1)  Imposition of Duties (No. 128) (Customs Duties and Form of Customs Tariff) Order, 1962.</P>
      <P>(2)  Imposition of Duties (No. 130) (Customs Duties and Form of Customs Tariff) Order, 1962.</P>
      <P>(3)  Imposition of Duties (No. 131) (Reduction of Rates of Customs Duties) Order, 1962.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Order No. 128 (Customs Duties and Form of Customs Tariff) prescribed a new form of customs tariff based on the internationally-agreed Brussels <Col N="34" /> nomenclature for use in classifying goods for customs purposes; it also revoked all then existing customs duties (except those on tobacco, beer, spirits, certain hydrocarbon oils, and wine which were excluded because of the number of consequential legislative changes which their inclusion would have involved), and re-imposed these duties, with certain modifications, within the nomenclature classification. This Order was made to bring our tariff code into conformity with the classification generally adopted by European countries, including those which are members of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>Order No. 130 (Customs Duties and Form of Customs Tariff) made a number of necessary amendments of a minor nature to Order No. 128 which I have just referred to and also revoked, and re-imposed, in accordance with the new tariff classification, a customs duty on wheat.</P>
    <P>Order No. 131 (Reduction of Rates of Customs Duties) reduced by 10 per cent all customs duties, with the exception of certain revenue and agricultural duties, as part of the movement towards freer trade conditions, and in anticipation of our entry into the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>One of the effects of Orders No. 128 and 130 is to re-impose in their new form a number of customs duties which had been amended or imposed previously by way of separate Orders. There are seven such Orders in question, all of which were made in the year 1962.</P>
    <P>The first of these Orders, Order No. 121 (Braid), reduced the <i>ad valorem</i> rate of customs duty on braid (other than braid suitable for the manufacture of laces) from 100 per cent (flat), to 60 per cent (full), 40 per cent preferential (UK and Canada), and was made in accordance with the recommendation of the Industrial Development Authority, after a tariff review under our trade agreement with Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The second Order &mdash; Order No. 122 &mdash; (Iron and Steel Files) &mdash; reduced the customs duty on iron and steel files from 75 per cent (full), 50 per cent (UK and Canada), <i>ad valorem</i> with <Col N="35" /> an additional customs duty of 1/6d. (full), 1/- (UK and Canada), the article, to 60 per cent (full) 40 per cent (UK and Canada), <i>ad valorem</i>, with an additional customs duty of 1/1½d. (full), 9d. (UK and Canada), the article.  This tariff reduction was also made in accordance with the recommendation of the Industrial Development Authority after a review under our trade agreements with Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The next Order&mdash;Order No. 124&mdash; (Overcoats for Men or Boys)&mdash;amended the customs duty on overcoats for men or boys so as to provide for minimum rates of 75/- (full), 50/-(UK or Canada), the article.  This change was made because the existing <i>ad valorem</i> rates were found to be inadequate to give protection against imports of low-priced goods.</P>
    <P>Order No. 125 (Knitted Undergarments) amended the Customs duty on certain knitted undergarments so as to provide for minimum rates of 2/- (full), 1/4d (U.K. and Canada), the article.  The existing <i>ad valorem</i> rates proved to be inadequate to give protection against imports of low-priced goods and a specific duty had to be imposed to protect the domestic producers.</P>
    <P>Order No. 126 (Knitted Fabric) amended the Customs duty on knitted synthetic fabrics to provide for minimum specific rates of 1/9d (full), 1/2d (preferential), per sq. yard.  Here again excessive competition from low-cost producers threatened the interests of the Irish manufacturers and made it necessary to provide more effective protection for the industry.</P>
    <P>Order No. 127 (Miscellaneous Customs Duties) made some minor amendments to the Imposition of Duties (No. 114) (Miscellaneous Customs) Duties Order, 1961.  This latter Order is the Order which provided higher tariff protection for goods, imports of which are subject to quantitative restrictions, so that, in a situation such as would arise on this country's adhesion to the Common Market, when these quantitative restrictions would have to be removed <Col N="36" /> at once, an alternative form of protection would exist.</P>
    <P>The last of these Orders, Order No. 129 (Wheat), imposed a Customs duty of 70/- (flat), per ton, on imported milling wheat.  The purpose of this Order was to appropriate, for the benefit of the Exchequer, certain surplus profit' which would accrue to millers due to the above-normal use of cheap imported wheat following the bad harvest of 1962.  The Exchequer incurred heavy expense in coming to the assistance of wheat growers as a result of the poor 1962 harvest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>The particular items mentioned in the Bill do not call for any critical comment and I think we are all in agreement on the proposals set out in the Bill about the confirmation of Orders, but some general questions do arise and I think this gives us an opportunity of considering certain very important points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that the first question that arises is the Government's policy and actions regarding our entry into EEC or some other such body. We could have a long debate on this subject but I think we know now as a result of the Minister's statements in Dáil Éireann and the debate on this particular Bill in that House that the Government's policy still continues to be based on the assumption that we would become members of EEC by 1970.  Everybody, with perhaps a few exceptions, is in favour of joining the European Economic Community if it is possible for this country to do so. The question has been asked as to where the negotiations for our entry into the Common Market stand at present and we are told that the Government are keeping in touch with developments within the European Economic Community and I think I saw today that the Minister for External Affairs may be attending a conference shortly on, I think, the question of agriculture. Incidentally, one of the English Sunday papers, the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i>, carried an article suggesting that even <Col N="37" /> now the EEC might fail and break up on the question of agriculture.  However, whether the economic community holds together or not, I think we all know that the trend of the future world is in the direction of freer trade even in a framework which might easily bring in the United States of America.  That being so, we cannot shirk the points raised by this particular Bill regarding the Government's policy on tariffs and quotas generally.</P>
    <P>It would seem that the Government policy is to continue to reduce protective tariffs and protective methods of all kinds so as to increase our competitiveness in getting exports of Irish manufactures and other Irish products. Indeed, whether we enter EEC or EFTA or not, a high degree of competitiveness will be necessary to expand our economy to meet the needs of developing standards.  We would all subscribe to the proposition that if we are to advance economically and socially in this country we must fit ourselves for competition with other nations in selling our industrial and agricultural products.  Indeed, one of the Orders mentioned today deals with the very point of low priced competition coming into our own country and provision is made to protect our manufacturers against the competition they have to face at the present moment.  It would seem only sensible. The very fact that this sort of goods can come in here at present and invade our own market should be a stimulus to us to try to keep our economy low priced in order that our goods will be able to invade the markets of other countries.</P>
    <P>It is obvious to everybody that the cold breeze of competition that comes with the lowering of protective measures brings an awareness of the need to keep down production costs. Costs must be kept to a minimum if competitive prices are to be possible.  Behind high tariff walls inefficiency and high costs are enabled to persist and result in an artificial complacency and a lack of enterprise, in people not working hard enough and in all the other evils that go with sheltered forms of industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="38" /> The Minister tells us that by 1965 it is hoped to achieve a 30 per cent reduction of tariffs and quotas. Naturally, there is some criticism and apprehension amongst those who are concerned that protection is being lowered too fast and perhaps without any visible or immediate <i>quid pro quo</i> being sought or given.  This is understandable and again I think the Minister is facing this matter pretty fairly in that he has said there is not going to be a headlong break down of the protective barriers and that the situation will be watched as it proceeds. A thing which is not perhaps understood is that these 10 per cent reductions are not all over reductions.  The percentage is merely on the existing tariff on each occasion, which is a much lower reduction than would appear than if there was a full 10 per cent on the original tariffs.  These are protective measures now rather than that we should have to take drastic ones later on when the time comes to conform to whatever tariffs we might have to work under.  The form of protection is being altered to conform with EEC procedures so that time is really being given to industrialists to prepare themselves by degrees.</P>
    <P>All that is very well and, indeed, the real question is one of timing the rate of dismantling of protection.  This process, and the speed at which dismantling should be carried out, should be done in consultation and co-operation with all the elements concerned. It is fair to say that in modem life, in our Governmental life, there has been a great deal of improvement in this matter in recent times.  Trade associations and trade bodies are now being utilised very fully in a consultative way in these matters in which they are particularly concerned.</P>
    <P>There is a third point which arises from this Bill and which is not such a happy one.  I refer to the Government's responsibility for the efficient and successful operation of Irish industry.  This postulates reasonable incentives to industry and the creation of a favourable atmosphere for its prosecution.  The Minister for Finance speaking in Dublin recently was reported as saying that exports are vital <Col N="39" /> to our economy and that all sections had a part to play in the stimulation of exports.  I fully agree with this.  It is up to the employers and management to be efficient and up-to-date and to give the lead in every possible way so that industry will be efficient and fully competent.  We look to the workers to play their part to give a fair return for money paid to them, to give a fair day's work for proper wages. There is no doubt that nowadays it can never be said that workers are underpaid.  They have the means to see that they are well paid and that they have good conditions of employment in every way.  It is important that they should not go too far in demanding more than they give to the economy merely through the weight of their organisations and trade unions.</P>
    <P>Finally, we come to the Government. Business people and people generally are accustomed to being urged by Ministers and the Government to improve efficiency and competitiveness, and an occasion like this gives me the opportunity to remind Ministers that the Government have a great deal of responsibility in this matter.  It is all very well for Governments and Ministers to call on business people to be efficient and enterprising but all the efforts of business people in that direction can be frustrated if there is inefficiency in the handling of the nation's financial affairs.  How can efficiency and price competitiveness be made possible for industrialists and farmers if the Government upsets the production costs and living costs of the whole nation as has been done in recent months?  Business people are puzzled by the confusion and chaos which runs in our economic life at present.  The cost of living and the cost of labour have made and are making steep and unprecedented rises.  Over a very short period from a low cost country we are fast being turned into a high cost country. The Government have thrown the ball to the industrial community to solve problems&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is to be hoped that all sections of industry will work together to iron out the many problems that face them at present in order to preserve and develop our competitive capacity in both home and export markets. I fully agree with the policy which this Bill is designed to advance, namely, efficiency of industry and the preparation for advancing our exports in original markets but in spite of the ruling of the Leas-Chathaoirleach I think the Government's contribution to this highly desirable aim of making our exports marketable and making them competitive is very important.  As I say, I support the Bill with the remarks I have made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to stray from the Bill or to engage in a general argument on the industrial or financial condition of the country.  The general policy of the reduction of tariffs Whether we enter the EEC or not is one to which the country is committed. The Government have undertaken to reduce protective tariffs and most people agree with that objective.</P>
      <P>I simply would like to remind the Minister, if I am not out of order, that this reduction of tariffs is really part of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and in order that that programme can be successful it must be consistently pursued.  Anybody who has read the programme should be aware of the reference in it to the necessity for consistency in Government policy.  There is a certain inconsistency between the reduction of protective tariffs, making it easier to import, and certain measures which make it more difficult to export.  I do not wish to go into details but if our exports become more expensive either because of rising incomes or because of rising public expenditure we will find it more and more difficult to compete abroad and simply will not have the necessary exporting capacity to pay for the increased imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the object of this Bill is to make importing easier, that is an object which could be inconsistent with other Government policy that might make exports more expensive, because our capacity to import is limited by our capacity to export, I would ask <Col N="41" /> the Minister to bear in mind that this Bill must be related to the other parts of the Government's <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>

      <P>I entirely agree with the last words spoken by Senator O'Brien.  In this Bill, it is the Government's intention by gradual stages to reduce protection and eventually to aim at circumstances in which protection will have disappeared altogether. Senator O'Brien and Senator McGuire are quite correct when they point out that if tariffs are coming down and the costs of production on our industrialists are going up there is no denying that our industrialists will be faced with a hazardous and dangerous period in the future.</P>
      <P>As far as our industrial policy is concerned, the country today lacks proper leadership and proper guidance. How can our industrialists plan for the future if they do not know exactly where they are going, if there is changing and chopping in the advice and in the guidance they get from our Government, from our Department and from our Ministry for Industry and Commerce?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are reducing tariffs, surely the industrialists should know exactly where they stand.  A few months ago, it was Government policy to have more or less a Standstill Wages Order and we had a White Paper, <i>Closing the Gap.</i>  I dare say that our industrialists believed at that time there would be a relative period of stability in this country and that they could plan ahead on that basis. That is what was pointed out to them at the time by the Minister.  Now, due to deliberate Government action in increasing taxation, in imposing a new turnover tax, and by themselves initiating a ninth round of wage increases, they have controverted all that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>How are our industrialists to survive in the future if tariffs are being reduced?  How are they to survive if material is being allowed in from abroad and at the same time it is deliberate Government policy to increase the cost of living, the cost of production and wages?  If we are not entitled to point that out, then I do not know what we are entitled to point out.</P>
      <P>The greatest danger is the fact that, if Government policy continues, as it is today, to reduce tariffs and quotas and deliberately to increase costs of production we shall price ourselves out of Europe and all world markets.  By doing that, we shall imperil the jobs of our people in industry and we shall provide fewer openings in industry for young people.  If we are to hold our own in the competitive period which faces us we must try to keep our costs of production as low as we possibly can.  Never was it more desirable, therefore, to have a reasonable period of stability.  There is no sign of that reasonable period of stability but the action of the Government in the past few days may again kindle the fires of inflation which may consume us all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The imposition of duties is an important matter.  Further markets are essential for the expansion of our exports.  The matter is under examination by the Minister and the Government.  What is really more important still is that any easing of duties in so far as our industries are concerned should carefully be considered. There should be no reduction of import duties to an extent that would change the present pattern of employment in our industries.</P>
      <P>The first consideration must be to safeguard our industries and to protect whatever employment they give.  As was mentioned earlier, labour costs must be taken into consideration but the important point is to keep labour employed where employment is provided at present and to try to create further openings.  We must ensure that we keep as many workers as possible employed in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we lower the duties on some of these industries to an extent that goods <Col N="43" /> imported would outprice the home-produced article then we would damage ourselves.  That point must be borne in mind.  All the other aspects of the matter are really ones for examination and negotiation.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that there will be no reduction in duties which will adversely affect the disposal of goods produced in any of our industries and we must ensure that we keep the labour force at present in employment here at work and if possible increase the number of openings.  I am sure the Minister would be anxious to do that, too.  We read sometimes about other markets and the EEC and we realise that it is all very important but nevertheless anything that would affect ourselves is bound to come first.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the kernel of any industrial policy &mdash; and indeed that relates to Government and individual industries and firms &mdash; is to produce goods of the best possible quality at the lowest possible cost.  That policy permeates our whole exercise in relation to tariff reductions at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGuire said that the present industrial policy is based on the assumption that we shall be in the EEC by 1970.  That, as the House is aware, is the end of the transition period that the Common Market countries set themselves, and at which time they propose to have all the restrictions on movement of goods between themselves abolished.  As the House is aware, the other community, the European Free Trade Association, also adopted that as the period in which they, too, would have the import and export restrictions abolished.  In the event, the EEC have shortened their transition period by 2½ years so that they hope to have all their tariffs eliminated by mid-1967.  The EFTA countries better that and they have set the date for the elimination of tariffs and quotas as the end of 1966. As I stated in the Dáil, that has stimulated the movement of goods within each of these communities.  Not only has it stimulated the movement of goods but it has increased the <Col N="44" /> efficiency of the producers of goods. Therefore, if we are to export our industrial surplus to these countries then, too, we must increase our efficiency so as to hold and, if possible, increase our markets in these countries. Therefore, this reduction of tariffs is worthwhile.  I said so on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford to ignore this world movement.  We cannot afford to ignore the reduction of tariffs that has been effected by the countries representing these two trade <i>blocs</i> and the consequent improvement in the efficiency of their industries.  Indeed, they are improving efficiency at a very fast rate.  In the short run, it would perhaps be a good thing for our industries here to maintain tariffs at their existing level.  As everybody knows, we have a small market here and, by reason of the smallness of our firms and the diversification of the goods they produce, we tend to be high cost producers.  Therefore, in order to get bigger runs on production it would be necessary for us to seek export markets, and to seek export markets means that we will have to be sufficiently efficient to compete in them. If we sit back under the umbrella of protection, then people will be inclined to take it too easy and we will not be able for competition abroad.</P>
    <P>Certainly, if we are to be members of EEC by 1970 and, indeed, if we are to compete in world industrial conditions, which will operate by 1970, then we will have to be much more efficient in the production of industrial goods than we are now.  If we neglected to take the steps we are now taking then we could be accused of neglecting the opportunity of maintaining employment and creating new employment in the long term.  The one reduction that has already taken place and the next reduction of 10 per cent in tariff as of the 1st January next year will stimulate our industrial producers to greater efforts and greater efficiency. Indeed, many of them have given testimony to me of that and many of them have told me that they have achieved greater efficiency now than they envisaged would be possible.  That has <Col N="45" /> been stimulated to some extent by the reductions that have been effected.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire implied inconsistency in the Government's approach to this matter.  Let us examine that allegation of inconsistency which is completely unfounded.  We applied for membership of the EEC in the summer of 1961.  Our application was formally presented in February, 1962.  Immediately on application, in the summer of 1961, there was set up the Committee on Industrial Organisation, which, the House is aware, comprises representatives of trade unions, industrialists and of Government Departments and Agencies.  The Committee on Industrial Organisation made, in the first place, three interim reports, two, of which are, perhaps, specially important, in order to indicate the consistency of Government action in this regard.  In the first interim report the Committee on Industrial Organisation recommended that loans be made available at favourable rates to industries in order to encourage them to adapt themselves for the greater competition that freer trading was going to bring about.  The Government not only adopted that recommendation but made available to industrialists, who wanted to adapt themselves or re-equip for greater competitiveness, grants, as well as loans, at specially favourable terms, I am glad to say, and these loans are being sought after at a very satisfactory rate.</P>
    <P>As well as that, the Committee, in another of their interim reports, advocated the setting up of Adaptation Councils.  These Councils, representative of certain industries, adopted certain rationalisation methods in getting advice in selling and buying and other matters.  Not only did the Government adopt that interim report, as well, but they made grants available to these Adaptation Councils so that they could better do the work that they set themselves to do.  Side by side with that, the technical assistance scheme has been improved whereby firms who want to seek consultative advice as to how best they could improve their methods and working systems get a grant now of 50 per cent, <Col N="46" /> instead of what it was, 33? per cent. These are only some of the measures that have been consistently employed and pursued by the Government since it became obvious that we were faced, sooner or later, and sooner rather than later, with conditions of freer trade than we have hitherto been used to. Therefore, I fail to see how this charge, or allegation, or implication, or whatever it is, of inconsistency can properly be levelled at the Government.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire asked what was the Government's contribution.  They made a very substantial and significant contribution in order to help industrialists to become more efficient in the conditions facing them.  If our assumption is wrong that we will be members of the EEC by 1970, then, at any rate, we will be living in a world where all our competitors in the markets to which we hope to supply goods, will have abolished tariffs <i>inter se</i> amongst the countries in which these competitors live.  Therefore, unless we undertook the effort we are now making we might find ourselves completely isolated, with a tariff wall built around us, unable to export anything and living in an ever-declining market.</P>
    <P>This is an era of expansion which has happily been achieved in employment and in industry and of expansion which also has happily been achieved in export.  It is a rate of expansion which has been assisted in great measure by Government action.  I think we are going in the right direction.  If, as Senator McGuire fears, the time will come when this will operate towards our disadvantage, then the Government will be perfectly free to take whatever action would be in our best interests.</P>
    <P>I said in the Dáil that we were not going to continue willynilly with this reduction of tariffs, but only so long as it is consistent with the best interests of our country, our workers, and our industries.  At the same time, I am convinced that it is in our best interests that we should proceed as we are proceeding.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the law relating to companies, a great deal of which is now very much out of date.  In 1958 the report of the Company Law Reform Committee which had been appointed by the Attorney General to examine our system of company law, was published, and copies were circulated to members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  As a first step in the process of revision, a limited number of important changes recommended by the Committee were dealt with in a special Bill which was enacted as the Companies Act, 1959. At that time I explained that the preparation of a second Bill to carry through the remaining changes in the law which were deemed to be necessary would be a formidable task and that some time would be needed to prepare a comprehensive and carefully thought out measure.  The preparation of this second Bill, which is the one now before the Seanad, took rather longer than I expected, but this was due to a large extent to circumstances beyond my control.  The principal problem was that while the preparation of the Bill was in progress, further investigations into company law were commenced, in the Six Counties and in Britain.  In the field of company law, as in other matters, we cannot ignore any changes which may be contemplated in the Six Counties or Britain, with each of which we have such close commercial ties.  It was necessary, therefore, to have regard to developments in those countries and this led <Col N="48" /> to substantial revisions of the legislative proposals from time to time.</P>
      <P>The Bill is, of course, a consolidating as well as an amending measure and contains many provisions which simply repeat existing requirements with little or no change.  This has contributed very substantially to its bulk.  The Bill is, in fact, so big that it is rather difficult to give a satisfactory summary of its contents.  It was introduced in the Dáil in July, 1962, and was subsequently examined in detail by a Special Committee.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the deliberations of the Committee a large number of amendments were made, many of these being of a minor nature but others of considerable substance.  I should like to record once again my appreciation of the work of my colleagues from all sides on that Committee, and I am quite satisfied that the Bill which ultimately emerged from the Committee is a most suitable one for our conditions.</P>
      <P>An explanatory memorandum giving some brief information about the principal provisions was published with the first print of the Bill, and for the convenience of Senators I have had this amplified and amended to take account of the many changes made in the Bill by the Special Committee.  I hope that they will find it useful in considering the measure; if any further information of a more detailed nature is required I will be glad to provide it during the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In what follows I propose to mention only the major provisions in the Bill. First of all, I would like to refer to the provisions relating to accounts, which are set out in Sections 147-159 of the Bill.  The existing requirements in regard to accounts are scanty in the extreme, and there has for a long time been a demand that more comprehensive information should be statutorily required.  The better-run companies have, of course, even in the absence of statutory requirements, made a practice of preparing informative accounts which are useful both to their own shareholders and to persons having business dealings with them. There have, unfortunately, also been <Col N="49" /> others, who have persisted in the preparation of accounts designed more to conceal the true position rather than to provide an accurate indication of the state of their finances.  It is now proposed to place a specific obligation on every company to keep proper books of account and to prepare each year a profit and loss account and balance sheet which, apart from giving a true and fair view, must also comply with the detailed requirements of the Sixth Schedule.</P>
    <P>In the case of holding companies, there will in future be an obligation to prepare group accounts, the effect of which will be to give a concise picture of the financial position of the holding company and its subsidiaries considered as a single undertaking. The Company Law Reform Committee recommended that this onerous obligation regarding group accounts should not apply to private companies.  As Senators will see from Section 154, private holding companies are being given the option of preparing group accounts or, alternatively, sending the accounts of the individual subsidiaries to members who ask for them.</P>
    <P>Any directors who do not adequately attend to their duties in regard to the keeping of books of account and the preparation of the profit and loss account and balance sheet, will render themselves liable to the very severe penalties set out in Sections 147 to 150 of the Bill.  The directors of every company will be required not merely to lay the detailed accounts before each annual general meeting, but also, in compliance with Section 159, to send them to shareholders and debenture-holders three weeks beforehand. In order to ensure that the interests of creditors and other persons are safeguarded, Section 128 imposes on every public company the obligation to file these accounts with the annual return which is sent to the registrar of companies each year and which is available for public inspection.</P>
    <P>The obligation to file accounts for public inspection will not apply to private companies.  This exemption does no more than continue a privilege which private companies have enjoyed for very many years, and is in conformity <Col N="50" /> with the recommendations of the Company Law Reform Committee. I do not think it necessary to set out in detail here the various arguments for and against the continuation of this privilege, and I think I can do no better than to refer Senators to paragraphs 110 to 120 inclusive of the report of the Company Law Reform Committee, which I think deals adequately with the point.</P>
    <P>Senators are probably aware that this privilege was partially withdrawn in Britain in 1948 and that its total withdrawal has now been recommended; the situation in the Six Counties is, of course, the same as that which obtains here.  I should like to emphasise that conditions as regards company organisation in Britain differ considerably from those prevailing here in Ireland, and the arguments which might be put forward for the publication of the accounts of private companies in Britain would not necessarily apply here.  The vast majority of private companies established here are family concerns essentially of a private nature in which outside interests play little or no part and this, I think, is the principal reason why we should not impose on them the altogether new requirement that they should file their accounts.</P>
    <P>In regard to publication of accounts it will be noted that the effect of Sections 126 and 128 is that in future companies limited by guarantee and not having a share capital will have to file their accounts with the registrar; in the past such companies did not have to make any annual return and their financial affairs were, therefore, secret. Included in this group of companies, there are many charitable organisations which ought not be obliged to disclose information about their finances, and as Senators will see from Section 128 suitable exemption provisions have been inserted in respect of such companies.</P>
    <P>Since I am on the subject of accounts, I think it no harm to refer to the fact that the Sixth Schedule and related provisions of the Bill were carefully vetted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants and other reputable organisations, and in their present form they take account of the <Col N="51" /> views expressed by these experts.  I think it can be said, therefore, that those best in a position to know are satisfied that these requirements are suited to the conditions of our commercial life.</P>
    <P>Some important changes are also being made in regard to the winding up of companies.  It is well known that the law in relation to voluntary winding up in particular has been most unsatisfactory for many years, especially in the case of insolvent companies. As the law stands at present, the members of a company which is being wound up voluntarily have control over the liquidation; this may be locigal enough in the case of a company which is in a position to meet all its financial obligations but it is quite inappropriate in cases where some creditors are likely to be left unpaid.  In order to implement some recommendations on this point by the Company Law Reform Committee, it is proposed, therefore, to provide that, in future, voluntary winding up will be divided into two classes, namely, members' voluntary winding up and creditors' voluntary winding up.  If the directors of a company wish to have the liquidation carried out as a members' voluntary winding up, they must prepare a declaration that the company will be able to meet its debts in full within a period not exceeding one year.  Where directors are not in a position to make this declaration, i.e., where the company is insolvent, then the liquidation must proceed as a creditors' voluntary winding up, and in that event substantial control of the proceedings passes to the creditors whose interests are to a large extent given precedence over those of the members of the company.</P>
    <P>Section 285 of the Bill is designed to effect some changes in the law relating to the payment of debts in a winding up.  The position in regard to the priority afforded to State debts is explained in the memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill, and may be summarised by saying that until recently, after claims secured by fixed charges have been met, most State debts had first call on the assets of a <Col N="52" /> company which is being wound up. Both the Bankruptcy Committee which reported in 1930 and the more recent Company Law Reform Committee were in favour of a diminution of preference in respect of State debts, on the grounds that it is most unfair to give priority to the State, which can carry on without difficulty if its claims are not met, over a small trader who may be placed in a very serious predicament by failure to secure payment for his debts.  I took this matter up with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, and he agreed that an alteration in the law was called for.  He included in the Finance Bill, 1963, a provision to abolish the preference for State debts set out in Section 38 of the Finance Act, 1924, and, as Senators are aware, that provision is now law. Section 285 of this Bill continues the preference enjoyed by the State in relation to twelve months' assessment of taxes.  The Company Law Reform Committee (but not the Bankruptcy Committee) were in favour of the abolition of the twelve months' tax preference also, but I think there is a good case for retaining this, and that was also the view of most members of the Special Committee of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>As will be seen from the explanatory memorandum.  Section 285 also introduces a number of important changes to protect the interests of employees in a winding up.  In so far as arrears of pay are concerned all clerks, servants and workmen will in future be entitled to preference in respect of services for the period of four months preceding the winding up, while the existing ceilings of £50 for clerks and servants and £25 for workmen are being raised to £300 all round.  These employees will also be entitled to preference for all accrued holiday pay. The existing provisions relating to preferences for workmen's compensation payments are also being amended to strengthen the position of any injured workers to whom a company may have obligations.  There is also an entirely new provision giving preference to amounts due from a company in respect of its liability to employees for accidents, other than liability under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.</P>
    <P>It is in the course of winding up a <Col N="53" /> company that most offences by fraudulent directors and promoters come to light.  The existing provisions for the prosecution and punishment of such persons are unsatisfactory and this situation is now being rectified.  In order to provide further safeguards for both the shareholders and creditors of companies, suitable changes in the law are being introduced in Sections 245, 286, 288, 289, 293, 295, 296, 297 and 299.  These provisions should not cause any difficulty for upright directors and promoters, but I hope that they will be an effective deterrent to fraudulent activities by unscrupulous persons.</P>
    <P>About 95 per cent of the companies registered in this country are private. Because of the nature of their constitution, and the way in which their internal affairs are regulated, it is sometimes possible for the majority of the shareholders in such companies to act unfairly towards the minority.  The Company Law Reform Committee referred to practices of this kind in paragraphs 123 and 124 of their report, and as the existing remedies are not effective, they recommended the enactment of special provisions designed to protect minorities from ill-treatment of this kind.  Rather elaborate provisions to this end are set out in Section 205 of the Bill.  There are a number of other provisions also in the Bill designed to protect minority shareholders. Section 166 enables the Minister for Industry and Commerce to appoint an inspector to carry out an investigation into the affairs of a company if he is satisfied that any of the shareholders are being oppressed, and Section 170 empowers him to petition the Court either for a winding-up order or an oppression order if the report of the inspector indicates that the suspicions were well founded.  In Section 213 it is provided that a company may be wound up compulsorily if the court is satisfied that there is oppression.  A further provision of the Bill which is of interest in this connection is Section 78, the purpose of which is to protect shareholders against any unfair variation in their rights. Under this section also the court is given the widest powers to deal with whatever situation may be presented to <Col N="54" /> it.  Any variation of rights which the court feels is unfairly prejudicial to the interests of any shareholders may be set aside.</P>
    <P>Prospectuses inviting members of the public to subscribe for securities are not commonly issued in this country, for the reason that only public companies, of which there are comparatively few registered here, may finance their activities in this way.  It has been considered desirable, nevertheless, to review the law relating to prospectuses and similar documents, and a number of changes having as their object the protection of the public have been provided for in Sections 43 to 58 inclusive.  In drawing up these provisions I have had to ensure first of all that adequate protection for prospective investors was provided, but care was also taken not to impose any unreasonable burdens on companies which might hamper them in their lawful activity of seeking finance from the public.  It would be possible to introduce all sorts of onerous requirements in connection with the contents of prospectuses, but I feel sure that in this Bill we have gone far enough.  We must be careful in this connection not to do anything which might restrict the spread of share ownership over as wide a field as possible.</P>
    <P>Strangely enough, there are at present no provisions in the Companies Acts insofar as prospectuses of foreign companies are concerned.  This omission is now being rectified by Part XII of the Bill which deals with the prospectuses of such companies whether or nor they have established places of business in this State.  The requirements in relation to such prospectuses are much the same as those which are applicable to the prospectuses of Irish companies.  There is an exemption clause in favour of prospectuses which comply with the law of foreign countries recognised by Order.</P>
    <P>Every company is owned by its shareholders and the directors merely act as stewards of the business on their behalf.  It has, therefore, been the practice for very many years to include in the Companies Acts various provisions designed to facilitate the coming <Col N="55" /> together of the general body of proprietors for the purpose of reviewing the company's affairs.  Insofar as the present Bill is concerned the relevant provisions are set out in Sections 131 to 146 inclusive, and these represent a considerable elaboration and improvement on the existing law.  One of the principal changes which is being made is in regard to the length of notice which must be given for calling meetings, which is dealt with by Section 133; the object of the new requirements is to ensure that any member who might wish to attend a meeting or to appoint a proxy will have reasonable notice thereof and will, therefore, be in a better position to make the necessary arrangements. Important changes are also being made in Section 136, in regard to the appointment of proxies, and, generally, that section implements the recommendations of the Company Law Reform Committee.  A further change which is being made is that the existing provisions in relation to extraordinary resolutions are being discontinued.  In future there will be only two types of resolution, ordinary and special. Senators will also be glad to note that Section 141 clarifies the legal position in relation to written resolutions; this should be of interest particularly to the smaller type of company in cases where it is not considered necessary to have formal meetings.</P>
    <P>Further changes designed to protect shareholders and other persons have been made in Sections 165 to 173 which relate to the appointment of inspectors to investigate the affairs of companies.  I have already made a reference to some of these changes in my earlier remarks about the protection of minorities.  The appointment of an inspector to investigate the affairs of a company is of its very nature something which can hardly be kept a secret and as soon as it becomes public knowledge some damage is inevitably done to the commercial reputation of the company in question, even if it is subsequently found that there was nothing amiss.  In the past it has always been the practice in considering applications for the appointment of inspectors to bear this point <Col N="56" /> particularly in mind; I expect that that policy will be maintained in the future, and that these powers will be used sparingly.</P>
    <P>In the Companies Act, 1959, provisions were for the first time introduced in our law to enable companies to issue redeemable preference shares.  The suggestion was put forward that companies should also be given the right to attach redeemable rights to shares which had been issued as irredeemable preference shares.  I undertook to give some thought to this idea, and if it were found practicable to devise a workable formula, to introduce a suitable provision in the Bill which is now before the House.  This matter has been given the most careful consideration. and I think that Section 65 of the Bill can be regarded as meeting all reasonable requirements in this respect.  It would be rather dangerous to give unduly wide powers to convert shares in this manner to all companies, and it is for that reason that the section is hedged about by a number of safeguards designed to prevent abuses.  It will be noted particularly that it is provided that nothing in Section 65 will oblige any shareholder to accept redemption of his shares.  It may well be, of course, that the terms on which a shareholder accepted his shares oblige him to be bound by the decision of a certain majority of his fellow shareholders and any provisions of that kind will continue to operate.  I understand that there may well be cases where the redemption of preference shares under the provisions of this section would be a happy release for the shareholders concerned provided the transaction can be arranged on acceptable terms, and for that reason I feel sure that its enactment will be generally welcome.</P>
    <P>The interests of shareholders may be adversely affected by unreasonable or reckless actions on the part of a company's officers in connection with the transfer of shares.  A number of provisions are being introduced in Part III to provide additional protection for shareholders in this field.  Examples of such provisions are Section 84 which obliges a company to give notice of refusal to register a transfer within two months after lodgment, and Section <Col N="57" /> 85 which imposes certain obligations on a company in connection with the certification of transfers.  I might also refer to Section 86 which requires a company to complete and have ready for delivery the certificates of securities within two months after lodgment of the transfer documents; under the existing law the period of two months runs from the date of registration of the transfer, which might not, of course, be effected for a considerable time after lodgment.  On this subject of the registration of shares I would like also to refer to Section 80 which discharges companies in certain circumstances, from the obligation to number shares.  I feel sure that this concession, which was recommended by the Company Law Reform Committee, will be very welcome to the commercial community.  A general dispensation as regards numbering cannot, however, be given as the interests of shareholders demand that shares should be readily distinguishable from one another in cases where they are not fully paid up or do not rank <i>pari passu</i> for all purposes.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of new provisions are being introduced in the Bill in connection with directors.  There is, at present, no obligation on any company to have directors and this is now being rectified by Section 174, which requires that every company must have at least two; it is desirable that a specific obligation of this kind should be imposed since the directors of a company are charged with numerous responsibilities under the Bill.  For that reason also it is desirable that the directors of a company should be physical persons, and Section 176 provides, therefore, that a body corporate may not in future be a director.</P>
    <P>A number of provisions are also included in the Bill with the object of bringing the activities of directors more closely under the control of the shareholders; for example.  Section 181 requires that the appointment of directors must be voted on individually, while Section 182 will make it easier in future for shareholders to dispense with the services of any director with whom they are not satisfied before the expiry of his period of office.  Sections <Col N="58" /> 186, 187 and 188 contain provisions requiring shareholders' consent for payment to directors for loss of office in connection with the take-over of the shares or business of a company.  There is also in Section 185 a prohibition on tax-free payments to directors, while Sections 181 and 192 require that particulars of directors' salaries, loans, and other payments, must be shown in the annual accounts.  I think it is desirable to enact provisions designed to bring to the light of day dealings by directors in the shares of their companies, and also their interests in contracts with their companies; suitable provisions to this end are included in Sections 190 and 194.  Since a director is, as a general rule, appointed by the shareholders, it is desirable that the assignment by him of his office to another person should be subject to control, and Section 181 deals with this matter. Section 200 is designed to ensure that directors and other officers of a company will be answerable to shareholders for neglect of their duties and cannot disclaim responsibility by virtue of unreasonable escape clauses contained in articles of association or other documents.  Two further provisions of interest under the heading of directors are Sections 183 and 184; the former contains a prohibition on undischarged bankrupts acting as directors, while the latter enables the court to restrain persons convicted of certain offences from acting as directors.</P>
    <P>In the Companies Act, 1959, a provision was introduced with the object of facilitating mergers approved by the vast majority of the shareholders concerned. Although I have had no complaints about the manner in which this section has worked in practice, it has been found on re-examination that it could, perhaps, be drafted in more precise terms.  The more elaborate provisions are now contained in Section 204 of this Bill and I feel sure that this will meet all reasonable requirements, providing as it does suitable facilities for the acquisition of the shares of dissentients and at the same time giving those persons adequate protection against abuses.</P>
    <P>In Part VII of the Bill a number of <Col N="59" /> new provisions are being introduced in connection with receivers.  The object of these is to protect the members of the company in respect of which a receiver is appointed, and to safeguard the interests of its creditors and other persons doing business with it.  A number of clauses to assist receivers in dealing with certain difficulties which may arise for them are also included.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill continues, in improved form, the provisions of the existing law relating to the registration of charges.  The law is being relaxed to the extent that it will not be necessary, in future, to submit the actual instrument creating the charge; certified particulars will suffice.  The object of these requirements as to registration is to ensure that persons doing business with a company will have a readily available means of ascertaining how far its assets have been charged as security for debts.  Apart from the additional obligations now being imposed on Irish companies in this respect, foreign companies having places of business here are now, for the first time, being bound by these requirements as to registration of charges.</P>
    <P>Now that we are imposing rather comprehensive obligations on companies in the matter of accounts, it is important to ensure that the law in regard to auditing is satisfactory.  I am satisfied that it would not be sensible to enact all these detailed requirements about the contents of accounts and at the same time to allow any person, no matter how much or how little he knows about accountancy, to act as auditor.  In Section 162 of the Bill it is proposed, therefore, to provide that, subject to certain exceptions, only persons having recognised professional qualifications can audit the accounts of companies.</P>
    <P>Other provisions of the Bill to which I would like to make some reference are Section 8 (modification of <i>ultra vires</i> rule), Section 10 (altering the objects of a company), Section 37 (pre-incorporation contracts), Section 62 (share premiums), Section 63 (issue of shares at a discount) and Section 91 <Col N="60" /> (Register of debenture holders).  It is not necessary for me to go into any detail about these matters but I would draw the attention of Senators to the relevant notes in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <P>There would, of course, be little point in imposing obligations on companies and their officers unless suitable provision were made for the prosecution of offenders.  A good deal of attention has been given to this matter and a number of new provisions designed to facilitate prosecutions are included in Part XV.  I should like to refer in particular to Section 385 which will remove certain difficulties which have arisen in the past in connection with summary proceedings; it is not always possible to bring proceedings within six months after the commission of an offence as the law at present requires and for that reason a period of three years is now being provided for.  Section 386 provides for a minimum fine for second or subsequent offences, and its principal purpose is to deal with persons who have been in persistent default of their obligations under the Companies Acts.  There is also a very useful provision in Section 384 which will make it easier for the police to procure evidence of offences from the books of a company where suspicions have been aroused.  Section 382 is also of some interest; the existing law does not contain any suitable provision for the prosecution of companies on indictment and this omission is now being rectified.  Apart from these special provisions under the heading of &ldquo;Offences&rdquo;, I should like to point out that particular attention was paid to the insertion of suitable penalty clauses in the appropriate sections throughout this Bill.  Entirely new penalties were provided for where none existed up to this, while in other cases the penalties by way of fine or imprisonment set out in the existing Acts were substantially increased wherever the nature of the offence seemed to require it.  On this question of offences, I should like to advert to the recommendations of the Company Law Reform Committee that the enforcement of the requirements of the Companies Acts should be regarded as a matter of major importance.  As the Committee pointed <Col N="61" /> out, incorporation under the Companies Acts is a privilege, and the terms on which it is granted should be observed.  I should like to take this opportunity to make it clear that I accept the Committee's recommendation unreservedly, and that, to the extent which our resources permit, steps will be taken to ensure that the requirements of the law are complied with, and that offenders are punished.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure the Seanad that all the provisions of the Bill, both new and old, have been the subject of the most careful consideration, by my own and other Departments, and, of course, particularly by the Special Committee who put a great deal of work into their examination of this measure.  In framing the Bill regard was had to the reports of numerous committees of inquiry which have reported on this subject in this State, in the Six-Counties, in Britain and in other countries; the legislation prevailing in these countries was of course also taken into account, as were the views of recognised experts, both at home and abroad.  I do not think there is very much more we can do to perfect it.  I am anxious, for the sake of the commercial community and also the public at large, to have it on the Statute Book as soon as possible as it has long been recognised that our company law is seriously in need of revision.  I would accordingly ask for your co-operation in passing it quickly through the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, before the adjournment, the object of this Bill is to bring the law relating to company formation, and company law in general, up to date, and to bring that law up to modern requirements. The Bill dealing with company law at the moment is the Companies Act, 1908 and, of course, great progress has <Col N="62" /> been made in industry and everything else since then.  At that time, in this country at any rate, apart from a few major public companies, there were comparatively few private companies or small companies.  Since then a lot of private businesses have been turned into private companies in order to gain advantages of one sort or another.</P>
      <P>It has been apparent for a long time that the law on this subject required to be consolidated, codified, and brought up to date.  As far back as 1951, the inter-Party Government of that year, through its then Attorney General, appointed a Company Law Reform Committee and asked it to report on the suggested amendments in the law.  I think, largely speaking, that this Bill was inspired by the report of that Committee and the present Government when they came into office, accepted the report of the Company Law Reform Committee, by and large, and they introduced a temporary measure in 1959.</P>
      <P>This Bill now comes before the Oireachtas to finish the job, so to speak, and to provide us with what we hope will be a suitable law on this subject for many years to come.  As I say, the Bill deals with a very technical subject, a subject, indeed, on which very few lawyers, not to speak about the ordinary layman, are experts. It is understandable then, when the Bill came before the Dáil, that it was referred to a Special Committee of that House.  That Committee, with the assistance of some officers of the Minister's Department, spent many days and weeks, and perhaps months, dealing with this subject in committee. I was very pleased to read in the report of the proceedings in the Dáil that the Committee dealt with it in a very practical way; that the many useful suggestions brought before the Committee by members of both sides of the House &mdash; the Opposition and the Government &mdash; were sympathetically received and fully considered by the Minister and indeed, in a great many instances, accepted by him as useful amendments to the Bill, as introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a great pity that the Committee, which dealt <Col N="63" /> with the Committee Stage of the Bill in the Dáil, was not a Joint Committee of the Dáil and of this House. I understand, under procedure, which is available, that could have been done. The Bill could have got a Second Reading in both Houses at the same time and a Joint Committee could have been selected to deal with it.  I think that would have had two advantages. First, it would have brought to bear on the deliberations, for the benefit of everybody, some specialised opinions of this House.</P>
    <P>It also would have kept this House informed of what was going on so that it would not take so long to deal with it now.  In my respectful opinion, if this House were to tackle the Bill in Committee, as it should be tackled, it would take a considerably longer time. It is obviously a Committee Bill.  I think it is a Bill which could only be dealt with in this House, as it was thought necessary to deal with it in the Dáil, by a Special Committee.</P>
    <P>I think that referring Bills of a highly technical nature, such as this Bill, to a Special Committee is very much to be desired.  The report of the proceedings in the Dáil on the Report and Final Stages of this measure demonstrates what really useful work can be done by a Special Committee on a Bill of this sort.  Of course I welcome the Bill.  It is a measure which was considerably overdue. The Minister and his officers are to be congratulated on the way they dealt with it in the Dáil.  I have a few suggestions to make on various items of the Bill in Committee.  I understand the Minister would not be opposed to a Special Committee of this House dealing with it and I respectfully suggest that is the proper way of dealing with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Fitzpatrick in praising the Minister, his advisers and those who sat on the Special Committee in the other House.  I speak as a practising solicitor with a little experience of company law.  It is quite clear to me that tremendous thought and effort have gone into producing this Bill.  The <Col N="64" /> very greatest praise is due to everybody who had anything to do with its production so far.</P>
      <P>I would also support Senator Fitzpatrick in hoping that the Minister will consider that this is a matter for a Special Committee.  I do not think we could possibly deal with the 400 Sections of the Bill as a Commitee of the whole House, not practically anyway. I am afraid I have always, as a member of the House criticised some of our existing legislation, particularly in relation to commercial matters, as being out of date and not being brought up to date, and possibly even going further.  The Minister has done a splendid job in bringing company law&mdash;long needed indeed&mdash;not merely up to date in the terms of company law in those islands but going beyond that.  Here I should like to sound one note of warning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suggest for one moment that we should seriously copy British Acts.  This Bill is, of course, based on the British Companies Act of 1948 and the Northern Ireland Act of 1960, but it goes further than either of these Acts.  It is well the Bill is based on these Acts because so much of our trade is with the United Kingdom. When people who come from the United Kingdom and set up industries here find our laws are similar to their laws it is of great help in commercial practice.  In some cases we have in the Bill gone beyond the British and Northern Ireland Acts.  It is here that I want to put in just one quiet word of warning.  I was talking a couple of months ago to a South African lawyer who told me that they had in his country adopted the British Act of 1948.  He said that so far as litigation went, and so on, where they had kept to the British Act they had found very little difficulty but where they had introduced innovations of their own, and at that particular time good innovations, they had run into difficulties.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the Minister and his advisers have overlooked this matter but we have to be particularly careful that where we have departed from those Acts&mdash;the British Act of 1948 and the Northern Ireland Act of 1960 <Col N="65" />&mdash;we are not making things difficult for ourselves.</P>
    <P>Section 191 requires that particulars of directors' salaries and emoluments be given in detail in company accounts.  We go further than even the Northern Ireland Act of 1960 which I think provides that this information is only supplied when it is required by 20 members of a company with a right to vote, or 20 per cent of the total shareholding&mdash;who are required in any case.  That may be theoretically a good idea but in practice it may lead to a lot of practical difficulties with the Revenue Commissioners as to the settling of accounts with them before they are produced to shareholders.  I have mentioned that as the sort of thing I have got in mind.  Except for that small word of warning, I support very much the Bill and am full of praise for the work which the Minister has done so far.</P>

      <P>I have pleasure in welcoming this Bill and in congratulating the Minister and the Special Committee on the excellent work they did in consolidating company law and bringing this comprehensive Bill before us.  The wonderful spirit in which the Special Committee acted right through made fine reading. A very harmonious atmosphere prevailed and the Minister proved the kindliest spirit of all with his ready acceptance of worthwhile suggestions as they came along.  I think it was an excellent committee in every way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate, as Senator Fitzpatrick has said, that it was not a Joint Committee of both Houses.  I know it is an imposition on the Minister and his officers to suggest that the Seanad should set up a Special Committee of its own because that would impose a very great burden on the Minister for months to come, but if the House is to do its work as it wants to do it we have no option but to ask for a Special Committee because we have on both sides of the House very able and eminent lawyers and I am sure they can make some contribution to the Bill before it comes back on Report.  I would like, therefore, to endorse <Col N="66" /> Senator Fitzpatrick's plea that a special committee be set up.  If any further matters need be raised Senators can raise them on Report or perhaps, if a Special Committee is set up, those of us non-lawyers who are outside this committee can take up the points with which we are concerned with the committee while it is sitting.</P>

      <P>It is a very large measure and it is possible that everybody who has studied it has some views on it.  There is the question of liquidation and receivers on which I have a view and I should prefer to give that view, if the Seanad agrees, first in Committee.  For that reason I support the views expressed.</P>

      <P>At the outset I should like to express my appreciation of the remarks of Senators who commended the work of the Committee, appreciation on behalf of the Committee, on behalf of the officials and on my own behalf.  It was, indeed, a monumental work.  This was, I think, the biggest single piece of legislation ever introduced into the Oireachtas since the Houses of the Oireachtas were established. The original Act referred to by Senator Fitzpatrick was passed in 1908. To say that it has stood the test of time since then would perhaps be an overstatement because in the last quarter century it has certainly wobbled quite a lot.  In fact, there was a move in the nineteen twenties to have the 1908 Act amended and brought up to date with the times but, unfortunately, pressure of work and the priority of other measures at that time precluded the possibility.  Other attempts were made in the meantime culminating in the establishment in 1951 of the Committee on Company Law to which reference has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill itself has been in preparation and under discussion for quite a <Col N="67" /> considerable time.  That it has been under discussion for quite a considerable time is obvious from the fact that coming before the Special Committee it had 400 sections and 91 pages of schedule and now it has 399 sections and a similar number of pages of schedule.  The Special Committee went through it minutely but before the Committee got down to their work they canvassed opinions and invited comments from all sources that they thought could make a contribution to it.  The opinions and recommendations they received were given the most careful attention by the Committee as indicated by the number of amendments made to the Bill&mdash;in Committee first 133 and on recommittal 181, with a further nine in the Dáil on Report, making in all 323 amendments.</P>
    <P>The Special Committee of the Dáil was composed of members of all sides of the House and was representative as well of legal accountancy, industrial and business interests.  I think, therefore, that we can claim that few measures if any have got such close, detailed and expert attention as this one.  It was my hope that the Seanad would pass the Bill with whatever amendments it could make openly on the floor of the House without reference to a Special Committee.  However, I can appreciate the force of arguments by Senators that a Special Committee of the Seanad might also be established. I did inquire at the time when the Special Committee of the Dáil was being set up whether it would be possible to have a joint committee of both Houses but my advice then was that it was not possible for the purpose of legislation; a joint committee is possible for other purposes but not for legislation.  Therefore, I want to assure the Seanad that it was not without consideration that a Special Committee of the Dáil only was set up for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the detailed attention that has been given&mdash;it was a non-Party Bill so there was no kudos going to anybody for submitting or resisting amendments&mdash;little if anything can be done to improve the Bill I think, but, however, that is a matter <Col N="68" /> for the Seanad in their wisdom.  During the final Stages in the Dáil, when I was pressed by members of the Opposition to indicate a date on which I would propose to bring the Bill on the Statute Book by order, I stated that I hoped to do so on the 1st April next. I am anxious that the Bill in its final form should be available for perusal by the people whose interests it affects in very good time before 1st April which I thought would be a suitable date to enact a measure such as this. Having regard to the amount of detailed work put into it, I doubt if it will be necessary for a Special Committee of the Seanad to spend very much time on it, though it is likely that some Senators will have points to make on some but not on very many sections of the Bill.  I would be willing to ask the Seanad to commit the Bill to a Special Committee but I would be anxious to have the Bill brought back to the House if possible within a short time and I suggest it might be possible to do so on 4th December next.  I doubt if it will be necessary to have the number of meetings the Dáil Special Committee had having regard to the fact that there is little more that can be done to the Bill.  Therefore, I would agree to the suggestion that a Special Committee of the Seanad be appointed but I would ask the Seanad to order if it can be so ordered that the Special Committee report by 4th December and if it has not for any reason reported by that date that it will come back to the Seanad anyway.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to bring the Registration of Business Names Act, 1916, into line with modern conditions and to extend its application to bodies corporate.  In its main essentials no substantial changes are being made, and the Bill is very largely a tidying up operation. The Bill has already been examined in detail by a Special Committee of the Dáil, who made a number of amendments in it.</P>
      <P>For many years before 1916, there had been a demand for legislation requiring persons trading under names other than their own, to register relevant particulars for public inspection. The advent of World War I brought matters to a head and in 1916 the Registration of Business Names Act was passed, partly to deal with aliens carrying on business under names which concealed their true identity.  This Act proved useful in peacetime and it has continued in operation since.  The registration requirements are regarded by many as rather irksome but I am quite satisfied that the view of the commercial community, generally, is that machinery of this kind should be available to help in the identification of persons trading under business names.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal requirements of the 1916 Act relating to registration of business names applied only to individuals and partnerships.  It is quite common, however, for companies and other corporate bodies to trade under <Col N="70" /> names other than their corporate names and it is desirable in such cases also that suitable particulars should be filed for public inspection. One of the principal alterations proposed in the present Bill is to expand the business names law accordingly. I would like to refer to two other changes of some significance.  The first relates to Section 2 of the 1916 Act which provides that any person carrying on business as nominee or trustee of or for another person or acting as agent for any foreign firm must file certain particulars with the Registrar of Business Names.  This provision applies regardless of the business name used, and it was designed principally to expose any business activities of aliens during World War I.  There is no need for it any more and I do not, therefore, propose to ask for its re-enactment. The other change refers to Section 8 of the Act of 1916, which provides that where a person fails to register under the Act, any rights which he may have under a contract entered into in relation to the business will be unenforceable.  This section seems also to have been prompted by wartime considerations; the disability penalty imposed is, I think, too severe for peacetime conditions and it is not proposed, therefore, to include a section on these lines in the new law. There are a number of other alterations of a rather detailed nature, but, as they would be more suitable for discussion in Committee, I do not propose mentioning them now.</P>
    <P>During the passage of the Bill through the Dáil it was strongly represented to me that something should be done to facilitate the taking of civil proceedings against the proprietors of concerns conducted under business names which are not, through the neglect of the proprietors, registered under the business names law.  I must say I have the greatest sympathy with any solicitors, and their clients, who find themselves in a predicament as a result of a default to register a business name.  Following consultation with the Department of Justice, however, I am satisfied that this is not so much a matter for the business names <Col N="71" /> law as for rules of court.  I have asked my colleague, the Minister for Justice, to see what can be done to deal with this matter, and I have no doubt that if a satisfactory solution can be found, he will see that the necessary steps are taken to implement it.</P>
    <P>It was also represented to me that persons who fail to comply with this branch of the law should be more vigorously prosecuted.  In reply I was able to give an assurance, which I now repeat, that so far as it is within the powers and resources of my Department, compliance with these requirements will be effectively enforced.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this Bill will improve the existing law relating to the registration of business names, and that it is as far as we can go in this field without imposing unreasonable burdens on the commercial community. Senators will have noticed that this Bill and the Companies Bill are travelling together and that they were, in fact, examined with a fine comb by the same Special Committee of the Dáil.  It is my hope that they can both be enacted very shortly and brought into operation on the same date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister stated, the object of this Bill is to bring the Business Names Act of 1916 up to date.  Broadly speaking, the object of that Act was to compel people trading under a name other than their own to disclose their identity by registering particulars in the Business Names Office. That was desirable during the first World War and, indeed, it is highly desirable in peacetime.  From time to time you have people carrying on business under a business name and when you go to sue them when they have made default it is impossible to get them.  One case comes to my mind of a young girl who had been a patient in a sanatorium.  She answered a notice in a daily paper which advertised some article of clothing for sale.  She sent away £1 for this garment but never got it and she did not get her £1 back.  On that occasion I tried to locate the firm. It was trading in the city of Dublin. This incident took place about ten years ago.  I sought the help of the <Col N="72" /> Department of Industry and Commerce without much success.  I felt very strongly about it at the time principally because the girl had been a patient in a sanatorium and I thought the proprietor of the firm should be traced and prosecuted.  I just mention that case to show the necessity for a measure of this sort to compel people to disclose their identity.</P>
      <P>It is a Bill over which there cannot be any controversy and it is an improvement on the existing Act. Apparently this point was raised in the Dáil and I should like to repeat it now.  From my own experience the Business Names Act, 1916, was largely ignored.  I have never in all my experience heard of a prosecution being brought under it and I am satisfied that through the length and breadth of the country there were people trading under business names without ever complying with that Act.  I am glad to hear that it is the intention to enforce this Act when it goes into the Statute Book, because I feel that what I said about the existing Act being ignored is quite true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reading through the Bill one thing struck me.  As I said, the object is to compel people to register particulars of their identity, their address and so on, so that they can be checked up on.  That being so, I find it rather difficult to understand Section 18 of the Bill.  I am not sure whether there was a similar section in the 1916 Act. Section 18, as far as I can see, from a quick look at it, makes it obligatory on a person who is trading under a business name to give all the particulars about himself on every sheet of notepaper and every billhead which he fills out.  I think that if he has complied with the Act and given all this information to the Registrar of Business Names there is hardly any necessity to give it again on his billheads and on his notepaper.  Having said all that, I think that this is a measure which can be considered in detail in Committee.  It was referred to a Special Committee of the Dáil. Although we have just referred the Companies Bill to a Special Committee of this House, I hardly think it is necessary to do that with this measure <Col N="73" /> but I think that the Committee Stage could conveniently be taken on the same day as the Companies Bill comes back to this House for consideration following its examination by a Special Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little to reply to in what Senator Fitzpatrick has said.  There may be just one or two points.  One is that there have, indeed, been prosecutions for offences against the old Act.  It is not always easy to bring them.  First, there has to be a police investigation as to the identity of a person who has been trading under a business name that has not been registered or a person who has offended in some other way. It often happens that these people have absconded, anyway, and it is impossible to bring proceedings against them.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzpatrick referred to Section 18.  That section was in the old Act as well.  Its purpose was that where a person trades under a business name it should be possible for a person dealing with him, who reads his letters, his circulars or his catalogues, to know exactly with whom he is dealing rather than to impose on that person the obligation of going to the Registrar's Office to find out.</P>
      <P>Business names are perhaps attractive, distinctive, very often catchy and a good selling medium but all that is poor consolation to a person who makes a contract with such a person and finds he can serve his writ on nobody in particular.  It is a safeguard for the public and it is not a very great onus on a person trading under a business name that he should have his name and proper title on his notepaper, catalogues and circulars as well as his business name.  Further than that, I think it is hardly necessary for me to comment.  It will be possible to go into it in more detail on the Committee Stage.  The suggestion of the Senator that it be taken on the 4th December with the Companies Bill is quite acceptable to me.</P>
