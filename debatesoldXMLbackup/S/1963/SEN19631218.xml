      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to make three minor amendments in the Central Bank Act, 1942.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 will empower the Central Bank to acquire securities of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development&mdash;usually known as the World Bank&mdash;which was established in 1944 and of which Ireland became a member in 1957.  Countries which are members of the World Bank are expected to assist it to raise capital by investing in the securities it issues at market rates on the international capital markets.  The proceeds of these issues go to finance the World Bank's activities which are mainly concerned with productive projects in the less-developed countries.  Section 7 (1) (h) of the 1942 Act already empowers the Central Bank, for the purposes of or through its General Fund, to buy, hold or sell securities issued by or guaranteed <Col N="196" /> by any Government.  The members of the World Bank are Governments but because its securities are not directly guaranteed by member Governments they are not covered by Section 7 (1) (h) of the Act.  It is, therefore, proposed to amend this section and to do this in general terms so that the Central Bank will have power, if it so desires, to acquire securities which may be issued by any other international bank or financial institution formed by Governments.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill will replace the provisions in Sections 19 (4) (a) and 23 (6) of the 1942 Act which disqualify the Governor and Directors of the Central Bank from nomination or election to the Dáil or Seanad or as Uachtarán.  The Constitution provides that every citizen who has reached his 35th year of age is eligible for election to the office of President; it does not provide that disqualification in this respect may be imposed by law.  The provisions in the 1942 Act that the Governor and Directors of the Central Bank are ineligible for election to the office of Uachtarán could, therefore, be regarded as unconstitutional, and the Bill will repeal them.</P>
    <P>The 1942 Act also disqualifies the Governor or a Director, while he holds office, from being nominated or elected and from sitting or receiving payment as a member of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann.  On the principle that the legislature should have first claim on a person's services, these sections are being replaced by provisions that the Governor or a Director of the Central Bank who is nominated, with his consent, as a candidate for election to either House of the Oireachtas, or is nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann, shall thereupon cease to be Governor or Director of the Bank, and that any person who is for the time being entitled to sit in either House of the Oireachtas shall, while so entitled, be disqualified from being or becoming Governor or Director of the Bank. The existing provisions are being repealed in Sections 3 (ii) and (iii) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, Section 3 (i) of the Bill will remove the bar on the payment of <Col N="197" /> interest on deposits made with the Central Bank by Ministers of State, public authorities and the commercial banks under Section 7 (1) (b) of the 1942 Act.  This will make it feasible for these institutions to keep their liquid assets with the Central Bank rather than in London.  Up to now, such assets were kept mainly in London because the Central Bank was not in a position to offer the inducement of an interest payment such as these assets could earn in London.  It is clearly desirable that the Central Bank should be in a position to attract the liquid reserves of these institutions and thus strengthen its own capacity to discharge its functions as lender of last resort.  I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Insofar as the provisions of this Bill are purely fiscal, we do not see any objection to them and accordingly do not oppose them.  The clarification of the law <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Constitution and the Act of 1942 relating to people holding certain positions, and thereby rendering themselves ineligible for membership of either the Dáil or Seanad, or for holding the office of Uachtarán, is a welcome clarification.  It is a matter, however, which should be examined further in future legislation because it is rather difficult to grasp in the somewhat prosy passages of legislation why men cannot be trusted in dual offices, as it were.  I do not suppose that is the full import of the matter.  The Minister has pointed out that, as far as public service is concerned, membership of the Dáil or Seanad has the first claim, the purpose being to avoid any kind of clash of interest.  The provisions would seem reasonable.</P>
      <P>The provision enabling public authorities, the Minister and the commercial banks to keep their assets with the Central Bank rather than in London is a very desirable one.  It is one which will be welcomed by every interest in the country.  We welcome the Bill, as I said, and we do not oppose any part of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three principal objects in this Bill.  The first is to enable the Central Bank to purchase <Col N="198" /> securities in the World Bank, or other international banks, the financial resources of which are issued by Governments.  That is very commendable. It is something to which no one could object.  The funds in the World Bank are used in the development of underdeveloped countries and it is pleasant to know that we are doing our share in that direction.  One of the objectives of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> is that we should assist in the development of underdeveloped countries.  By allowing the Central Bank to take shares in the World Bank we will be enabled to do our part in this wholly admirable work.</P>
      <P>The second matter in the Bill is one on which I differ from the Minister, and have done so on more than one occasion.  I really cannot understand why anybody should not be a member of the Central Bank and a member of the Dáil or Seanad.  We have discussed this on many occasions.  When any sort of new public authority is being set up, it seems to me that the parliamentary draftsman invariably and automatically, and without consideration, puts in a clause stating that members of the board of this new authority cannot be members of either the Dáil or the Seanad.  Now that seems to me to be something that requires explanation. Surely experience gained in the Central Bank would be of considerable use to members of either the Dáil or Seanad in considering financial business.  The experience gained in the Dáil or Seanad could, I think, add to the qualifications of a Central Bank Director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to be accepted in this country now that no one can take part in politics and in the administration of a State body at the same time.  That seems to be accepted without question. I have raised this here time after time &mdash;I am, I think, the only person who has raised it&mdash;and I have had no explanation.  There is no barrier in England to a member of the Board of the Bank of England being a member of either the Lords or the Commons. The Bank of England is a very much more powerful body than our Central Bank and, if it can stand the presence <Col N="199" /> of parliamentarians, I really do not see how the administration of our Central Bank could be injured by the presence of members of either the Dáil or the Seanad.  It has never been explained.  No reason has ever been given for it.  If any new Bill is being drafted to set up any new board, the parliamentary draftsman puts it in automatically.  It has a very deleterious effect in keeping people with a great deal of business knowledge and experience out of the Dáil and Seanad and in keeping people with a knowledge of the political affairs of the country from taking part in the administration of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The third object of the Bill is one of which we can all approve.  It is to enable the Central Bank to pay interest on deposits.  In the Central Bank Act, 1942, the Central Bank was authorised to accept deposits from banks and certain other institutions, but not from the general public.  That section was drafted on the report of the Banking Commission published in 1938, of which I was a member.  In those days it was usual for central banks not to pay interest on deposits.  Since then, there has been a change in world practice.  This section simply brings our Central Bank into line with what takes place in other central banks.</P>
    <P>It has the advantage that the liquid assets of the associated banks and other credit institutions can be employed in Dublin instead of in London. At present, credit institutions with liquid assets have either to deposit them in the Central Bank without interest or to employ them in London. This will enable them to deposit in the Central Bank and to get a rate of interest on their deposits.  It is quite possible, of course, that the Central Bank itself may have to invest these liquid assets in the London money market.  However, that is a question that does not arise on this Bill.</P>
    <P>It certainly is an improvement that the depositors in the Central Bank, who do not include the general public, should receive interest on their deposits, just as the people who make deposits in the ordinary banks do.  It should be made clear to the Seanad that these powers are purely permissive. <Col N="200" /> There is nothing in this Bill to force anybody to make deposits with the Central Bank and nothing to force the Central Bank to take them.  It is a minor alteration, but it is in the right direction.  It increases the powers of the Central Bank.  It tends to make the country financially more autonomous and to give the banks the possibility of deriving some interest on their liquid deposits in our Central Bank instead of employing them in London.</P>
    <P>To my mind, the disqualification of members of the Dáil and Seanad from sitting on the Board of the Central Bank is quite unjustifiable.  Otherwise, this is an excellent Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator O'Brien's remarks in regard to Section 2.  He has put the case quite squarely, that there should not be, in the case of a person considered eminent enough to serve as a director of the Central Bank, any doubt of his capacity to act both as a member of a House of the Oireachtas and as a member of the Central Bank. There is undue anxiety on this point. Members of the House only have to keep the last speaker, Senator O'Brien, in mind to realise that he is both eminently qualified and valuable as a member of the Seanad as he equally would be as a director of the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>I want to go a bit further than Senator O'Brien.  He has made the case that it would be wrong that a person be prohibited from serving in both capacities.  But this section is even more restrictive and undesirable than that.  This section does not allow a person who is a Governor or Director of the Central Bank to be nominated for either House of the Oireachtas.  It is the mere act of nomination, and not the act of election, which disqualifies him from the governorship or directorship of the Central Bank which he previously held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is altogether intolerable.  We could well have a case of a most eminent person acting as a Director of the Central Bank.  He could be nominated by one of the vocational nominating bodies for Seanad Éireann.  We know only too well what has been in the past the fate of several eminent people nominated by vocational bodies <Col N="201" /> for election to Seanad Éireann.  In these cases, nomination and election are two things with a very wide gap between them.  Whatever case there is to be made for forbidding a person being a member of both Seanad Éireann and of the Board of the Central Bank, it is going altogether and utterly too far to put a prohibition on a person being at the same time a nominee for election to Seanad Éireann and a member of the Board of the Central Bank.  I agree completely with the case Senator O'Brien made.  Even if that case is not granted by the Minister, surely this particular section could be amended, so that the prohibition would operate only in respect of persons elected to either House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with previous speakers in protesting against Section 2 of this Bill.  It is something we have protested against many times in the past.  Where a State board or other State company is set up, we see this infamous clause coming in at all times.  In some Bills it appears somewhat less restrictive than this in that the disqualification begins when a person is elected to either House.  I have noticed in the past two years a tendency to become more extreme and to make it a disqualification even to be nominated for the Dáil or Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It ill-becomes the Government or their advisers to insert such a clause at a time when all Parties are appealing for people to come forward and serve in Parliament.  We are all too conscious of the many classes prevented from serving here.  Public servants and local authority officials are either actively prohibited or <i>de facto</i> prohibited in that they cannot make the sacrifice involved.  The Seanad is a place where, as Senator Dooge said, many men could serve with distinction while serving on another body as well.  Certainly, this Seanad would be a far better place if some of the Directors of the Central Bank were here as members.  I am sure they would lend enlightenment and guidance to many of our debates. To quote the example given by Senator Dooge, Senator O'Brien would be an <Col N="202" /> ornament on the Board of the Central Bank if called on to act.  Likewise, our Cathaoirleach, a distinguished economist, would be an ornament on the Board of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>I do not see any reason for this, apart from the growing tendency of our bureaucracy to try to arrogate to themselves an ever-increasing control over our public life.  This anxiety to spread bureaucracy is shown by the effort to restrict membership of the Dáil and Seanad to a few classes of people&mdash;mainly self-employed people, such as farmers, publicans, shopkeepers and a few other categories. We cannot have a balanced Parliament when such restrictive practices are in operation.  If it is right and proper, as I believe it is, that a distinguished civil servant can be a Director of the Central Bank, I cannot see the logic of saying that a distinguished parliamentarian cannot equally sit on that Board.</P>
    <P>This is a section we will have to fight with all the resources of the Seanad on Committee Stage and right on until this Bill leaves here.  In bringing this into an institution&mdash;the Central Bank&mdash;where it did not exist previously, the Bill is yet another step in the strangulation of our public life, and we should not subscribe to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should consider adopting the procedure followed in the case of ESB employees. At one time they could not be nominated and I am almost certain that provision was amended to enable them to be nominated.  A member of the ESB was elected to the Dáil as a member of our Party at one time and the question arose as to whether he would lose his seat and whether there would be another election in that constituency.  I think the relevant provision in the legislation was amended and the rule now is that a person may be nominated and that while he is actually a member of the Oireachtas, he may not remain in the ESB.  The Minister might consider something along those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am equally disturbed by the way this sort of provision seems to be automatically written into <Col N="203" /> Bills coming before us but there is less to be said against the provision here than there is in regard to other semi-State undertakings that are dealt with in legislation.  I should hope that the Central Bank would be more an instrument of Government policy in finance and economic development, an extension of the Government's arm.  As such, there would not be a very good case for allowing Directors of the Central Bank to be members of the Oireachtas. As I say, this provision is not as objectionable here as it is in relation to other semi-State undertakings. Therefore, there is probably a better case for excluding members of the Oireachtas from the governorship of the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>To come down to the section itself, I am wondering is it really operative as it is written.  It says that if a Governor of the bank or a Director is nominated with his consent, he then automatically ceases to be Governor or a Director. Under recent electoral legislation, a person can now be nominated for a Dáil election simply by somebody putting his name on a nomination paper and depositing £100.  I do not think there is any provision in regard to consent.  I may be wrong but my memory is that there is no such provision. I have no ambition to deposit £100 in favour of any Governor or Director of the Central Bank but if my memory is correct, there could be a peculiar situation.  A person could be nominated, £100 being deposited on his behalf.  How do we deal with the question of his consent?  Will he make a public statement saying this was without his consent or who will judge whether his consent is there or not? That is not covered in this section.  My memory may be at fault and perhaps the Minister will say what is the exact position in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to the protest made against Section 2 and in doing so, I should like to ask the Minister to tell us what principle, if any, is behind this section.  I understood him to say in his speech that the section was thought desirable because the Oireachtas should have first claim on its <Col N="204" /> members.  Most of us here&mdash;in fact, I might say all of us&mdash;are part-time politicians.  Most members of the Dáil are not members of that House on a full-time basis.  All of us have other interests.  Whatever may be said about having such a prohibition in the case of members of the Dáil, it is very hard to make a case for it in this House.</P>
      <P>If we believe what we are told about this House, it is a vocational body, a non-political assembly.  That is what we are told here from time to time when we speak about Parties.  At any rate, the members of this House are elected on such a basis as to make it very unlikely that one member would have a very big influence on a vote. The Government of the day see to it in one way or another that they have an absolute majority.  Therefore, I cannot see how a case can be made in favour of Section 2 as far as this House is concerned and, as has been said by other speakers, why it is necessary to disqualify a director just because he is nominated as a candidate for the Dáil or Seanad.</P>
      <P>As Senator Quinlan has said, people have been nominated for election to this House and they did not get a single vote.  The records will prove that.  It might be a good thing to allow people who are eminently qualified to sit in this House to be nominated so that the electorate in general can see what happens.  This principle has crept into legislation of disqualifying people who succeed in being nominated for election to Dáil Éireann from sitting on semi-State bodies.  It is a bad principle and one which should be reconsidered at the highest level, with a view to deciding whether it should not be modified, if not abandoned altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly agree with those who have spoken on Section 2 so far that, generally speaking, sections of this kind are undesirable. Everyone nowadays will agree it is ridiculous that a minor official of some semi-State body should be prevented from being nominated for the Oireachtas or from being a member of it, but the position is entirely different in regard to Section 2 of this Bill and I certainly hope the Minister will not agree to make any change in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" /> One of the most important factors in the financial and economic administration of the country over the past few years has been the existence of the Central Bank as a completely independent, non-political, non-Party body which is able to give advice to all Governments, irrespective of what Party are in power, and which, in fact, has severely criticised almost every Government in office since the Central Bank was first formed.  Because of that, because of the very valuable service which it performs on an independent basis, it is very undesirable that there should be any suggestion that any Governor or Director of the Central Bank had even the remotest connection with party politics.  I think that position is entirely different from the position of a minor official in the ESB perhaps.  I think the fact of being nominated is as much an open avowal of party politics as being elected.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick made the point that it is conceivable that a non-political non-Party person could be elected to the Seanad.  It could happen, but we must be realistic.  Generally speaking, members of the Seanad have certain Party interests.  Even if one visualises a completely non-Party member of the Central Bank becoming a member of the House, I am not at all sure that it would be a good idea to have a member of the Central Bank put in the position of having to make pronouncements in this House in the debates on the annual Finance Bill or other financial business.  I think the whole value of the Central Bank is that they are not thrown into the public field.  Their reports can be unbiassed.  They are not connected with party politics, and they have not published debates or discussions of the kind that go on here.  Therefore, this section while it is extremely undesirable in many other cases as we have seen from time to time, is entirely necessary in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be a very open question whether there could be certain regulations governing the Directors of the Central Bank, in that even if they were eligible for election as any other member of the community whether or not they might succeed <Col N="206" /> in getting elected, their positions as Directors might not be just so simple. It is a very debatable point whether or not they would be eligible.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank can be a very important institution in the work of the nation dealing with finance.  I should like to hear from the Minister what part the Central Bank play in general, or intend to play, in directing the financial policy of the country.  They have quite a lot of work to do.  This is a rather burning question as it affects the people from time to time, especially people who need credit from the banks, or from what are fairly well known as credit companies, or from the local authorities, particularly where the interest rates charged on loans are concerned. I do not know how far the Central Bank have influenced policy, but they could make clear to the people what they think the interest rates should be.</P>
      <P>The interest charges on borrowed money are regarded by sections of the community as a rather big problem.  I might quote the case particularly of members of the community who build their own houses and have to borrow money from the banks or the local authorities, or from some person who has money to give them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, in relation to the exact proposals before us, but I was anxious to make that point to the Minister.  The Central Bank can be very important in influencing policy and dealing with finances on a commercial basis, and with what the interest rates generally might be.  The point has been made in different parts of the country that by the time a borrower has paid back a loan for the building of a house, the interest rate has involved him in the payment of almost double the price of the house. However, I am not permitted to proceed on that line.  I was asked to get the Minister's views on whether the Central Bank would be able to advise on what interest rates might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The big discussion on this Stage of the Bill has been on the question of the eligibility of members <Col N="207" /> of the Oireachtas to be members of the Central Bank.  We are not changing policy very much.  We are only reversing it, as it were, because up to the present a member of the Central Bank could not be a TD or a Senator.  We are saying now that a TD or a Senator cannot be a member of the Central Bank.  In other words, the banks are making their own rules and saying: &ldquo;We do not care who is a member of the Oireachtas, but whoever he may be, he cannot join this Board.&rdquo;  In fact, it amounts to the same thing so far as policy goes.</P>
      <P>All I can say is that this question of policy in regard to State boards has come up many times, and the major Parties seem to agree that it is undesirable that members of the Oireachtas should be eligible for membership of State bodies.  I should not like to state categorically that that rule was made entirely in the interests of the country.  There may have been some element of consideration for the Parties themselves.  It might be awkward for Parties to be compelled, as it were, from time to time, to put a member on these boards.</P>
      <P>I was never a very disinterested advocate on one side or the other of this question.  One good argument I have heard against it is that they are put in a peculiar position because these bodies are subject to review from time to time by the Houses of the Oireachtas, especially when an amending Bill, such as this, is before the Houses.  There is an opportunity for members to state their views with regard to the activities of the boards. It has been argued that if there were members of the Seanad who were also members of the Board of the Central Bank, their opinions would carry undue weight here in regard to the activities of those bodies.  In other words, it would be difficult to expect an objective approach from members of the Seanad who were also members of those bodies.  That is one good argument against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not altogether in favour of one side or the other, but I think that if we make it a rule that a member of the Seanad cannot be a member of the Board of the Central Bank, we must <Col N="208" /> logically say also that if he allows himself to be nominated for election to Dáil or Seanad, he thereby disqualifies himself from being a member of the Board.  That might not apply so very cogently to the Seanad as to the Dáil because one can imagine that when a person is nominated for election to the Dáil, he has to take part in electoral activities where his public statements and so on might not go so well for the board on which he is acting.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan referred to the restrictive practices which deprive us of service on these boards, but if we look at it carefully, we will find the number is small.  Taking all the State boards, I do not believe the number would add up to 100, and 100 people from this State are a very small proportion indeed.</P>
    <P>Senator Boland raised the matter of ESB employees.  I think employees are in a different category.  It did happen on one occasion that a man was selected to stand for election for the Dáil and had to resign his job in the ESB.  He was defeated in the election and found he could not get back his employment in the ESB.</P>
    <P>That is a very good reason for making the amendment as far as employees are concerned, so that they will not lose their connection with the particular body with which they were employed unless they were elected, that the body would await the result of the election.  In the case of boards, the situation is different.  In practice, what happens is that a member of a board resigns; he goes up for election and if he fails, he goes back and asks for renomination.</P>

      <P>In the new Electoral Act, the question of consent comes in; a board member seeking election to the Dáil must give his consent before he can be nominated because, as Senators are aware, the process of nomination is very much simpler than what it was <Col N="209" /> and it would be bad if the consent of the person concerned were not given. Any two people can nominate a person now and therefore it has been made part of the procedure that the person's consent is given.</P>
      <P>In Seanad elections, the situation is not quite so clear.  It is laid down that the President must have consent before he nominates a person.  I know that consent is not required in regard to university nominations but I am not quite sure how it applies in regard to the different panels.  In this Bill it was thought desirable that consent should be necessary.  Let us say the chairman of a board felt it was his duty to see that the law was carried out to the full.  He might call on a member of his board to resign because he was nominated for election.  Then if the person says he had not given his consent to such nomination, he is all right and he is not asked to resign.</P>
      <P>A point raised by Senator Yeats was that in respect of this Board there might be something more to be said for the exclusion of members of the Oireachtas than in regard to other State boards.  I agree.  The Central Bank is a very important body in respect of which the Government are very much concerned.  The Central Bank should, I believe, be expected to facilitate the Government.  The Government do not require, and we would not expect, that the Central Bank should go beyond what is right and proper for such an institution.</P>
      <P>As Senators are aware, the Government usually get a lecture once a year on the Government's activities for that year from the Central Bank.  As far as I am concerned, I have always welcomed it, always looked upon it as a constructive criticism of what the Government have been doing.  I have tried, as far as possible, to take this yearly lecture to heart.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, I have tried to take the Central Bank's advice as far as possible and I would be very sorry that the Central Bank should be perhaps influenced in its lecture to the Minister for Finance because it had a <Col N="210" /> few chauvinistic members of Fianna Fáil on its Board.  That would be very bad in the end and I agree with Senator Yeats it is very important that members of one side of this House or the other should not be on the Central Bank Board.</P>
      <P>The last point raised by the last Senator to speak was whether or not the Central Bank has any great influence in the country.  I believe it has. It has not an influence on what the commercial banks do in certain respects, but before there is a change in the rate of interest, the commercial banks always consult the Central Bank and from my experience, I know that the Central Bank takes a very strong line in regard to rates of interest. Therefore, in that matter, its influence is felt by the commercial banks.  I can say to the Senator, therefore, that the influence of the Central Bank is effective in many cases and I have no doubt that that influence will become more and more effective.</P>
      <P>The last clause of the Bill deals with the payment of interest on the liquid assets of the commercial banks, among others.  That, too, will give to the Central Bank more influence and more power.  If Senators will look at the balance sheets of the commercial banks, they will become aware that our commercial banks hold a considerable proportion of their assets in foreign places, such as London.  One of the results of that is that if a commercial bank here has a fair amount of money on tap and if a sudden movement takes place and they want to be in a position to pay, they must have liquid money, money they can lay their hands on immediately.</P>
      <P>The only place at the present time for that type of source of quick money is the money market in London where a commercial bank here can invest money at call, as they say.  They can call that money back in an hour's time, a day's time or two days' time, if they want it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are trying to build up that facility for our commercial banks here with the Central Bank.  It is something that will have to be done gradually&mdash; it will not bear full fruit for a very long time&mdash;but I hope that in time a <Col N="211" /> fair amount of the money now going to London to provide liquidity for our commercial banks will be held by the Central Bank.  It must be remembered that for a long time the Central Bank will have to provide for its own liquidity but not to the extent of 100 per cent of the amount of money placed with it at the moment because it will be in the position that a number of the commercial banks will be depositing with it and the Central Bank would be safe in retaining at least a small amount of that money itself and still be retaining its own liquidity requirements.</P>

    <Title>Stock Transfer Bill, 1963: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill simplifies the procedure for transferring ownership of fully paid-up registered securities in line with the simplification recently introduced in Britain and Northern Ireland.  The Dublin Stock Exchange has asked for this legislation to enable uniformity of transfer procedure to be restored throughout Ireland and Britain.  At present Irish stockbrokers operate two transfer procedures&mdash;the existing procedure for Irish securities and the new simplified procedure for British securities.  The reform is desirable in itself and the extension of the simplified procedure to Irish securities will result in considerable saving of time for stockbrokers, banks and registrars of stocks and shares as well as for the investing public.  Indeed, the slowness and complexity of the present transfer system has often been cited as a factor which discourages prospective investors.  The Bill follows the lines of the British Stock Transfer Act, 1963.</P>
      <P>The main provisions governing the new stock transfer procedure are set out in Section 2 of the Bill and are:</P>
      <P>(i)  a new form of transfer for general use is introduced;</P>
      <P>(ii)  the person to whom securities are transferred need not in future sign the instrument of transfer;</P>
      <P>(iii)  the signature of the transferor need not be witnessed; and</P>
      <P>(iv)  a transferor whose holding has been sold on a stock exchange will not have to execute more than a single transfer form even where parts of the holding have been sold to different buyers.  A new form to be executed by the broker is introduced for such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill applies to fully paid-up transferable registered securities.  It will not apply, however, to securities carrying a contingent liability, namely, <Col N="213" /> partly paid up shares or securities of a company limited by guarantee or an unlimited company.  In the case of the transfer of these shares the present form will continue to be used and the witnessed signatures of both transferor and transferee will continue to be required.  This will ensure that shares involving liabilities cannot be transferred to a person without his written consent.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that the Bill has effect notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any enactment or instrument, such as articles of association, relating to the transfer of securities. The Bill thus amends in respect of fully paid-up shares the share transfer procedure contained in the Companies Bill, 1963.  Because of the complexity of the Companies Bill and as the Stock Transfer Bill, which covers a wider range of securities than company shares, introduces a new principle it was considered desirable to have the new transfer system discussed separately. For that reason the Companies Bill was not amended.  However, in deference to views expressed in the course of the debate in the Dáil on the Stock Transfer Bill consideration is being given to a suggestion to incorporate in the Companies Bill by way of amendment whatever material of the Stock Transfer Bill is relevant to it.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides against the evasion of stamp duty by means of the circulation of transfers in which the name of the transferee has not been inserted. Power is being taken in Section 5 of the Bill to permit of the amendment of the new transfer forms by way of regulations.  Under Section 6 such regulations and also regulations made under Section 1 determining the Stock Exchanges to be recognised for the purpose of the Bill, will be required to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>At the request of the Dublin Stock Exchange, it is proposed to recognise all the Stock Exchanges recognised in Britain in the corresponding British Order.  The Bill was welcomed in the Dáil for the simplified procedures it introduced.  I am sure that it will also <Col N="214" /> recommend itself to this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express the approval of this side of the House of this Bill.  It has been introduced to keep the form of transfer of paid-up stock here in line with the transfer form which is being used in England, following the British Stock Transfer Act of 1963.  Of course it is highly desirable that the same forms should be used here as are acceptable on the British Stock Exchange and it is certainly very desirable that there should not be any more difficulty in transferring stock here than there is in England.</P>
      <P>I personally welcome the provision in the Bill which dispenses with the necessity for the transferee to sign the transfer because it does happen from time to time that a person in America or some other place gives instructions to invest money here and if it is necessary he should sign the transfer, it becomes necessary then to send the transfer out to some foreign country, and it might come back not properly completed unless he gives it to some professional man out there.  That is done away with here.  Of course a signature is still necessary.</P>
      <P>I am glad to hear from the Minister that he has considered carefully representations made in the other House concerning the alteration of the Companies Bill which has just become law. This Bill as it stands would seek to change that Act which was only recently passed.  That would be a great mistake, because the Companies Bill came to us as a result, first of all, of a very lengthy session by the Company Law Reform Committee, who sat for several years.</P>
      <P>Some years after that Committee presented their report, the Companies Bill was introduced in the Dáil and there it got a very patient and a very constructive hearing and was dealt with by a Special Committee as a non-controversial measure.  It came to this House as, we thought, a Bill which could not be very much improved upon, but nevertheless a Select Committee was set up and some of the amendments suggested here were accepted by the Minister in the spirit in which they were put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would, therefore, be a tragedy that <Col N="215" /> the good work done should be undone and that the form which has been just newly prescribed in the Companies Bill should be done away with by a separate measure known as the Stock Transfer Bill, 1963.  I understand that some months ago the Stock Transfer Act became law in England, that it was apparent then that a similar Bill would be necessary here and a question was put down in the other House asking what steps the Government proposed to take to bring the law here into line with the law in England.  If these Bills could have been introduced at the same time in the other House, there would not have been the disadvantage of having the Companies Bill altered so quickly by an independent measure.</P>
    <P>At any rate, I am glad the Minister has consented to reconsider the matter. I believe that an offer was made in the Dáil that a one-line amending Bill would be given to him in a matter of minutes in the Dáil, if he accepted it, in order to avoid the undesirable situation I have mentioned.  I trust that the Minister will now accept that offer and that he will not spoil the good work of consolidation done by the other Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only matter that arose here was this matter of the amendment of the Companies Bill.  I should like to put it to Senators that it is not, perhaps, as important an issue as it might appear.  It would not have been necessary to put in this amendment in this Bill if the Companies Bill had become law a day before this Bill was brought before the Dáil because a clause in this Bill says that these sections shall apply, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any enactment&mdash;that is how it stood&mdash;including the law in relation to the transfer of these securities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Companies Bill had been law before this, that could have stood and everything would have been right but there was the peculiar position that the Companies Bill had been passed by the Dáil but not actually signed, and then there was a certain doubt on the part of the draftsman that it might not apply until the Act was actually <Col N="216" /> brought into operation, because, I understand, the Companies Bill is brought into operation by an order of the Minister.  On account of that uncertainty, it was thought well to put in this amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, of course, is responsible for the Companies Bill and I am quite sure he would like to have that consolidation measure there as long as possible without amendment.  I put to him the opinion in the Dáil and said that he could probably bring in an amending consolidation Bill; that I presumed it would go through both Houses without very much discussion; and that if that were done before a new Bill was translated and printed, it would not give rise to very much extra trouble.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is considering that matter and it is for him to decide.  My duty in relation to this Bill is over and done with.  It is for him to decide whether he would like to have his Bill amended in the way suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to release £50,000 of the funds of suitors vested in the Accountant of the Courts of Justice and to use it to help finance the rebuilding of the Opera House, Cork, which was destroyed by fire towards the end of 1955.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> The loss of Cork Opera House was keenly felt by the people of the city and the county.  A number of public-spirted persons formed a new Cork Opera House Company in 1958 and immediately set about the formidable task of raising the necessary funds for a new building.  The company is a public one with an authorised share capital of £125,000 in ordinary shares of £1 each and its directors are six prominent Cork citizens.</P>
    <P>It was estimated at the time that the overall cost of rebuilding would be approximately £150,000.  In 1959 the company approached the Government, through the Minister for Industry and Commerce, for assistance in reaching this amount as it was clear from an early date that no more than £75,000 could be raised by subscriptions from the public and by local fund-raising activities.  They were informed that the Government would be prepared to seek approval for a State Guarantee of a loan of £50,000 to be provided by a commercial bank.  The necessary steps are now being taken by the Minister for Finance for the issue of this guarantee under the State Guarantees Act, 1954.  In addition, the Cork Corporation are providing an interest free loan of £25,000.</P>
    <P>The negotiations involved in the raising of these funds were complicated and prolonged.  The company, therefore, were not in a position to put the work out to tender until late in 1961. When tenders were received, it became clear that the estimate of £150,000 was by now unrealistic because of increased building costs and the necessity for compliance with stringent municipal standards of public health and safety, and that the cost of the new building would be about £200,000.  The Opera House Company thus found themselves facing the unpleasant alternatives either of having to seek another £50,000 or of abandoning a project for which three-quarters of the outlay had already been assured.</P>
    <P>The company had by this time canvassed all local business concerns and many national ones as well, and it was evident that no further financial assistance from these sources was to be expected.  A large amount had also <Col N="219" /> been subscribed in small sums by many thousands of local people, who could hardly be asked to provide any more. A total of £75,000 has now been subscribed from private sources and the company has pointed out that the raising of such a large sum of money is evidence of the widespread desire that the Opera House should be rebuilt.  Accordingly, they asked the Government, through the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to review the problem in a generous light so as to make it possible, by the provision of the additional funds now required, for the company to carry its plans to completion.</P>
    <P>It was clear at this juncture that, without substantial Government aid, the project would have to be abandoned. The extent of the commitments already undertaken by the company made it impossible for them to assume any further financial burdens so that aid in the shape of a further guaranteed loan or even an interest-free loan, would not solve the company's difficulties. We have decided, therefore, that, subject to the approval of the Oireachtas, a grant of £50,000 should be provided from the funds of suitors for the project.</P>
    <P>The loss of the Cork Opera House was a severe blow to the cultural life of the south of Ireland.  Enthusiasm for its rebuilding is great and I am sure that Senators will agree that the grant of £50,000, which is provided for in the Bill, will be money well spent.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the grant of £50,000 to be made available to the company from the funds of suitors will be given on the basis that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) the grant will not be made available until all the other funds, private contributions, Cork Corporation loan and State-guaranteed loan, have been certified as expended on the building operations, and</P>
    <P>(2) if within 30 years the Opera House ceases to be used for drama and opera, the grant must be refunded, an allowance of one-thirtieth being made for each year for which the premises have been so used.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the fulfilment of the latter condition will be secured by an <Col N="220" /> indenture to be entered into between the company and the Minister for Finance and it will be arranged that the amount of any refund would be a charge on the premises.</P>
    <P>The funds of suitors are the cash and securities belonging to suitors which have been transferred or paid into or deposited in the High Court.  In the normal course, they may be used only for the benefit of suitors entitled.  Part of the funds consist of unclaimed dividends and balances which have been accumulating over more than 200 years.  These are known as the dormant funds and they may be defined more precisely as balances in accounts which have not been dealt with for 15 years or longer.</P>
    <P>The total liability in respect of the funds of suitors on the 31st October, 1963, was £10,323,000 of which the dormant funds amounted to about £947,000 consisting of cash to the value of £390,000 and securities to the nominal value of £557,000.  The actual funds, however, whether cash, money on deposit or investments standing in the name of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice do not amount to the totals which I have just mentioned. This is because cash and securities amounting to £648,150 and £130,000 respectively have been withdrawn from the funds of suitors under the authority of various Acts of the Parliament of Ireland, the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the Oireachtas. The purposes to which these withdrawn funds were applied included the building and improving of the Courts of Justice and the enlarging of the Law Library in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The last statutory authorisation for withdrawal from these funds was contained in the Funds of Suitors Act, 1959.  This Act enabled a total of £323,000 to be utilised for a number of specific purposes, namely, to provide financial assistance towards the rebuilding of the Abbey Theatre, to finance the repair and renovation of the buildings of the Society of King's Inns and to provide for the creation of a fund for the maintenance of the Society's Library.  All these Acts indemnified suitors for any loss which they might sustain by reason of the withdrawals. <Col N="221" /> This indemnity is backed by the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>It will be apparent from what I have said that a portion of the funds of suitors amounting in the aggregate to £778,150 is represented not by cash or securities but simply by the liability of the Central Fund to indemnify suitors against any loss.  The present Bill proposes the withdrawal of a further sum of £50,000 and provides for the usual indemnity backed by the Central Fund. The withdrawal of this amount will almost exhaust the so-called dormant funds.  As I have said, the dormant funds amount in all to £947,000.  When account is taken, however, of the fall in the value of the dormant securities, the net value of the funds is £866,000. The total withdrawals which have been authorised by the various statutes in the past, plus the amount of the proposed withdrawal under the Bill, amount to £828,000, leaving only £38,000 untouched.  As time goes on there will, of course, be a further accumulation of dormant funds.</P>
    <P>When the Abbey Theatre was destroyed, the Government were approached for help in rebuilding the Theatre.  This appeal was met by a grant of £250,000 from the funds of suitors which was provided under the Funds of Suitors Act, 1959.  The rebuilding of Cork Opera House is also an enterprise of national concern and unless the State assists financially, the work may never be completed.</P>
    <P>The granting of the £50,000 which is proposed in the Bill will enable Cork to have its Opera House.  As a cultural amenity, its value cannot be expressed in terms of money but its existence will certainly improve the facilities which Cork has to offer from the point of view of the tourist.  The business community and the public have shown their real interest in the project by raising the very substantial sum of £75,000 in the form of shares and interest-free debentures.  Building work has commenced and payments to the contractors and architects are being made out of the £75,000 which has been raised from these private sources. I believe that it is only right for the <Col N="222" /> State to help to bring this very worthwhile task to completion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to extend a hearty welcome to this Bill.  It is right and proper that the people of Cork should be assisted in the reconstruction of their Opera House which was destroyed in 1955.  As the Minister said, the loss of the Opera House was a severe blow, culturally, not alone to the city of Cork but to the south of Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is clear from what the Minister has told us that a genuine voluntary effort has been made in the city of Cork and, as a result, a sum of £75,000 has been subscribed.  The Cork Corporation have also provided an interest-free loan of £25,000 and the State have guaranteed a loan of £50,000.  If my figures are correct, it means that, apart from the sum of £50,000 which is being given, a sum of £150,000 has already been provided.  It was originally thought that £150,000 would rebuild the Opera House but apparently the cost of building has gone up drastically since the destruction of the building.  It is, therefore, necessary that the State should step in and finish the job, so to speak, by providing this £50,000.  I am entirely in favour of it.</P>
      <P>The State should subsidise voluntary effort of this sort.  It should subsidise the living theatre in this country.  I was rather disappointed some time ago when the Arts Council gave grants on a less generous scale to the drama festival committees.  Further, this grant of £50,000 which we are now being asked to sanction will not cost the State anything.  It is being paid out of dormant funds which are standing to the credit of suitors in the accounts of the Courts of Justice.  It is true that the State are accepting a liability to indemnify that suitors' fund account, should the missing suitors turn up and claim the money that should be there for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill affords an opportunity of saying a word about these dormant funds and I should like to ask the Minister whether any steps are taken from time to time to trace the missing suitors, whether notices are ever sent <Col N="223" /> out to their last known addresses.  It may be that some people have money in court, where money was invested for them, when they were very young&mdash; maybe their parents died; maybe their guardians were indifferent; and maybe these people went to England to seek a living and perhaps do not know they have sums of money to their credit.  I think some notices should be sent out or some efforts made to trace these people from time to time.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point which I should like to make on the Bill because it affords an opportunity of doing so.  It happens from time to time that money is invested for a minor, let us say, when he is 15 or 16 years of age, or younger.  Where, say, £1,000 has been invested for the minor, it has happened, and I suppose it will happen, that when he reaches the age of 21 years and wishes to withdraw that money, he finds the £1,000 is not worth £1,000 any more but worth considerably less.  I think that in future another good use to which those dormant funds could be put would be to set up a fund to indemnify minors who, on coming of age, or within six months of their coming of age, withdrew the money standing to their credit and found that they had suffered a loss as a result of depreciation of the fund in which it was invested on their behalf.</P>
    <P>The same thing might happen in the case of an estate of a person of unsound mind.  During his lifetime, money might be invested for him in trustee securities and on his death, it could happen that these trustee securities had depreciated in value.  Again, his estate could be indemnified out of these dormant funds, and I respectfully suggest to the Minister that it would be a proper use to which to put these funds.</P>
    <P>To summarise, I welcome the Bill.  I think this money is being put to a good use.  I suggest that the Minister serve notice on people who seem to have lost interest in funds to their account, and, perhaps he might consider setting up a fund to indemnify suitors who suffered a loss in the way I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I approve of the idea in this Bill and I want to make only one point on it.  Having heard the Minister in his opening statement saying that previous calls under the Funds of Suitors Act were made in connection with the Abbey Theatre, the courts and King's Inns, it appears to me that the whole of this fund, which to a certain extent is a windfall, has been expended, and will be expended, in the city of Dublin and the city of Cork.  It seems that this fund, being what it is, could be used in a far more general way.  I would say, particularly as a countryman, that it seems slightly unfair that these funds should be spent in the cities, where we rather tend to expect to find all the wealth of the country.  I want to make that one point &mdash;that possibly some of these funds could have been spent on a more general educational scheme for the whole country.  Originally, the funds possibly came from all over the whole country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who comes from Cork, I want especially to welcome this Bill and to say that it is very heartening in this material age that a Government will think of doing something for those who are engaged in doing things which aim at providing some kind of recreation and culture for the people. Never before in our history have the people had so much leisure time at their disposal.  It is easy for people in high places to talk, with their tongue in their cheek very often, about the way in which the younger generation are behaving, or misbehaving, and still decline to create ways in which they may spend their leisure hours.  This is a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other point I should like to make is that tribute should be paid to those people in the city of Cork who have devoted, at great personal inconvenience, an amount of their time to keeping this issue alive and to seeing that the restoration of the Opera House becomes an accomplished fact.  I can assure the House that the measures now taken are appreciated not only by them but by the citizens of Cork and the people of the country generally.  It is not only as a Corkman I speak: everybody realises that this amenity <Col N="225" /> will benefit the whole province of Munster.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Cole's suggestion and I certainly would have no objection to the money being spent likewise in any part of the country. It is not for me to say it, but I think that the people of Cork, who have collected £75,000, have shown that they have done a tangible amount of work by doing something for themselves.  I welcome the measure and I am glad to see that the Government have given recognition where it is due.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Healy, I am one of those who will benefit directly from this particular windfall fund.  I should like to say how very welcome this will be in Cork. Those responsible for drama, both professional and amateur, and for various productions in Cork have made great efforts during the past few years to keep things going in Cork in the absence of the Opera House.  But there is absolutely no doubt that the absence of this particular centre and of a fully equipped theatre such as the Opera House has been a very limiting and inhibiting factor in regard to this aspect of cultural life in Cork over the past few years.  Therefore, all of us in Cork look forward to the completion of this work and indeed to the rebuilding of the Opera House, placed as it is directly beside the Art Gallery in Cork, forming another centre there which is of very great value.</P>
      <P>The only other point I should like to make has already been made, but it is one which cannot be overstressed. The point is the Government come in in this instance to supplement private effort&mdash;and to supplement a great deal of hard private effort.  Indeed, local people had to go to the limit of their own efforts first and then when they had done all they could do, the Government were prepared to supplement their efforts and make up the remainder.  This is as things should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the subsidisation of a great deal of activities in this country, I think it is necessary for us to have the utmost involvement of the local people if we are to get real value from the subsidies which come from the <Col N="226" /> Central Fund.  Therefore, I welcome not only the grant which has been made but the way in which it has been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Dooge I should like to support this Bill and particularly the Government's attitude in coming in with money after a voluntary effort has been made.  This seems to be the Government's attitude in a number of cases of this kind; I am thinking particularly of another recent case in which the Government took the same attitude in regard to the Library in Trinity College.  They made very generous contributions after the University raised from its own graduates and other people substantial sums of money.  However I feel that this Bill is part of a haphazard attitude to the Arts and to our cultural heritage.  I may be wrong but I feel that the Government looking at the difficulty in which Cork was in, in regard to its Opera House, said: &ldquo;What funds can we allocate?  Where can we find money for this project?&rdquo;  and somebody then thought: &ldquo;We have not had a &lsquo;go&rsquo; at the funds of suitors for some time.  Let us take the money out of those funds.&rdquo;  That is an unfortunate attitude because as a State we have now a financial status sufficient to enable us to think of the Arts and of our cultural heritage in something more than a piecemeal manner.  I should like to see further Funds of Suitors Bills in a different form; in fact, I should not like to see another Funds of Suitors Bill in this form again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time has come for the Government to consider setting up some funds to which annual contributions could be made, possibly from revenue, possibly from funds of suitors as they mount up or possibly from other funds as they become available, so that moneys can be accumulated for just the very sort of need being provided for now, to supplement the moneys needed for the <Col N="228" /> Cork Opera House.  I should like to see a very substantial fund built up, an Arts heritage fund, or a cultural heritage fund if you like, from which the Government would be able from time to time to allocate moneys to the arts, to the preservation of our heritage of buildings, of music, of theatre, and ballet and other cultural activities.  I do feel that while this Bill is a step in the right direction, and very much to be praised, it does not go nearly far enough and I should like the Government to consider setting up some permanent substantial fund which could be built up over the years for this kind of purpose.</P>

      <P>I agree entirely with Senator Ross but it does seem to me that his arguments point towards an even more drastic solution.  The suggestion has been made in this House before, and I make it again, that this country really needs a Ministry of Fine Arts.  Our prestige in the world is due to a large extent to our artistic inheritance. It seems unfair that so busy a man as the Minister for Justice should have to look after funds which should be devoted to fine art.  In all seriousness, I think we should move towards restoring that admirable situation which I understand existed under the First Dáil, when this country had a Minister for Fine Arts.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Senators who have spoken for the welcome they have given this Bill.  I had hoped and expected that it would be a non-contentious piece of legislation but the Seanad, in its magnanimity, has done better and has unanimously welcomed the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to follow Senator Ross into the area which he has opened up. He will readily understand that artistic matters are not my concern as Minister for Justice.  Indeed, I come into this particular field only because these funds &mdash;this Aladdin's Cave, as one Deputy in the Dáil described it&mdash;are administered by the courts and are, therefore, the responsibility of my Department. It is for that reason I am involved in this matter and not because I have any particular appreciation of the Arts. The suggestions made by the two <Col N="229" /> Senators should, I think, more properly be addressed to the Minister for Education, or, perhaps, more directly to the Minister for Finance.  We have, as Senators know, An Chomhairle Ealaíon to which the Government make substantial funds available each year for artistic purposes.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick asked me about the arrangements for notifying suitors themselves, of funds lying dormant. The position is that the Superior Court Rules provide that a list is to be prepared by the Accountant every five years and published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>

      <P>The Senator also raised the question of the fall in value of securities in which moneys belonging to suitors are invested.  It is true that we had a fairly bad situation at one time, because of the fall in the value of some particular stock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The particular stock fell heavily, with resultant loss to those whose moneys were invested in it. That fall applied all over, of course, and not just to court funds.  A large number of institutions suffered the same loss.  I understand that situation is now rectified and that it is unlikely there will be such a fall again.  Precautions have been taken with regard to the stock in which these moneys are invested and it is hoped that there will not again be any loss sustained, though it is, of course, impossible to guarantee that.  If such a loss were to occur in the future, it is difficult to see how one would be justified in making moneys of that sort available to meet the loss.  The principle established with regard to the use of these funds is that the transaction should be a capital one, and one involving a once <Col N="230" /> and for all payment; it would be wrong, for example, to use the funds for something which would properly be a charge on a Vote.  They may be used only for exceptional capital purposes. While we cannot guarantee that there will never again be losses in the sums invested for the benefit of minors and others, we all hope that such loss will not occur.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill falls naturally into two parts. First of all, it is proposed that all airguns and similar weapons should be brought within the definition of &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; thereby making it unlawful for them to be kept or used by children, and providing also that they may be kept and used by adults only on foot of firearm certificates.  The present position is that smooth-bore air guns of a calibre of .22 inches or more and all rifled airguns are deemed to be firearms, but smooth-bore airguns below .22 in calibre are not.  It is these latter guns that are now being covered by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that Senators generally will agree that it is desirable to introduce this control on the use of airguns. The number of injuries caused by the use of airguns is high enough to warrant this step, and while we can agree that it is unfortunate that a few accidents, mainly due to carelessness, should force the community to deprive all children of what under proper supervision should be a harmless recreation, I think most people would take the view, first of all, that to remove airguns from the hands of children is not an excessive hardship on them nowadays when there is a large variety of other amusements available to them, and, secondly, that the proposal is justified inasmuch as <Col N="231" /> it can confidently be depended on to reduce the incidence of injuries some of which&mdash;especially the loss of an eye &mdash;are of a particularly distressing nature and, unlike most injuries, last for life.</P>
    <P>The Bill, apart from prohibiting the use of airguns by persons below a certain age, proposes that no adult may have or use an airgun without a firearm certificate.  I think that this provision is essential to ensure that the substantial numbers of airguns at present in the hands of children are not retained, as a matter of course, by adult members of the household, many of whom in practice would find that, if an airgun formerly owned by a child were left lying about, it would be used by the child.  It is reasonable to assume that when the Bill becomes law, the majority of airguns at present held by young persons will be destroyed.  Those adults who opt to retain them on foot of a certificate will have a clear-cut legal responsibility for ensuring that they are not used by young persons.</P>
    <P>Closely allied with the foregoing provisions is the one in Section 17 that proposes to raise from 15 to 16 years the minimum age at which a person may obtain a firearm certificate.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the Bill are generally tidying up provisions designed to round off the main Act of 1925.</P>
    <P>Section 15 adds to the categories of persons who may possess, and in some cases use, firearms and ammunition without the necessity for a firearm certificate.  In connection with the prohibition on airguns it will be of interest to note that one of the exempted categories embraces persons, of any age, using rifle ranges at carnivals and another embraces members, of any age, of rifle and gun clubs using their weapons at a range or other place that is approved by the police.  Other persons proposed to be exempted are auctioneers and their employees and persons taking part in theatrical performances etc., and there are some others.  Provision is being made for adequate police control in relation to these exemptions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="232" /> Section 3 empowers the Minister for Justice, at the request of the Minister for Lands and in the interest of game preservation, to make orders, with a validity of not more than a month, prohibiting the use or carriage of firearms, but not their possession, either generally or in a particular locality. The Minister for Lands considers that in certain circumstances this may be the only effective method of preventing the slaughter of game in particularly severe weather.  Section 4 has a rather similar provision.  It proposes to empower the Minister for Justice to make an order for the handing up to the police of all firearms or particular types of firearms in a particular area for a period not exceeding a month. This of course is a provision that would not be used save on the rarest occasions.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 contain detailed provisions for the disposal of firearms that are at present in police hands or that will come into the possession of police, and which under the law as it stands the police are obliged to retain indefinitely.  The proposal is that, where the owners of such weapons do not, within a reasonable time, make arrangements for the sale or disposal of the weapons in accordance with law, the police may themselves put them up for sale.  If they sell them, the proceeds must be handed over to the owner if he is known.  If they fail to sell them and think that further efforts to sell are unlikely to be successful, the weapons may be destroyed.  There are detailed safeguards for the rights of owners.</P>
    <P>There was some adverse comment in the Dáil in relation to Section 24 which proposes to relieve the prosecution of the onus of having to prove that a firearm certificate, importation licence or other written authorisation in relation to firearms does not exist. As I explained in the Dáil, I have unambiguous legal advice that the section will not mean that if a defendant loses a certificate, he will be automatically convicted.  Its primary object is to relieve the prosecution of the expenses of having to bring witnesses long distances to prove that no certificate is in force in those cases where the <Col N="233" /> defence makes no serious claim that a certificate, etc. exists.  The effect of the section is that the defence must not only plead that a certificate was granted but give reasonable evidence as to where and when it was granted, but all that is needed in this regard is sufficient evidence to create in the mind of the court a substantial doubt.  Once that doubt exists, the Court obviously must acquit unless the prosecution adduces evidence to offset the doubt.</P>
    <P>I do not think it necessary to delay the House with comments in relation to the remaining sections of the Bill at this stage as the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill has indicated the purpose of each section.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to repeat what I said in the Dáil on the question of consolidation.  I had considered the possibility of making this a consolidating measure because of the relatively large number of amendments but I decided in order to bring in this ban on airguns as quickly as possible not to consolidate on this occasion.  In any event most of the proposals in the Bill are additions to rather than amendments of the main Act.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, this Bill is to control the sale and use of guns and airguns, and it also proposes to bring up to date the law in relation to firearms generally.  We welcome the Bill, which, we feel, is long overdue.  Parents throughout the country will also welcome it.  We all know that over the years there has been a public outcry about gun accidents, and especially those caused by the indiscriminate use by children of airguns.  We all know of cases where serious injuries have been inflicted by these guns, where people have lost eyes or suffered some other serious injury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from injury to persons, we are also aware of the suffering caused to animals and birds by these guns. Unfortunately, some children seem to take a delight in firing at cattle in fields or along the road, at dogs, at cats and at birds, especially during the snowy and frosty weather.  It is regrettable <Col N="234" /> to have to say that, but unfortunately it is too true.  Many of our young people have not got the love for animals and wild life they should have.  Indeed, I often wonder if we, as legislators, examined our own consciences, would we find we were not in some way to blame?  For instance, do we not allow Telefís Éireann to show too many Wild West films where the gun is too often used and where men seem to be shot down as if they were wild rabbits?  After looking at those films, is it not natural that children should take out their airguns and fire at the first thing they see, whether a bird or an animal?  It would be much better if the gun were taken out of Telefís Éireann, just as it has been taken out of politics here.  It would make it much easier for the Minister, for parents, for the Garda and for all concerned in making this Bill the success we would like it to be.</P>
    <P>Apart from injuries caused to persons and to wild life, we are all aware of the lack of civic spirit demonstrated by many of the users of airguns and of the damage and destruction they cause to private and public property.  Driving through the country, we all see from time to time the destruction caused by young vandals using these weapons.  They seem to take a particular delight in firing through windows, plate glass windows, and even the windscreens of unoccupied cars.  If they come across an unoccupied house in the country, they take a delight in firing at least one pellet through every window in the house.  I have seen that happen in different parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister is entitled to the help and co-operation of everybody in putting this measure into operation.  A call should go forth to parents, pastors, teachers, to radio and television, to all interested in the welfare of society to lend a hand to putting an end to the cruelty and destruction caused in the past by the misuse of these guns and to bring home to everybody the necessity of complying with the Bill.  It would be no harm if Telefís Éireann made a New Year's resolution to show fewer of the type of film I referred to.  I hear many parents condemn them.  Instead, they <Col N="235" /> should show more films of the type shown at 6.55 p.m. on Tuesday, 17th December.  This film, entitled &ldquo;Our World&rdquo;, happened to be a study of Soviet educational methods and dealt with their primary, secondary and boarding school systems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I believe this is the kind of thing we should teach our young boys and girls so that we will have more civic spirit and less indiscriminate use of airguns.  They should be taught to have a love of their country.  They should not be shown destruction and killing.  They should be taught to be proud of the property of other people and not to destroy.  They should be taught to love and take care of animals, as they were in this film.  We should have courses like that in our schools.  If we had, it would make it much easier for the Minister and all concerned to implement this Bill.</P>
      <P>There is another matter.  It concerns the use of fireworks.  One of them was thrown at a member of the Trinity Rugby team during the match last Saturday.  It was not a very sporting gesture on the part of those concerned.  I have seen fireworks thrown into crowded dancehalls from balconies.  They are most dangerous. I doubt if the police can do anything about them at present.  Unfortunately, at some of our Christmas parties, we have some young thugs who seem to be a law unto themselves.  Has the Minister any power to deal with this situation.  These fireworks can do very serious harm, especially in a crowded hall.</P>
      <P>I should like to know what steps the Minister envisages will be necessary to ensure that the guns do not remain in the hands of children.  What action does he intend to take in the future? Various suggestions were made to him in the Dáil and he did not agree with some of them.  At column 996, Volume 205 of the Dáil Official Report of 6th November, 1963, he stated in answer to a suggestion by Deputy A. Barry:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> ...I am not sure that we should as good international citizens, unload our arms on some other country.</P>
    <P>I am 100 per cent with the Minister in his view and I am glad the Government, even after 40 years, have learned so much.  There was a time when some of those in the same Party would have exhorted the people to bury the arms, that they might be useful for Ireland afterwards.  As far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we stand for law and order and we support the Minister in that because unfortunately we know that at other times when a Government were trying to collect much more dangerous arms than airguns, they were advised by a man who said: &ldquo;Comrades&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was not alive to those things then.  I agree with what the Senator said at the beginning of his speech, that there is a certain amount of vandalism and cruelty in the use of these airguns.  Going around nowadays and seeing people with airguns, I am not quite sure whether it is the children who are causing the damage.  Time and time again I have seen adults going out along the roads with airguns, perhaps belonging to some junior member of the family, and aiming at telephone installations and things like that.</P>
      <P>I should like to see boys being allowed to have airguns, where parents will vouch for them, at a younger age than is envisaged in the Bill, 16 years. I had an airgun at a younger age than that and was taught to be very careful with it.  I have heard of more accidents to eyes with penknives than with airguns and perhaps we are going a little too far in not allowing a boy of, say, 15 to have an airgun, provided the permit is taken out by a parent or some such person.  I put in that plea, that perhaps we are going too far.  If we go further, we shall prohibit penknives and bows and arrows because these things do cause accidents to eyes and are responsible for a certain amount of cruelty to animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two other Committee points on which I should like to have the Minister's views at this stage, if possible.  With regard to the disposal of guns in the possession of the garda, would it be possible for a person to obtain a permit to keep a gun in the house without using it? Sometimes these guns might be in a house and a person might not want to expend any money on them but would like to keep them in their possession. In Northern Ireland, they have a permit to keep the gun which is more or less a permanent thing and if they wish to use it, they have to take out a licence to enable them to buy ammunition <Col N="238" /> and use it for game and so on.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies where a minor is left a shotgun.  The only way that gun can be kept is by allowing some neighbour or some other person who already has a gun to take out a second licence for that gun in his name and keep it for the minor until he comes of age.  I know of several instances where that has happened and it means that a person, year after year, perhaps for several years has to take out a permit in that way, which is the only way an ordinary person who does not want to use it can keep a gun.</P>
    <P>Section 3(1) of the Bill reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister may...in the interest of the preservation of game, make an order prohibiting the use or carriage of firearms...on any lands...</P>
    <P>Those are the operative words.  Subsection (3) of the same section reads:</P>
    <P>(3) An order under this section shall not apply in relation...to the use or carriage of a firearm by a person to a person to whom the Superintendent of any district has granted a permit which is in force to use and carry a firearm for a purpose (other than the shooting of game)...</P>
    <P>At present there are two sorts of licences.  There is the 10/- licence which enables people to shoot vermin and the £2 5s. licence which allows them to shoot game.  If the Minister makes an order under Subsection (1) of Section 3 and if I have a £2.5s. licence which allows me to shoot game and vermin or protect my sheep, if necessary, I must not use that gun unless I go again under Subsection (4) and ask the superintendent for a permit, whereas the man with a 10/- permit who is supposed not to shoot game with it is allowed to keep the gun and use it.  It does seem the man with the game licence, that is, the man who might also wish to use it for destruction of vermin or to protect his sheep, may not do so.  He must go again to the superintendent and get a permit.</P>
    <P>The rest of the points I should like to make are small Committee points and I shall not trouble the House with them now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in general agreement with the provisions of this Bill.  There is just one aspect arising out of it to which the Minister might give his attention.  Section 4 and Section 8 deal with circumstances in which firearms must be handed in to the local superintendent or local police but it is nowhere mentioned in the Bill that the local superintendent must, if he is offered firearms, take them in.  I am not raising this on any obscure legal point.  I am raising it because of a personal experience I had a few years ago.</P>
      <P>During the Emergency, I was serving as an officer in the Army and on occasions an order used to come that all officers were to carry their revolvers at all times, whether off duty or on duty, whether in civilian clothes or not. That entailed carrying around what I can only describe as a six-shooter, which is very difficult to carry in civilian clothes.  A friend of mine heard of my problem and gave me a very neat and beautiful little Browning automatic.  He had it abroad, and when he came back, he handed it in to the Garda authorities, and it was held in the Depot.  He said I was quite welcome to take it and use it during my service in the Army.  I took it and I got a licence without any difficulty at that time.  I had it at home for many years.  The Garda reminded me about it and I used to take out a licence every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About 1955, I felt there was no point in continuing to take out a licence.  At that time, also, there was a certain amount of activity on the Border, and so on.  I felt the police must be worried about any revolvers which members of the public had and wondering what might be happening to them.  The next time the licence was due for renewal instead of renewing it, I decided to hand the revolver to the Garda authorities.  I was living in the Dun Laoghaire area at the time, and I went to the police station and told them I had been reminded about the licence but that I did not propose to renew it.  I told them I intended to hand in the revolver and <Col N="240" /> that I had it with me.  I placed it on the counter, and that caused a bit of a sensation.  They went off and consulted various officials, and finally they told me they did not have any machinery for taking in revolvers at Dun Laoghaire police station.  They assured me that they felt certain the police in Blackrock had machinery for taking in revolvers.</P>
    <P>A week or two later, I went down to Blackrock police station with the automatic.  I said I wished to hand it in.  There were a number of detectives and other people there.  They all examined it, passed it around, and said it was a beautiful weapon, and so on.  They admired it, and then they consulted one another and told me they were very sorry but there was not any machinery in Blackrock for taking in firearms.  They could not suggest any machinery.  So at that stage, I let the matter drop for the time being.  I was moving to Greystones to live shortly afterwards, and I forgot the matter for a while.</P>
    <P>A month after I moved to Greystones, a very intelligent and sophisticated young Garda called to say he understood I had a revolver and asked me to take out a licence for it.  I said I would not, that I wanted to hand it in.  I asked him to arrange it, and he came back a week later and said there was no machinery in Greystones for taking in revolvers.  He knew I was at home most Saturday mornings, and he used to call practically every Saturday morning to discuss the matter with me. He used to bring a licence form with him, which I think he had filled out, and he used to beg me to fill in my signature, and hand in the 10/-, or whatever it was, at any time.  He said he was in some difficulty because he had been assigned to get me to take out the licence.  I was just as obstinate, and I said I wanted to hand in the revolver.  He said he could not trace any authority for handing in revolvers.</P>
    <P>This went on for some time.  The Garda and I became great friends.  He was a very intelligent, nice fellow. After some time, I said I was getting very tired of it, and that I proposed to go for a walk along the seashore and <Col N="241" /> throw the revolver into the sea.  I said that should solve the problem.  For the first time his sophistication cracked. He practically got down on his knees and begged me not to do that, because he would be writing reports for the rest of his life if the revolver just disappeared.</P>
    <P>At that time it suddenly occurred to me that it was not my revolver at all, but that it was owned by the man who had been good enough to lend it to me some years previously.  The obvious thing was to give it back to him and wipe my hands of the whole affair.  The man lived in Greystones. He was retired at that time, and seemed to have a lot of time on his hands.  I gave it back to him and forgot the matter.  About three or four weeks later, the same young Garda came back with the revolver, handed it back to me and said that the man had been delighted to get it back.  He regarded it as a most wonderful toy, and he was bringing it around all the pubs in Greystones, and the buses, and handing it around to everybody to admire and try.  The Garda could not have that sort of thing so it was brought back and given to me.  Again we started what would nowadays be called a dialogue as to whether I would take out a licence, or he would take in the revolver.</P>
    <P>After a further period I asked him could he not suggest any way out of the impasse.  He said the only known method by which I could dispose of it legally was if I could persuade a firearms dealer to buy it.  I went to Garnetts, or one of those people, and showed them the revolver.  By this time I was a little sensitive about people telling me what a beautiful revolver it was.  Mr. Garnett, or whoever he was, and many other people admired it and said it was a beautiful revolver but that actually they could not take in any more revolvers, and they would not buy it.  I begged them to buy it.  I practically said that I would give them money to take the revolver.  At last, seeing that I was really distressed, they relented and said they would take it.  I said I did not want any money but they said: &ldquo;We must pay something; we will <Col N="242" /> give 5/- for it.&rdquo;  He thereupon gave me 5/- and my problem was solved.  I passed on the 5/- to my friend who owned it.  That was the end of that.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he might see to it that it is a little easier for anyone who feels like handing in a revolver to hand it in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that in a Bill of this kind we must be cruel to be kind.  While it deals primarily with airguns, we should also strengthen the powers of the Minister regarding the use of firearms in general.  For a nation that has had practice with firearms over a long period on a number of occasions when we asserted our right to freedom, there is an extraordinary amount of carelessness to be seen in the use of guns and this has resulted in tragedies in a number of homes.</P>
      <P>I feel the Minister should have power to carry out inspections in the homes of owners of guns to see that these guns are being properly maintained and kept out of the way of children.  Only a fortnight ago, I read where a person was fined the paltry sum of 5/- for having a loaded gun in the back of his car.  He was also charged with being under the influence of drink.  Last evening I read of another fellow who had a gun in the car and fired out of it without investigating to see if there was anybody in the vicinity.  He was fined 5/-.  In the same issue of the paper it was reported that children were fined 10/- in Dublin for playing football on the street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe guns are looked upon as toys by adults and it is not so much the children as the adults we should worry about.  Guns are often kept in dangerous places in the homes.  They are either put beside the fire or in some corner that is quite accessible to youngsters, and tragedies result.  If we are to have a driving test for car-owners, we should have some system whereby it will be necessary for people to have a knowledge of guns before getting a licence.  I do not agree with the age limit in the Bill, which I think should <Col N="243" /> be 18.  Under the Dancehalls Act, you must be 18 to be allowed in but under this, we allow persons aged 16 to use guns.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister has made provision for visitors who are anxious to come here to shoot at particular times and that the period has been extended to 12 months as against the limited period previously specified.  I do not entirely agree with Senator L'Estrange that &ldquo;Have Gun, Will Travel&rdquo; or any other such programme on Telefís Éireann has very great influence.  Our principal worry is, as I have said, as regards adults using guns.  I believe the children look at a cowboy picture as we did and always try to emulate or imitate the hero and not the bad man.  While his gun may be smoking most of the time, I think every child realises that the victims do not all die as a result.  Comics could be put in the same category as these Telefís Éireann films and these comics are available and read by children.</P>
    <P>There is a section here, about which the explanatory memorandum says:</P>
    <P>Section 23 (1) (a) of the Larceny Act, 1916, makes it a felony to rob a person while armed with an offensive weapon and Section 28 of that Act makes it a misdemeanour for a person to be found by night with any dangerous or offensive weapon with intent to break or enter into any building and to commit a felony.  The new section proposes to provide that unloaded firearms and imitation firearms are, for the purposes of those sections of the Larceny Act that have been mentioned, to be deemed to be offensive weapons.  (It is already clear that a loaded firearm is an offensive weapon for this purpose.)</P>
    <P>I take it that section would cover an ordinary toy gun which resembles a revolver.  Then, there would be a danger in this that where a child might be accosted by a Garda while having a gun, the child might, without having any ill intent, be made liable to prosecution.  I think that section may require tightening up in that regard.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to tighten the <Col N="244" /> regulations in regard to firearms generally and endeavour to ensure that more care is exercised in their use.  If necessary, there should be power of inspection of homes as there is in the case where protection from fire is concerned and even though tragedies have occurred, people have been prosecuted. Where negligence in regard to a gun is found in a home, the people responsible should be brought to justice, just as people are in respect of fire-guards. Every effort should be made to ensure that guns are kept properly and out of the way of children.</P>

      <P>I should like to follow up something mentioned by Senator L'Estrange.  I should like to have an assurance from the Minister that there is power to prevent the use of these appalling thunderflash fireworks. Some people were sceptical about these being thrown at dances but that is perfectly true.  I have attended at least two dances where these fireworks were used and created positively dangerous explosions.  There was one case at Trinity College after a graduation ceremony where a girl was very seriously injured by one of these things.  I hope there is power in some other Act to deal with this matter and, if not, I would ask the Minister very earnestly to work in a section here to deal with them.  I should just like to add that the thunderflash thrown last Saturday was not thrown by a member of either university.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  I merely want to say that the .22 rifle is a most lethal weapon.  People shooting rabbits take out the cartridge case immediately after use and throw it down on the land.  I know of at least three or four cattle that have been lost through that practice and the owner had no redress.  That is terrible black-guardism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read of a man being fined 10/- for discharging a .22 rifle out of a car. He could have killed somebody.  I know of a case where three cattle were lost and in the post-mortem by the veterinary surgeon, six cartridge cases were found in the animal's stomach. The owner had no redress.  I want to impress on the Minister that the .22 <Col N="245" /> rifle is something that should be used with great caution.  There should be some provision to ensure that when people discharge these rifles, they will put the empty cases into their pockets to be disposed of safely when they get home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as a definite step in the right direction. In the case of Section 12, I should like to see these regulations applied to game licences also.  We farmers must contend with a good deal from people who do not wish to understand the trouble they cause&mdash;perhaps they are unaware of it&mdash;to farmers by indiscriminately walking over land, making gaps and so on.  Before a man has a game licence issued to him, even though it is £2 5s., he should have some place, some range or other land over which to shoot.</P>
      <P>In subsection (4) of Section 12, if we take the case of two brothers with two small holdings who live together, will this subsection prevent any one of them having a gun to shoot vermin on the combined holdings?  In intensive tillage areas in Laois where two brothers live together, both may have some land in their own names.  Very seldom will the two men go out shooting together.  One may be a sportsman and the second may have other interests.  Would it not be extraordinary if one brother could not kill vermin on both holdings?  Perhaps the Minister would look into that.</P>

Is there any provision in this or any other Firearms Act whereby a short-term licence can be issued to tourists coming here to shoot for a few weeks? I received a complaint that when a tourist applies for a licence, he must pay the full fee of £2 5s. which, if he were staying in the country, would cover him for a whole year, whereas he wants the licence for only two weeks. According to him, there was no provision for a refund.  I should like some information on that point.</P>

Ní dóigh liomsa gur ceart go mbeadh ceadúnas ag éinne atá faoi 16 bliana d'aois chun gunna a úsáid, pé saghas gunna é.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome this Bill.  It is long overdue and I think every parent and guardian of a child will be relieved when they find they will not be under pressure to buy airguns or, if they are, they can say: &ldquo;You must have a licence&rdquo;.  When a youngster is aged eight or so, he starts badgering his parents to get him an airgun and once it comes into the house, nobody knows who will first be shot or injured.  The Bill was overdue in that respect.  At least they must now wait until the age of 16 and I imagine that any warning they have to get will have been given.</P>
      <P>I do not think this Bill goes far enough in regard to the .22 rifle which is a deadly weapon.  It seems to me that licences have been issued indiscriminately for those guns.  We all know of young persons wanting such rifles to shoot rabbits but it is doubtful if the people who get them understand &mdash;is any effort made to find out if they understand?  &mdash;how dangerous they are. A bullet from such a rifle has killing power a mile away.  With a shotgun, at least the damage is within normal vision: with rifles it may be beyond that.  The garda should be empowered to refuse to issue a licence for a .22 rifle until satisfied that the person getting the licence knows exactly how to use these weapons and understands the danger attached to them.  Those of us who live in rural areas, where these guns are used pretty extensively for the destruction of rabbits, have had very narrow escapes from accidents where these weapons were in inexperienced hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the suggestion that firearms of all descriptions should be inspected periodically as to their condition. My suggestion would be that at least once a year when the licence is being applied for, the weapon for which it is requested should be produced to the garda for inspection.  I can see nothing difficult or wrong about that.  Everybody knows that in <Col N="248" /> many cases guns are kept in a very faulty condition.</P>
    <P>I have in mind a terrible tragedy that occurred very near to where I live, a very short time ago, which would have been avoided if inspection had been a prerequisite for renewal of licence.  There was kept in a house an old shotgun in the breech of which a cartridge had been jammed for two or three years.  A member of the family decided to remove it and lost his life in the process.  It was considered that the cartridge had been in the gun for so long that it had become ineffective. However, an unfortunate boy lost his life.  If it had been the case that that shotgun had to be produced when the licence was sought, that accident would not have happened because before issuing the licence, there would have been insistence on the cartridge being removed from the breech by a person who knew how to do it.</P>
    <P>There are kept in houses guns in which the springs of the safety catches are faulty and dangerous in use.  I am sure that many accidents that happen are the result of that sort of defect in weapons.  I should very much like to see a system of inspection.  The only system I can visualise at the moment which would be reasonable is that the weapon should be produced to the Garda when application for renewal of licence is made.</P>

      <P>It is clear that the Bill, certainly in principle, is welcome to the Seanad.  I shall deal briefly with some of the points which have been made by Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could not but have sympathy with Senator Eoin Ryan in his harrowing experience but I want to suggest to the Seanad that the situation is not quite as the Senator painted it.  At the time the Senator was speaking of, <Col N="249" /> the Gardai were often put in the position of being asked by people to store weapons for them and, indeed, as the Senator will notice, the Bill sets out to deal with this kind of problem by helping the Garda to get rid of a considerable quantity of unwanted weapons which they have in their possession and cannot get rid of.  As the position of the Garda is made easier, they will be more inclined to help out Senators who are distressed in this way.</P>
    <P>The Garda have always been prepared to store weapons for law-abiding citizens who have asked them to do so. They are always prepared to do that, but they were often very reluctant to put that principle into operation in specific instances because they found from experience that when they took in weapons for some people and stored them, they were afterwards accused of having allowed them to deteriorate, and so on.  They were, thus, naturally, to some extent reluctant to have this facility availed of too widely.</P>
    <P>Of course, a person who wants to dispose of a weapon should ask a firearms dealer to store it and try to sell it.  That is the proper, orthodox thing to do when you have a weapon which you want to dispose of.</P>
    <P>If a person wishes to keep the weapon for sentimental reasons, perhaps as a souvenir of his gallant military career, he can have a hole drilled in the barrel in such a way as to make the weapon ineffective and it ceases to be a firearm and he no longer needs a certificate for it.  He can keep it for evermore in that ineffective condition.</P>
    <P>That answers the point which Senator Cole raised, to some extent.  I gather that Senator Cole also was interested in persons who wanted to keep weapons, for sentimental or other reasons, although they never used them.  They can keep them in the way I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Senator Miss Davidson asked about tourists.  The suggestion that she makes has been put to us very strongly by a number of people from time to time. We have decided, on balance, not to <Col N="250" /> provide for a short-term certificate for tourists, because one could be criticised of being prepared to make available for tourists facilities which are not envisaged for our own people.  As everybody knows, there are sportsmen in this country who would be delighted to avail themselves of a short-term certificate and we would be put in a very invidious position if we set out to give short-term certificates to visitors and were not prepared to give them to our own people.</P>
    <P>The Senator will notice that we have made some concession in this regard in the Bill because the Bill now provides that a person who is not resident in the country can take out a certificate for any 12 months period.  One of the main difficulties which a tourist might encounter up to now was that if coming here for a period which overlapped the 31st July, he had to take out two certificates even though his total stay might be of short duration.  Now we are facilitating tourists by providing that a certificate will remain in force for a full 12 months, no matter when granted.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Siochfhradha spoke fairly strongly about persons who have guns and who are careless in their use or who are not to be trusted with them. I am in full agreement with the Senator in this matter.  As he mentioned, it is proposed in the Bill to raise the age limit from 15 to 16 years.  That is a considerable advance.</P>
    <P>On the broad question of suitability of persons to hold firearms' certificates, I should like to explain that this obligation is placed firmly on the local superintendents of the Garda.  The superintendent must satisfy himself that the applicant for a certificate is a suitable person to have a firearm and that he can be trusted to look after it and use it in a responsible manner.  I consider that the superintendent is the right person to have that responsibility, because he is fully aware of local circumstances and can familiarise himself with the temperament, character and record of the person concerned. I do not think we can go much further.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that there was any criticism that the Garda were lax in <Col N="251" /> this way: in fact, any criticism is in the other direction.  I am often asked to appeal to superintendents to give back firearms or to grant certificates when they have been refused.  My understanding is that the Garda are, if anything, quite strict in their administration of the Act.</P>
    <P>I do not think Senator Donegan could expect us to insist on the type of inspection system he suggests.  I am not sure we are equipped to do it. However, apart from that, I do not think it would be of any great value unless we were to have some followup powers.  That would be going very far indeed.  There is a limit to which the State, in its paternal rôle, can go.  People must look after themselves, to some extent.  I think the system of control laid down in the original Act works well and should be sufficient for all practical purposes when amended as we propose in the Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators were concerned about fireworks.  We have a very strict policy in regard to fireworks. It is a specific criminal offence to use fireworks in any way which is a danger to others.  Apart from that, our whole policy is to minimise the use of fireworks.  The importation of fireworks is controlled.  Nobody can import fireworks save under licence from the Minister for Justice and licences are given only where the Minister is satisfied that they are to be used in a properly-controlled public display.  This policy is stringently administered.</P>
    <P>No matter what we do, fireworks will be smuggled and used but, in so far as we can manage it, we will do everything we possibly can to make sure that such incidents as Senators have described will not take place. The control of fireworks, in any case, is not a matter for this Bill.  This Bill is confined in scope to firearms.  I understand that the Department of Industry and Commerce are considering a new Explosives Bill and controls on fireworks are a matter for such a Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald asked about Section 12.  That section is intended to <Col N="252" /> facilitate farmers.  At the moment, farmers can get limited certificates for the purpose of shooting vermin.  I want to emphasise that these certificates have a utilitarian, not a sporting, purpose.  They exist to make it possible for farmers to keep down vermin on their lands without having to take out a certificate at the full rate.  Only the occupier of the land can get such a certificate.  The Bill now proposes to loosen the provision and to enable the occupier to nominate somebody else to have the certificate.  One thinks immediately of the widow who has a son on the farm: she might wish to nominate him to have the certificate. Again, a farmer who is getting old might like to nominate his son or a manager to do the work.  The purpose of the amendment is to facilitate farmers.</P>
    <P>We are now leaving the door open to a certain amount of evasion.  Up to now, the very fact that a person was found with a gun held on a limited certificate on lands other than his own was strong evidence that he was committing an offence.  We are opening the door to some extent to the evasion of the law.  We must restrict it in some way so that such evasions will not be widespread.  We are saying: &ldquo;You can have only one of these limited certificates for each farm.&rdquo;  If a man wishes to shoot vermin on two farms occupied by different persons, he will have to have two certificates.  I do not think that is any great hardship.</P>

    <P>Senator Cole asked about Section 3: I think he is confused by the drafting. The permit referred to in subsection (3) of Section 3 is, in effect, the permit <Col N="253" /> which will be issued under subsection (4).  What is proposed is that, at the request of the Minister for Lands, I, as Minister for Justice, could issue a blanket prohibition on the carrying of firearms for a period of one month. We are, however, providing that a superintendent may issue a permit to a person, if he thinks it necessary&mdash;and obviously what would be involved would be the shooting of vermin.</P>
    <P>The Senator also had a more general point on that, namely, that we do not have here, as they have in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, a cheap permit which enables a person to be in possession of a gun and another permit, a game licence, which enables him to use it.  That argument has been put before.  That is mainly a matter for the Minister for Lands, who is responsible for game preservation. As far as I know, he does not think at the moment that we should make that change.  That is a matter which the Senator might take up with him directly.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In recommending this Bill to the House, I would like to begin, as I did in the Dáil, by stressing that the amendments it proposes are not radical and are entirely in the nature of modifications to a statute which has worked exceptionally well and which has already, in the course of ten years, enabled the benefits of legal adoption to be brought to nearly 7,000 children. I think it right, also, that I should again take the opportunity to say that the success of the Act has been due, not only to the sound principles on which it was based, but to the excellent, and indeed indispensable, work that has been done in giving effect to the Act both by the Adoption Board and by registered adoption societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody concerned with the welfare of children will readily acknowledge the importance of the work done by the Board but, in acknowledging its importance, we may perhaps be inclined to overlook the fact that the work is also very time consuming and that it is a voluntary Board.  The time devoted by members of the Board to adoption work is very considerable incline <Col N="255" /> deed.  As I said in the Dáil, this country is well served by people who sacrifice their time and leisure to voluntary work on various Boards of this kind but there can be few Boards, if any, which make such demands on the time of their members as An Bórd Uchtála.</P>
    <P>The other vital factor in the successful operation of the system of legal adoption has been the work of the Registered Adoption Societies.  Most adoptions in this country are arranged by these societies and the proportion is increasing: they now deal with nearly 80% of all placements.  They care for and maintain unwanted children, including children who can never be legally adopted, and, where children are eligible and suitable for adoption, the society concerned has the task of seeking and finding families willing and able to adopt them.  These societies, therefore, do all the basic work and the Board's rôle, indispensable though it be, is supervisory only.</P>
    <P>During the debate in the Dáil, I was asked for some further information about the registration of these societies, so perhaps the House would wish me to refer to this matter here now.  The first point I should like to stress is that all adoption societies are, and must be, purely charitable organisations.  More specifically, the requirement, set out in Section 36 of the 1952 Act, is that&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the Board shall not register any body of persons unless the Board is satisfied&mdash;</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(a)  that the body is one which exists only for the purpose of promoting charitable, benevolent or philanthropic objects, whether or not any such object is charitable within the meaning of any rule of law, and</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(b)  that the body is competent to discharge the obligations imposed upon Registered Adoption Societies under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should say, in passing, that the decision of the Oireachtas to restrict this function to charitable organisations, while undoubtedly prudent, was quite possibly unnecessary for it is not an activity which shows or can hope to show a material profit or which any <Col N="256" /> group of persons would be likely to undertake and keep up except as a charitable or philanthropic undertaking.</P>
    <P>The Board is entitled, by Section 37 of the 1952 Act, to cancel the registration of a society on any ground which would require or entitle the Board to refuse an application for registration or if it appears to the Board that the requirements of the Act are not being adequately complied with by the society or if an offence under the Act is committed by the society or by any person acting on its behalf.  Finally, registered adoption societies, and every officer of such society, are obliged to give, at any time, at the request of the Board, full information in regard to the constitution, membership, employees, organisation and activities of the society and at all reasonable times to permit a member or authorised officer of the Board to inspect and make copies of all books and documents relating to adoption in the possession or control of the society.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, therefore, that the Board has comprehensive powers of control over adoption societies.  It is quite evident that the Board, in the 10 years or so that it has been in existence, has been generally satisfied with the standards observed by the societies, and I say this not just because the societies have been kept on the register by the Board but because, as I understand, the Board has never, as far as the Board can recall, had occasion even in a single instance to reject, on grounds of unsuitability, an application for an adoption order sponsored by an adoption society or in respect of a child whose placement was arranged by a society.</P>
    <P>This does not mean that the Board, or indeed the societies themselves, do not realise that there is room for improvement.  The societies would be the last to suggest otherwise and I have no doubt that they, more than anybody else, are concerned to achieve a gradual improvement in standards over the years.</P>
    <P>Turning to the provisions of the Bill itself, I think I can say that it received a very good reception in the other House.  Some points which I myself had <Col N="257" /> regarded as of little importance were a cause of concern to some Deputies and, as members of this House may have similar doubts, I should like to refer to them in particular as I go along.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill proposes to allow the adoption of legitimated children in certain circumstances&mdash;but not where the birth has been formally re-registered under the Legitimacy Act, 1931.  As the explanatory memorandum points out, the main object of this section is a practical one, in that it will relieve the Board of the need to have last-minute inquiries made, as they frequently have to do at the moment, as a safeguard, to satisfy themselves beyond doubt that the mother of the child has not married the father between the time she gave her consent to the adoption and the day the application comes formally before the Board.  In all but the rarest cases, these inquiries serve no purpose other than to give everybody concerned an assurance that the adoption order is valid and cannot be called in question in years to come on the grounds that the child had been legitimated and was therefore ineligible for adoption.</P>
    <P>Apart from that practical problem, there have been some cases where a child who was eligible for adoption when it was placed with the prospective adopters became ineligible because the natural parents married before the adoption order was made.  In some such cases, the natural parents find themselves unable to acknowledge the child and the barrier to legal adoption has no other result than that the child is kept by the prospective adopters without the benefit of legal adoption or is even sent back to spend its childhood in an institution.  It is not in the general interests of legal adoption that a situation could arise in which a couple take a child into their home with a view to its adoption, having been fully satisfied that it was legally eligible for adoption, only to find that at a later stage the child becomes ineligible but is still unwanted by its natural parents who are not prepared to recognise it.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill proposes to allow the Board, at its discretion, to <Col N="258" /> extend by up to two years the time for making an application for an adoption order.  Under existing law, the application must be made before the child has reached the age of seven: the amendment will permit that limit to be raised to nine, but only where the child has been in the family since before its seventh birthday.  The object of the amendment is to cater for the occasional case where, perhaps through an oversight, an application for an adoption order is deferred too long or in which an adoption society has not quite satisfied itself as to the suitability of a prospective adopter.</P>
    <P>This section, of course, raises the general question of the desirability, or otherwise, of setting age limits for children who may be adopted.  I think it can be said that practically everybody agrees that adoption while a child is very young, rather than at the age of ten or 12, should be the norm. On the other hand, most people also will agree&mdash; certainly I would agree&mdash; that there are exceptional cases in which legal adoption of an older child might take place with complete success. The question, then, is whether it is desirable to try to make provision for these exceptional cases.</P>
    <P>My attitude is that we should not try to cater for these exceptional cases and that to attempt to do so would endanger the whole structure and I think it is right that I should make clear to the House that my attitude in this regard is, to my certain knowledge, shared by many qualified persons with long experience of this kind of work.</P>
    <P>In explaining or defending this attitude, I think it is important to make a distinction.  There is a fundamental difference between the problems that arise in relation to the legal adoption of an older child who has been with the family from its early childhood and the adoption of an older child who has been placed with the family much later.  Where a child has been with a family since early childhood, it is quite probable that in many cases an adoption order could be made without any significant risk and with benefit to the child and indeed the Board recommended that that should be allowed provided the child was <Col N="259" /> taken into the family before its seventh birthday.</P>
    <P>We cannot, however, consider an individual case in isolation or by reference only to the conditions that obtain at the particular time the application for the adoption order is made. If provision for adoption in such a case were made, we must have regard to the probable repercussions on other cases and, unfortunately, experience has shown very clearly that if the law allows adoptive parents to defer indefinitely the making of an application for an adoption order, quite a few of them will neglect to apply while the child is still young and the child spends most of its early years without the security which an adoption order brings and without having available to it a birth certificate in the surname of the adoptive parents.  It is one thing to make provision for cases that arose in the past, such as was made in Section 19 of the 1952 Act and is proposed again in Section 3 of this Bill, but, for all future cases, the strict statutory provision that application may in no circumstances be deferred until the child has passed its ninth birthday is, I submit, most definitely desirable in the general interests of all children placed with families with a view to adoption.</P>
    <P>When we come to consider the question of legally adopting children who were not taken into the family at an early age, much more serious problems arise.  All the experts are agreed that there are special difficulties and dangers associated with the adoption of older children.  In the Dáil, I quoted extracts from a document produced by the European Seminar on Inter-country Adoption, prepared under United Nations auspices, and while that document dealt primarily with inter-country adoption it stressed repeatedly that legal adoption of an older child, even in its own country, is fraught with so many dangers that it should not be contemplated except under the guidance of the most highly skilled experts in this field.  If any Senator would like me, at a later stage, to quote these extracts again, I shall be glad to do so but in the meantime they <Col N="260" /> are available in the Official Report of the debate in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There are two points about this that I would like to stress.  The first is that we have not yet developed in this country any substantial body of specialists in this particular field, even though progress is certainly being made.  The second, and perhaps more important, point is that, unlike most countries, where the law permits the adoption of legitimate children and, consequently, the re-adoption of adopted children, an adoption order, once validly made under our law, is final. This means that if a mistake is made, it cannot be rectified but that is the price that we have to pay for the permanence of legal adoption with the benefits that it brings to the general body of adopted children who are placed in the same legal position as if they had been born into the families into which they have been adopted. Since there can be no going back on an adoption order, there is no room for mistakes and, consequently, no significant risk can be taken in individual cases.  It would require only a very few failures to cast a shadow over the whole structure of legal adoption.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with age limits of the adopters.  The present minimum age limit for adopters, other than relatives, is 30 years.  The Bill proposes to reduce the limit to 25 years where a couple have been married for at least three years.  This was recommended by the Board and has, I think, been generally welcomed.</P>
    <P>Section 5 also proposes to drop the present requirement that an applicant for an adoption order must, unless he has resided here for five years, be an Irish citizen.  This proposal caused some criticism in the Dáil and, as Senators may have seen, from some organisations outside.  I am quite satisfied that these criticisms are based on a misunderstanding of what is involved and I hope to convince the House that there is nothing whatsoever objectionable in the proposal.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that, apart from this particular provision, there is a provision in the law&mdash;Section 11 of the 1952 Act&mdash;to the effect that applicants for an adoption order must be residing <Col N="261" /> here at the time of the application. It is not proposed to alter that provision. There is, therefore, no question whatsoever that this provision will mean that foreigners can fly in here, put up in an hotel, obtain an adoption order and fly out again in a week's time.  They have to be residing here, and that means having their home here. What the proposal does mean is that foreigners who transfer their residence to this country will not be barred from adopting a child during the first five years of their residence here.  There is no reason why they should be.</P>
    <P>This provision in no way modifies the strict obligation on the Board not to grant an adoption order unless they are satisfied as to the suitability of the applicants, and if the Board are satisfied that a foreigner resident here is suitable&mdash;may I stress that it is only if he is resident here that the provision has any application&mdash;there is no reason why he should not be allowed to adopt a child.  I would like to mention, too, that not only is the existing prohibition arbitrary in that it excludes quite suitable applicants but it has no merit as a safeguard.  Irish citizenship has no direct bearing on a person's contacts with this country and in no way assists or facilitates the Board in deciding whether the applicant is suitable.  In fact an Irish citizen may have been born abroad and may have lived abroad all his life.  And, of course, under the 1952 Act, only the husband need be a citizen.</P>
    <P>It is significant that, when this country was represented recently at a Council of Europe Conference on legal adoption, and a proposal was made that countries should never forbid legal adoption merely on the ground that the applicants were not citizens, it turned out that no country in the Council, apart from ourselves, prohibited resident foreigners from adopting a child.  Admittedly our law does not prohibit them completely.  They may adopt after five years, but this concession is practically valueless since by then they are eligible for naturalisation anyway.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill relates to religion.  Section 12 of the 1952 Act provides that an adoption order may <Col N="262" /> not be made unless the applicant, or applicants, the child and the child's mother are all of the same religion. The Board may, however, having regard to the special circumstances of a particular case, make an adoption order although all these persons are not of the same religion, provided each of them belongs to one of the following religions: the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Methodist Church in Ireland, the Religious Society of Friends in Ireland, the Baptist Union of Ireland and the Brethren, commonly known as the Plymouth Brethren.</P>
    <P>This provision in the 1952 Act was inserted at the joint request of the authorised representatives of the religions that I have mentioned.  Those representatives and the representatives of the Salvation Army have now jointly requested that the Salvation Army be added to the list.  I am sure that the House will readily agree to this request, and Section 6 proposes accordingly.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is only a drafting amendment, to clear up a possible defect in those provisions of the 1952 Act relating to the fixing of a date of birth for a foundling or other person whose date of birth is unknown.  The law as it stands enables the Board to fix a date of birth in such cases and that date of birth is accepted for all purposes, but it is not certain that if the actual date of birth subsequently becomes known the Board is entitled to amend it in the records and to authorise the Registrar of Births to amend the register. Section 7 proposes to make it clear that the Board has this power.</P>
    <P>In moving the Second Reading of the Bill in the Dáil, I described what is now section 8&mdash;it was then section 7&mdash; of the Bill, relating to interim orders, as merely a drafting amendment.  I was challenged on that, so, to avoid an unnecessary controversy on words, I would like now simply to explain what the section does.  Under the 1952 Act, the Board is entitled to make an interim order where, but only where, it would be lawful for them to make an adoption order, that is a final order.  It is, however, lawful for the Board to make an adoption order <Col N="263" /> only where they are satisfied not only that the adopters and the child are eligible as to age and in respect of matters capable of being proved by documentary evidence, but also that the adopters are persons of good moral character, have sufficient means to adopt the child, and are generally suitable persons in whom to vest parental rights.</P>
    <P>The generally accepted function of an interim order, not only in this country but elsewhere, is that it serves as a provisional approval by the competent authority, but subject to the further test of a trial period.  In other words, it is envisaged that an interim order may be granted where the competent authority is fairly well satisfied but may have some doubts on some aspect of suitability&mdash;perhaps it may be the health of the adopters or it may be the ability of the adopters and the child to establish a parent-child relationship.  It was suggested in the Dáil that the Board should never make an interim order unless absolutely satisfied as to the suitability of the applicants, and that the function of the interim order should be to resolve some doubt about some such matter as the environment, but that is an unreal suggestion, in my opinion. &ldquo;Suitability&rdquo; of the adopters does not mean suitability in the abstract, but suitability in relation to the particular child in respect of whom the adoption order is sought and it includes such matters as health and environment in so far as these are relevant to the Board's decision whether or not to grant an adoption order.  There is no doubt whatsoever that an interim order is designed precisely to test the suitability of the adopters and that, as the 1952 Act is worded on this particular point, it may very well be that the Board could never lawfully make an interim order.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill is merely a drafting point to remove a doubt about the Board's power to adjourn applications. Section 10 of the Bill is an important section, which has caused some little controversy, much of which is based on a misunderstanding of its implications and, it may be thought, <Col N="264" /> insufficient acquaintance with the realities.</P>
    <P>In recommending this section to the Seanad, I would like to repeat that what it proposes is to remove an obstacle to legal adoption that was imposed, quite unwittingly I am certain, by the Oireachtas when passing the Children (Amendment) Act, 1957. The relevant provision of the 1957 Act was introduced by way of amendment in response to some suggestions that were made in the course of the debate, and it is quite clear that the Oireachtas was not thinking at all in terms of the effects on children placed with a family with a view to legal adoption.</P>
    <P>In fact, it is no exaggeration to say that, in its present form, section 2 of the 1957 Act, if consistently enforced by local authorities, would have gone a long way towards bringing the work of legal adoption to a halt.  It would have meant, not only that prospective adopters would have been subjected to two quite distinct systems of inspection and supervision, one by the local authority and one by the Board, not to mention supervision by an adoption society as well, but that prospective adopters would have been obliged by law to ascertain and pass on to local authorities particulars which in several cases they do not know themselves, that they do not want to know, and that could, if known to them, be a source of constant anxiety.</P>
    <P>Senators will no doubt have seen, from the newspapers, that certain organisations have been condemning this section.  I have no desire whatsoever to appear to be critical of the members of the committees of these organisations but, when I find that letters published by them are being quoted by members of the Oireachtas as arguments against the section, I do not think I have any option but to point out that they do not seem, even yet, to understand either what the implications of the present law are or what the effect of the proposal in the Bill will be.</P>
    <P>It has been alleged that the only criticism that I have made of the Children (Amendment) Act, 1957, is that it would compel prospective adopters to furnish information to a local <Col N="265" /> authority which it is plainly undesirable that they should be asked to furnish and which, if they were required to furnish it, could very well place the particular adoption in jeopardy.  The validity of this criticism has been accepted by the organisations concerned, but it has been suggested that the way to meet it is to let the 1957 Act stand, omitting the obligation to furnish the personal particulars specified.</P>
    <P>That, however, was merely one of several serious criticisms of the 1957 Act.  I mentioned it, and possibly stressed it, not as the only or the major objection but as an objection which was so self-evident that even those who appeared to be irrevocably committed to the idea of local authority inspection should recognise its force.  But there are, as I say, other and more fundamental objections.</P>
    <P>Under the Children (Amendment) Act, 1957, it is necessary to notify the local authority where arrangements are made for the placement of an illegitimate child with a family, even though the family taking the child are receiving no payment.  That provision applies only to illegitimate children. Consequently, the mere fact of notifying a local authority of a placement, where there is no question of reward, immediately identifies the child as illegitimate even if no personal particulars are supplied.  It is, of course, a fact that a majority of adopted children are illegitimate but, in the ordinary way, there is no evidence that any particular adopted child is illegitimate and, as those with practical experience in this field have pointed out to me, it can be very important in some cases that prospective adopters should not be forced to know with certainty that the child they are adopting is illegitimate.</P>
    <P>They may have perfectly valid reasons for this attitude.  For instance, if the adopted child wishes later on to ask them for information about his origins, the adopters may feel it important to be able to tell him truthfully that they do not know.  But, quite apart from that, most reasonable people would agree that it is wrong that prospective adopters should, even <Col N="266" /> if they themselves have the information, be forced to disclose to the local authority, which often in practice means disclosing to persons known to them personally, that the child proposed to be adopted is illegitimate.</P>
    <P>Even if the linking of legal adoption procedures with procedures designed to protect unwanted illegitimate children from exploitation did not cause these serious practical problems, it is difficult to see how anybody could seriously contend that prospective adopters who are offering a home and security to an unwanted child should be subjected, not just to one system of official supervision&mdash;we all accept that that is necessary as a safeguard against possible abuses&mdash;but to two separate systems of official supervision, one under the auspices of the Adoption Board and the other under the auspices of a local authority, not to mention the checks and enquiries carried out by the adoption society.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested also that there is a practical objection to these proposals on the grounds&mdash;so it is alleged &mdash;that the contribution which local authority officers, such as public health nurses and children's officers, can make, both from their local knowledge and their training, are being thrown overboard.  The answer to that is, simply, that they are not being thrown overboard.  There is nothing in this Bill to interefere in the slightest degree with the arrangements which already exist whereby the Board can, whenever and in so far as it wishes, ask these officers to carry out inspections and make a report.</P>
    <P>Not only does the Bill not prohibit such an arrangement but there is no intention of abolishing the arrangement in practice, though the need for it may become less over the years if it is decided to expand the Board's inspectorial staff.  But even then these local officers are almost certain to be asked for assistance in many cases.  The essential point, however, is this: that they would do this work, as they have already agreed to do it, as agents of the Board and under the aegis of the Board, and their reports will come to the Board and will not be filed in the local authority's records or indeed <Col N="267" /> submitted to the local authority at all. In other words, we can have the full benefit of the services of these officers without bringing the local authority, as such, into the picture, with all the attendant disadvantages of this latter course.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that what is now proposed will mean that the child will lose the &ldquo;protection&rdquo; of advance inspection by the local authority.  I must make clear that I, for one, would not support the proposition that those who are devoting their lives to the charitable work of finding homes for unwanted children should be subjected to the serious obstacles that I have outlined for no more solid reason than that there was a theoretical possibility that some of them, sometime, might make an error which local authority inspection might possibly prevent.  But it is, in any event, a fundamental error to confuse the functions of a local authority under the Children Acts with those of an authority concerned with legal adoption.  A local authority can insist only on minimum standards&mdash;they can hardly interfere unless there is positive neglect, provable cruelty or grossly inadequate accommodation.</P>
    <P>If an adoption society were to place children in homes that were so obviously unsuitable that an advance inspection by a local authority would rule them out under the Children's Acts, then that Society would not only be unfit to be registered but so unfit that it is absurd to suggest that they could be kept on the register by the Board.  To imply, in legislation, that the minimum standards enforceable under the Children Acts have any relevance to what is appropriate for legal adoption would set an entirely false headline, would establish a standard that is quite inadequate and would, therefore, degrade the whole concept of legal adoption.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to make clear that this section has been considered by the Board who agree with it, as indeed they do with the entire Bill with the minor reservation that I mentioned earlier about section 3.</P>
    <P>I think that I have covered most of <Col N="268" /> the points that arise in the Bill and I recommend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am glad to know the Adoption Act of 1952 has been reviewed and amended, I am perturbed by some of the proposed changes and the effect they will have on the welfare of the children to whom the legislation relates.</P>
      <P>The proposal in Section 3 (1) (a) to raise the maximum age at which a child may be adopted from seven to nine years is a small advance but the qualification at (b) restricting the application to cases where the applicant has had the child in his care since before it attained the age of seven years seems to be unnecessary and could deprive a large number of children of the chance of being adopted and enjoying a normal home life.</P>
      <P>In the debate in the Dáil, a plea was made for the raising of the maximum age limit very considerably but the Minister would not accept the proposal. Yet there exists a need to facilitate the adoption of persons of a higher age group.  All are agreed, of course, that the ideal is infant adoption but a little thought will reveal circumstances where adoption at a much later stage of life would not seem unrealistic.</P>
      <P>In the broader thinking of today, a very kindly practice has grown up. It is becoming an increasing custom for people to take children out of institutions to spend summer and other holidays with them and their own children.  The guest children often fit in so well with the other children and become so much a part of the family that there is an unwillingness to let them go back to the institutions and adoption is not beyond the bounds of possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Children taken in such circumstances are not as a rule in the infant or toddler stage but are boys and girls of ten years and over who sometimes become part and parcel of the family. I think the door should be left wide open to permit of adoption in this and other cases which might arise from time to time.  I can see no possible reason for closing the door at seven or nine years of age, particularly when <Col N="269" /> we know how bleak the future is for young people in institutions and how much bleaker it can be when they must eventually leave the institutions&mdash;often ill-equipped to earn their livelihoods except in the most menial employments.</P>
    <P>It is an improvement in the Bill to have the age of the adoptive parents reduced from 30 to 25 years.  I am glad the Minister has made this change but I would ask him to look again at the question of limiting so drastically the maximum age at which legal adoption is permitted.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) of Section 11 of the Principal Act reads:</P>
    <P>An adoption order shall not be made unless the applicants reside in the State.</P>
    <P>That provision is to remain but what does &ldquo;reside&rdquo; mean?  With respect, I would say it appears to be meaningless, more particularly when subsection (5) of the Principal Act is to be repealed.  This subsection reads:</P>
    <P>An adoption order shall not be made unless the applicant or, if the applicants are a married couple, the husband is an Irish citizen or has been ordinarily resident in the State during the five years preceding the date of the application.</P>
    <P>I feel this is a dangerous change in that it could leave the door wide open for Irish children to be taken to any country in the world by persons whose backgrounds could not really be properly investigated.  I hope I am wrong in that but that is how it appears to me.  I would ask the Minister if any difficulties arose from the subsection now proposed to be deleted during the time the Adoption Bill of 1952 has been in operation.</P>
    <P>Again, with respect, I would say that we should endeavour to keep these children in Ireland.  They are Irish citizens and we should be careful not to deprive them of their citizenship as we will do if we permit them to be taken abroad by persons who would merely reside here for a short time to qualify for an adoption order. I think the word &ldquo;reside&rdquo; in subsection <Col N="270" /> (a) should be clearly defined or clearly explained by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The subsection to be deleted appears to me to be a useful safeguard for a deprived child.  It would to some degree ensure that there would be a good chance of its being brought up, if not in its native land, at least, in an atmosphere which had some touch of its homeland.</P>
    <P>I understand also that some countries do not recognise adoptions negotiated in other countries and persons emigrating may find themselves in difficulties in regard to such children who will have to be readopted under the laws of the country they desire to enter.  Under the British adoption laws, I am informed, where adoptive parents intend taking children out of the country, they will be issued only a provisional adoption order.  The final adoption order has to be sought under the law of the country to which the child is being taken.</P>
    <P>Children legally adopted here could, on reaching adult years, find themselves in other countries without rights and subject to immigration laws which in certain circumstances could lead to deportation.  There could also be nationality problems for such a child. I would repeat that it would be a good thing if we would aim at the adoption of these children in their own country. If this country expands and develops as we all hope it will, we will need all our children, whatever the circumstances of their birth, to help in that development.  We should do everything possible to protect the child's right to live in the country of its birth until it is of an age to decide otherwise.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill, as passed by Dáil Éireann, seeks to permit the Adoption Board to grant an interim adoption order in respect of a child where the Board is not satisfied that the applicant is, among other things, of good moral character and is not a suitable person to have parental rights and duties but where it is of opinion that before the expiration of the probationary period, the applicant is likely to come up to the desired standard.  Is this not a very dangerous provision and most unfair to a child?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is how it seems to me and I should be very glad if the Minister would make that point clear. I cannot see the need for such a provision.</P>
      <P>I have read the Minister's explanation in the Dáil regarding Section 9 which proposes to withdraw Section 2 of the Children (Amendment) Act, 1957, where a child is being placed with a family with a view to legal adoption.  The Minister did not seem to agree with this in his Dáil statement but I still feel that the provision means that a very valuable safeguard, that is, the local authority supervision, will be withdrawn from the child.  I still feel this in spite of what the Minister says.</P>
      <P>I agree excessive supervision would discourage persons from undertaking legal adoption, as the Minister mentioned, but can he assure us that the Adoption Board can and will exercise a satisfactory supervision on its own? This is not a reflection on the Board; it is merely an inquiry as to whether the Board has a sufficient staff to cover all the cases of long-term inspections arising in different parts of the country. Would the Minister say, for instance, if the Board carries out inspections in all cases before placements?  I am not clear about that.  I am of the opinion that the Board would be better served if the work of long-term inspection were left, as under the Children (Amendment) Act, to the local authorities which have the trained staff for the work.  An amendment could be made to delete some undesirable points such as giving names and so forth.</P>
      <P>I would agree that there should not be duplicate inspections.  It seems to me that local information is most valuable in discovering unsuitable placements. People will not talk to strangers seeking information, and sometimes it is difficult for an outsider to discover what are the real conditions.  Local officers would be better equipped to come to a proper decision.  I think the Minister should look at the new provision again, as it appears to be scrapping a valuable safeguard for the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 makes provision for the <Col N="272" /> repeal of Section 19 of the Principal Act.  Would there be any value, I would ask the Minister, in amending and retaining Section 19 so as to enable the Board, or the Minister, at his discretion, to permit legal adoption at a higher age in exceptional circumstances?</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure if a reference to birth certificates is in order, but they were mentioned in the other House.  I would press, as some other members have already done, for the issue of short birth certificates only, but that in exceptional circumstances&mdash;as was referred to also&mdash;such as inheritance cases, the long certificate should be available.  It seems to me to be very cruel in this enlightened day that we should condemn an innocent human being to produce a document which not only casts a shadow over him, but which could serve to retard his advancement in life.  I hope we will not have to wait too long until some very courageous Minister for Justice will issue the order that the only birth certificate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is timely that the 1952 Adoption Act should be reviewed and, I think, therefore, we all welcome the introduction of this amending Bill.  The amending Bill as introduced by the Minister seems rather concerned with the tidying up of some details, covering some mistakes, and allowing for some hard cases.  I think something more could have been done on this occasion.  The 1952 Act was an extremely important step in the promotion of child welfare and welfare generally in this country. I should not like to let this occasion pass without paying tribute here to Senator Boland who at that time was Minister for Justice, and is now a member of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="273" /> It would have been advisable to have had a full scale review, not merely by the Minister talking unilaterally to the different parties concerned, but a full scale review of this important topic by bringing all the interests together.  All the people who have spoken and written about adoption, before and after the introduction of the Bill, have essentially the same objective and the same idea&mdash;to promote welfare.  There has been a difference of approach and in many cases that difference of approach has resulted in a sharp clash of opinion.</P>
    <P>That is the position in which the Minister finds himself.  There has been this sharp clash of opinion in regard to certain aspects of this measure.  It might have been better if those conflicts were worked out within a reviewing body before anything was embodied in the form of a Bill which would come to the Dáil and the Seanad.  The Minister appears to take the attitude that after his review of the work of the 1952 Act, he is satisfied with it&mdash;satisfied that this Bill is 100 per cent successful&mdash;but I think in an area such as this it is extremely difficult, first, to define, and secondly, to assess the degree of success of the work involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This review was made by the Adoption Board in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Any work in regard to adoption has got three main objectives: first, it is intended to relieve the mother; secondly, it is intended to bring happiness to the adopting parents: and thirdly, the most important of all, it is intended to give a real chance to the child concerned.  Those three objectives have to be harmonised. That is not easy, and if we are to look for maximum success in the harmonising of those three objectives, this is something that must be thoroughly examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we can be satisfied with saying that success is achieved when an adoption order is made.  The measure of success is not merely the making of the adoption order, because from the point of view of welfare, and <Col N="274" /> particularly of the welfare of the child, the making of the adoption order is the beginning only.  It is not the end of the business.  Indeed even in regard to natural parenthood, how can we judge success or evaluate success in regard to the rearing of children?</P>
    <P>So while we can leave the details of the Bill to the Committee Stage, it is well to take a look at the system in the 1952 Act directly, to take a look at the different elements in the system and see perhaps if there are not directions in which there might be some degree of improvement.  The elements of our system in this country are the Adoption Board, the adoption societies, the adoptable child, the prospective adopters and the mothers of the adoptable children</P>
    <P>I think we can say that the decision in this country to work through a board rather than through the courts has, by and large, been a success, but we must remember that what the Board is doing and what the Board was set up to do was to perform a particular judicial function, to perform a function in regard to the extinction of certain rights and the creation of others.</P>
    <P>The peculiar thing about the Board is that it has been set up to make judicial decisions in accordance with certain welfare principles, and we must therefore be careful to remember this primary nature of the Board and to be very slow to think of the Board as being merely a welfare agency or to allow that part of the Board's work which has the nature of the work of the welfare agency to become overlarge. I am afraid there has been a tendency for this to happen.</P>
    <P>Indeed, even if it has not happened in the past, it may well happen under the proposals the Minister is now bringing forward, and the unfortunate quarrel concerning the functions of the local authorities in regard to a child placed for adoption has arisen because of this tendency for the Adoption Board to become, as it were, a welfare agency.</P>
    <P>What would be most desirable is that in regard to the welfare of the child&mdash;of any child, but in this case of the adoptive child&mdash;the Adoption <Col N="275" /> Board and the local authority should be acting in concert rather than in conflict, that their aim and the aim of the Minister or other Ministers concerned should be to ensure the existence at local level of welfare workers sufficient in number and in training to deal with all the aspects of child welfare.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the problems of Section 2 of the 1957 Children Act and the amendments to it, which can be better discussed in Committee, but I would suggest that this is an area in which there is scope for using the local authorities in the particular aspect in which they can be used.  As Senator Miss Davidson has pointed out, there is no real substitute for local knowledge.</P>
    <P>If we take a look at another element in the system as we have it at the moment, if we look at the adoption societies, let me say straight away that these are an extremely valuable part of our adoption system since they can ensure the child is placed in a home which is both generally suitable and is also suitable for the particular child. We must realise this work is the great contribution the adoption societies make as opposed to the third party adoption of the child at a very early age, at the infant stage.  For the best results, these adoption societies should have an adequate supply of trained social welfare workers, a regular system of operation, and they should have at some level a representation of the various points of view with regard to this problem, whether on a general committee or on special case committees dealing with individual children.</P>
    <P>In so far as adoptions here can be criticised, there has been a tendency to lack this bringing together of different points of view, a tendency for those concerned with adoptions to be segregated, each of which is taking a narrow point of view.  Anything to overcome this would help to improve our adoption system as it now stands. Another thing we see about societies is that they seem badly spread throughout the country.  There may be good <Col N="276" /> and sufficient reasons for this but one would hope to see a better distribution of adoption societies growing up in the years ahead.  I understand new societies were recently formed in Kilkenny and Killarney and this is a very laudable development.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the 1952 Act does give the Adoption Board control of the registration of adoption societies, but as it stands I think it is rather bald and one would expect, reading it as it stands, that the provisions in this section would have been supplemented by regulations which would have been issued indicating in broad outlines and in regard to minimum standards certain norms to which adoption societies would be asked to conform.</P>
    <P>In this respect, we might remember that Section 30 of the British Act of 1958 is more stringent than the corresponding Section 36 of our 1952 Act.  In particular, the British Act brings out the point that the adoption society must not only be competent to carry out its activities but must also have the staff and the facilities to carry them out to the extent to which it is operating.  Our Act merely asks for competence and we can all agree that a particular organisation, a particular number of trained staff, might well be developed to carry out work at a particular scale.  The level of activity might increase and while one would hesitate to say such a society was then not competent, still you could get the position that this society, by the extent of its activities, would be strained beyond its resources.</P>
    <P>There is need for regulations of some sort here.  If we look at the position as it stands, we have at the moment something like 700 adoptions per year.  It is something for which we are all very thankful.  That is no reason why we should be satisfied and should not look for an increase in this number.  It is good that 700 children find families and homes under the Adoption Act but we should also all agree that it is a tragedy that so many of our children, between the ages of 2½ and 16 are still housed in institutions. We should all agree that anything that can be done to increase the number of children now in institutions <Col N="277" /> who would become adoptable should have the support of everybody interested in this problem.</P>
    <P>Inquiries suggest that a large number of children in institutions are not adopted because there is difficulty in getting the mother's consent.  In many instances, the mother is apparently content to leave the child in the institution from the age of 2½ to 16 and then reclaim the child at the age of 16 when the child is a potential earner. However much respect we have for the natural right of a mother&mdash;indeed, we must have every respect for it&mdash;I think what we have here is the question of the right of a mother to exploit the child by leaving it in an institution and preventing, by withholding consent, the child getting a part in a family, and reclaiming the child at 16 when the child is able to work.</P>
    <P>Regarding the provisions of the Bill as introduced here, there has been a great deal of discussion on the question of age and this is a point that will come up again on Committee Stage. Everybody agrees with what the Minister said, that early placement and early adoption are preferable but that is no reason, I think, why there should be brought in a curtain of prohibition at the age of seven or nine and that all adoptions beyond that age should be refused.  If one looks at the Bill as it stands, it appears that the extension to nine years of age given under the Bill is only to be an exceptional thing, only to occur in particular circumstances.  Does the Minister envisage that the extension to the age of nine should be something rare?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we should leave this to the Committee Stage when it can be discussed in more detail.  I raised the point because the Minister has indicated that the age at which the child can be adopted may be raised to <Col N="278" /> nine years of age but there are no corresponding amendments in other parts of the Principal Act.  For instance, the prohibition on a child leaving the country still remains at seven so that I feel the Minister is still taking the point of view that seven is the age limit for adoption, except in very exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>Perhaps hard cases make bad law and the plea that there should be adoption above the ages of seven or nine is a plea about hard cases.  But if hard cases make bad law, I think Sections 2 and 3 of the Bill are very bad law indeed.  I should like to make a few points at this stage in regard to the provisions in these sections. Section 2 allows the adoption of a child legitimated but not re-registered. This device appears to me undesirable and I suggest it might be preferable to redefine the meaning of &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; in Section 10 of the Principal Act as meaning &ldquo;illegitimate at birth&rdquo; or &ldquo;illegitimate at the time of placement&rdquo;. This would seem to be a better way out of the problem the Minister is endeavouring to meet in Section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from this, I think that the provision the Minister makes in subsection (2) of Section 2 with regard to the consent of the natural father is not necessarily a desirable one.  The requirement that in the case where there has been a subsequent marriage, the consent not only of the mother but also of the natural father is required for adoption to take place, could be effective only if there were a conflict between the mother and the natural father.  Even under the Act as it stands, if the mother refused consent, there could be no adoption: the only point in bringing in the consent of the natural father would be that the natural father can block the adoption where the mother is prepared to consent. If the mother is prepared to consent, it would appear that this is fairly good evidence that the mother is not prepared to bring the child into the new home.  The position then is that the failure of the natural father to consent means that the child who is not acceptable in the new home because of the mother's attitude is by the natural father's refusal to consent, <Col N="279" /> condemned to live in an institution rather than allowed to be adopted into a new family.  Again, this point could be gone into on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Regarding the provisions about adoptive parents in Section 5, I think there will be a general welcome but there is one point I should like to raise now.  Under the amending Bill, married people may adopt from the age of 25, provided they are three years married.  I should like to raise the point that if adoption is to take place three years after marriage, there might be very early placement with a view to subsequent adoption and I think there should be some control over the placement of children too soon after marriage.  It would be undesirable if there were placement with a view to adoption by a young couple, say, of 23, one year after marriage. Even though the child could not be adopted for another two years, placement could take place.  I do not think this would be good adoption practice.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain further than what he said in his Second Stage speech as to how an interim order will work.  It is still not clear from what the Minister has said how the order would operate and what the advantage of it would be.  Certainly, one effect would be to give a very false sense of security to prospective adoptive parents and I think it could be a real difficulty.  I think this device of the interim order might well be a dangerous thing, if not properly used.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of citizenship and children going abroad, again, this is a matter which evokes a great deal of controversy and will undoubtedly arise on the Committee Stage.  I should like to ask the Minister one question in regard to children sent abroad, not having been legally adopted.  I am satisfied in regard to the precautions taken regarding the issue of passports for such children but I should like to ask the Minister whether the number of children allowed abroad in this way is reported and published in any public document? Is it reported to the Department of Health, to the Minister's Department or to the Adoption <Col N="280" /> Board?  It is desirable that this number should be on record.</P>
    <P>There are some points I want to raise at this stage because they could not arise on Committee Stage.  It has been represented to me that serious difficulties could arise during the placement period if the mother shows a tendency to change her mind regarding the placement of the child.  It has been represented to me that a mother having placed her child with prospective adoptive parents through an adoption society may then inform the adoption society; &ldquo;I want my child back next Saturday.&rdquo;  In many cases, the mother will not turn up to claim the child on that day but the adoption society must tell the prospective adoptive parents with whom the child is placed to have the child ready for return.  There have been cases where this has happened continuously and it could give rise to grave anxiety on the part of the prospective parents with whom the child is placed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps that may be one answer to the Senator's question about the interim order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would be.  I shall consider that and see whether it would meet it or not.  I would urge on the Minister that this could have a very serious effect on the child and on the adoptive parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister would consider in regard to this point that under Section 39 of the Principal Act, the mother must sign a statutory form before releasing the child for placement and I wonder, if there were some simple formal process before she was enabled to reclaim the child from custody, if that would prevent a mother indulging in these quasi-hysterical manoeuvres of wishing to reclaim the child, perhaps actually reclaiming the child, perhaps only expressing an intention to do so.  It would seem as if it would be better to have some formal process rather than merely a question of calling to the office of the adoption society and saying that the child had to come back. That position in Great Britain is that the mother can reclaim the child from replacement only if she can show that <Col N="281" /> she can give the child a home.  Here we have absolutely no limitation on this.</P>
    <P>There is one further point with regard to consent that I should like to raise.  I should like to ask the Minister specifically what is the interpretation being given to the phrase &ldquo;cannot be found&rdquo; in Section 14 of the 1952 Act, the section dealing with dispensation with consent.  This is a phrase, of course, which could be subject to many meanings.  There is no doubt that a needle can be found in a haystack if sufficient effort is made to find it but just how is this interpreted in practice in regard to the finding of a mother before her consent is dispensed with?  It might be preferable that the actual practice might be perhaps expressed a little better in the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>A final point in regard to consent: I wonder if the Minister has considered and will let us have his views on the question of the consent of a young mother when the situation is known to her family.  We could have the case here of a mother of 14 or 15 years of age and, under the law as it stands, her consent alone can release that child for the purpose of adoption away from her and away from her whole family.  If the situation were not known to this young mother's family, there is no reason why the situation should be made known to them, but in the case where the situation is known to her family, it might well be that a member of her family, an elder sister or somebody like that, might prefer to take this child rather than see it pass completely outside the family. This is a point which might be considered.</P>
    <P>Finally, though these matters are not the Minister's responsibility, there are a few points in regard to registration which do affect adoptable children that I should like to bring up. Persons connected with adoption work from different aspects have suggested that there is some incidence in this country of what is in effect infant adoption through false registration.  I have no direct knowledge of the extent to which this is going on but people who differ about a great deal in regard to adoption work seem to be <Col N="282" /> at one that there is an element of this type of thing happening.  Here we have a case where the first registration of a child is a false registration and, in fact, a third party adoption takes place and the false registration makes it a legal adoption.  In one sense this might be considered to be a good thing in that it does certainly cover things up but I do not think, looked at from the point of view of modern adoption practice, that this is necessarily the best solution because this means, in fact, rapid adoption, adoption at a very, very early stage of infant life and this is certainly not preferable to legal adoption where care is taken in order to place the child in the home that would be most suitable for that child.</P>
    <P>This may be a situation which could well be examined and, indeed, if there were an element of false registration going on in this country the fact that in this country 80 per cent of our adoptions are through adoption societies, which is very much higher than occurs in other countries, might not be a matter for congratulation; it might well be an indication that adoptions that take place as open, third party adoptions elsewhere are taking place in this country by false registration.</P>
    <P>There is one final point on registration which I wish to raise.  I understand the position is that the original registration of an illegitimate birth is not erased from the general register. The position is, of course, under the Adoption Acts, that the link of the new identity with that originally entered is preserved as confidential but a case has come to my notice of a search being made in the general register for an illegitimate birth by an individual who had absolutely no moral right to make this search and one fears that by leaving these original registrations open to search, we might well be facilitating persons who could possibly be in a situation to influence or even blackmail some of the persons concerned in the adoption.</P>

      <P>I would therefore say to the Minister that I regret that a great deal of the discussion which has taken place outside the Oireachtas and inside the Oireachtas in regard to this Bill has been contentious when this might well have been avoided if there had been a thorough public discussion of the matter beforehand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill clearly makes several improvements in the previous Act.  We are not ungrateful for those but, such is the hard way of the world inside Leinster House and outside Leinster House, I propose to confine my remarks to what I consider are inadequacies in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say at the outset that the Minister in his introductory remarks shed a good deal of new light on some rather cloudy corners of the Dáil debate.  I think he has satisfied us on some points that still remained unsatisfactory until this evening.  But a few queries and a few uncertainties <Col N="284" /> remain in my mind, and I will be grateful if the Minister would help me to resolve them.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I am not an expert in the rather complicated procedure demanded for adoption and, of course, necessarily complicated and necessarily careful because it is a most important decision to make.  In what I have to say I will talk for a moment or two first about what is not in the Bill and perhaps should be.  Here my chief worry is with this question of placement.  As I understand it, a child may for several months, perhaps six months or nine months, be in the home of the persons who wish to adopt before the case comes before the Adoption Board at all.  That is, there is a preliminary six months, nine months or perhaps longer time, and it has been suggested&mdash;but this suggestion has also been questioned&mdash;that the regulations controlling those preliminary months are not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows exactly what the criticisms have been.  But I am not quite clear what his answer is.  What are the regulations controlling these initial months?  Who makes these regulations?  How exactly does what is called &ldquo;case committee&rdquo; come in? Under what regulations?  I would be grateful if the Minister could remove uncertainties from my mind, therefore, because there has been a clear suggestion that the initial precautions are unsatisfactory.  The Minister said that the only welfare authority concerned is the Adoption Board.  But I think it is true to say that as far as placement is concerned, this may have been an accomplished fact for several months before the case comes before the Adoption Board.  I should be grateful if the Minister can shed light on that particular question.</P>
    <P>I come now to what is in the Bill. These matters have been all raised before in this House and they have been raised before in the Dáil.  Yet I must refer to them because I think they are matters of supreme importance. When we come to the Committee Stage, no doubt we shall have fairly strenuous tussles over them.</P>
    <P>The first is the matter of the age of the child for adoption.  My great <Col N="285" /> uneasiness of mind in this comes from the simple fact that in Norway and in certain States in Canada&mdash;Quebec, at any rate&mdash;and in the United Kingdom a child can be adopted up to 21 years. These are countries governed by wise Governments.  I do not quite see why we should dissociate ourselves so rigorously from them.  In France and Spain, the regulation is that there should be 15 years' difference between the age of the child and his adopters &mdash;an interesting point of view.  It implies that what really matters is that parents should be a good way ahead of the child in life.  I think that this attitude is worth considering.  In Latin America, the same criterion is demanded, not based on the absolute age of the child or his parents but on a difference of 18 years between the age of the child and that of his parents &mdash;again, I think, an intelligent way of approaching it.  Therefore, I wonder just why the Minister is being quite so rigid on this.  I see the point when he says that the sooner a child is adopted, the better.  On the other hand, I do not quite see why the axe should fall at seven or nine years.  The suggestion that would-be parents will defer adoption if they can carry on to 15 or 21 years does not, I feel, carry full weight.  Certainly, the experience of some of the societies is that parents are clamouring for adoption immediately. There is no suggestion of their being cautious or of holding back: there is an urgent demand for children for adoption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had to insert a special section in this Bill to cure quite a few hard-luck cases which arose precisely because people would not go in time to look for adoption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems a good argument.  Yet, I am assured that the demand is such that few parents would hold back now.  Times may have changed.  However, I must consider later what the Minister has just said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I come to a very important point.  In the Dáil, the Minister undertook to consider a suggestion by Deputy H.P. Dockrell.  The suggestion by the Deputy is to be found at <Col N="286" /> column 914 of the Official Report and the undertaking by the Minister is to be found at column 930.  I hope the Minister, before the close of this evening's debate, will let us know his intentions in that regard.  It was to do with a suggestion that a relative could adopt up to 21 years.  We look forward with very much hope that the Minister is prepared to accept that suggestion.</P>
    <P>We have already had some discussion on the residential qualifications. The Minister is entirely satisfied.  I still have some lingering doubts.  What exactly does &ldquo;having their home in the State&rdquo; mean?  The Minister's actual words were &ldquo;Have their home here&rdquo;. I should like a legal definition of that, or I should like to be assured that there is a cast-iron legal definition. Otherwise, what is there to prevent foreigners from coming over here, buying an expensive flat, furnishing it, adopting a child and clearing out right away?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Why bother submitting themselves to the scrutiny and inspection of the Adoption Board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the other aspect of it.  In other words, they can get away with it, without any responsibility at all?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different point.  It does not affect this.  We are at least here dealing with a couple who are prepared to submit themselves to the inspection of the Adoption Board and to satisfy the Board that they are suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No length of residence. But the Board must be able to satisfy itself that they are suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="287" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is another point: it has come up before.  It concerns Section 10.  Some people are &ldquo;het-up&rdquo;, to use a colloquial phrase, about this.  I should like the Minister to assure the Seanad that if this provision about local inspection is waived, the adoption societies and the Adoption Board all have the necessary trained people, the necessary energy and ability to do the job thoroughly. If he is quite certain of that, then perhaps Section 10 should stand as it is.</P>
      <P>However, I have received some fairly strong communications on this matter.  I shall read the following one:</P>
      <P>This prohibition would of course expose the children to all the dangers from which social workers had hoped the 1957 Act would protect the child.  How can one know where a child is placed with a view to adoption?  They are to notify the Adoption Board, apparently, if the child is placed.  The Board has no army of inspectors to go about the country whereas the local authority probably knows already the circumstances of the family and the character of the adoptive parents.  These children are the most pathetic and helpless section of the population. This section would remove from them the small measure of protection (1) by the Act of 1957 and leave them once more exposed to exploitation, cruelty, sadism and perversion.</P>
      <P>Those are not exactly my words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I quote them as an indication of the strength of feeling in responsible quarters on this section.  Therefore I shall look forward to an even stronger assurance from the Minister on this.  In a sense, I think he is shifting the critical focus in raising the matter of illegitimacy and so on.  I think that risk has to be weighed against under-inspection, which is the real fear.  Senator Miss Davidson spoke well on this.  The Minister referred to the inspectorial staff&mdash;a fine phrase. Is he quite satisfied that the inspectorial <Col N="288" /> staff at the disposal of the Board is entirely sufficient?</P>
      <P>However, I return to the fact that there is much in this Bill that makes improvements, and that we certainly welcome.</P>

      <P>I should like to add my words of welcome to this Bill to those of previous speakers.  I find on looking carefully at the Bill that there is much in it to commend my support because it definitely improves what, to my mind, was one of the most important things that has been done in the Oireachtas since I have been a member of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, I should like to associate myself with Senator Dooge in regard to the debt we owe to the Adoption Board and to adoption societies who have carried out such a wonderful amount of work since the 1952 Act.  I am in fairly close touch with the adoption machinery through my own Department, the Department of Social Studies and through various medical colleagues who are involved in midwifery practice and I have been impressed by the almost unanimous view that the 1952 Act has worked extremely well.  It has brought happiness to a large number of people through the numerous adoptions that have been promoted under this Act.  As far as I can see, it works, on the whole, better than corresponding Adoption Acts in other countries.  Perhaps they take more risks.  There will be, on the whole, more good done but more risks will be taken.  I think we make fewer <Col N="289" /> mistakes and that is perhaps because we are going cautiously in the beginning.</P>
    <P>That is not a bad way to start because, as the Minister pointed out, this matter of legal adoption is far too delicate and could be injured by a few mistakes.  Our circumstances are rather special and we have to go about this matter cautiously and I do not find myself blaming the Minister for expressing the view he has expressed so cautiously.</P>
    <P>I know that in the other House, and already here, a number of points have been raised about defects in this Bill, about things that might have been done and so on.  I find myself worried about, or really deeply interested in only one of these points, that is, the point raised by Senator Stanford.  In the Dáil, the point was pressed by Deputy Dockrell.  It refers to the age at which children can be adopted by relatives, as compared with the age at which corresponding adoption can take place by adoptive parents who are not relatives.  The argument Deputy Dockrell put forward was that this age should be higher, if the adoptive parents are closely related to the child, if they are, say, aunts or uncles.</P>
    <P>This is a very good point.  One of the reasons for not having a higher age for adoptions in Ireland is the risk of incompatibility, because the child, as the Minister pointed out in the extract from the seminar report, who has reached nine, ten, 11 or 12 years has already accumulated life experience and consequently may be more difficult to fit into the new household, but if the new parents are relatives, it is very likely the child may have known them for some time before its natural father or mother died.  The adoptive parents may have been aware of any peculiarities the child had in its character.  They are choosing the child&mdash;this is the probable course of events&mdash;in the knowledge of what it is like.  If they are not related to the child, it is a blind choice.  They have, perhaps, had a certain amount of experience in the preliminary period but this cannot really take the place of the knowledge that relatives will usually have.  There <Col N="290" /> is, in addition, a blood relationship.</P>
    <P>I think all these add up to a reduction in the amount of risk in regard to incompatibility which may occur between the child and the adoptive parents.  I would, therefore, support Senator Stanford, in the hope that the Minister may see his way, when we come to discuss this on Committee Stage, to implement his assurance in the Dáil that he would seriously consider this particular point of view.  We hope he will do so with complete sympathy.</P>
    <P>I find myself rather uneasy about the question of residence.  I am sure the Minister will be able to clear up this matter when he refers to it on Committee Stage but it does appear as if parents may come to the country to establish an appearance of residence, without any real intention of staying here and then going off after the adoption has been accomplished. He says, very reasonably, that anyhow they can take the child away.  I do not know how the question of passports and so on, comes in, but at any rate, we would all be reassured if the Minister would give us some explanation about this at the appropriate time.  I find myself, on the whole, very well satisfied with this Bill and I support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because any move made by any Minister to solve the question of what happens to illegitimate children is good.  As a member of a local authority for 18 years, I have come up against this problem on many occasions and I have also come up against it in my capacity as a national school teacher.  When we had no legal adoption, the question of the illegitimate child became a problem for the local authority.  The only system at that time was that the child was boarded out.  As a teacher in the national school, I found myself with at least five children on average every year who were boarded out.  I hold that the children who were boarded out were only boarded out for profit and that that system was a complete failure</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for that reason that I welcome any move by the Minister to introduce <Col N="291" /> a system which will make it easy for people to adopt children and I agree that there should be a minimum number of years after marriage before adoptions can be made, that is, three years.  The Minister is going in the right direction there.  The usual period for people to adopt children was at seven, eight or nine years.  I have seen that happen, and I have seen children being adopted, and then children arriving subsequently and I can assure you that the adopted children were loved just as much as the natural children of the parents.  No parent has got rid of an adopted child because a child arrived subsequently.  The old system we had was that mothers were sent to the county homes.  They had their children and the mothers then became servants in the county homes. We have tried to break down that system and Deputy Dr. Browne took an active part in breaking it down and did a good day's work in doing so.  I can assure you that I would have no adoption system if I could get the mother to keep the child or the grandmother to keep the child.  The child would be much better off with the mother or with the grandmother if that could be done.  The mother becomes a sort of slave or prisoner in the home.  We have homes at the moment which keep mothers for two full years, if the child is not adopted.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should introduce some measure to do away with these homes.  I could mention names. The Minister knows them as well as I do.  No mother should be held a prisoner for two years because the only result is to make her hate the very sight of her child.  Our aim should be to develop her mother love for the child, make her interested in keeping the child.  There is too much of a stigma attaching to these unfortunate people who have illegitimate children. Many of these mothers are very young indeed.  It is not always their fault. Their parents do not inform them sufficiently.  Possibly the mother died when the children were very young. There are many and varied reasons. There may not have been proper control. They may have been allowed to <Col N="292" /> go to dances at 13, and 14, and 15 years of age.  At the moment the number of illegitimate children in rural areas is very small indeed.  It is a nine days' wonder now if an illegitimate child is born in the parish.  Of course, very often a marriage takes place and the child is born legitimately.  That is the tendency.  I remember some years ago there were numbers of illegitimate children in various parishes.  There are very few today.</P>
    <P>Above all, I would impress upon the Minister the need for getting rid of this system whereby mothers are sent to these homes and kept in them for two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>These girls should be sent to maternity hospitals like every other mother.  I have had experience of boarded out children who were kept in school until they were 16 even, though the law was that they should be kept in school only until they were 14 years of age.  The argument was that at 16 they were more mature and better.  The natural tendency where other children were concerned was to ask why these were still in school and then, of course, someone told why they were there.  I broke that down myself in Westmeath. I hold it should be broken down all over the country.  These children should have the same rights as all other children.</P>
      <P>With regard to the period in which investigations are made, and so on, I think that period could be cut.  If the mother gets married during the period and claims the child, the whole machinery is upset.  I would not make the period too long.  I welcome the Bill as a step in the right direction.  If possible, I should like some provision whereby mothers of illegitimate children would be encouraged to keep the children and rear them as members of the family.</P>

While I should like to deal with the matters <Col N="293" /> raised as fully as possible, I feel I should be to some extent wasting the time of the Seanad if I were to go into them in detail now.  I should, however, like to answer some of the specific queries put to me.</P>
      <P>Senator Stanford and Senator Jessop spoke about the discussion which took place in the Dáil on Deputy Dockrell's amendment and my undertaking to examine it further.  I regret to have to say that, so far, I have not been convinced the amendment is necessary. As I said in the Dáil, it seems to me that the orphan child who is taken by relatives is far less in need of adoption than other children placed for adoption. I think it might not be any harm, however, if either Senator Stanford or Senator Jessop put down a specific amendment along the lines of Deputy Dockrell's amendment to give the Seanad an opportunity of discussing the matter fully and examining all the pros and cons.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooge mentioned the clash of opinion which has taken place outside this House.  One might be inclined to get a wrong impression as a result of what has happened.  I should like to point out that people all over the country who are interested in this work, and who support the proposals in the Bill, have not entered the controversy.  They have said nothing because they believe, as I do, that this sort of public controversy, particularly newspaper controversy, is the worst possible way in which to debate adoption matters.  The fact that some people, with a particular view, are more vocal than others, does not mean that there is not a substantial volume of informed opinion throughout the country to support the view I am expressing here.  I can assure the House that I am very well buttressed by expert, experienced opinion in putting forward the proposals in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dooge implied that I carried out only a narrow Ministerial or Departmental examination.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  When I came into office as Minister for Justice, one of the first things in which I took an interest was legal adoption. Far from having only a Departmental examination of the matter, I asked the <Col N="294" /> Adoption Board itself to consider carefully, as a result of all its ten years' experience, what amendment and improvements could usefully be made, and to let me have a comprehensive memorandum on anything they thought necessary.  This Bill is the result of that process.  It corresponds almost exactly with what the Adoption Board recommended.</P>
    <P>I wonder why some people take the line they do in these matters?  It seems to me that they are concerned with doctrinaire theorising rather than with the realities of the situation.  There is nothing consistent in their approach. There was no consistency even in the approach of Senator Miss Davidson here tonight.  On the one hand, Senator Miss Davidson appears to favour measures allowing more adoptions: an increase in the age limits and so on.  On the other hand, when she comes to a proposal designed to facilitate suitable adoptions by foreigners resident here, she goes over to the other side and advocates a restrictive approach.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford has asked me to reassure him about this question of residence.  It seems to me that the arguments are entirely on the side of what is proposed.  As I indicated, we are giving nothing away.  This requirement of five years' residence or citizen-ship&mdash;and do not forget it is five years or citizenship&mdash;is at the moment an illusory safeguard.  All it does is that in certain cases it prevents desirable adoptions taking place.  What the people criticising this are not taking into account, either deliberately or unconsciously, is that all the time the Board is there.  All the requirements about examination and suitability still apply.  It is entirely unreal to talk about people flying in here and taking children out.  What this Bill is concerned with is a foreigner who has a home here who wants to go to our Adoption Board and submit himself to all the formalities and inquiries inherent in making a formal application to our Adoption Board, who wants to adopt a child under our system and not that of any other country.  People talking about taking a child out and denying it the rights of Irish citizenship <Col N="295" /> are talking about an entirely different matter.  That has nothing to do with this case.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the question of notification of local authorities.  It is difficult for me to remain unemotional about this.  This provision we are proposing to amend was a mistake.  It was put into the Children Act, 1957, inadvertently by people at that time who did not examine what they were doing.  The very fact that it is in the Act in the form it is today, with the requirement that people must give these personal particulars to the local authority, is proof that when it was put in, the people responsible for it did not know what they were doing and did not realise what the implications were. Now they try to mend their hand and say: &ldquo;We will leave it there but include notification of the personal details&rdquo;.  But this attempt to undo the damage is not enough.  They are overlooking the fact that where there is no question of reward, only an illegitimate child has to be notified to the local authority.  An orphaned child or any legitimate child need not.  Therefore, the very act of notifying the local authority brands the child as an illegitimate child.</P>
    <P>Surely none of us wants that?  Do we not all want that the child placed in the adoptive home should, as nearly as possible, be facilitated in becoming the same as an ordinary member of the family, as Senator McAuliffe said? That is what our Irish legal adoption system is all about.  It is, in my view, a superior system to the system in many of the other countries mentioned. Some of these people briefing Senators about this matter tell us what is in the British Act, as if we did not know. We attend European seminars on this subject of adoption.  We know what the system is in other countries.  We compare notes.  As a result of this, we are satisfied that our system is as good as, if not better than, any of these systems.</P>
    <P>Our system, from the very beginning, is concentrated on the child.  The child is the centre and pivot of our idea of legal adoption.  Some of these other countries put much more emphasis on considerations relating to <Col N="296" /> the adopting family, property rights and so on.  But current opinion is now beginning to veer to the point of view that we have already accepted in this country.</P>
    <P>In regard to the adoption of older children, I have quite frankly admitted and everybody who knows anything about the problem will admit that there very probably are isolated cases whose adoption would be desirable, although, as Deputy Dillon readily agreed in the Dáil, they are far fewer than many of the people who discuss this matter seem to believe or to suggest. Let us admit there are some.  But, as I see it, what we are asked to do is to endanger the whole valuable structure of adoption as we have built it up here over ten years in order to cover a very few cases, which, as some Senator said, are hard cases but make very bad law.</P>
    <P>What we want to encourage is infant adoption.  Experience all over the world has shown that infant adoption is the only adoption which will, subject to suitable safeguards, be a real success.  No matter what group presses me and no matter what attacks are made on me, I do not intend to have anything to do with proposals that would in any way lessen the pressure for infant adoption, and I say this apart from anything else that is to be said against these proposals.  I feel I have no option but to take what might appear to be an implacable attitude on this matter.</P>
    <P>I want to assure Senator Stanford that we are really at cross-purposes as regards the services of officers of local authorities.  All I am proposing in this Bill is changing the aegis under which machinery operates.  Legal adoption, as we know it, is not a matter that should come under a local authority, as such, in any way.  The local authority are not an appropriate body to deal with it.  The local authority have all sorts of specific statutory functions, which they carry out&mdash; many of them very well, some of them perhaps indifferently.  We all know local authorities throughout the country.  I admit, and readily agree with Senator Stanford, that most local authorities have excellent people in the persons of welfare officers or children's <Col N="297" /> officers of one sort or another.  I agree that it would be nonsensical for us arbitrarily to cut these people out of the whole system of adoption.  There is no question of that, as I explained in my opening speech.  We propose to continue to call on the assistance of these officers in so far as their work can be of any assistance to adoption: but they will be doing the work for the Adoption Board.  All their service, knowledge and experience&mdash;about which everybody is so enthusiastic&mdash; will be available to the Adoption Board.  All we are doing is cutting the local authority as such out of the matter.  Instead of having two different systems of inspection of the family, we propose to have one&mdash;but one which has all the resources of the two available to it.  That is the way to have it.</P>
    <P>A question we might ask ourselves is this: what is adoption? Adoption takes place when some charitably-minded couple offer their home to an unwanted orphaned or illegitimate child.  It is an act of charity. Admittedly, as we all know and as Senator McAuliffe rightly pointed out, the adopters too, gain immensely; but, basically, the initial act is an act of charity by people who take an unwanted child with a view to adopting it.  Why should people of that sort be subjected to the additional inspection of a local authority?  It is completely inappropriate and wrong.  This Board was established by the Oireachtas. Senator Dooge is not right in suggesting that the Board was intended to be a judicial institution only or mainly. In the main Act, certainly the Board is clearly established with judicial or semi-judicial powers, but, at the same time, it has equally clear and definite functions of inspection and supervision. When charitably-minded people go through the process of taking a child into their home with a view to its adoption, it is this Board, established by the Oireachtas for this purpose, that should be the responsible authority and they should not be associated with the local authority.  We should get away from this &ldquo;poorhouse&rdquo; association.</P>
    <P>There were many other points raised <Col N="298" /> to which I should like to reply but the House has other business tonight and I do not wish to delay it unduly. We can have a discussion on all these matters on the Committee Stage. However, Senator Stanford asked me to indicate how adoption begins, what happens before the Adoption Board comes officially on the scene.  The work is done by adoption societies in these cases in which Senator Stanford is interested.  These are reputable bodies of charitably-minded people who form themselves into societies and satisfy the Board that they are suitable persons to be registered.  Senator Dooge's criticism of the 1952 Act in regard to the stipulations regarding societies seeking registration struck me as being a little academic, to say the least of it.  Any reasonably-minded Senator reading the Act and seeing what is set out will readily admit the obligations on the Board are stringent enough and certainly adequate for practical purposes, and to raise these doubts is in fact to suggest that the Board is not doing its job.  I have no doubt the Board does its job.  I have no worries about that.</P>
    <P>To return to Senator Stanford's query: what happens is that one of these properly registered societies establishes contact with a family seeking to adopt a child.  They satisfy themselves that the family is suitable, and then they give to that family, or procure for that family, a suitable child.  This is very delicate, human, personal work and I think this is the way it should be done, by charitably-minded people who devote themselves to work of this nature.</P>
    <P>Then the child is placed with the family for adoption and subsequently an application is made to the Adoption Board.  The Adoption Board satisfies itself that all is in order and may make either an interim order or a final order, as the case may be.  The best guarantee that these adoption societies are doing their work well is that, as far as I am aware, and as I mentioned in my opening address, there has never been a case where the Board has had to turn down on suitability grounds an application for an adoption order out forward by an adoption society.  There <Col N="299" /> have been some that ran into legal and technical difficulties of one sort or another but the Board has never had to say to a society: &ldquo;You did a bad job.  This is not a suitable family,&rdquo; or &ldquo;You have placed an unsuitable child with this family.&rdquo;  That is the best proof that these societies are doing their work well.</P>
    <P>I hope the Seanad will agree to give the Bill a Second Reading because, so far as I can gather, most Senators are in favour of the Bill, at least in principle.</P>

      <P>This is an amendment of the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation Scheme and it is intended to bring the position of married secondary teachers into line with that of married women national teachers.  Up to recently married women national teachers had, on marriage, to retire compulsorily and received a gratuity.  When the marriage ban was removed, this compulsion to retire and the marriage gratuity were done away with.  The amendment provides that in the case of a secondary teacher who enters the service after 1st August, 1963, there will be no marriage gratuity and a married woman secondary teacher can continue in service, or if she breaks her service, can re-enter secondary teaching and, for the purpose of this scheme, get credit for the years she has already served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to those who entered the service before 1st August, 1963, there was some difference between them and women national teachers in so far as the secondary teacher could on marriage, if she so wished, continue to teach, or if she broke her service, could return to teaching if she had not accepted a marriage gratuity.  Under the 1951 scheme, a secondary teacher <Col N="303" /> could receive a marriage gratuity under certain conditions of service, and on condition that she retired on marriage and would not have the right to re-enter the scheme or re-enter the incremental salary scale.  For people who had the right to receive a marriage gratuity, and who took it, provision is made because through family circumstances, some found that they regretted excluding themselves from the further right to teach and the incremental scale.  It is provided now at conciliation that such people will be permitted to re-enter the service on the incremental salary scale on condition that they repay the marriage gratuity with compound interest of five per cent. That is all that is in the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This little piece of legislation which we have before us today looks very simple and innocuous.  So far as it goes that is so, but consequent on it and concomitant with it is the natural provision that married women would be readmitted to recognised teaching <Col N="304" /> service.  It is on that point that I feel bound to raise an issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister has explained lucidly enough the position with regard to women secondary teachers.  They are now divided into two categories: those who served before 1st August, 1963, and those who entered service thereafter. Those who entered the service after 1st August, 1963, have now no claim to a marriage gratuity.  They either carry on teaching or give it up, and marriage does not affect the issue one way or the other.  Those who served before 1st August, 1963, have the option of taking the marriage gratuity, which is a benefit under the superannuation scheme to which they have contributed.</P>
    <P>Why it is called a gratuity I do not know.  It is not really a gratuity in the sense of being a gratuitous payment, because the scheme is contributory, and consideration has been given for the payment which is made.  There is a contract, as it were, between the teacher and the Department, and the teacher, having complied with the conditions attaching to qualifying for the payment, is entitled to benefit.  The conditions are set out in paragraph 21 of the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Act, 1951. Side by side with that provision is the decision to admit women teachers who have qualified for a marriage gratuity to recognised teaching service. That is to say, on the one hand a teacher must retire&mdash;that is one of the conditions that has to be complied with&mdash;and on the other hand she is admissible to recognised teaching service, entitled to an incremental salary, and entitled to become a member of the superannuation scheme.  Now, by virtue of the amendment which the Minister has introduced, she is entitled, under certain conditions, to have her pre-marriage service recognised for pension and other superannuation purposes.</P>
    <P>It is at this point that the question arises that concerns me.  It is at this point I suppose that the Minister, the Department and I part company.  I do not think we are agreed as to what we mean by retirement in this case.  It must be remembered that the marriage <Col N="305" /> gratuity falls to be paid as soon as the conditions prerequisite to qualifying for it have been fulfilled, that is to. say, on the day after the marriage of a lady teacher.  If any interval has elapsed between the date of retirement and the marriage, that gratuity falls to be paid.  Cases have arisen in which teachers, having complied with all the formalities, retired in good faith from teaching and having got married&mdash;in good faith also, I hope&mdash;and having applied in the ordinary way to the Department, have had their marriage gratuity withheld by the Department.</P>
    <P>The people in these cases had gone to new homes, to new areas of residence and at the time of their marriage had no intention of resuming teaching. I do not know whether their intention not to resume teaching for a few years had any bearing on their claims: I mention this only because they went to new areas of residence, were got at by managers of schools in their new areas because of their experience and were prevailed on to resume teaching. They took up this teaching before the gratuities were paid.  When the fact of their having become re-employed came to the notice of the Department, the Department withheld the gratuities on the ground that they had failed to comply with the provisions of the scheme which compelled them to retire on marriage.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, representations were made by the Association of Secondary Teachers, and correspondence was entered into between these teachers and the Department.  As a result of that correspondence, a new term came to light in which the Department described their retirement as &ldquo;nominal&rdquo;. The phrase &ldquo;nominal retirement&rdquo; does not occur in the pension scheme and I submit that retirement for any period is sufficient qualification under the scheme and that the attempt by the Minister and the Department to introduce the idea of nominal, as opposed to real, retirement is an unwarranted and gratuitous assumption on the part of the Minister of the function of interpreting a statutory instrument to suit his own devices.</P>
    <P>The scheme does not say that the <Col N="306" /> period of retirement may not be nominal.  It says nothing at all about it.  It says one of the prerequisites or conditions governing qualification for a gratuity is that the teacher retires not later than the date of her marriage. The interpretation of it by the Minister and the Department would not be, I submit, upheld by any court of justice. If the gratuity had been paid before the fact of the re-employment of these teachers became known to the Department as it really should have been, I hesitate to think the Department would dare to claim a refund of that gratuity from the teachers, but of course the machinery of the Department is so slow and cumbersome, particularly in the matter of disbursements of any kind, that the fact of the re-employment of these teachers had become known and the Department withheld payment and have persisted in this attitude, despite representations on behalf of these teachers.</P>
    <P>There are two cases in question.  In one, the teacher resumed teaching on the day the school reopened in September and her appointment dated only from that day.  In the second case, the teacher did not resume for a few days, or a week perhaps, after the school had re-opened.  In both cases, there was a lapse of at least five weeks in which the teachers were out of benefit as teachers.  They were actually in retirement for that period.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly about this matter. I feel the attitude of the Minister is against all principles of equity and is out of step with the customary practice obtaining in ordinary business circles as between employer and employee.  It is the negation of democratic practice for a Minister to try to enforce his interpretation of a clause in a statutory instrument in such a way as to create hardship for people who have done all that was asked of them in the matter of qualifying for benefits to which they had subscribed.</P>
    <P>Our legal advice on this matter is that the interpretation we have been putting on it, namely, that retirement at any time of the year for any period is sufficient, would be upheld by any court.  I dislike the idea of having recourse to such measures in matters of this kind, but I am so convinced <Col N="307" /> of the justice of the claim that I feel I must urge my colleagues in the Association of Secondary Teachers to proceed as far as they can in the matter of securing the benefits they consider are just for those people.  Of course, I hope this course will not be necessary, that the Minister will see the reasonableness of the case I have made and will, without further delay, authorise the payment of the outstanding gratuities.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa cuidiú le gach a bhí le rá ag an Seanadóir Ó Conalláin i dtaobh aoisliúntas na mban-mhuinteóirí seo.  Tá sé an-dheacair na píosaí beaga de scéimeanna a thuiscint agus a chur le céile in aon scéim amháin, ach tá sé in am féachaint isteach sa cheist.</P>
      <P>I should like to support what Senator Ó Conalláin has said.  The place is littered with pieces of legislation dealing with pension schemes for secondary teachers, vocational teachers and national teachers and the time has come when we should consider that situation so that this legislation may be codified and some unity established between the three branches of teaching.</P>
      <P>For example, up to 1944, the national teachers had a contributory scheme.  The Minister removed the contributory condition and now these teachers enjoy a pension scheme to which they make no contribution.  The secondary teachers and vocational teachers must still contribute, for some mysterious reason.  There should be one pension scheme applicable to all three branches of the profession.  This would ensure mobility within the profession. This is most desirable because, as things are, national teachers are kept within the scope of national teaching. If they move out they lose certain rights which they have built up and also must begin at the bottom of the scale for secondary or vocational teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, if a Doctor of Science teaching in an eminent college were put teaching sixth class in a national school, he would have to be classified as an unqualified or untrained teacher. <Col N="308" /> It does not make sense.  The Department should arrange that there will be one teaching profession with mobility within it, everybody carrying the rights he has built up within his own branch. As teachers, we are working within a department&mdash;why all this mystery?&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the remarks of the Leas-Chathaoirleach. I pointed out that this is a further piece of legislation which contributes as it were to the mystery which exists of the small pieces of legislation. Senator Ó Conalláin has already made the point very convincingly that codification in these matters is absolutely essential.</P>
      <P>Coming to the particular point as advised by the Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator Ó Conalláin pointed out the injustice that can be done by this piecemeal legislation and we have a particular case which will be of interest to secondary teachers also in the matter of retirement gratuities on marriage.  The Minister said it will be necessary if a teacher opts to regain credit for pensionable purposes ultimately to make a refund of the gratuity at the rate of five per cent compound interest.  It is a long time since we have heard the term &ldquo;compound interest&rdquo;.  It is a most savage imposition on anybody to have to pay compound interest on a refund at the rate of five per cent.  Simple interest at five per cent is a heavy interest but why should the Department dig up this five per cent compound interest which is a complete disincentive to a person endeavouring to reclaim credit for pensionable purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of a person who would opt as a national teacher to repay the gratuity at compound interest but who for domestic reasons had to leave with her family to go to Canada after making a considerable contribution on the basis of five per cent compound interest. When she pointed out this matter to the Department and said: &ldquo;I cannot now enjoy the credit I have been <Col N="309" /> seeking to recover on the basis of five per cent compound interest because I shall be living in Canada from now on and I should like an opportunity of getting back the money I have refunded&rdquo;, the answer was &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Senator Ó Conalláin may be interested in that.</P>
    <P>This case, I think, could not stand up in law.  The Department say this money is not recoverable.  I should like to alert Senator Ó Conalláin in that regard and point out the type of injustice which can ensue from this kind of piecemeal legislation and drawing up of plans.</P>

Ach ní dóigh liom gur féidir liom ghéilleadh don dara moladh.  Rud contabharthach go leor atá ann agus b'fhéidir go dtuigfí níos fearr é dá gcuirfinn san teanga eile é.</P>
      <P>I accept that it might be desirable to put the various pieces of legislation under one cover.  It would take much time and work but I shall have that examined.  I do not think I can accept the second suggestion.  We now have an agreed arrangement at conciliation which gives women teachers the right, if they were in the service before the 1st of August, to retire and get a marriage gratuity.  Having done that, they have a new right of being allowed to return to the service by repaying the gratuity.  If this scheme is to be worked in a way which would meet the cases it was intended to meet, that is the type of person who had genuinely retired and found through incapacity for work of her husband that she had to return to teaching again, we should give the chance of being able to repay the gratuity as is done in this agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of time over which you will allow this to be done is to be determined by the Minister.  If the Minister says you must pay it back before you start teaching or in a short time, this could cause considerable hardship in the cases it was intended to meet.  On the other hand, if you <Col N="310" /> give a long period for repayment the person could retire for two days and get a loan at a certain rate, which would not be available through the bank, to be repaid over several years. It would be a device whereby a person could retire, get a gratuity and get back into service and have a loan to be paid back over as many years as the Minister would determine.  But that determination would be for all teachers.</P>
    <P>In actual fact, the teachers who were mentioned by Senator Ó Conalláin as having returned were in active service again when the question of refunding the gratuity came up.  It was quite obvious they had returned to the service and must, therefore, repay the gratuity.  Why give it to them if you are going to make them repay it unless you are giving it as a loan?  It was a new conception of a marriage gratuity. I do not agree in that interpretation of what was agreed to at conciliation. If you have one interpretation and I have another, you are entitled to ask somebody else to decide between us but my intention is that secondary teachers in this matter should be brought into line with national teachers.  That is my interpretation of the matter.  The actual amount of interest is laid down in many schemes and was agreed to at conciliation.</P>
    <P>On the question of the legislation being piecemeal, the very nature of legislation makes it so because this is a new thing that has been done and if we had one general legislation and no room for small pieces to come, we could not have these improvements. So we will have to have amendments to schemes from time to time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dónall Ó Conalláin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister implied that repayment of the marriage gratuity would be a preliminary to recognition of return to service.  I do not think that is contemplated anywhere in the scheme.  Surely a teacher could retire, get the marriage gratuity and remain out for a year or more, come back to teaching, start again at the point on the incremental scale at which she left off and not pay back the gratuity unless she wanted her pre-marriage service to be recognised for <Col N="311" /> superannuation purposes?  That is the only point in repaying the gratuity and it has no reference to recognition of service.  So that the point the Minister has made&mdash;what is the use in paying them the gratuity if they will have to return it immediately?&mdash;has no relevance at all, I suggest.  The whole thing is a question of did they retire or did they not and that is a matter of fact and the submission I make in the case is that the teachers did retire and there are documents in the Department to that effect that they did retire; they were not teaching for a certain period; their appointments to new posts and in new schools, mind, was after a lapse of several weeks. Therefore, I think the Minister's reply to this is not relevant at all to the issue.</P>

    <Title>Subsidy for Losses on Stall-Fed Cattle&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichealPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That in view of the heavy losses sustained by farmers who stall-fed cattle for beef last winter, Seanad Éireann is of opinion that the Government should introduce a system of subsidy or deficiency payments to offset similar losses this winter and thus ensure an adequate supply of such cattle for the home and export markets.</P>
      <P>If this motion had been taken when first put on the Order Paper, the substance of it would have more relevance than today; but even at this late stage perhaps some good may come of it, and what I mean by some good is that the Minister, having heard the arguments in its favour, will accept the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there is a good argument in favour of farmers who stall-feed cattle <Col N="313" /> having some form of protection against such severe losses as they experienced last year, and in the event of a similar collapse in beef prices next January, February and March if some scheme were devised whereby their losses will be met, it will be an incentive to them to stall-feed again this year.</P>
    <P>My personal opinion is that last year's disastrous beef trade will not be repeated, but there is not much use in my saying to farmers, who got their fingers badly burned this year: &ldquo;Do not worry.  Beef will be a good trade early in the New Year.&rdquo;  Such an utterance from me would carry little, if any, weight, and even if it did, in the unlikely event of my prediction not working out as hoped for, I would find myself a very unpopular man in the eyes of many farmers.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Minister, his position would be different because if he felt as I do, he could say to the farmers: &ldquo;Stall-feed your usual number of cattle and if my prediction is not right, I will see to it that you will not lose money from your efforts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am firmly convinced that the Minister could make such a statement and find himself not paying any subsidy or deficiency payment; but such an assurance would make a big difference to the numbers of cattle being stall-fed for beef.  I can assure the Minister that there are not one quarter the number of cattle being stall-fed at this moment that there were this time last year.  If that position is not changed, there will be a definite scarcity of beef for the home and export markets. Such an occurrence could also have a serious effect on the store trade because, if the numbers of cattle that would ordinarily be fed for beef come on the market as stores in January, February and March, the result might easily have a depressing effect on the store trade by virtue of the law of supply and demand.</P>
    <P>Another serious effect deriving from a beef scarcity would be tremendous unemployment in meat factories.  I know the management of many of these factories are very perturbed about the present situation, not to <Col N="314" /> mention the unfortunate people who may find themselves unemployed.</P>
    <P>On the head of the Minister, and on his head alone, lies the responsibility. He cannot say he was not warned or that the seriousness of the position was not pointed out to him. I believe that even at this late stage if the Minister accepts this motion all my forebodings could be averted.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that the Minister does not like subsidies.  I know and I admit that the last time a subsidy was paid on cattle that it was abused.  But I also think that the scheme lent itself to abuses.  From that experience I am sure the Minister with the help of his advisers could, if the occasion necessitated it, devise a scheme that would be watertight.  I would suggest that whatever payment that would have to be paid, if any, should be paid direct to the farmer who feeds the cattle. Over the past nine or ten years we have built up a very useful dollar-earning business selling prime beef to the American forces in Europe.  If the supply of stall-feds is not available, as I predict, this very useful trade may be lost.  There are other countries in Europe that would be only too pleased to see us unable to fulfil the requirements of this valuable market.  Have no doubt, if we fall down and they step in, it might well be that we would never regain our foothold.</P>
    <P>I know on previous occasions the suppliers to this market have lost money and plenty of it to fulfil their contracts, and I know on many occasions they have tendered for contracts knowing they were going to lose money, but wanting to keep their grip on the market.  If the situation that I predict arises it does not matter if they are prepared to lose money or not to stay in the market, they will not have the supplies to meet their requirements. That in itself creates a serious position.</P>
    <P>In today's market, the average price for beef was around £6 5s. 0d. per cwt.  I believe that anyone who stall-feeds cattle for around two months would require to get £1 per cwt more than the purchase price to meet his expenses.  If the Minister would take <Col N="315" /> today's prices as a basis and say that as and from 1st February he will make up the difference, if the average price is not up to £7 5s. per cwt., such a guarantee would give encouragement to farmers.  They would at least feel that even if they wouldn't get much profit they wouldn't lose money.</P>
    <P>Other sections of the farming industry have guaranteed minimum prices for their produce&mdash;the milk producer, the pig producer and the wheat grower &mdash;and while they may at times be dissatisfied with the minimum guaranteed price they at least know where they are going.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why our producers of beef should be left to compete with Government-subsidised Yugoslavian beef and cheap meat-producing countries like the Argentine, Uruguay, Australia and New Zealand.  Too often, we have to sell our beef for half nothing in Great Britain when, as frequently happens, these importing countries make nothing better than a dumping ground of the English meat market.</P>
    <P>What amazes me is that foreigners can come to this country and get all the money they want for industry&mdash; building hotels, and so on&mdash;but when the unfortunate farmers ask for something such as the substance of this motion, when they ask for what is no more than a guarantee to help them to stay in business, all kinds of excuses are made as to why they are not entitled to get it.  The moneys given to foreign industrialists are meant to create employment, yet, if no beef cattle are available for export next February, March and April, many thousands will find themselves unemployed, not alone from the meat factories, but from the allied industries.  Surely that reason in itself justifies acceptance of this motion.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I appeal strongly to the Minister to accept this motion.  If he does, he will find himself a more popular Minister for Agriculture than he thought he ever would be.  I sincerely believe it will not cost the Exchequer one shilling but acceptance of the motion will give the farmers an <Col N="316" /> incentive to produce the goods for which I believe there will be a ready market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephQuigley" hpid="Mr. Quigley Mr. Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding Senator Prendergast's motion, I feel it is unnecessary to emphasise in Seanad Éireann the vital importance of cattle exports to the national economy.  In this connection there are a few points which I should like to make.  Owing to the fluctuations of prices on the British beef market, Irish farmers may find themselves feeding their beef cattle over the next three or four months at a net loss as I regret to say happened last year.  This is something which our farmers are powerless to prevent.  Without wishing to offend those who practise other systems of farming, I believe that the men who practise mixed farming and who provide themselves with home produced fodder for winter feeding are the farmers who should get every consideration. As such, they are entitled to an assurance from the Minister for Agriculture that they will receive a reasonable reward for their investment and their labour.</P>
      <P>From information I have received, I understand that in most other European countries farm exports are subsidised in one form or another.  Here, our producers of export beef have to contend, unaided, with competition from the Argentine, the Commonwealth and other countries, not to mention the growing output from home producers in Britain.  In my own county of Laois, numerous small farmers bought in store cattle in the autumn of 1962 at over £6 per cwt. and, after feeding those animals through an exceptionally severe winter, they had to sell them the following March and April at less than they cost.  This result, following on three successive bad harvests, has left many of them in a position where they cannot afford to risk similar losses in the current season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope and trust that no subsidy will in fact be necessary this coming season.  It is quite possible that farmers may obtain a reasonable return, but I feel strongly that they should be cushioned against a repetition of <Col N="317" /> last year's collapse in beef prices.  If the necessary machinery is not put in motion by the Government to safeguard the farmers engaged in this important export, there is a real danger that it may diminish alarmingly in the years ahead and the resulting loss to the country would be difficult to overestimate.</P>
    <P>Apart from our export trade, any falling off in beef production over the winter months would undoubtedly have serious repercussions on employment at home.  If our meat factories were starved of supplies from January to April, thousands of Irish workers would be disemployed, and many ancillary industries would also suffer.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is alive to the dangers to which I have referred. Every year he has to make provision to safeguard other farm exports and those who produce them.  There is no logical reason why the mixed tillage farmer who is also the producer of winter beef, should be denied the protection which is given throughout the year to other sections.  I shall not refer to the vast amounts which are being laid out to encourage industrial exports&mdash;sometimes with very poor return.  Here, we have one of the oldest exports, based entirely on native raw materials and employing many thousands of our countrymen.  Surely it cannot be left unaided to compete with the subsidised product of other countries?  It would not be fair treatment and it certainly would not be good for the national economy.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister who, I am sure, is familiar with the problems of the feeding farmer, to give serious consideration to this motion, and I would also appeal to the House to support a proposal which is of very real importance to our whole economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is admitted by all people in this country at present that our cattle industry is our major industry and that the prosperity of our people, irrespective of whether they live in town or city, depends upon what our farmers and their labourers are able to export profitably <Col N="318" /> from the land of Ireland.  The stall-feeding of cattle provides more jobs and more work for Irish farmers and their labourers than any other branch of agriculture.</P>
      <P>Millions are voted every year for industrial projects&mdash;many of them perhaps of doubtful value: nevertheless, the money is voted.  One of the arguments always used by any Government is that those industries give employment and for that reason both this House and the Dáil have always been anxious to vote the money.  Here is one of our oldest industries and it gives great employment.  When we vote money for industry, we vote it in millions&mdash;£4 million, £5 million or £6 million.  Many economists and other people think that such money would be much better spent in other directions&mdash;for example, if it were spent in giving subsidies or by way of a deficiency payment in respect of the stall-feeding of our cattle.  We have all the raw materials at home.  We can grow the crops for the stall-feeding and give employment to the people growing them and to the people minding and feeding the cattle.</P>
      <P>We believe that a subsidy should be given.  Another good reason why a subsidy or deficiency payment should be provided is that it is mostly the small farmers, the medium-sized farmers and the tillage farmers who indulge in stall-feeding.  Those people are the backbone of the country.  They are paying their due share of taxation but at present they are getting less than their share of the State subsidies being paid to farmers.  Forty per cent of the farmers have less than 50 acres and the proportion of the various crops and produce receiving special assistance, which were accounted for by farmers of less than 50 acres, has fallen significantly over the past ten years.  Those small farmers and tillage farmers, as I said, have less than 50 acres and in 1960 they received only 19 per cent of the total wheat subsidy paid.</P>

      <P>I have no intention of engaging in such a discussion. All I want to say is that these people only received 19 per cent of the wheat subsidy and 21 per cent of the barley subsidy and that they feed the corn to their stores.  I think I am entitled to make the point that instead of selling corn on the market and getting their share of the subsidy, they feed it to their stall cattle and then walk the cattle off the farm to the market and by doing that, are losing their due share of the subsidy.</P>
      <P>Another good reason why we should have this payment is that if we are to achieve the targets set for 1970, something will have to be done to keep the people on the land.  It might be no harm to point out to the Minister that if we take the average price of cattle over the years, we find that in 1952, for three-year-old store bullocks a man got £50 and for a three-year-old fat bullock he got £56 6s., or £6 6s. more for store-fed cattle.  That trend has deteriorated over the years and if we take 1959, we find that he got £62 13s. for a three-year-old store bullock and £64 7s. for a three-year-old fat bullock, so that he had only £1 14s. in the difference.  We all know that it deteriorated further last year and any man who store-fed cattle lost anything from £1 to £2 per head.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The Senator would know the figures better than I <Col N="320" /> do, but we have not got the official statistics.  If we take the figures for 1960, we find that in that year 542,270 cattle were exported, for which we received £33.6 million; the total number of fat cattle exported were 220,163, for £14.6 million.  In that year almost half the cattle exported were sent out as fat cattle.  In 1961, there were 722,227 cattle exported for £44.1 million, of which 299,338 were fat cattle, representing £18.6 million. The percentage had dropped from 50 to 41.</P>
      <P>In 1962 there were 575,260 cattle exported for £36.2 million and only 136,765 fat cattle, representing £9.9 million.  In other words, only one quarter of the cattle exported were fat cattle which meant that in 1960, 50 per cent were fat cattle, in 1961, 41 per cent, and in 1962, only 25 per cent.  That is a dangerous trend and one which is going to affect the economy of the country unless something is done to deal with it in the near future.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach was reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> on 28th February, 1963, as saying that the farming industry is the key to the nation's welfare.  We have all recognised that for a long time.  I believe something should be done for those people who are stall-feeding cattle and accordingly support the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this motion and what has already been said by Senator Prendergast, Senator Quigley and Senator L'Estrange.  The store feeding of cattle, whether in stalls or in open sheds, is a very important factor especially in tillage areas.  For generations, it has been the practice and has been considered good husbandry for farmers, large and small, to put in their stores in late autumn and stall-feed them during the winter months. It is still the most economic method of producing beef and if our farmers are to become economically efficient, as they are told they must in order to survive entry into the Common Market, we must protect and foster this practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has already been said, farmers <Col N="321" /> who stall fed cattle last winter sustained heavy losses.  The average price last autumn for beef cattle was 110/- per cwt. liveweight.  The average price for the same type of cattle during the spring of 1955 was 166/- per cwt. liveweight.  These figures&mdash;166/- per cwt. in 1955 and 110/- this year&mdash;speak for themselves.  No other section of the community is expected, I submit, to live and survive on a declining income. Over the past eight, nine, or ten years, farmers' incomes have been considerably reduced and surely the time has come now when some measure of protection must be afforded them.</P>
    <P>The stallfeeding of cattle is a fundamental part of our agricultural industry, particularly in the midlands where there is mixed farming.  This type of farming calls for the highest degree of husbandry.  Where the land is intensively cultivated, there is a high labour potential.  A great deal of manpower is needed.  The production of farmyard manure helps to fertilise the land.  The basic raw materials for the land are home-produced.  We all know, of course, that selling at the store stage yields the farmer a quicker return.  The conversion to beef is by far the most economical exercise, especially for the home market.  Surely it is vital that we should preserve this branch of our agricultural industry?</P>
    <P>This motion does not ask merely for another subsidy to be granted to the farmers; it calls on the Government to fix and guarantee a basic price for fat stall-fed cattle in order to ensure that the farmers will continue to produce prime quality beef without being at a loss, as they were last year, as they were in the spring of 1962, in 1960, and in 1958.  Some time ago, the Minister announced a subsidy of £15 on heifer calves.  This will lead, I believe, to large numbers of cow heifers being offered for sale on the beef market.  These will be three-to four-year olds.  They will be prime beef.  The farmers, however, offering these animals for sale will get only the price paid for the old stripper cow. That will be grossly unfair.  It will be unfair for the farmers to get this scandalously low price for prime quality beef.  The price paid for cow heifers <Col N="322" /> should be the same as that paid for prime beef or a new scale should be introduced for this particular type of beef.  There is no comparison whatever between beef from a 3½-to-4-year old cow heifer and the old stripper sold for canning.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept the motion.  I urge the Minister to take steps to compensate that section of our community which has received less than any other section for its labours over the past eight or nine years.  The motion deserves the Minister's most serious consideration.  If trade is good this year, there will be no call on the Exchequer, but, at the same time, it is important that those farmers, and the numbers engaged are pretty big, who engage in this particular form of husbandry should receive some measure of protection and have some knowledge that they will be properly rewarded for their labours.</P>
    <P>There is talk now of a ninth round of wage increases for other sections of the community.  The farming community have not yet benefited from the fifth round, not to talk about the ninth round coming on now.  Most people agree that the farmers are the backbone of the nation's economy.  Nevertheless, the farmers are not getting their fair share of the national cake. One wonders if those who agree that they are the backbone of our economy are sincere.  This is a rather modest motion.  All it asks for is a guaranteed floor price for this very important industry.</P>

      <P>Listening to the speeches in this motion, it occurred to me that there is just no knowing all the money a Minister can handle, dispose of and distribute&mdash;if he has it.  There is no knowing, too, the extent to which he might be invited by one source or another to make himself popular by acceding to all the requests for money.  But even if the Minister, any Minister, were in a position to accede to all the requests <Col N="323" /> made to him for money, no one can prophesy that he would, in fact, achieve what Senator Prendergast has suggested he would achieve, namely, become the most popular man in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Let us for a moment now consider this motion in association with the whole cattle industry.  We find ourselves under constant pressure to support the cow, to support the milk producer, to give him a better price for his milk; the case he makes is that, if it were not for the fact that he is so industrious in his particular effort, we would have no store cattle trade, we would have no fat cattle trade, and we would have no meat processing industry.  I could never find myself in disagreement with that line of thought. I could always see sense in it and I always liked to go along with it as far as possible.  But here is a major section of the agricultural industry that has always stood on its own feet.  I know you can never be positive about the future, but it would appear that the prospects for this major section of agriculture are reasonably bright.</P>

      <P>Yet no cattle were stall fed this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that. The case has been made that stall-feeding of cattle was not a profitable occupation last winter.  I know that. I never saw a time in the cattle trade, whether it was stores or fats, when there was not a period of uncertainty now and then.  If you look at the early months of 1963, you find the explanation of what brought about the tremendous fall in these prices&mdash; increased killings of British home-fed cattle and increased imports from Argentina and Yugoslavia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephQuigley" hpid="Mr. Quigley Mr. Quigley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>At a later stage in the spring, you had store prices improving and, in fact, becoming quite high.  As store prices improved and continued to hold firm for a long period, exports of fat cattle declined.  Store prices started to ease at the end of September <Col N="324" /> and continued to decline up to very recently&mdash;now they appear to have improved somewhat.  The tendency since September has been for fat cattle exports to improve.</P>
      <P>Here is what I would invite those interested in this subject to think of: just trace the store and beef animal from the day of its birth.  Think of what Senator McDonald said in regard to the recent scheme introduced to encourage the production of more livestock; associate that with the efforts being made to increase the carrying capacity of our land.  Think of the man who produces a calf for store purposes and encourage him or some other farmer to get into the business and produce more cattle.  Then come to the Seanad and say &ldquo;We want a subsidy on beef also&rdquo;.  It is all very well to make a case.  I know Senators and others can use all sorts of arguments about eighth, ninth and tenth rounds and all the rest of it.  But apply yourselves intelligently to what we are being asked to do here.  We have price supports for bacon, barley, wheat and a number of other commodities. So far as butter is concerned, we are obliging our own consumers here to pay high prices for their butter.  In addition the taxpayer is making a contribution to dispose of the surplus butter.  This joint effort on the part of the consumer and taxpayer is designed to improve the whole cattle trade.  Yet this proposal is asking the Government to provide a subsidy in this case also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the suggestion is being made because there is unevenness between the store and the fat beast, then we have to think of the store cattle arrangement secured with the British Government, under which we got for these animals, when they were fattened in Britain for three months, a price equivalent to the British home price less 3/6d. per cwt.  Later, when the first six of the Twenty Six counties became attested, the British agreed to remove that differential of 3/6d. and enable store cattle from these areas, when fattened for three months in Britain, to get the British home price. That arrangement has been extended since many other countries have <Col N="325" /> become attested, all our store exports being now attested, and we claim that has been a tremendous advantage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichealPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>That has nothing to do with the beef trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it contended that having obtained this advantage for our store cattle, the two types of trade must be in parity at all times?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichealPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking anything of the kind.  The Minister has misinterpreted the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am examining the proposal intelligently.  I am saying it would be unreasonable to ask the taxpayer, simply because of a situation which arises at a particular time, to subsidise some scheme so as to ensure that there would be no risks and no loss in respect of cattle.  Whether the farmer is in stores or beef or whatever line it may be, although the overall picture may be satisfactory for the future, there will always be these slight upheavals and these tendencies showing, so that the store producer will benefit in one instance and the beef producer will not fare so well, and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
      <P>These inequalities have arisen in the past and will arise in the future and may favour beef to the detriment of the store.  Do we not all know the factors that influence store prices? Looking at the figures for exports, say, over a period of ten years, you will find that in one year there is a very small export of store cattle.  On the other hand it will be seen that in fats the shipments have been heavy and the killings have been heavy.  The next year it will be the reverse, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have met the trade, both those interested in the dead-meat side of it and those interested in exporting fat cattle on the hoof and we have discussed these matters very fully.  It is only natural that interests such as those should make demands and look for the removal of what they regard as inequalities and which would of course, be beneficial to themselves.  I am not blaming them for that, but, as I say, I do not believe it is possible to eliminate the degree of risk that <Col N="326" /> prevails and I do not think a Government or a Department could be expected to devise a system at public expense that would ensure the elimination of these inequalities.</P>
    <P>I have looked at the figures showing the killings in the factories.  In 1960 and 1961, the killings were exceptionally high because during those two years we had to provide a subsidy due to the existence of a problem that arose from our efforts to eliminate disease.  In 1960, 1961, 1962 and so far in 1963, the killings are fairly substantial. They may not be just as high now as they were in 1960 and 1961 but they are fairly high.  This is an excellent trade, I admit, giving good employment, which is something a Minister and a Government would not be unmindful of.  However, there are no indications that I can see that this trade is not capable of continuing profitably.  It has been said that these concerns have often been forced to quote prices that are uneconomic from their point of view.  I am sure those engaged in that trade are keen businessmen and will try to secure contracts to meet all that.  Taking it all in all, they, too, must carry the risks the producer carries and they will have to take those risks.  They may not take them to the same extent as the producer does but I am sure there is no business of any consequence in the country where such risks have not to be faced.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of accepting this motion.  As I said at the outset, it is amazing the enthusiasm some Senators and public men can display in asking Governments and Ministers to spend money while showing such a tremendous reluctance to provide it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask a question? The Minister mentioned that he was reluctant to ask the taxpayers to contribute in this respect because they were compelled to pay a high price for butter and also to contribute towards the economic export of butter. Is he not also aware that the farmers pay 50 per cent of the cost of selling butter in foreign countries and that they also contribute 50 per cent of the cost&mdash;&mdash;</P>

All it asks is that in the event of a disaster in the beef trade as happened last spring, the Minister will step in and cushion the farmers against loss. In his opening remarks he said there was no knowing what money would be available if Ministers wanted to do this, that or the other thing.  That is true.  There is no knowing what money is available to different Ministers for grants to foreigners to build colossal hotels, and to industries&mdash;half of which are going bankrupt&mdash;but when the farmer wants money, there is none for him.</P>

We are not asking for money except in the event&mdash;remember that: in the event&mdash;of a recurrence of the disastrous situation of last year when farmers lost £20 apiece in many cases on store-fed cattle.  After that colossal loss, farmers are not stall-feeding this year.  The point I am making is that in the event of such a situation recurring, the effect on the meat factories&mdash;I just mention them in passing&mdash;and on the employment given in these factories will be disastrous. If the Minister would only say to the House and the farmers: &ldquo;Look; I do not believe there will be a bad beef trade, but if there is, we will give some help or some protection,&rdquo; I would be satisfied, and I would call that acceptance of the motion, but otherwise I am not satisfied.</P>
