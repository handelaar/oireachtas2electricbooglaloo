      <P>Tá leathchumha orainn i mbliana ag plé an Bhille seo toisc gan na Meastacháin ar fad a bheith pléite ag an Teach eile. Ar ndó, bhí caoi againn ar na Meastacháin a bhreithniú agus ár dtuairimí a chumadh in a dtaobh agus mar a chéile agus cuid mhaith eile de na daoine anseo, is ar Mheastachán an Roinn Oideachais is mó a thug mise m'aire agus b'údar áthais liom a fheiceáil go raibh méadú ar an Meastachán sin.  Ach caithfidh mé a rádh go mba údar díomá liom a laghad a bhí an méadú sin.</P>
      <P>Bhí an oiread sin cainte anuraidh ann faoin méid ba ghá an córas oideachais a fheabhsú agus a fhorbairt agus a chur ar chomh-chéim le tíorthaí eile, nárbh ionadh liom dá mbéadh an Rialtas nó an Roinn sin ag iarraidh £10 miliúin bhreise i mbliana ach ní mar sin atá.  Níl méadú ann ach an méadú a thagann leis an bhfás nádúrtha atá faoin oideachas le blianta anuas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is mór an trua liomsa gan an ráiteas bliaintiúil a bheith tugtha ag an Aire Oideachais sar ar tháinig an Bille seo ós ár gcomhair.  Tá sé taréis an oiread sin coiníní a tharraingt as an hata le cúpla ráithe anuas narbh ionadh liom cúpla ceann eile a theacht as dá mbeadh caoi aige a intinn a nochtadh don Dáil.  Ba mhaith liom a fhios a <Col N="1578" /> bheith agam cén dul chun cinn atá déanta maidir lena pleananna agus an fhorbairt atá déanta maidir leis na pleananna atá fógartha aige cheana. Mar atá an scéal, táimid, mar a déarfá, ag tabhairt ar dtuairimí <i>in vacuo.</i></P>
    <P>Bhí de léir-mheas ar an Roinn Oideachais le blianta anuas go raibh sé ró-thámhach ró-fhaiteach ró-réidhchúiseach, ró-choimeádach, sean-bhean chríonna Shráid Mhaolbhríde gan beatha, gan beocht, ach caithfidh mé ar an ócáid seo a thréaslú leis an Aire gur léirigh sé i mbliana nach raibh an tsean-bhean críonna seargtha, calctha ar fad.  Thionscnaigh sé scéimeanna i mbliana nár mhór misneach chuca, nár mhór dian-smaoineadh agus pleanáil chruinn.  Níl bliain ó shoin baileach ó thug sé céim ar aghaidh ar mhaithe le teagaisc agus foghlaim na Gaeilge sna scoileanna agus ar mhaithe leis an dteanga a bheofhorbairt.</P>
    <P>Táim ag tagairt don cheapachán a rinne sé tuairim is bliain ó shoin tré shagart oirearc céimiúil a cheapadh ina chómhairleoir don Roinn Oideachais. Nuair a bhéas an taighde agus an réiteach is gá déanta ag an sagart sároilte sin, tig linn bheith ag súil go dtosnófar ar deireadh thiar ar fheabhas cinnte a chur ar mhúineadh na Gaeilge agus ar mhódhanna nua teagaisc a thabhairt isteach sna scoileanna, agus go dtiocfaidh máistreacht ar an dteanga don aois scoile as seo amach.  Ar ndóigh, ní rud é sin a thiocfaidh ar an bpointe.  Caithfimíd fanacht leis ach is cruthú dúinne é go bhfuil an intinn ceart ag an Aire chun a ghnótha fhéin, agus go bhfuil tuiscint aige don laige a bhí sa scéal agus gur thug sé caol díreach ar an laige sin a leigheas.</P>
    <P>Bhí caint inné ar an gcló Romhánach a thabhairt isteach agus ar an aibitir nua.  Is dóigh gur ar chómhairle an Athar Colmáin Ó hUallacháin, a thug sé an fógra sin amach do na scoileanna tosnú ar an gcló Rómhánach agus an &ldquo;h-alphabet&rdquo;, mar tugtar air, a usáid ins na scoileanna.  Ar aon chuma, guímíd rath agus séan ar an iarracht atá dhá déanamh.</P>
    <P>This move to improve the position of Irish language teaching in the schools is only one of the signs of a rejuvenation of outlook in Marlborough <Col N="1579" /> Street.  Since then, we have what has become, possibly, to be known as the Hillery Plan.  Now the Hillery Plan came in for quite a lot of criticism yesterday.  Senator Quinlan criticised it rather severely, I thought. I would not go as far as Senator Quinlan did in his criticism of it.  I see a lot more merit than he seems to see in it.  Granted it is not a panacea for all the ills of education and it was not designed to be.</P>
    <P>The Minister took note of the most glaring weaknesses in the post-primary educational structure and he set himself the objective of remedying these weaknesses.  Now, he has brought about, therefore, two major changes and the one I consider the most important was not adverted to very much at all yesterday.  It is the fact that he has opened up the cul-de-sac that was vocational education and has made an exit from it to higher education.  Heretofore, there was no outlet from the vocational school.  Now, by integrating the two systems at the intermediate stage and leaving the vocational pupil free to do the Intermediate at the end of a three-year course, he has given him equal opportunity with the secondary school pupil.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan seemed to think that the imposition of that examination on the vocational pupil was foolish, that it was impracticable, that it could not work.  Of course, there is nothing compulsory about it.  No pupil in the school need take it but it offers the opportunity to anyone who is capable of taking it and who is capable of doing the three-course subjects, of taking these subjects to that standard. It gives him the opportunity of going forward to a future which was not previously there for him.  I will say, of course, that probably a majority of the pupils who attend vocational schools will not be taking it up for various reasons.  Normally a person who is good on the practical side is not so good on the academic side and you have at least two subjects of an academic nature which have to be taken at the Intermediate level.  I welcome, at any rate, the opportunity which has been given and I consider <Col N="1580" /> it is a tremendous up-grading of the vocational schools.</P>
    <P>Now, the other aspect of education which was discussed at length here yesterday was the comprehensive school, the new type of school.  As you all know, this is intended to cater for areas that have had no educational facility of a post-primary nature up to now.  The conditions under which these could be established were adverted to here yesterday.  They serve an area within a radius of ten miles and for that reason they are going to be out of the reach of competition.  They are going to be little educational kingdoms in themselves and I doubt if there are going to be many of them, in view of the conditions laid down for their establishment.</P>
    <P>The main thing about them is that they are a departure in principle from the attitude of the State up to now in the matter of post-primary education. It is one field in which the Minister has displayed tremendous courage because he is really setting into the field of private enterprise.  Again, I would take Senator Quinlan to task on his views on this yesterday.  He said that he welcomed the attitude of the Minister in bringing education to places where it would not normally be brought by private enterprise.  At the same time, he seemed to criticise the undue interference of the Government in education.  I do not think this is undue interference because surely it is one of the principles we must accept that where private enterprise cannot do the job, then it is the function of the State to step in and do it if the social conditions demand it.</P>
    <P>These schools will not interfere in any way with the existing secondary or vocational schools.  They will be comprehensive in every sense of the word.  They will have a very wide curriculum, covering both academic and practical subjects.  The buildings, salaries and so on will be provided by the State.  I would venture to think that when these schools are established, the <i>per capita</i> costs in them will be very much greater than our current costs in the ordinary secondary schools. Therefore, I welcome these schools because they will make an incontrovertible <Col N="1581" /> case for much higher subsidisation of the existing secondary schools. We will now have the position reversed. The depressed areas will have become the privileged areas as far as education is concerned.  In order to reestablish some sort of balance, it will be imperative for the Government to make further investment in secondary education in the areas now served by private enterprise.  That is one of the reactions I see coming from these new schools.</P>
    <P>Much was said about equality of educational opportunity and that the Minister, by the establishment of these schools, was providing equality of educational opportunity.  I do not think the establishment of these schools was really intended for that, because equality of educational opportunity does not consist merely in providing schools in every area.  So long as people may be deprived of education because a fee must be paid, there is not equality of educational opportunity.  In that way, these new areas have a further privilege over areas like Dublin where there is an abundance of secondary schools but where people are precluded from availing themselves of them because of the fee-paying system.</P>
    <P>I am not one who believes that secondary education should be completely free, but there is a proposition to which we all must subscribe, that nobody should be precluded from secondary education because of means. I am afraid, even with the establishment of these new schools, unless there is very much greater subsidisation of secondary schools in the remaining areas of the country, there will still be inequality of educational opportunity.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this development in education to which I might draw attention.  Apart from the merits of this new plan as a plan, the idea of a comprehensive school has got people engaged in post-primary education thinking in terms of integration, co-ordination and co-operation. Where you had in the provincial towns secondary and vocational schools existing in a sort of cold war atmosphere, there is now the feeling abroad, as a <Col N="1582" /> result of this plan, that these schools should co-operate with one another, and I think that is actually in practice in a number of cases.  There are technical difficulties to be overcome, because we will have to bring about the position where a teacher in one category can get recognition for service in either type of school.  A great amount of overlapping which occurs, particularly in the smaller towns, could be eliminated with co-operation between the two types of schools in the same area.</P>
    <P>I have in mind one case where there is a boys' small secondary school and a vocational school.  The vocational teachers do the practical subjects in the secondary school and the secondary teachers, having done whatever is required of them in their own school, do academic subjects at night in the vocational school.  There could be a lot more of that.  It would bring the comprehensive school idea into a number of areas which would not qualify under the terms of the plan.  The Minister, therefore, deserves our sincere thanks for pointing the way to this co-operation between the various types of schools.</P>
    <P>So many aspects of the educational field are clamouring for attention&mdash; everything from the size of classes in kindergarten schools to the subsidisation of universities and the provision of schools of dentistry&mdash;that it is very difficult to make a selection of what should be discussed.  The opportunity afforded here on the Appropriation Bill is hardly adequate for a full discussion of education.  Especially in the end-of-term and eve-of-holiday atmosphere we have now, the education of the country does not get sufficient notice in this House.  Would it be possible to have a motion on educational matters put down at a time of year when business is not so heavy and probably following the discussion of the Estimate in the Dáil?  Could we have an assurance from the Leader of the House that such a motion would be taken with a view to discussing the various aspects of education and that there would be no political tinge to it at all?  Many people here are interested in various aspects of education, both as members of vocational committees and, of <Col N="1583" /> course, as parents.  They would be very anxious to have a general discussion on educational matters.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, and having regard to time limits, I should like to confine myself to one or two items relating specifically to secondary teachers&mdash;not really the most important ones but having a special relevancy at the present time.  I want first to criticise the Minister for his failure to hold consultations with the teachers before imposing on the secondary schools the new mathematics syllabus and the new science syllabus last year. It came as a complete bombshell to the teachers who read, for the first time, in the newspapers last Easter that the new syllabus was to operate in the schools as from September, 1963.  The official notice actually came on 4th April this year.  The reaction of the teachers was that this was too precipitate and that time must be given to prepare because a considerable amount of new matter was involved.  Teachers in the 50-60 years category are not too anxious for, and it is not too easy for them to accommodate themselves to new ideas without ample opportunity of preparing themselves.</P>
    <P>In view of that, consultations were held with all the recognised bodies in secondary teaching and, as one body, they approached the Minister to have the application of these new courses postponed for one year so as to give everyone an opportunity to prepare for them.  Despite the fact that that approach was unanimous, that was not done.  I must deplore in the strongest terms the attitude of the Minister in that regard.  Following that, and on demand, courses were arranged for teachers.  One would think that having imposed this new burden on the teachers who were not prepared for it, the Department would certainly have helped the teachers in every way possible to acquire the necessary knowledge in the new matter and would, therefore, subsidise the courses.</P>
    <P>Again the Minister has refused to subsidise these courses and again I must deplore that attitude.  There is every reason why the courses should be subsidised and why the teachers should <Col N="1584" /> not be asked to come to a university centre from all over the country at their own expense and to pay tuition fees to the university as is happening. They had arranged a course to accommodate 70 or 80 people but the demand was so great that they had to extend the course to take three times that number and to open another course in Cork.  That shows that the teachers are most willing and anxious to co-operate with the Minister even in the adverse circumstances of having to pay their own way through the courses and having to abandon their holiday plans in order to equip themselves for the task the Minister imposed on them.  I think the Minister has treated the teachers shabbily in this matter.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister introduced a scheme whereby in future lay teachers of science, holding a degree in science, are to be given a salary in excess of that given to teachers of ordinary subjects. Again, it is characteristic of the Minister that he wanted to achieve an objective and went the most direct way about it but possibly he did not consider all the implications involved in doing so.  He has done this in order to recruit science teachers for the schools. There is only one appeal that operates and that is the appeal of money.  He has introduced therefore a new rule whereby a teacher of science, a lay teacher&mdash;he made a distinction between lay and religious&mdash;holding a university degree in science and teaching for a certain minimum number of hours per week, will be in receipt of £150 in excess of the salary payable to the teacher of ordinary subjects.</P>
    <P>While we applaud the Minister's directness in going for this objective and his attitude towards recruiting teachers of science for the schools, I think this is really an acknowledgement of the inadequacy of the salaries paid to all teachers.  The question of the recruitment of science teachers has been a problem for some time but the question of the recruitment of foreign language teachers is an emerging problem and may be even more acute than that of the science teachers.  In a few years' time, we may have to make similar provision for that type of teacher and eventually wind up with a multiplicity of salary scales.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1585" /> That is a bad thing and the proper way to cope with the problem is to make the teaching profession attractive enough by giving sufficient to all grades of teachers to induce people to go into that profession.  It is imperative that that be done and it should be accompanied by an insistence that teachers will teach only subjects in which they have university qualifications.  This is something that has been demanded by secondary teachers generally for a long time, that their teaching be confined to subjects they have studied at university level.</P>
    <P>It is one of the marvels of our system here that a person with a degree in science only can teach English, Latin or French in the secondary school.  He is held to be qualified and is recognised because he has a primary degree.  That is one of the aspects of our secondary educational system that has evoked adverse comment on all sides.  Now that changes are being made, now that certain subjects are coming into prominence and that qualifications are being examined, it is the proper time to make a move towards taking that type of anomaly out of the system.</P>
    <P>I should like to support the plea made by Senator Brosnahan yesterday for the establishment of a research institution in education.  The only research we have at the moment is that carried out by An tAthair Ó hUallacháin who is engaged on one aspect of research for the schools.  It is highly important in any country which is taking education seriously that the Department of Education should be aware of what the educational needs are and should be able to meet them.</P>
    <P>I should like also to join with Senator Ó Maoláin in criticising the amount of time given to Irish on Telefís Éireann. It was one of the matters I raised on this debate last year and no progress has been made since then.  Some effort was made for a short time but it was given up and the position now is worse than it was 12 months ago.  With regard to the criticism made yesterday, and which received prominence in today's papers, of the cutting off of programmes at the peak point, the reason, I am given to understand, is that there is a link up with Eurovision in these <Col N="1586" /> programmes.  They are run to a split-second timing and irrespective of what is happening, they must be cut off at that time and the television authorities are not responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ó Maoláin last night criticised Telefís Éireann but I feel he should consider himself fortunate to be in a position to criticise them, for despite the fact that I have been the owner of a television set for many years and have paid the television licence fee for two successive years, I have never had the opportunity of watching Telefís Éireann in Donegal.  The people in my county are a patient people.  We realised that it would take time to provide the service throughout the country and for that reason we waited for the first year, but we are now getting a little impatient and I am justified in registering a very strong protest to the Television Authority.  I appeal to them to take immediate steps to let us see Telefís Éireann programmes and possibly we may not be too harsh on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Extra moneys are being provided in this Bill to stimulate our major industries. I hope the day is not too far distant when the Government will be in a position to provide much more money for the tourist industry.  Senator Fitzpatrick made a point about encouragement for boarding houses which I should like to support.  Our tourist potentialities are not by any means being fully exploited and we have a long way to go before this industry becomes top-heavy.  We are fortunate in that we are within 24 hours travelling distance of the greatest tourist market in the world&mdash;the industrial workers of England, Scotland and Wales.  The majority of these people would be content with good boarding houses, clean rooms and good food.  If Bord Fáilte were to encourage more of them to extend in order to cater for this market, the all-over position would be greatly improved.  In my own county, one would have to travel possibly 50 miles before one could even get overnight facilities.  On at least one occasion I have had to keep four elderly ladies in my sittingroom at night because they could not get accommodation.  I hope <Col N="1587" /> that Bord Fáilte will give this greater consideration in future.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick was concerned about the courts of justice in Donegal and mentioned a circuit court case in Letterkenny on 5th of July.  The Minister for Justice was asked about this last week and made a comprehensive statement which Senator Fitzpatrick must not have read.  I shall read the statement he made, from the Dáil debates, Volume 204, No. 8, at column 1174.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice said:</P>
      <P>On Friday, 5th July, a man named Bernard J.  McManus was sentenced at Letterkenny Circuit Court to six months imprisonment for larceny. Later on that day an application was made to me, by the solicitor in the case, that the execution of the warrant should be deferred pending my consideration of a petition against McManus' removal to Mountjoy Prison pending the hearing of a jury action against another defendant in the same case which had been adjourned until the October sessions.</P>
      <P>I became aware, also, that Bernard J. McManus had been served with a summons on 27th June to appear at Letterkenny Circuit Court on Thursday, 11th July, as a witness in a criminal case.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances and, as the law does not permit of a person being detained in a lock-up provided in a Garda Station for more than 48 hours while awaiting removal to prison on conviction, I decided to accede to the request for a temporary postponement of the execution of the warrant, pending consideration of a petition which was about to be submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may add that the petition in question was received by me on 8th July and on 9th July it was disallowed <Col N="1588" /> and on that date the Garda superintendent and the county registrar were so informed and that the law should take its course.</P>
    <P>McManus gave evidence in Letterkenny Circuit Court on 11th July and was then brought to Mountjoy Prison to serve his sentence...</P>
    <P>I see no reason why there should have been any public disquiet.  This power of mine to defer the execution of warrants has been in operation since the foundation of the State and has been exercised time and again by my predecessors and was vigorously defended in this House by Deputy MacEoin when he was Minister for Justice.  I do not propose to be stampeded out of the use of this power which is vested in me by the Oireachtas and I will continue to exercise it in appropriate cases until such time as the Oireachtas, and nobody else decides, I should not have this power.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick mentioned this case which was raised by Fine Gael in the Dáil.  The facts and the petition were presented on behalf of the defendant by his solicitor, who happens to be a Fine Gael Deputy from West Donegal.</P>

      <P>I should like to restrict my remarks to one Vote, No. 32, Secondary Education.  My feeling is that secondary education is the Cinderella of the Department of Education. We are in the midst of an industrial revolution.  We are now living in the 20th century but we are neglecting our secondary education and in doing so, we are neglecting the leaders of this country of tomorrow&mdash;the people who will be the leaders in managerial life, in professional life and in political life.</P>
      <P>The Vote for Secondary Education is £3,745,000&mdash;a comparatively large sum and an increase of £615,000 on last year&mdash;but we have to get those figures, I think, into proportion.  If we compare them with the funds spent in other countries on secondary education, they are practically infinitesimal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to pay credit here to the continued work of the Federation of Irish Lay Secondary Teachers who, as the Minister and several members of this House know, have produced a supplemental report to their previous report of last year.  The figures which I shall use are taken from the figures produced by that body whose research is a <Col N="1590" /> tremendous help to all those interested in secondary education.</P>
    <P>I think we should try to get our figures into proportion.  If we look at the <i>per capita</i> sums spent by the State in England and Wales on secondary grammar school children, over two groups&mdash;the under 15 and the over 15&mdash;we find that approximately £140 10s. 0d. per head was spent on the under 15 group and £181 was spent on the over 15 group in secondary grammar schools in England and Wales.  In secondary modern schools, of the 11 to 15 age group the sum is a bit lower&mdash;and rightly so, I think&mdash; £88 10s. 0d. per head.</P>
    <P>If we turn to the Republic, the figure per head is only £36 7s. 8d. for secondary pupils.  I think it right to compare that not so much with the secondary modern but with the secondary grammar school figures.</P>
    <P>There are terrible gaps in secondary school facilities in this country.  Senator Ó Conalláin mentioned the gaps in languages, mathematics and sciences and the gaps in getting the right types of teachers for these subjects.</P>
    <P>I very much agreed with Senator McAuliffe last night when he said that perhaps too much attention is paid to examination results&mdash;that schools and headmasters and headmistresses are too keen to measure examination results and to forget about what a child has to do after he gets his examination. I entirely support him on that and on his belief that some attention should be paid to career guidance for children while they are at school to guide them into the careers they should follow.</P>
    <P>May I suggest that perhaps the Department of Education could produce some brochure or booklet or some guidance to students leaving school as to the careers open to them that might be available to all secondary school children throughout the country?  Possibly that might be followed up at some later stage by the encouragement of the establishment of a career master or mistress, part of whose duties would be the guidance of children on leaving school because, as Senator McAuliffe said yesterday, so many children leaving school have no <Col N="1591" /> idea of what they are suited for.  A little preliminary guidance would be of tremendous help to them so that they might then have some opportunity of searching out the avenues which they are to follow later.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, examination results are a yardstick and though Senator McAuliffe may be right to say we pay too much attention to them, they are a yardstick of the results of the educational system.  Let us look at some of the figures in Table 13 of the second report.  I do not want to bore the House with figures but I want to stress a couple of basic figures which are indicative of the standard of results which we are getting and which are not good enough.</P>
    <P>If we equate A level passes in GCE in England with honours in Leaving Certificate in Ireland, I think we get a fairly fair comparison.  We can take A level passes at the same time in Northern Ireland.  Let us look at those figures for French.  Take an age group of 17 to 18 in England and Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic, and taking the number of A level passes per 10,000 of the population, the figure for England and Wales is 205; Northern Ireland, 232; Republic, only 78.</P>
    <P>In German, the situation is worse: 63 per 10,000 in England and Wales; 54 in Northern Ireland; and seven in the Republic.  The language figures compare most unfavourably with those of our neighbours.  A similar situation arises in connection with the sciences. I do not want to go into the detailed figures for sciences but they reflect the same trend.  The total for basic science in England and Wales per 10,000 of the same age group is 980; Northern Ireland, 663; Republic, 218.  By the yardstick of examination results, we do not compare favourably.</P>
    <P>In the light of these figures, do the Government deny that there is something seriously wrong with our secondary education system?  I cannot think they would dispute it for a moment. What are the remedies?  Perhaps there are a number of immediate remedies and a number of long-term remedies <Col N="1592" /> but I should like to deal with a few of them as I see them.  Basically, money is perhaps the major problem but even with a little money, certain things can be done.  First, I think the capital grant must be increased.  It is very small and within the system of administering that grant, there is far too rigid control.  I suggest that the 4-2 system, as I understand it is called, should be abolished, that is, the system by which a recognised pupil following a recognised secondary course spends four years in a junior capacity and two in a senior. This penalises the clever student because, if he is clever enough to get Intermediate in three years, there will still be a capitation grant available for him only for two senior years.</P>
    <P>There should be some relaxation of this system so that a clever student can get a grant all through his secondary school career and if he wants to stay on for further years to continue the senior course and work for a university scholarship, the capitation grant should be available for him, even though he got Intermediate at a much earlier age than the average.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Conalláin spoke of the difficulty of attracting maths, language and science masters.  That is a very real difficulty and I suppose the standard of teaching would be very low indeed if it were not for the devoted service and real patriotism of many secondary teachers who prefer to work in this country rather than get much higher scales elsewhere.  But that is not a situation which should be allowed to continue.  It is very dangerous in the long run that it should continue.  The figures show that in this country at present, of the 680 secondary school teachers teaching mathematics, only 33 are honours graduates.  In England and Wales, 1,600 out of 3,600 are honours graduates.  In spite of devoted patriotism, It is very difficult to get honours graduates to teach here and the time will come when we probably will not get any.</P>
    <P>The same is true in many other subjects.  The Department of Education will have to face the situation in which salaries, official salaries particularly, will have to be brought in line with what is paid in Northern Ireland and Britain and at the same time, in order <Col N="1593" /> to attract people back here, they must envisage giving credit for teaching experience in Northern Ireland and Britain in regard to incremental salaries.  Teaching is not so very different in the neighbouring countries and anybody who has taught there should be given credit for that service.</P>
    <P>Secondary education is very much neglected in the matter of scholarships. The number available to secondary school students needs to be tremendously increased if it is to be brought anywhere near in line with our neighbours. In Northern Ireland in 1960/61, the scholarship grant per head of the child population from 12 to 18 was £16 12s.  I think it was a good deal higher in England and Wales but I have not got the figures.  In the Republic, it was not even 16/-; it was 11/3d. per head of the same age group of the population.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has set out the very laudable aim of making secondary education available to all. All of us here and outside would support him in that but it is one thing to express the aim and another to carry it out, and unless the number of scholarships for secondary school students and scholarships available to students of poor means so that they can go to secondary schools is substantially increased, I see little chance of that aim being realised in the near future.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is great need for capital building grants.  Senator McAuliffe rightly pointed out that the costs of building are continually rising and it is becoming increasingly difficult, if not impossible, for devoted bands of voluntary subscribers to support secondary schools in their present need for new building accommodation.  The Government make generous grants for equipment, particularly science equipment, but what is the good of scientific equipment, and grants for scientific equipment, if there is no grant for the place in which that equipment has to be housed?</P>
    <P>We talk of investment in education. Any businessman making an investment thinks in terms of putting down some fairly substantial sum on which he can get an adequate return.  What <Col N="1594" /> sort of investment is 11/3d. per head per secondary school scholar?  Does the House, and does the Minister, consider this an adequate investment?  What sort of return does the State expect from an investment of that size?  It is the aim of the Minister for Education to make secondary education, by widening post-primary education, available to all.  If steps are not taken to increase the money available, and to increase the grants, then we will be a very long way off the Minister's aim.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Conalláin said that as so much had been spoken about education here, he hoped a motion would be tabled and that the Minister for Education could be present so that we could discuss education in its wider aspects and in greater detail.  I have felt this for some time and, with regard to secondary education, Senator Brosnahan and I will table a motion that the Government should give it more financial support because we feel that this is of tremendous importance to the future of this country; it is something which, up to now, has been tragically neglected.</P>

Sí ceist atá ag cur imní orm ná ceist athbheochan na Gaeilge, go bhfuil an athbheocan ceangailte ar an Rialtas agus go bhfuil obair mhór ar siúl ina leith ag an Rialtas.  Ní fonn cáinte ná cnáimhseáin atá ormsa i leith saothar an Rialtais sa ghnó seo agus ba mhaith liom go dtuigfí nach do Roinn amháin, an Roinn Oideachais, atáim ag tagairt ach don Rialtas go hiomlán agus don mhéid atá curtha i gcrích acu i leith an dualgas a cuireadh orthu faoin mBunreacht a ceapadh don tír seo.  Is fíor a rá go bhfuil saothar mór déanta ag an Rialtas ar chuid de gnéithe na ceiste go dtí seo agus go bhfuil torthaí maithe tábhachtacha le feiscint de bhárr an díchill agus na féile sin i bpáirt an Rialtais.  I gcúrsaí oideachais is mó, ár ndó, atá rian na hoibre sin le feiscint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhí tráth ann im chuimhne féin nuair ná raibh aon fhocal Gaeilge dhá mhúineadh in aon scoil phoiblí.  Ní <Col N="1595" /> hionann agus mar atá anois, ach níl aon cheann dar scoileanna poiblí nach bhfuil an teanga dhá mhúineadh inti go maith nó cuíosach maith.  Is ar éigin atá oide scoile i mbun-scoileanna na tíre seo ná fuil cáilíocht mhúineadh na Gaeilge aige agus eolas na teangan go sár-mhaith, go maith nó cuíosach maith aige.  De thoradh obair an Rialtais i leith oideachais tá anois againn na fichidí mílte daoine in Éirinn go bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu agus eolas acu cad is ciall don Ghaeilge sin agus, tá súil agam, a fhios aca cad na thaobh gur múineadh dóibh é agus na fáthanna náisiúnta a bhí leis an dícheall sin ón Rialtas agus óna múinteoirí a bhí i mbun na hoibre.  Tá na mílte daoine sin anois ina nGaelgeoirí ná beadh aon eolas ar an dteanga acu mura mbeadh dúthracht an Rialtais a sholáthraigh an teagasc dóibh as a dtáinig an t-eolas sin chuca.</P>
    <P>Sa Státseirbhís anois, de thoradh chúram an Rialtais, tá an tseirbhís sin lán de Ghaeilgeoirí agus eolas maith acu a chuirfeadh ar a gcumas a gcuid oibre a dhéanamh i nGaeilge dá mba ghá dhóibh é.  Sí an cheist atá agamsa anois agus agamsa ar an Rialtas gur mithid scrúdú iomlán a dhéanamh feasta ar staid na gluaiseachta i láthair na huaire, ar na torthaí atá le fáil ón tsaothar a deineadh le 40 bliain, agus ón eolas a gheobhfar as an scrúdú agus an léirmheas sin céim nua ar aghaidh a thabhairt in obair na hathbheochana. Is féidir a rá gur ullmhúchán í an obair atá déanta go dtí seo agus na torthaí atá le fáil aisti don lá nuair a thabharfar iarracht ar an nGaeilge a chur in ionaid udaráis agus cleachtaithe i ngnó na tíre nó in ionaid Rialtas agus gnó an phobail. Is chun go mbeidh ar ár gcumas é sin a dhéanamh atá an t-ullmhú ar siúl le mór-dhícheall agus le cuid mhaith costais le 40 bliain.  Is mithid dúinn anois toradh an tsaothair sin a chur i bhfeidhm chun an cuspóir a bhí leis an saothar sin a shroichint.</P>
    <P>Sé dob áil liom anois a chur i láthair an Rialtas ná an fiosrú sin a dhéanamh, agus an dea-mhéinn atá fásta in aigne an phobail a úsáid agus dul ar aghaidh go misniúil chun an cuspóir atá romhainn le 40 bliain a <Col N="1596" /> thabhairt i gcrích.  Tá ar an Rialtas cúram an phobail, cúram chorpartha an phobail, a sláinte, a leas agus a gceart a chothú.  Sé atá mé ag iarraidh anois go dtógfadh an Rialtas&mdash; an Rialtas uile&mdash;mar chúram orthu féin dul i muinín an phobail, an pobal a theagasc, an pobal a ghríosadh agus a threorú chun na h-aidhmeanna uile a bhí againn, agus atá fós againn, a thabhairt i bhfeidhm, agus an teanga Ghaeilge a chur san ionad inar cóir dí a bheith ag ár gcine agus ag ár náisiún.</P>
    <P>Fé mar atá freagarthacht ar an Rialtas an pobal a theagasc i leith a leasa, agus a sláinte, cén chúis ná beadh an fhreagarthacht chéanna uirthi i leith chultúr an chine dhúchais. Táimíd, dar liom, ar tí dul i gcómh-pháirt le náisiúin na hEórpa.  Má théimíd, imeoidh a lán neithe atá anois mar chúram orainn.  Má théimíd i gcómh-pháirt leis na náisiúin eile sin dar liomsa, tá an baol ann gur múchadh agus dearmad buan a bheidh i ndán dar gcultúir.  Chun na cómharthaí a bhí beo againn gur chine ar leith sinn, gur náisiún ar leith sinn, go bhfuil traidisiún ar leith againn, go bhfuil cultúr ar leith againn agus go bhfuil an teanga náisiúnta mar phríomh-chómhartha ar ár seilbh do theideal cine agus náisiúin, ba mhaith liom tathaint ar an Rialtas an scrúdú agus an léirmheas sin a dhéanamh, cineadh ar ghnó teagaisc agus gríosadh a dhéanamh ar an bpobal chun an Gaeilge atá anois acu a úsáid agus a chleachtadh agus a bheith maoíteach as go bhfuil an cómhartha sin orainn fós nach Franncaigh nó Sasanaigh sinn ach Gaeil nár scar riamh leis an dtraidisiún is dual do Ghael.</P>
    <P>Tá somplaí maithe ag an Rialtas chun aithris a dhéanamh orthu.  Bídís dáiríre, cinnte, san obair fé mar a bhí na Giúidigh san Israel a thóg teanga a bhí marbh le míle bliain agus a dhein teanga bheo agus teanga oifigiúil dí do phobal Israel.  Má scrúdaíonn siad an Fhionnlann chífidh siad cad a dhein Rialtas agus muintear na Fionnlainne nuair dob áil leo deireadh a chur leis an teanga Sbheirgeach a bhí in uachtar acu, gur chuireadar a dteanga féin ó bhaol a múchta faoi thionchar na teanga gallda sin.  D'éirigh leo na <Col N="1597" /> neithe sin a thabhairt i gcrích mar bhíodar dáiríre san obair.  Déanfaimís aithris orthu.  Tá pobal na tíre toilteanach le teagasc a ghlacadh agus glacfaidh siad le saothar na hathbheochana agus an cuspóir atá ag gabháil léi a thabhairt i gcrích in Éirinn.</P>
    <P>Tá ní amháin san obair seo atá ar siúl ag an Rialtais&mdash;an nós, agus is baol liom an deachtú, atá ghá dhéanamh deireadh a chur leis an bhfoirm liteartha a bhí ag gabháil riamh leis an nGaeilge.  Do réir deallraimh tá beartaithe anois deireadh a chur le húsáid na litreach a bhí ag gabháil leis an teanga Ghaeilge le míle go leith bliain. Deirtear gurab é an cló Rómhánach a bheidh feasta ann.  Is cúis gháire cuid den scéil mar ba chló Rómhánach agus cló a bhain leis an Laidin féin atá ins na sean-leabhair Éireannacha go bhfuil an oiread sin gradam againn dóibh&mdash;Leabhar Laighean, Leabhar Bhaile an Mhóta, Leabhar Darmhagh agus Leabhar Árd Mhaca.  Anois ar chúis éigean níl an cló Rómhánach sin le húsáid feasta.  Is cló Rómhánach a bhí riamh ag gabháil leis an Ghaeilge agus cén fáth go ndéanfaimís é mhalartú anois ar chló ná fuil fiú amháin oiriúnach don Ghaeilge chun leasaithe, athraithe agus neithe nua a chur léi.  An bhfuil aon chiall le bheith ag déanamh ath-chumadh agus míchruthú ar fhocla Gaeilge le &ldquo;h-anna&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;h-anna&rdquo; atá marbh?  Ní dóigh liom gur ciallmhar an rud é an screamh &ldquo;h-anna&rdquo; sin a chur gan chúis mar loit agus ábhar mearthaill i bhfocla in áiteanna nach rabhadar riamh iontu.</P>
    <P>D'iarrfainn ar an Rialtas d'achainí mór dáiríre deireadh a chur leis an rud ainis sin an &ldquo;h&rdquo;, agus gabháil leis na comharthaí a bhí ann riamh agus a oir seacht n-uaire níos fearr do riachtanaisí an litriúcháin Ghaeilge.  Tá aithne ag daoine ar bhun-fhoirm na bhfocal agus maireann na bunfhoirmeacha sin fós le feiscint sa chló ba dhual don teanga.</P>
    <P>Bhí trá ann nuair cuirtí leabhair i gcló ar an Mór-Roinn nuair ná raibh caoi nó cead ag ár sinsir in Éirinn leabhair a chur i gcló agus bhíodar san cómh cinnte sin do riachtanas an chló Ghaeilge, mar thugaimíd air, a úsáid gur éirigh leo i bParis, i Louvain agus <Col N="1598" /> sa Róimh, cló a dhéanamh go speisialta i leabhra Gaeilge.  Iarraim ar an Rialtas deireadh a chur leis an &ldquo;h&rdquo; marbh atá dhá chur isteach gan riachtanas i bhfocla na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>I dtosach mo chainte do thagraíos do dhualgas an Rialtais&mdash;cuid den dualgas san, dar liomsa, an pobal a theagasc agus a ghríosadh chun feidhm a bhaint anois as an Gaeilge atá an Rialtas agus na dúthrachtaigh leasmuigh den Rialtas taréis a thabhairt do phobal na hÉireann.  Tá gá leis an dteagasc sin.  Cinneadh an Rialtas ar an gcéim nua sin a thabhairt.  Cuiridís gléas ar siúl chun an pobal a theagasc. Bíodh an Rialtas féin, lena gcomhacht, lena núdarás agus lena ndícheall, ag gríosadh an phobail chun an cuspóir atá leis an ngluaiseacht a thabhairt chun tortha agus críche.  Is é dualgas an Rialtais é sin a dhéanamh agus a chur in iúil go bhfuilimíd in Éirinn dáiríre i dtaobh an scéil.</P>

      <P>First, I should like wholeheartedly to support the remarks of Senator Ó Siochfhradha as far as the recurring h's in the Irish language are concerned.  In doing so, I should like to mention that if provincial papers in Naas and Carlow are able to do this and do it quite well, I do not see that there will be tremendous <Col N="1599" /> difficulty in the rest of the country following suit.</P>
      <P>Speaking in the debate yesterday, Senator Ó Ciosáin referred to the Government's agricultural policy.  I regret that he did not elaborate on this particular topic a little more fully.  I should like to know if it is a fact that the Government have decided, should the weather improve and should the harvest of 1963 be good, to introduce again this year the wheat levy.  That is a question that is troubling all the wheat farmers at this time and I feel that it is something that should be settled as it was heretofore.</P>
      <P>When the inter-Party Government were in power, the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, always announced the wheat price before the crop was sown in the spring.  Senator Ó Ciosáin, of course, as usual criticised Deputy Dillon on the wheat question but he seemed to forget all the propaganda and talk of his Party, when they were in opposition, about the 82/6 a barrel for wheat.  When we consider that last year the majority of our unfortunate farmers received only 52/6 a barrel for their wheat, we see that it is high time that the Government made a clear-cut statement on what their wheat policy is now and what price our farmers can hope to receive for this year's harvest.</P>
      <P>Senator Yeats asked were the Government spending too much money on agriculture, was the Estimate for agriculture too high.  The farmers are not asking that more money should be spent on agriculture; they are not just asking that more money should be spent on the Government's agricultural policy as it is, but what they do expect is that the Minister for Agriculture will assert himself and fix proper agricultural prices.  He should insist that the millers and all other middlemen pay the farmers an economic price for their produce, based on the cost of production in 1963 and not, as at present, on the cost of production in 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night, Senator Flanagan mentioned the decision to scrap the &ldquo; Stop&rdquo; signs on our roads.  If the Government decide to scrap these signs, they should <Col N="1600" /> bear 100 per cent of the cost of the change.  The local authorities in Laois, Offaly, Kildare and Carlow have spared no effort adequately to signpost their roads, and if the Government decide to change the signs after only a few years of operation, it would be unfair to ask the ratepayers in these counties to pay for the mistakes of the Government.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the general dissatisfaction about the telephone service.  I met a subscriber in Dublin who, when looking for a trunk call down the country, was told by the operator that there was a 90-minute delay on all lines.  But ten minutes later, he dialled again and got through straight away.  There is something wrong with a system that allows that to happen, and grave public concern is being expressed.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should take more drastic action in an endeavour to have the service improved.</P>
    <P>There are many small things in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs which aggravate the public.  In the case of telegrams&mdash;whether from a few miles away for a few shillings or from Australia or America at great cost to the sender&mdash;the writing on these telegrams when they arrive is sometimes childish and almost undecipherable.  I have here some telegrams which came from the Kilkenny post office a few days ago.  One would expect a child of six to have a better standard of writing. It is a disgrace to have a scribble like this come from any public office.  These are matters which closer supervision should be able to rectify.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the Minister for Transport and Power, his Department and indeed the Government themselves, have no respect for public opinion.  The public have definitely conveyed to those concerned their opposition to the decision of the ESB to tear down the Georgian houses in Fitzwilliam Street.  It is also an expression of CIE's lack of faith in the people that after so many years of operation, if any society wish to run an excursion or even a pilgrimage to Knock, they must guarantee to pay for 400 or 500 people on that pilgrimage.  The policy of closing down railways in the teeth of public opinion is further proof that <Col N="1601" /> the present administration have no regard for the wishes of the people they claim to represent as a democratic Party.</P>
    <P>I would appeal again to the Minister for Transport and Power to review the matter of the bimensal charges by the ESB for rural electrification connections. It is extraordinary to see the occupants of a house with a poor law valuation on buildings of £15 having to pay £30 or £40 a year for the privilege of having the ESB service connected. The ESB overhead charges are based on the floor area of the house.  If the ESB did the wiring of the house, perhaps one could understand their charges; but since they only bring the supply to the nearest external wall, it is a bit too much to ask people to pay £4 or £5 every two months for a connection.  In many cases where the Land Commission acquire old country mansions, the occupants are unable to avail of this great national service because they cannot afford to pay the overhead charges.  I would appeal to the Minister to fix a maximum overhead charge for all these rural houses.</P>
    <P>Senators McAuliffe and Ross advocated the introduction of a guide to careers.  I should like to point out that the country's leading morning paper recently ran a comprehensive series of articles on a guide to careers, and I understand that they also publish these articles in book form.  In doing so, they have done a wonderful service to parents and young people. They deserve our very best thanks for making the choice of a career much easier for so many people.</P>
    <P>The present situation in the political life of the country is obvious.  The electorate, as shown by the result in Dublin North-East, want to get rid of the present Fianna Fáil administration. They are looking more and more to the Fine Gael Party for the leadership necessary to prevent the present critical situation worsening further.</P>
    <P>There were some other remarks I wished to make on the Bill and I should like to express my dissatisfaction that on practically every Bill that comes in here back bench members <Col N="1602" /> are asked to be brief.  Ministers seem always to have to get away and I feel that when the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition are making their arrangements, they should stretch the time a little more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Bill we are considering the cost of running the nation for the present year, and the length of our debates here is adding to the cost of running the nation.  We have a Vote for the Houses of the Oireachtas which increases a little each year.  I should like to consider for a moment the cost to the nation as a whole of the kind of debate we have had here during the last fortnight. Some of the debate has been relevant, honest and sincere.  Most of the speakers this morning come under that heading.  But some of the matters referred to earlier in the debate clearly do not.  We have had discussions on the majority in the Treaty debates, the Civil War and on alleged bribery.</P>
      <P>This kind of thing is costing the country time, money, energy and prestige.  I would make an appeal to those members of this House and of the other House who indulge in this kind of discussion to consider what it is costing the country in general as well as its cost in the Vote for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The money spent from the Exchequer does not, for example, cover the cost to our energy of these debates which have made us angry when we do not want to be angry so that when we go back to our work, as many of us must do, we are less fit for it.  In this way the production of the country is suffering in 60 cases, when all members of the Seanad have been involved.</P>

    <P>What gain is there to the country from this kind of discussion?  Perhaps there is a gain in votes.  I can think of no other reason for it.  But I know a good many young people and I know a good many older people and I am quite certain that there is no gain in votes from this kind of discussion.  I believe the younger people are disgusted, and I believe the members of the older generation are appalled and disgusted at it.  The younger generation have no use for the drums and <Col N="1603" /> fifes of the old political brass bands, north or south of the Border.  Too many times in the past fortnight we have heard echoes of these drums and fifes in this House.</P>
    <P>One of the most expensive liabilities in any country is the back-looking, angry politician, and those who deliberately foster old feuds, antagonisms and divisions.  Every day when we come into the House, we see the magnificent Proclamation of the Republic in 1916 hanging in the main hall.  When bringing visitors through the House, I always make an effort to point out to them the phrase in the Proclamation which describes the intentions of the Republic and I quote:</P>
    <P>Oblivious of the differences carefully fostered by an alien government, which have divided a minority from the majority in the past.</P>
    <P>That is a magnificent declaration of idealistic freedom.  The recurrence in this House and in the other House of such debates as I have mentioned would seem to indicate that the idealism behind these words has almost died out.</P>
    <P>The cost can be reckoned not only in the Estimate before us.  It can also be reckoned in the spirit of the country as a whole, and in that way it is a long-term cost.  The deadliest and most insidious evil that can enter into any family, school, university, or church, is the evil of discouragement and disillusionment of the younger generation. In his play &ldquo;Back to Methuselah,&rdquo; Bernard Shaw brings some people who are living somewhere about the year 15,000 to pay a visit to the west of Ireland.  There they see some sad-looking, drooping people.  The `perfect ones', as Shaw sees them, ask their guide, who would be the counterpart of a Bord Fáilte guide of the present day, what is wrong with the natives of this country.  &ldquo;They are suffering from the national disease&rdquo; says the guide, &ldquo; the national disease of discouragement.&rdquo; I am quite certain that words that have been said and exchanges that have been made in this House in the last few weeks are adding to such discouragement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1604" /> The poet Yeats, who was a member of this House, in one of his poems, in agonised uncertainty, asked whether certain words he had once written had sent some young men out to their deaths in 1916.  The poem reflects the agonised uncertainty of the poet.  He asks himself if he were partially responsible for the deaths of some of these young men.  We should ask ourselves whether words spoken in this House in the past few weeks may have caused members of the younger generation to fall into the apathy of the beatnik, the violence of the delinquent, or the bitterness of the cynic.  Are we happy that some of those words may have driven away young men and women from the honourable paths of public service into that pit of disillusionment and discouragement?</P>
    <P>Most of us here are fairly veteran politicians.  I have been a member of this House for some 15 years and in my own heart there is a sense of discouragement after the kind of debate we have been listening to part of the time here in the past fortnight and for a longer period in the other House.  In the current issue of <i>Studies</i>, there is an article by Roland Burke Savage which I strongly recommend to all interested in the honour and welfare of Ireland.  This is part of what he writes:</P>
    <P>Economic development is essential but if it is not based upon values we cherish, and if it is not seen as a means of preserving and developing these values, it cannot give a vital purpose to the people of Ireland, an attractive ideal to draw the best out of them.</P>
    <P>Our pressing problem is to express in terms of today's world an ideal, true to our nature and traditions, that will satisfy the intelligence of our young people, and will speak to their hearts.  Only such an ideal will impel them to work for its fulfillment. Through lack of such an ideal many of them indulge in endless bouts of arid and depressing criticism that is essentially sterile because destructive and never directed to action.</P>
    <P>I shall not continue to read from it.  The whole tone of this article is that unless <Col N="1605" /> ideals are created and maintained in this country, there will be no happy future for the country because of the disillusionment and discouragement of the younger generation.</P>
    <P>Now I shall deal briefly&mdash;I have been spending a good deal of the last one and a half hours tearing up pieces of my speech&mdash;with matters of detail. First, the universities.  The grants to the universities have been generously increased.  It is very reassuring for the university which I represent to have this generous treatment.  On the other hand, it is our duty more and more to show that we are trying to run our university as efficiently as possible since we are receiving more of the taxpayers' money.  We are doing that. I can prove it from a recent development in Trinity College.  We have brought in consultants in managing and organisation.  They have suggested drastic reforms in the office work of the college.  We are putting these through after careful consideration. The reason we are doing this is that we feel a responsibility to the taxpayers to see that what we are spending is spent only on essential costs.  At the same time, for some years now there has been a committee of development working in the college to see how we can improve the teaching and the accommodation for students.  Already these have been improved very considerably. I had intended to say more about this, but I do want to assure the House and the taxpayers in general that the determination of Trinity College is that any money given to them from public funds will be well spent.</P>
    <P>In today's paper, we read some important statements by the principal of Gurteen Agricultural College Roscrea, the Rev. R. C. Livingstone. The Minister for Agriculture was there and said he would do everything in his power to help teachers and students in agricultural education.  I simply want to mention a fact which may be of use to him and to the country.  We have in Trinity College a well-equipped farm between Slane and Drogheda, the fertility of which has been greatly improved by experimental methods.  We are willing and eager to receive agricultural <Col N="1606" /> students.  The supply has not been satisfactory up to the present.  If the Minister can do something for us, he will be doing something worthwhile for the country in helping us to develop this experimental and educational farm.</P>
    <P>I shall not at this late hour try to argue the case for spending more money on education.  Plenty has been said by Senator Ross, Senator Ó Conalláin and many others.  The facts are there and the need is there and I believe the Minister and the Government are aware of this.  But if some of us pass it over without emphasis do not let him think that we do not very strongly support what Senator Ross emphasised&mdash;we need greater capital grants for the secondary schools.</P>
    <P>There is just one point in the statement made by the Minister for Education a month or so ago which alarms me a little; otherwise I welcome the statement.  His intention is to build a number of new post-primary schools. Good, but what about the old secondary schools?  Senator Ó Conalláin said that they will not be affected.  They will not be affected only if the State is prepared to provide almost twice as much money as before, because if money is spent on building those schools, there will be less money for the existing secondary schools.  The point is there: I shall not press it.  Our schools in the Republic need capital grants immensely at the moment.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross mentioned&mdash;and I concur with him&mdash;the need to bring scientific and mathematical teachers back from outside our borders.  This is desperately urgent.  The figures are given in the document <i>Investment in Education</i> from which Senator Ross quoted.  The main need is not a rise in salaries but a recognition of their service for increments over here.  I really cannot understand why the Minister is holding back on that.  It is simply an administrative matter if he would see to it.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Vote for the Office of Public Works, there has been a suggestion that the care of our public monuments should be a matter for a separate organisation.  I do hope the Government will consider that suggestion <Col N="1607" /> favourably.  Our historic buildings are of enormous value to us in every way.  I believe they could be better looked after if there were a separate sub-Department to look after them.  I should be very much interested to hear the Government's opinion on this or whether they have arrived at a decision on it.  I hope it will be a favourable one.</P>
    <P>Up to the moment I have been speaking vocationally.  For the next three minutes, I shall speak as a mere taxpayer.  I mean to give the impression that I have confidence in the Government's policy and in the Department of Finance and other Departments.  It is ironic that any members of the Fine Gael Party or others should complain or vote against the main method of bringing in money and then advocate spending more money.  It is a ridiculous contradiction in terms.  We need this money and we must get it and it is ridiculous to say we reject this method of getting money without offering an alternative means&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are two matters with which I propose to deal very briefly.  One is in regard to the considerable losses in State-sponsored companies.  Mr. Garret Fitzgerald in a valuable article in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 17th July, 1963, pointed to very grave losses in what you might call State investments.  The country is perturbed about this.  I am not an economist, but I do hope that the strictest scrutiny will be exercised when putting money into such projects as the St. Patrick's Copper Mines or the Industrial Engineering Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> One other point&mdash;I speak as a tax-payer&mdash;is that I see hotels being lavishly subsidised.  Good.  To take my own region of Dalkey, County Dublin, I see good hotels being set up.  They benefit such people as taximen, shopkeepers and publichouse owners.  I also see the prices going up steadily in the shops during the tourist season for basic food supplies.  That is an inequality. The working classes, from street cleaners to secondary teachers and professors like myself, are suffering from this policy of developing the hotels in certain regions.  We are paying more money for our goods and I appeal to the Minister to keep that in mind in the next Budget.  The hotels and many others do well, but the salaried workers do not and if the Minister could do something to help them, he would be doing justice.</P>
    <P>That is all I propose to say.  There was much more I had to say.  I repeat that I believe the present Government have the confidence of the country generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Further, though perhaps it is embarrassing to do this on some occasions, I should like to say that the country has great confidence in the team of experts the Minister has in his Department.  They have done magnificent work, and they encourage us to think well of the financial future of the country.  We need firm Government, and I would encourage the Government to continue it.  Perhaps the various Ministers concerned will meet our views on the many matters raised.</P>

      <P>I am sure all of us are conscious of the statement made by Senator Stanford at the outset.  Like most of the latter speakers, I have to cut down on what I had intended to say.  I shall not deal with the theme song of the Fine Gael Party &mdash; emigration and unemployment.  Somebody said a record should be made of it because we have heard it so often but I doubt if it would get into the Top Ten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not heard anything from the other side of the House about the <Col N="1609" /> benefits flowing from the Government under the various heads.  I could go down through the Departments and enumerate the various such benefits. In my county of Leitrim, a document was issued by no less a body than the NFA.  It was issued with a view to encouraging greater membership.  They pointed out under various heads the amount of money that had come into Leitrim from Government sources. They gave information in relation to cattle, pigs, sheep, wool, calves, fertilisers and rates relief.  The document was the greatest vindication of Government policy I have read.  Unfortunately, I have not a copy of it with me.</P>
    <P>There was reference to small farms but no reference was made to the Government's initiative in relation to the small farmer, to the report on small farms and to the implementation of that report.  Earlier this year, a team of experts was set up in the western counties to investigate and implement this report.  Therefore, as far as the small farmer is concerned, the Government are looking after his interests.</P>
    <P>I resent the implication which is made time and time again that it is the intention of the Government to get rid of the small farmer and that they are being advised by the economists to do so.  An indication of their policy in regard to the small farmer is the fact that they have set up an inter-Departmental committee and hope to implement the recommendations.</P>
    <P>A proposal was put forward as recently as yesterday to the Taoiseach by a representative body from the west of Ireland following a meeting held in Claremorris quite recently, at which I was present, that the sugar company should be given sufficient funds to provide a number of fruit and vegetable plants in various areas of the west of Ireland.  I urge the Minister for Finance that when it comes to his level, he will give it not alone the utmost sympathy but the utmost practical consideration.</P>
    <P>No reference was made to the new Land Bill.  I am sure it will be welcomed on all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>I agree with what has been said in regard to tourist promotion in foreign parts but I do not agree with bringing over representatives of various travel agencies and wining and dining them because when most of them leave this country, they have no idea of the position here.  The material which they received&mdash;the various brochures&mdash;was found afterwards in the hotel.  One of those people asked me after having had lunch and been well received, the name of the town.  That was not very encouraging.  Unfortunately, from the point of view of commission, these people may find it more profitable to concentrate on what some other countries have to offer in the way of tourism.</P>
      <P>In our county recently, a unit was established for mentally defective children and is run by an order of nuns.  It is an indication that efforts are being made to deal with that problem.</P>
      <P>I want to appeal to the Minister on behalf of cancer victims.  There may be places of which I am not aware but it is rather unfortunate that people who are known to have cancer and for whom there is no hope have not a rest home to go to once they have been sent home from hospital as incurable, only waiting for the end.  Some effort should be made by the Department of Health and by the Government to provide some rest homes for these people where they may stay from the time the verdict has been given until the inevitable happens.</P>
      <P>I was rather surprised that no reference was made to the dynamic policy being pursued by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands in regard to inland and sea fisheries.  I have a cutting here about Irish salmon rotting in course of transport in Britain and the matter might be taken up by the Department of Agriculture with British Railways.  Here is the relevant extract from the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> of 25th July, 1963.  Under the heading &ldquo;Irish Salmon Rot&rdquo;, it is stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1611" /> When Sir David Robertson, Independent Conservative for Caithness, tried to raise by way of a Parliamentary Question with the British Minister for Transport, the delay by British Railways in getting supplies of salmon from Paddington to Billingsgate and to prevent further losses to Irish fishermen and their British customers, he was advised to get on to the Transport Users' Committee. It was stated that in the old days Irish salmon from Rosslare used to be put on the boat train at Fishguard and got into Paddington at 11 a.m.  Now it does not arrive until 6 p.m. and is liable to be kept overnight.  Sir David said that the quality fish was worth £50 a box.  He stated that he had been complaining to the Paddington authorities and was promised some improvement but was told by a Billingsgate firm that 313 boxes at Fishguard would not reach Paddington until that evening and that British Railways refused to guarantee delivery apparently for lack of porters.  Sir David intended to raise the matter with the Irish Embassy in London.</P>
    <P>That matter should receive immediate attention.  It is not the fault of the Department of Agriculture at this stage but apparently of British Railways. It is very serious, as we are trying to develop an export trade for fish, that this should happen just for lack of porters.</P>
    <P>There have been tributes to and criticism of Telefís Éireann.  I should like to join in the tributes that have been paid, particularly in regard to their coverage of the death of Pope John XXIII and the accession of Pope Paul VI.  In particular, I should like to pay a tribute to sound radio for all that was done during that period.  The people were kept well informed of events as they happened.</P>
    <P>Like many others, I was rather perturbed at and annoyed by the cutting off of the programme of the coronation of Pope Paul just at the time of the actual crowning.  I accept the explanation that it was a matter of timing and that our television authorities had no responsibility in regard to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1612" /> I congratulate sound radio on their efforts in regard to Irish culture, particularly Irish music.  I have in mind the radio programme &ldquo;Fleadh Ceoil an Radio&rdquo; and their &ldquo; Town Hall&rdquo; programme.  I do not agree with the programme &ldquo;Ireland's Top Ten&rdquo; which is broadcast on Monday nights. I do not believe the records chosen are representative of Ireland's Top Ten.  I believe it should include records of Irish céilí music and ballads.  I certainly do not think that foreign music under the title &ldquo;Ireland's Top Ten&rdquo; should emanate from our radio service.</P>
    <P>Emigration has been mentioned. One of the sad results of it is the mode of life some of our people live over there.  Again, in reply to a parliamentary question in the House of Commons, which was reported in yesterday's English newspapers, it is unfortunate to learn that of 182 convictions for living under certain conditions in the metropolitan district between the 1st July last year and 30th June this year, 22 were in respect of people from the Republic of Ireland.  I think the Department of Justice should keep a wary eye on those people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is part of the emigration problem.  We have criticism of emigration and I think those who criticise it must accept some responsibility for it, as the previous speaker pointed out.  I agree with the statement quoted yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition that emigration is a national problem.  It is also an international one.  People are leaving all countries and so far as the land is concerned, they are leaving the land in Japan and in America.  That trend is not peculiar to this country.  Those who criticise it should make some effort and contribution towards the solution of the problem.  The best way is to avail of the policy pursued by the Government and work it until such time as these people are given a mandate by the country to take over.</P>

      <P>Unlike Senator Stanford who tore up only some of his speech, I am scrubbing practically all of it to assist the Leader of the House who wants to let the Minister away. I am anxious to co-operate but when one builds up an amount of material about a Department on which he can speak&mdash;the Department of Defence in my case &mdash; where an expenditure of nearly £10 million is involved, one naturally feels sad about not getting the opportunity to expand on the matter.  We shall probably get an opportunity of tackling the Minister at a later date about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the Minister and I hope he enjoys the evening.  He is entitled to it.  This is a type of reiteration of a matter I wrongly referred to on the Finance Bill.  I was told to raise it on this Bill and I am doing so.  Certain officers in the Defence Forces by their ability and qualifications obtained posts in the Civil Service and qualified for a modified pension from the Army.  I understand those pensions are being withheld from these former officers who are now officers in the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>Another group in the Post Office got four years' incremental service for their service to the nation during the Emergency and they feel they are entitled&mdash;and so do I&mdash;to have the four years added to their service for pension purposes because they will soon have reached the retiring age and will be deprived of a year's pension.  If their Army service entitled them to the incremental service, it should also entitle them to the pensionable service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point I should like to hear about in that connection is this.  Those men in the Post Office are about to be retired and they are led to believe that their military service pension will be cut from 1920 when they became entitled to the Post Office pension.  That information may be wrong but they tell me they believe they will not be paid their IRA pensions along with the Post Office pension when they finish work in the Post Office.  I do not want <Col N="1614" /> to wax too eloquent on the point which may be entirely wrong.  It has been said that you cannot draw two pensions from the same State at the same time but we all know a number of people are doing that in the case of military service pensions.  I know officers in the Army who had broken service and got IRA pensions in addition to the Army pensions, and rightly so.  These men, it appears, feel they will not be paid their IRA pensions. I think the Government would not do that but I should like to have it clarified.</P>
    <P>I am omitting references to Defence in the hope that we shall have another opportunity but I want to refer to an auction I attended early this year.  This relates to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It consisted of the sale of machinery from the Wicklow copper mines.  They sold about £100,000 worth of heavy machinery, Euclids, scrapers, dozers, <i>et cetera</i>.  I saw these wonderful machines going for £2,000 or £2,500 for each machine.  The public paid no more than £25,000 for well over £100,000 worth of machinery. That is bad in the ordinary way but it is worse when one considers that only across the river, there is to be a nitrogen factory for which we were legislating in the Oireachtas and I am positive that factory will need quite a lot of machinery of that nature.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Government but the administration.  I made a few inquiries; perhaps I heard the wrong information but it was sad to see this machinery being sold for a quarter of its value, some of it scarcely used.  If the Euclids in any case were used daily from the beginning of the operation of the mines, they would be well worth more than what was paid for them and we are probably going to buy new machinery for the nitrogen factory. Further, on the way back from the auction, I saw obsolete machinery trying to scrape the roads of County Wicklow.  The same is the case in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will correct me if I am wrong but I made inquiries and I believe that local authorities and Civil Service Departments are precluded from buying second-hand <Col N="1615" /> machinery; they must buy it new.  If it is true, something should be done about that.  I happen to know that some of the machinery bought at the Wicklow auction was going abroad. I presume the same type of machinery required subsequently by a county council would have to be imported.  There seems to be a tremendous loss involved and the Minister should take cognisance of that fact and authorise local authorities to participate in these auctions or, better still, let local authorities take their pick before machinery such as this is put up for auction at all.</P>
    <P>One firm in which I am interested bought one of these machines for a couple of hundred pounds in excess of £2,000.  It is unbelievable that machines of this type could be bought at such a price.  Looking at the site of the new nitrogenous factory, I have no doubt that similar machinery will be required there.  Indeed, it has probably been bought by now.  If it is a fact that local authorities cannot buy this machinery at auctions such as the one I have mentioned, machinery purchased in the first instance by the Government, then that position should be remedied immediately.  I should like the Minister to give us some information on the matter.</P>
    <P>The present position seems to me to be a tragic one.  Local authorities should be circularised privately by the Government and county engineers should be informed that this machinery is available.  My suggestion would help the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce because imports would be reduced. The minimum paid for any one of those machines was £9,250.  Machinery costing £100,000 was sold at give-away prices and there was not even one county engineer there to make a bid. Local authorities should have had their pick.  All over the country obsolete machines are trying to scrape the roads. Some of these machines would go down three feet; they would be ideal for drainage and the reclamation of land.  I trust the Minister will be able <Col N="1616" /> to make a satisfactory reply to the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephQuigley" hpid="Mr. Quigley Mr. Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the indulgence of the House in permitting me to make a few brief remarks.  There has been a good deal of discussion about education.  Education is very important, and naturally we should all like to see it put on a proper footing, but agriculture is admitted to be the most important industry in the country and, to my way of thinking, there was not enough emphasis on agriculture during this debate.  I am surprised the Minister has not seen his way to increase the grants given towards the relief of rates.  Rates are increasing all over the country.  We expected an increase in the grants last year.  It did not materialise.  It has not materialised this year either.  Rates contribute to the rising costs of production on the land.</P>
      <P>I should like the Department of Industry and Commerce to give a little more attention and assistance to the smaller towns and villages throughout the country.  Senator Yeats suggested we are all prospering, but the smaller towns and villages grow daily more like ghost towns and villages.  The basic cause is emigration.  The people are no longer there to trade.  These places go from bad to worse.  If we make a suggestion about a factory, we are immediately asked how much we will put up and what type of factory we want to build.  A little more encouragement by the Government might restore some of these towns and villages to something near their former prosperity.</P>
      <P>I was glad to read that there will be no levy on wheat this year.  I trust the millers will not be allowed to get away again this year with the tactics they adopted last year; they turned down three quarters of the good wheat brought in to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like making complaints, but the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will have to do something about the telephone system.  In the past couple of months, the position has become almost hopeless.  Reception is very bad and the delays are appalling.  Last night I wanted to make a phone call from an hotel to my town some 70 miles away.  After eleven o'clock, I <Col N="1617" /> thought I should get the call inside two or three minutes.  I was told there would be a delay of one hour.  In a little over the hour, I got the call.  The person at the other end heard me quite plainly but I could not hear one word he was saying.  The position is most unsatisfactory.  The Minister must take some steps to remedy it.</P>

      <P>I should like once more to commend to Senator L'Estrange a study of the emigration figures from March, 1954, to March, 1957, and from March, 1957, to date. He will see there is a remarkable improvement. Apart from that, I have noticed in recent statistics that the marriage rate is very high and the birth rate is also very high.  It is not possible, therefore, to agree with the Senator that all the young people are running out of the country.  Some are remaining, getting married and rearing families.  Indeed, these statistics are higher than they have been for many years.</P>

      <P>Senator L'Estrange talked about the good bargain made in 1949, as a result of which we had big exports. Now we must remember that the bargaining that time was governed by what one could get and not by what one could sell: &ldquo;Will you give us so much coal if we give you cattle?&rdquo; That was what we asked the British. The British asked us: &ldquo;Will you give us cattle if we give you coal?&rdquo; All the bargaining was designed to keeping down exports and bringing up imports. As a matter of fact, our negotiators were not altogether successful in their efforts because no sooner were they back home than they had to revive the <Col N="1618" /> turf scheme they had scrapped before they went over to Britain.</P>
      <P>Senator L'Estrange mentioned the price of wheat and oats.  I do not think the price of oats has gone down in recent years.  It was over £2 per barrel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On average, the price of oats has not gone down.  With regard to barley, there is always a difference between the price paid for malting barley and the price paid for feeding barley.  Feeding barley has become a much more important crop than malting barley in recent years.  As regards the price of wheat, it is true we have not restored the 12/- a barrel which Deputy Dillon took off when he was Minister for Agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we did not.  The 12/-he took off is still off and we are getting enough wheat at the present price, so that Deputy Dillon was wise in his calculation at the time in making out that he would get enough wheat at 5/- a barrel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not.  We shall go on to the national income&mdash;the only other figure I shall quote, as far as I see.  The national income, as the best index of anything good being done in the country, has gone up by 38 per cent since 1956, which means that the average spender in this country now has 27/7d. to spend whereas he had £1 in 1956.  That applies all round in the national income and is, as I say, <Col N="1619" /> one of the best indications of national progress.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Brien made the usual very useful contribution to the debate. I just mention a few points where I agree with him, points which are useful to be kept in mind.  He started off by saying that we are open in this country to the influence of other countries in respect of our economic conditions. That is perfectly true, and it is a thing we must always keep in mind, because if, say, there is a downward trend in the economy generally in other countries, it is very difficult for us to keep out of that movement also. If there is an upward trend, it suits us.  As a matter of fact, there was no upward trend in the past three or four years generally, whereas ours was going up considerably and it shows, I think, that credit is due to the planning done during that period.  I agree with Senator Stanford that a great deal is due to the experts we have in the Department of Finance who are advising us in relation to economic conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The next point Senator O'Brien referred to was public expenditure. He said that public expenditure was tending to increase and, in fact, I think he said that it was going a bit out of line with production. Although I must, of course, again say that Senator O'Brien's speech was helpful, very interesting and, I need hardly say because it is always the case, very objective, at the same time, I should like to quote a figure which does not <Col N="1620" /> altogether bear out his contention.  It is in the tables issued at the time of the Budget.  It showed that if you take the gross national product of the years from 1957 to 1962 and take the Government's expenditure each year, the percentage remains almost the same. In 1957, it was 22.1 per cent; in 1962, it was 22 per cent, was a .1 per cent reduction.  The tendency, therefore, was actually that for the first three years it went down to 20.2 per cent, and then for three years, it went up again until it reached the same level as in 1957.  I am quoting that only to show that there are figures to support the contention that the Government's expenditure is not out of line with national income or gross national product.</P>
      <P>Another fact we must keep in mind is that last year I was able to produce figures to show that if we had made no change whatever in taxation from 1957 until 1962, we would have had a bigger revenue in 1962 than we actually had.  That would mean that leaving the revenue at the level advocated by the Taoiseach when he was in opposition in 1957, it would have given us sufficient to cover expenditure in 1962.  I am not promising that now.  I think this Budget has put that out of mind but up to 1962 it was the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I go on to a question raised by Senator Brosnahan with regard to insurance companies.  I have not very much to say except that I am quite satisfied, and I think Senators will be, too, if they read any answers given in the Dáil, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was not in any way negligent.  In these cases, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has power to delay the receipt of accounts.  I am quite sure that if the Bill were being brought before this Seanad for the first time, if it were absolutely rigid that the accounts must be presented at a certain time, all Senators would say the Minister should have power to give a little time to a company who, for one reason or another, are not in a position to present their accounts. There was, therefore, such a provision in the Act dealing with this.  The Minister gave that and again what could he do?  They said they were <Col N="1621" /> not in a position to present the accounts; he had to give the time and he gave it.  He gave too much time as it happened but there was nothing the Minister could do.</P>
    <P>The Minister has under consideration the question of whether his powers are adequate or not.  That particular point about the time is only one aspect.  There might be other aspects in dealing with Irish insurance companies where somewhat greater powers in the hands of the Minister would be useful.  If he comes to the conclusion that he would need greater powers, he certainly will have no hesitation in asking for them.</P>
    <P>As regards the policy-holders, the liquidator saw that he was not likely to have enough to pay all claims that might arise to the end of the term of the policies in operation and, therefore, he issued a notice to all policy-holders that the Equitable was off cover and they should insure with some other company.  That was a good precaution to take.  There were, of course, claims outstanding at that time and the liquidator is considering what can be done about these.  No indication can be given until he has completed his investigation and seen what assets he may have to meet the liabilities.</P>
    <P>Motor insurance, of course, is covered for third party risk, but, apart from that, I do not think the company would remain.  In the case of other policies, I think the cover would probably be useless in that there would not be assets to meet them.  Therefore, the advice of the liquidator to insure with other companies was good and everybody should try to adopt it.  No more can be done until the liquidator has produced his report on the assets.</P>
    <P>The bond is a difficult question.  It strikes me that if a builder has entered on and is building the premises, whatever they may be, and if it is found that the bond is useless, I do not see how the owner of the property can insist on the builder taking out another bond.  There is a genuine difficulty there and I suppose it may be worth the consideration of the person concerned to offer payment for the bond himself so that he would be covered in any <Col N="1622" /> case, even though he had to go to that expense.</P>
    <P>Senators Brosnahan, McAuliffe and Quinlan&mdash;and I think I could include other Senators&mdash;advocated more expenditure on education.  In fact, I think this was largely an education debate and it would be much more appropriate if the Minister for Education could be here because I think threefourths of the debate dealt with education. However, we can only deal with it in a broad way.  I want to say, first of all, that Senators have some of the same virtues and some of the same faults as any other public men.  They have in this case advocated more expenditure on education, but I think some at least of these Senators were not so generous when they came to vote the money in the Seanad.  They have been advocating, if you like, more expenditure and less income to meet it. I suppose the average citizen has the same idea, that he would like to pay less in taxes and get more benefits, and it is up to the public man to try to do what pleases the average citizen. But I am not so sure that it will get us anywhere, as Senator Stanford very truly pointed out.</P>
    <P>I have not very much to say about the matter of Irish, about which Senator McAuliffe spoke.  I think I can be taken as an example of a person who much prefers to read Irish in the Gaelic type.  I do not like the Roman type, but at the same time, I see the necessity for it.  As far as I know, other languages like German which have their own type have gone completely away from it and all their publications are in the Roman type. I take it that applies to the world in general and we can only fall in with that.  As Senator Ó Siochfhradha pointed out, the Gaelic type was an innovation in the Gaelic language. That was a considerable time ago but it was an innovation.  Before that, the Roman type was there.  It would appear to be advisable that children learning Irish for the first time should start with the Roman type and so have no difficulty as some of us who learned Irish in the Gaelic type have.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator McAuliffe when he approves the scheme laid <Col N="1623" /> down by the Minister for Education for bigger and more comprehensive schools for post-primary education and subsidised transport.  I think that is a very much better system than trying to provide schools within reach of all children.  For one thing, we will probably get better staffs because it will probably be that we will have to have a teacher for each subject in the bigger schools.  That will be a big improvement in the smaller schools where the teacher has to teach two or three subjects.  There are many other things which could be said for the bigger schools, that it will be possible to have better equipment and bigger and better laboratories.  Generally speaking, the schools will be better. We hope, as Senator McAuliffe hopes, that it will be a success.</P>
    <P>Senator McAuliffe, I think, found fault with the Government for not contributing more to the building, repair and upkeep of schools.  I want to make one comment on that.  I do not think all the Churches which own schools would agree that the Government should own them and pay for them completely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister took me up incorrectly.  I said that I believed local committees should be set up to collect local contributions, that failure to collect local contributions was the cause of quite a lot of schools not being repaired and it did not rest with the Department at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Senator that local committees would be very useful in these matters.  Sometimes you have a manager who is not too progressive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ó Maoláil talked about the delay in the issue of the reports of Seanad debates.  He raised this matter in connection with the Stationery Office but it may not always be due to the Stationery Office.  The Stationery Office make arrangements, and as far as they are concerned, they insist on the arrangements being carried out with the contractors.  But, the preparation of the bound volumes is a matter for the House here, for the Dáil Office, <Col N="1624" /> or, as the case may be, the Seanad Office here and the delay may be due there rather than laid at the door of the Stationery Office.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Maoláin made many useful and constructive criticisms particularly of the work of State organisations more than of the Government itself.  I notice that since that other Senators have agreed with his statements about some of the State organisations and I hope that they will have the desired effect.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick went on to talk about the adverse trade balance.  An adverse trade balance is something which any Government would try to avoid.  I always look on the running of the finances of the Government much in the same way as running one's own house.  Unfortunately, I was not always successful in making ends meet in my own house and, therefore, I could not claim <i>a priori</i> to be a good Minister for Finance.  I think we should run it in the same way.  If there is an adverse trade balance, the Minister says: &ldquo;I am not making ends meet&rdquo;. But, on the other hand, it is an extremely difficult figure to calculate and to make up.  I will say there is some imponderable stuff, stuff which is hard to get at.  There is another thing.  There is an absolutely reliable figure in our external balances.  Where our external balances remain good and are not going down, there is no great danger ahead.  In fact, these external balances are going up.  For that reason, we are not too worried about the adverse trade balance, even through it is very high. I admit also, as was pointed out by Senator Fitzpatrick, that it is even worse than it was on 1st January.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick was wrong in saying that there is no difference in the grants given today to the undeveloped areas and other parts of the country.  As a matter of fact in the new legislation, they are called developed areas because underdeveloped was regarded as a very uncomplimentary term.  There is a book&mdash;I am sure some Senators have it&mdash;entitled <i>Industry in Ireland</i> and it is the only book that can be got in which these provisions are set out.  I see in the development areas the authority dealing with grants may give the full cost of factory sites <Col N="1625" /> and buildings and up to one-half of the cost of plant, machinery and equipment. They may also cover the cost of training workers in these areas and they may also cover the cost of constructing roads, bridges, harbours, railways and houses for workers. These are very generous terms indeed and I do not think in any case so far they have gone 100 per cent all round in their discretion in dealing with these grants, but they can go so far. In the other areas, that is, those areas not in these development areas, they can give two-thirds of the cost of the site and building and one-third of the machinery and equipment, that is, two-thirds against the full grant and one-third against half the grant, so actually Senator Fitzpatrick is not right in stating that it is the same for the two areas now.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick and other Senators mentioned that there was adverse comment on the fact that the Minister for Agriculture did not accompany a delegation to London some time ago.  That delegation went with the express purpose of exploring the possibility of negotiations.  No negotiations whatever were entered into.  They discussed if it would be useful to hold negotiations again and, if so, under what headings.  It was concluded that negotiations might possibly be useful.  The officials on both sides have the matter in hands to find out under what headings negotiations could be carried out.  If these negotiations take place and if they are at Ministerial level, there is no doubt the Minister for Agriculture will take part, but there was no reason why he should lose his time on this exploratory delegation.  One delegate&mdash;the Taoiseach himself&mdash;was quite sufficient to make the necessary exploratory approach to the British Government.</P>
    <P>The next matter referred to was what were described as &ldquo;these palatial hotels&rdquo;.  I do not think they should be made a political subject.  If these international organisations, who have hotels all over the world, say they are prepared to build a hotel here, I do not see why they should not get the same grants as anybody else building a hotel.  Possibly these hotels will bring <Col N="1626" /> tourists who would not otherwise come, and we shall have the benefit of their spending.  I might mention something I know personally.  On one occasion I suggested that a certain international conference might be held in Dublin, and the question put to me was: &ldquo;How many hotels with bathrooms have you in the city?&rdquo; Our number was too low.  I am not saying it was a disaster that that conference did not come here, but it shows our city is not as well equipped with hotels as many of the capital cities in Europe and elsewhere.  If those who are running these big hotels in other countries wish to come here, I do not see why they should not be encouraged to do so.</P>

      <P>Senator Fitzpatrick also raised the question of some trouble the Minister for Justice had with certain judges lately.  I would not like to speak on that, because if I defended one, I might offend the other&mdash;and I do not want to offend either the Minister or the judges.  However, I think Senator McGlinchey gave a good account of what happened in Letterkenny.  Senator Fitzpatrick said that technically the Minister had power to do what he did. If that is so, I do not see why there should be such a row about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Verolme cases was also criticised. I know it is the business of Deputies and Senators to prevent the Government spending money unnecessarily, as they thought in this case.  I am quite prepared to listen to criticism of that kind and to accept it is made in good <Col N="1627" /> faith, but I should like to put this to Senators.  In this case they got no grant of any kind from this country.  They got loans, but no grants whatever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator would just listen to me.  It was calculated that, if the legislation had been in operation when they came, they would have got so much, so in the circumstances it was a fair enough proposition to consider giving them that grant.  It is true that money is being lost on shipbuilding there, but that applies to the whole world.  In many cases, they are subsidised by the Government, and in other cases they have big reserves on which they can fall back.  The fact they are losing is not proof that the concern is incompetent.  In fact, one would expect they would lose more, because the men working there have very little experience, and their skill will probably improve as time goes on.</P>
      <P>I come now to Senator Jessop, who said the accommodation for primary education is very poor.  I quite agree. I am sure we could do a lot to get the primary schools into better order.  We are, however, making good progress.  I have not got the figures with me, but Senators can look them up and see that the amount being spent now is very much higher than it was a couple of years ago.  It is going up rapidly, and the number of schools being built and repaired is also going up.  Of course, it will take a long time before all the schools are as well constructed as one would like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also have a note of the Senator's comments on capital expenditure in the city on teaching hospitals.  I agree that many of the teaching hospitals are not at all up to standard and that we should try to meet the position as far as we can.  When I was Minister for Health, I was quite prepared at that <Col N="1628" /> time to provide the money and some of them were making preparations for going ahead.  Things have moved very slowly since then.  In fact, no progress has been made, and that is practically ten years ago.  I also hope that the dental hospital problem has been solved by recent agreements which have been made.</P>
    <P>As regards Senator Ross's speech, I do not accuse him of saying you should measure education by the expenditure, but we have to be careful we are not too impressed, let us say when we hear the State is putting very much more into it in England than here.  Maybe they are spending money lavishly and that we are a bit parsimonious, but there should be a medium&mdash;maybe nearer to our figures than theirs &mdash; which would be the ideal.  As far as I am concerned as Minister for Finance, I am always ready to consider any proposals the Minister for Education may make in matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>I do not claim a very wide experience, but my impression from meeting young people from England is that they are not a bit better educated than our people leaving secondary schools.  I have met teachers who have taught in both countries, and they bear that out.  They say our people are as well taught as they are in England, but that they do not show their education as well as the English boy or girl.  I am only mentioning that.  I am not to be taken as sure of my ground on that; I am only giving an opinion.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald asked about the wheat levy.  The Minister for Agriculture has to have two figures confirmed before he can speak about the wheat levy: first, the census of acreage, which he has now got, although it has not been published yet; and, second, the expected yield.  His inspectors have to make a forecast of what the yield is likely to be.  Having got that, he comes to a conclusion on whether the levy is necessary or not. As far as I know the figures, I would be prepared to bet there will be no levy this year.  That is not official.  The Minister for Agriculture may have different ideas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1629" /> On the question of ESB charges, the ESB were set up as a commercial body to make ends meet.  They are supposed to collect the revenue which will pay their outgoings and, as everybody knows, the main outgoing is in the form of interest charges.  They cannot be changed and no economy can be made as far as they are concerned. The only way in which the Government have interfered is in giving a subsidy for rural electrification of about £13½ million which is a fairly substantial subsidy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the closing of CIE lines, I do not think any public opinion could be as good an index as to whether a branch line should be closed as the amount of support given to that branch line when in operation.  If the people do not support it, it means that public opinion is that it is not worth supporting and, therefore, CIE have every right to proceed on the lines they are going as far as these branch lines are concerned.</P>
    <P>Another point made was that we are not proceeding as quickly as we should in respect of the telephone service. Two years ago, the amount provided for telephones was £2.5 million, last year it was £3.5 million and this year it is £4.5 million.  Going up at the rate of £1 million a year is a fairly substantial step.  This matter is not governed by the amount of money the Minister for Finance is prepared to give.  It is entirely governed by the trained staff that can be provided by the Post Office itself.</P>
    <P>I now come to Senator Carton's point about the Army men who left the Army and went into Government service of one kind or another and whose pensions from the Army, because they are now in Government service, are abated or completely withheld. That is a very old ruling.  It has been there as long as the Civil Service and it has always been a principle that if a man goes from one branch of Government service into another, his pension is abated.  The usual rule is that he must not receive a higher salary than he was receiving when he retired from the original post on pension.  I think myself that that ruling is a bit out of date and, as a result of Senator <Col N="1630" /> Carton raising the point, I think it is a matter that we should examine again. I shall give that undertaking now but I am only saying that we are going to examine it.</P>
    <P>Another point made by Senator Carton was that officers were brought into the Civil Service with four years incremental service.  That is not uncommon. The Civil Service Commissioners advertise a job and give the commencing salary with increments of, say, £20 a year and so on.  They sometimes add, in the case of a person of experience, that increments may be given, and that is done.  If a person has three years experience, he starts off at the point where he would have reached if he had been three years in the job. The men mentioned by Senator Carton got increments of four years but that does not entitle them to four years for pension purposes.  As far as an IRA pension is concerned, it is not abatable.  It was abatable at one time but, for some years back, the pension is payable, whether a man is working in the Government service or in any Government Department.</P>
    <P>There is also a provision that a pensioner cannot draw two pensions for the same period.  If I might give an example, take teachers who were at work before 1917 or 1918 and who felt it their duty to leave their posts and go out and fight for the IRA during the War of Independence.  They were dismissed at that time and were afterwards reinstated and got their service back to the time they went out.  Actually under the Bill, they would be entitled to a teacher's pension from the time they went out in 1918 until they went back in 1923 or 1924.  At the same time, they got a military service pension for 1920 and 1921.  However, they cannot draw two pensions for the same period.  They have a choice.  Either they can take the teacher's pension or the military service pension, but not the two and, of course, the choice which is usually made is the more profitable one.</P>

The Minister has admitted that there was a delay in supplying the accounts as required by the Insurance Acts. Because of that, while I would not go so far as to say that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was deliberately neglectful, I would say that the fact that he allowed the delay involved him in culpability which must be taken up by the Government.</P>

      <Col N="1633" /> Senators will be well aware of the functions of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company which is charged, generally, with promoting the welfare of Shannon Airport, with particular emphasis on the encouragement of commercial, industrial and trading enterprises at the Airport.  While the stimulation of passenger and freight traffic through the Airport remains a primary concern of the company, it was realised at an early stage of the company's existence that the greatest scope for its energies lay in the development of the Industrial Estate and the taking advantage of the attractions for industry which already existed at Shannon, namely, freedom from customs restrictions, enjoyment of certain taxation privileges and proximity to an international airport holding a key position between America and Europe.</P>
    <P>In order further to encourage the setting up of industries at the airport, factory buildings which may be rented are provided by the company.  Factories may also be purchased outright or may be built on sites leased from the company with the aid of grants from the company.  Grants are also made available for machinery and for the training of workers.  Houses for employees of the Industrial Estate are provided by the company at reasonable rents or to purchase and developed sites are made available for executive-type houses and for speculative building.</P>
    <P>The share capital subscribed to the company has been used for the provision of factory buildings and dwelling houses, and associated services, the rents from which go to supplement the company's grants-in-aid.  The repayable advances have been used to meet one-half of the expenditure by the company on the provision of housing. The grants-in-aid are applied towards meeting the company's running expenses and providing financial assistance to industries including grants towards factory buildings, new machinery and the training of workers.  The finances provided to the company under existing legislation up to 30th June, 1963, were as follows:</P>

    <P>Of these amounts, £2,270,000 has been expended on the Industrial Estate, £1,040,000 on the Housing Estate, £492,000 on grants to industrialists and £413,500 on the running expenses of the company.  It is now urgently necessary to increase the limits under existing legislation to enable the company to continue to function.</P>
    <P>The company was set up a little over four years ago.  I think it will be agreed that their record in that short time has been one of considerable achievement.  Senators had the opportunity about a year ago of seeing for themselves what has been accomplished on the industrial and housing estates.  At 30th June, 1963, 12 factories and six trading enterprises were in operation and a total of 1,698 workers were employed of whom 917 were male and 781 female.  This employment has approximately doubled the number of persons employed at the Airport.  The output of these factories, practically all of which is exported, includes products as diverse as pianos and floor polishers, electronic equipment and knitwear, diamond drills and radios.</P>
    <P>Twenty-six standard factory premises and three smaller premises were completed all but one of which were occupied. Together with a special factory constructed by an industrialist with the aid of a grant from the company, the total area of factory space as at 30th June, 1963, was 509,190 square feet.  Eight standard factory premises are under construction giving a total area of factory space when these are completed of 656,940 square feet. Ancillary services including water, sewerage, electricity and a boiler-house have also been provided.  Thirty-eight houses and 137 flats have been built and 158 houses are under construction or contracted for.  Thirty-five houses and 123 flats are already occupied.  A community centre comprising a shop, bank and recreation hall has been provided and four shops are under construction.  Arrangements are also in train for the provision of other <Col N="1635" /> amenities necessary for a growing population.</P>
    <P>Five existing industries are expected to require additional factory premises in the near future and new industries are expected to be set up in the next year with a considerable expansion in employment.  Plans are in hand for the construction of six further factory premises.  By the middle of 1964, the company's factory building programme is expected to comprise 40 standard factories completed or under construction and three small factories completed, eight warehousing units, a boiler house and a commercial office block. While a certain amount of factory accommodation must be provided in anticipation of actual demand, factories are built on the basis of likely demand and building programmes are sanctioned on this basis.  It is, of course, impossible to foresee exactly the extent of future development but the increase in the share capital to £4 million should be sufficient for the time being.</P>
    <P>Housing is provided in parallel with industrial development, of which it is an integral part.  Shannon is in a somewhat isolated position and it is essential in order to attract workers who do not reside within convenient reach of the Airport, that a sufficiency of living accommodation at reasonable rents be provided so as to cater for both married and unmarried workers desiring to live adjacent to their work.  It is necessary to strike a balance between planning on an over-ambitious scale so that houses might be left unoccupied and on the other hand under-planning to the extent that workers would be discouraged from taking up employment at the Airport because of the lack of suitable accommodation.</P>
    <P>Housing is, therefore, provided on a minimum but expandable basis. This means that the schemes are planned to meet the known demand but that they are expandable to meet very quickly new requirements which may arise.  The company is careful to keep in line with Governmental and local authority requirements in its planning and construction of houses <Col N="1636" /> and its aim is to develop the housing estate in accordance with the best principles of town planning.  Because of its isolated position and the need to develop sites and to provide services, the cost of housing at Shannon is relatively high, but contracts are placed by open tendering which ensures that costs are kept at a competitive level.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on housing and community services up to 30th June, 1963, provided out of share capital and repayable advances amounted to £1,040,000.  Under existing legislation, repayable advances up to a maximum of £400,000 could be made to the company to meet one-half of the expenditure on housing.  The Bill provides that all expenditure on the provision of dwellings and community services, including expenditure already defrayed out of share capital, will now be met by way of repayable advances.  These advances are repayable over a period of 50 years at the current Exchequer lending rate, this being the basis on which advances are made for local authority housing.  With the increase in the limit on repayable advances to £2 million a further £960,000 will be available to meet expenditure on housing after 30th June, 1963.  In addition to housing for factory workers, the company provides developed sites for executive-type houses and for speculative building on the basis of the recovery of the full cost of development.  As at 30th June, 1963, 20 sites had been provided for executive-type houses.  The company are anxious to encourage speculative building at the Airport and are in negotiation with a number of builders in the matter.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the payment from the Transport and Power Vote of a subsidy in respect of each dwelling or other unit of accommodation constructed by the company.  The subsidy is necessary because the rents which it is considered the workers may reasonably be expected to pay fall short of the full economic rents.  The economic rents are calculated on the full cost of construction after deduction of the equivalent of the normal housing grants available to private persons <Col N="1637" /> under the Housing Acts.  In the early years, the subsidy will be relatively high but provision is made in the rental agreements for increases in the rents as wages generally increase thus reducing the amount of the subsidy required.  Capital grants equivalent to the grants available to persons under the Housing Acts will also be payable and this is provided for in the Bill.  The payment of these grants will be subject to compliance by the company with requirements similar to those laid down by the Housing Acts in the case of grants payable under these Acts.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for an increase from £1.25 million to £2 million in the aggregate amount of grants payable to the company.  These grants provide for the running expenses of the company and also enable the company to pay grants to industrialists for buildings, machinery and the training of workers.  Grants paid to the company up to 30th June 1963, amounted to £905,500.  In addition, the company received £141,500 by way of rents and other income.  £555,000 was used by the company for its running expenses and grants were made to industrialists as follows:</P>

    <P>While the company's most fruitful field of operation lies in the development of the industrial estate, it should also be remembered that a primary purpose of the setting up of the company was to stimulate passenger and freight traffic through the Airport. The combined number of transit and terminal passengers using the Airport decreased only slightly in 1962 over 1961 but the company is urgently concerned to secure Shannon's share of the traffic growth on the North Atlantic as well as to attract passengers from Britain and the Continent. The evolution of faster and longer-range aircraft is necessarily having an adverse effect on transit traffic through the Airport but the company has set up a Travel Promotion Department to take advantage of the opportunites which undoubtedly exist for the development of tourist traffic through the Airport.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1638" /> In its tourist promotion activities, the company, of course, co-operates fully with other tourist promotion bodies including Bord Fáilte and the air companies.  The success of the local tour arranged for tourists taking in places of scenic and historical interest and culminating in the medieval banquet in the restored Bunratty Castle is an example of what can be achieved by imaginative planning.  A further development will be the establishment of a Folk Park in conjunction with the Bunratty Castle project.  I myself visited the Folk Park at Arnhem and was so utterly convinced of its national value and attraction to tourists that I suggested a similar development to the Shannon company. I am glad to say that the initial problems have now been solved and that a Folk Park will shortly be added to the attractions of the Shannon region.</P>
    <P>The cost will be borne equally by the company, Bord Fáilte and an amenity grant from the Department of Local Government.  The park will be operated by the Shannon company in conjunction with Bunratty Castle.  This scheme for a very attractive Folk Village in the grounds of Bunratty Castle has been devised with the cooperation and advice of the Folklore Commission.  The village will consist of authentic examples of rural dwellings typical of the Shannon region and illustrating the rural way of life in past times&mdash;from the early 19th century onwards.  In the first stage, the village will comprise a bothán scoir, a cottier's house, a forge, a West Clare farmhouse, a West Kerry fisherman's house and a farmhouse from the Shannon area.  These older dwellings are quickly disappearing from the countryside and in preserving examples of them, the Folk Village will represent an historically correct reproduction which will be useful to students of the future as well as being a point of great interest for tourists.  The houses will be furnished in the style of the period to which they relate and it is a sign of the remarkable change in the way of life in the country that it is already difficult to obtain examples of the household goods and utensils which were in common use as recently as our own boyhood.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1639" /> The main objective of the promotion drive is to establish Shannon Airport as the natural gateway for American visitors to the south-western and western areas with all the amenities they offer for mountain, lake and shore scenery, fishing, golfing, hunting and archaeological study.  In this connection may I repeat what I have said earlier.  Neither the Shannon company, Bord Fáilte nor the national airline alone can promote tourist development at a sufficient pace to offset the inevitable decline of transit traffic at the airport.  Regional tourist associations equipped by local authorities and other local interests with promotional funds representing a percentage of tourist spending in the areas can help to create their own image of each tourist area, can stimulate group hotel publicity, encourage group booking, entertain travel writers and agents and can assist in local resort development and in promoting interest in fishing, golf, etc.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the regional tourist association movement is beginning to progress in the area.  Contacts with Americans of Irish origin organised on a regional basis is one example of tourist promotion offering a great potential in the future.  Kerry, Limerick, Clare and Galway&mdash;the Shannon counties&mdash;are competing with regional development competitive promotion work all over Europe.</P>
    <P>The growth of terminal freight traffic through the Airport is slow mainly because of the great disparity at present existing between air and surface rates but as air freight costs lessen, it is expected that the volume of air shipments will increase substantially. Nearly one half of the terminal freight generated at Shannon in 1962 was attributable to the Industrial Estate and in the first quarter of this year air freight generated by the Industrial Estate was up by 15 per cent compared with the first quarter of 1962. Three firms at the Airport engage in freight forwarding and consolidation and two other firms in warehousing operations while two American companies of international repute are considering Shannon as a distribution point for their markets in the UK, Europe, Middle East and Africa.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1640" /> A big expansion in warehousing activities is expected as a result of an extensive campaign publicising the advantages which the Free Airport holds for freight warehousing and distribution.  By the provision of warehouse facilities, air cargo is attracted to the Airport for storage and redistribution. Shannon is very well placed as a centre for entrepôt and distribution operations but to develop the Airport's potential in this field it is necessary to provide adequate facilities. Eight warehousing units, each of about 3,500 square feet, are being provided initially by the company with provision for expansion to meet demand.  The introduction recently by Pan American Airways of an all cargo Boeing jet freighter service through Shannon linking cities in the United States with important European and Middle East centres should also provide a very considerable fillip to the growth of air freight through the airport while the company are active in endeavouring to secure improved cargo rates, improved services including increased frequencies and speedy clearance at destinations, and the publicising of the facilities available by air.</P>
    <P>There is no reason to believe that the outlook for the future of the Estate is other than bright but we must, of course, combine optimism with prudence. The concept of an Industrial Estate at Shannon was a revolutionary and, therefore, speculative one.  That so much has been achieved in such a short time justifies the bold and imaginative experiment undertaken four years ago and I am convinced that it will continue to play its important part in the economy.  The financial limits proposed in this Bill are realistic though they may perhaps be a little on the tight side since they represent only the minimum financing which the company will require in the next few years.  If I have to come back to the Seanad before that time, I will make no apology as the need for further finances will be a measure of the company's success.  In the meantime, it is with confidence that I ask for your approval for this Bill, in giving which you will have expressed your satisfaction <Col N="1641" /> with the achievements of the company to date and your confidence in its continued progress.  For my own part, I wish to congratulate the Board and management of the company and also the management of the various enterprises in the Estate on the results achieved and to urge them to even greater efforts in the future.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>What we are doing in this Bill is further financing the Shannon Development Company, which seems to have run into certain difficulties.  I sincerely hope that what we are doing today will be successful. I also hope there will be a full investigation and inquiry before the people's money is pledged to any factories.  We are giving here a blood transfusion, as it were.  I hope more blood will not be needed.  I hope the patient will improve immediately and remain in good health in the future.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in the course of his speech, stated:</P>
      <P>There is no reason to believe that the outlook for the future of the Estate is other than bright but we must, of course, combine optimism with prudence.</P>
      <P>I entirely agree with the Minister there.  I hope there will be prudence. This morning here a Senator referred to an article which appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> on 17th of this month. From that it will be seen that many of the companies to which we have subscribed in the past are now running into certain difficulties.  As the watchdogs of the taxpayers' money it is our duty to see that, while there is optimism, that optimism is tempered with prudence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past few years, millions of public money, according to the article, have been sunk in what now look like doubtful propositions.  Indeed, there is public disquiet at the amount of public money that has been gambled in some shaky propositions and the amount of money that has had to be voted over the past few years to keep these shaky propositions staggering along.  We were told a few years ago that the Verolme enterprise was one of <Col N="1642" /> the greatest industries that could be established in this country.  Only last week it was in difficulties and we had to vote almost £1 million of the taxpayers' money to keep it going.  We sincerely hope this, and all the other projects, will succeed and become viable propositions in the future.</P>
    <P>Every one of us, no matter how we may disagree at times on matters political, is interested in the future of our country and in providing employment for our own people here at home. I will not refer to this money as &ldquo;slush&rdquo; money, though that was the manner in which the Minister himself in a speech in Kilkenny a number of years ago described the money we were spending at the time on housing. We believed the houses were necessary. We believed the money was well spent. The Minister did not agree.  He described the money as &ldquo;slush&rdquo; money.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for giving these grants to factories in the Shannon development area was in the hope that these factories would export their products through Shannon Airport.  I wonder if the Minister would give us some more information on that aspect. What is happening?  I have been informed&mdash;I may be wrong; the Minister has more information than I have&mdash; that many of these companies are exporting over land and by sea.  Is it a fact they are finding it more economical to send their goods by road to Northern Ireland and by sea from there to Britain and elsewhere?  Was Oireachtas Éireann not asked to provide money for these companies in order to ensure that they would use air transport from Shannon?  Was it not the intention that these companies would help to keep Shannon Airport going?  I should like to know is there any clause in their contracts under which they could be asked if possible &mdash;I suppose we could not make them &mdash;to use Shannon Airport as well.  The amount of money being voted in this Bill seems to be a very expensive buttressing of the Shannon Area by the people in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>Everyone concerned with this project should be congratulated.  We are seeking to build and foster at Shannon a community where no community <Col N="1643" /> existed in the past, to have work where no work existed, to build houses where no houses existed, and to bring the people to a place where there were no people in the past, and to enable them to support themselves and live their lives in the houses that are being provided. I wish all that work success. The Irish people have made a great investment of hard-earned money in it. As the Minister has pointed out, almost 2,000 people are employed there, and it provides them with their bread and butter.</P>
    <P>Most of us realise that the real danger to the Shannon development area, the Airport and the surrounding area, lies in the struggle to make Dublin the major transatlantic terminal.  If that struggle succeeded, Shannon might well be doomed, and all that Irish investment might very well be lost.  I believe it is wrong to have everything centred in Dublin.  There is too much &mdash;and too many&mdash;in Dublin already. It has often been said in the past that Dublin is growing too big.  The country is beginning to look like a small child with a big head; the head seems to be getting bigger and bigger and he will be brought down in a short time unless something is done to build up the rest of the body.  Therefore, I hope this hidden struggle to make Dublin the international terminal does not succeed.  Tribute is due to the Government for resisting that struggle for so long.  I sincerely hope this project is successful and that it will give employment to many more people in the area.</P>

      <Col N="1644" /> Industrial development at Shannon is making a major contribution to the national economy in a region where such development is of vital importance.  It is providing employment for significant numbers of our people at reasonable cost to the public purse, in an environment where modern industrial skills and techniques are applied for the purpose of manufacturing goods for export with resulting benefit to the country's foreign trade and balance of payments position.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to hear the statement by Senator L'Estrange that he wishes the project every success.  I commend him for his statesmanlike approach to the matter.  I was very glad also to hear the Minister's reference to the decision of Pan American Airways to route their jet freighters through Shannon.  That, to my mind, is one of the most encouraging signs that people who know what they are doing in the world of business have confidence in the future of Shannon Airport and its Industrial Estate.  I understand the Pan American Company are now using the Airport as a transshipment point for Britain, Southern Europe and the Middle East.  They are operating eight flights a week through Shannon.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the statement made recently by their Irish manager, Mr. Con McGovern.  When he referred to that project, he said that most European air terminals are so congested that delays in loading and unloading are inevitable.  His company consider the prospects of operating through Shannon are very good in view of the free industrial zone and the warehouse facilities which could easily be expanded.  He emphasised that this new development reflects the serious interest Pan American Airways have in Shannon, with which they have been in contact for 26 years.</P>
    <P>When the Minister mentioned the Pan American decision to route their big jet freighters to Shannon, I could not help thinking with pleasure of the early days when Pan American blazed the trail across the Atlantic with their Clipper service to Foynes.  In the early days, they were one of the first props of Shannon Airport.  I am glad to say <Col N="1645" /> we are now beginning to appreciate the efforts which have been made to develop this great project.  We are seeing the fruits of the work which the company have put into it since the beginning.</P>
    <P>It is good to know also that when the company started in 1959 there were 83,000 terminal passengers at Shannon.  Last year they numbered over 180,000.  The factories in the Industrial Estate are rapidly expanding their freight, and I hope, as Senator L'Estrange said, an endeavour will be made to induce any companies producing freight to avail of the air freight facilities rather than overland and motor transport.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us the amount of employment given in the Industrial Estate, and I was glad to read in a recent newspaper article that wages and salaries in Shannon have risen from £962,000 in 1959, to £2,300,000 last year.  That increase of £1,300,000 is a good sign of progress.  Another sign of the confidence which business people have in the future of the Airport and the industrial zone, is the fact that in the Shannon region five first-class hotels have recently been opened.  When business people put their money into concerns of that nature, in what might be described as an isolated part of the country, to my mind, that is a sign of their belief in its future.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the new warehouse project.  It is well to remember that when they are finished, something like 100,000 square feet of warehousing space will be available to American manufacturers, who undoubtedly will give serious consideration to the advantage they would gain from using Shannon not only as a storage point, but as a transshipment point to the European Common Market area or the European Free Trade area.</P>
    <P>One other point that struck me as being of some consequence was the fact that Shannon's importance as a freight centre is best shown by the fact that it occupies seventh place in a total of 17 European airports.  The Irish people can be proud of the fact that in that great Airport, and the Industrial <Col N="1646" /> Estate, there are facilities which will go to make it a hive of industry in the future.</P>
    <P>Senators will remember, I am sure with pleasure, the visit we paid, at the invitation of the companies down there, to Shannon and its industrial zone last year.  I am sure they were impressed, as I was, by the business like efficiency of the factories which have gone into production, and by the businesslike efficiency in the housing schemes which were then in course of progress.  I am glad to know the housing project continues, and that it will be extended as occasion demands.  This is in every way a desirable Bill and I am confident the Seanad will expedite its passage.</P>

      <P>We must all be very pleased to see a development of this kind in the west of Ireland where there is so much running down of population in towns and villages.  Therefore, anything that can be done to back up a project like that at Shannon Airport must have support from all of us. Anybody who has seen it must be pleased at the way this scheme has been planned.  When the first idea did not seem to materialise, we were all naturally apprehensive as to where we would go from there.  However, it does seem there is every possibility of creating a new town with a modern form of life.</P>
      <P>What is obviously wrong with the towns in the west of Ireland&mdash;and the further you go from Dublin the more apparent it is&mdash;is that the towns offer no incentive to the younger people to stay and to live in them.  One thing that has made an improvement in villages and towns throughout the country is the Tidy Towns Scheme. That in itself has made these places look brighter and better.  They are being painted and being modernised but not fast enough to retain the younger element of population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often expressed the view, on the question of industrial development, that it was a mistake to try to establish industries here, there and everywhere.  That sort of fragmentation of industrial development has no economic future, no real attraction.  It can only be done through subsidies <Col N="1647" /> and all sorts of artificial means.  In Shannon, there is the proper kind of development.  It is a development where there is a concentration of labour, a concentration of skilled workers and of social life.</P>
    <P>The difficulty about isolated development is that if a single industry is established, people are trained for that industry.  It costs a lot to train them but when they get a skill, they go to the more populous areas where they will have social life and will be well paid for their skill.  Unfortunately in the past that has meant Dublin, Cork, Limerick or England.  I should like to see more Shannons and I hope that in the future we shall have them.</P>
    <P>Another point I was very pleased to see in the Minister's statement was in relation to the development of the Folk Park.  That is a splendid idea. The Minister says there is one in Holland. There is also a well-known development of this kind in Barcelona in Spain where all the Spanish industries and all the Spanish forms of country life can be seen.  All the local industries are enabled to show their goods and sell them to visitors from all over the world.  Not only is the Folk Park a good idea but the castle at Bunratty is a cultural development of the highest quality, in spite of the carping criticism one hears from people from time to time who do not know what they are talking about.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a similar development near Dublin.  The folk life of Ireland has its sad side, the mud cabins, and so on but there was a good folk life in Ireland and it is the good things that should be projected into view.  Anybody who passes into or out of Leinster House cannot but see the regular flow of people who go into our museum, but the museum, owing to lack of space, can show only certain objects such as the Celtic arts of the middle ages.  There is scope for showing the folk life of Ireland of the 19th and particularly the 20th century, the transition period after the Treaty before the advent of modern living, modern bathrooms and so on, which is very good but the other side of Irish life should be shown as part of our heritage.  I commend the Minister <Col N="1648" /> for establishing this Folk Park in Bunratty.  I hope the example of Shannon will be followed and that we shall have strong pockets of industry in other parts of the country as well. I have pleasure in supporting this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senator L'Estrange, Senator McGuire and Senator Ó Maoláin for the very helpful way in which they spoke.  It is a great delight to me to be able to present this Bill in an atmosphere of encouragement to the development of Shannon Airport.  I can be truthful in my views on the Shannon Estate when I say the total all-in cost of the Shannon Estate calculated by any method and related to the number of workers employed is not excessive and is not extravagant in comparison with other industries established elsewhere. The subsidies we have to pay when compared with subsidies provided by local authorities in the neighbouring district are not excessive.  Some of the most famous and well-established companies in the world have chosen Shannon for their factories and that is an excellent advertisement in itself. Therefore, we can be reasonably optimistic about the future of the Shannon Industrial Estate.</P>
      <P>In regard to freight, Shannon Free Airport Development Company cannot insist on industries established there making use solely of their freight service.  They now have got to the stage when they can be reasonably selective as between the different firms which apply for factory space, and they are trying to select the type of firm, the nature of whose industry makes it economic to export by air freight, light engineering industries, industries where, from the point of view of damage to goods, the high cost of raw materials transported over long distances, air freight is dictated. The only figure I can give Senator L'Estrange is that roughly 50 per cent of the goods produced at the Shannon Industrial Estate are exported by air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The big competitor in this regard is the container, and the development of the container in regard to Irish traffic is comparatively recent for various reasons.  All I can say is that if one <Col N="1649" /> looks at the general development of air traffic all over the world, air freight and air passenger traffic have become more and more competitive with surface facilities, and so we can look forward to the growth of air freight traffic at the Airport as new knowledge finds ways of making air transport more economical.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire spoke of the necessity of brightening the towns of Ireland.  I am glad he mentioned the Tidy Towns Scheme.  We hope the Folk Park will be attractive to people. I should like to see other examples of folk villages elsewhere in the country. I trust the Folk Village at Bunratty and the new Folk Museum at the Royal Hospital will together be able to show some of our heritage.  I think I have answered all the questions put to me. Once again, I thank the House for their very favourable attitude.</P>

    <P>As Senators will have seen from the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill, the Bill is primarily concerned with giving legislative effect to <Col N="1652" /> the increases in the rates of non-contributory, old age, blind and widows' pensions, children's allowances and unemployment assistance which were announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement on 23rd April last and also the increases in rates of social insurance benefits foreshadowed in that statement.  In addition, the Bill proposes some further improvements in the social assistance and insurance codes and in the Intermittent Unemployment or Wet-Time Insurance Scheme.</P>
    <P>For the convenience of Senators, I will deal first with the social assistance increases and improvements which are intended to come into operation on 1st November next.  The increases proposed in the rates of non-contributory old age and blind pensions are 2/6d. a week which will bring the new rates of those pensions to 35/-, 30/-, 25/-, 20/-, 15/- and 10/-, according to the means of the pensioner as set out in the table to Section 2.</P>
    <P>A recipient of unemployment assistance will get an increase of 2/6d. a week in respect of himself and a similar increase for an adult dependant, if he has one.  This will make the maximum rate for a married man with a dependant wife but no dependant children 47/6d. a week in an urban area, and 39/6d. in a rural area.  The rates of widows' non-contributory pension are also to be increased by 2/6d. a week and the proposed new rates are shown in the table in Section 4.</P>
    <P>The children's allowances scheme is being extended by the payment of an allowance at the rate of 10/- a month in respect of the first child in a household. This will result not only in payment being made for the first child in each of the existing families in receipt of allowances &mdash; some 225,000 in all &mdash; but will provide allowances for an estimated 84,000 one-child families who are not at present receiving allowances. In addition, the rate of allowance for the third and each subsequent qualified child in a household is to be increased by 4/6d. a month from 22/- at present to 26/6d. The effect of these increased payments can, perhaps, <Col N="1653" /> best be shown by a few examples &mdash; the monthly allowance for a family of three children for instance will go up from £1 17s. 6d. to £2 12s. 0d. while for a family of five, the new rate will be £5 5s. 0d. as against £4 1s. 6d.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, some other improvements on the Social Assistance side are also included in the Bill.  The first of these relates to non-contributory old age and blind pensions and is, in fact, dealt with in Section 2 of the Bill. The increase of 2/6d. in each rate of pension would result in a new minimum pension rate of 10/-, which would be payable where the yearly means of the pensioner exceeded £117 15s. but did not exceed £130 15s.  As the weekly rates of Old Age Pension vary, according to the means of the pensioner, by steps of 5/-, it has been decided to add a further step by introducing a rate of pension of 5/-weekly to be payable where the yearly means exceed £130 15s. but do not exceed £143 15s.  This is in line with last year's Act under which two new rates were added at the bottom of the scale giving a new minimum rate of pension of 7/6d. which, under the present Bill, is to be increased to 10/-. The new step is included in the Table in Section 2.</P>
    <P>A second improvement concerns widows' non-contributory pensions where at present an allowance as part of pension may be paid only in respect of a child who normally resides with a widow and who resided with her or her husband immediately before he died or who, being a child or step-child of the husband, became normally resident with the widow after his death. It is now proposed that this allowance should also be paid in respect of a grand-child of the widow or her late husband, a child or step-child of the widow or a child who is adopted by the widow after her husband's death&mdash; the basic qualification still being that the child is normally resident with the widow within the meaning of the rules made for that purpose under the Children's Allowances Acts.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to ease the method of calculating the value of capital or property invested or capable <Col N="1654" /> of investment for purposes of the non-contributory widows' or orphans' pension scheme.  Since that scheme was introduced in 1935, the yearly value of such capital or property has been calculated by ignoring the first £25, taking 5 per cent of the next £375 and 10 per cent of any excess over £400. The same method has applied in relation to non-contributory old age pensions since 1919, where it can be justified on the basis that it gives a means assessment commensurate with the return that may be obtained by surrendering the capital for an annuity at age 70.  It operates too severely in relation to widows under that age, especially those with children and I feel sure that Senators will agree that some concession is justified in the case of widows to assist them in making the serious economic adjustment with which the great majority of them are normally faced on the death of the husband and particularly in relation to the education of any children which they may have.</P>
    <P>It is therefore proposed that for widows' and orphans' pensions purposes the amount of capital to be ignored should be increased from £25 to £100 in all cases, that a further sum of £100 should be ignored for each qualified child normally residing with a widow, and that any remaining balance should be assessed at 5 per cent.  The revised method of assessment would for example allow a widow with two qualified children to qualify for a pension at minimum rate if she has capital amounting to £3,955 as against £2,040 at present.</P>
    <P>The yearly cost of the proposed social assistance increases and improvements is estimated at £4,000,000, comprised of £761,000 in respect of non-contributory old age and blind pensions, £181,000 in respect of unemployment assistance, £178,000 in respect of non-contributory widows' pensions and £2,880,000 in respect of children's allowances, including £1,857,000 in respect of the new allowance for the first child.  In the current financial year, the cost will be in the region of £1,688,000 since the increases take effect from the beginning of November next.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1655" /> I now come to the provisions of the Bill relating to social insurance schemes.  Section 15 of the Bill provides for an increase of 5/- weekly in the basic personal rates of disability and unemployment benefit, maternity allowance, widow's (contributory) pension and old age (contributory) pension for an increase of 4/- a week in the special weekly rate of disability and unemployment benefit for married women and persons under 18 years. Provision is also made to increase the allowances payable in respect of adult dependants by 5/- in the case of unemployment and disability benefit and 2/6d. in the case of old age (contributory) pension.  The increased rates of disability and unemployment benefit and maternity allowance and of the associated dependants' allowances will come into effect on the 6th January, 1964.  The new rates of widows' (contributory) pension and old age (contributory) pension and the allowances payable with them, will come into effect on 3rd January, 1964, the first normal payday in the New Year.</P>
    <P>Senators will appreciate that these increased rates of benefit will heavily increase expenditure from the Social Insurance Fund and an increase in rates of contribution by employers and insured persons is, therefore, unavoidable. New rates of employment contributions are provided for in Section 14, while increases in rates of voluntary contribution are provided for in Section 8.  The maximum increase in employment contribution is 1/4d. per week, or 8d. each for employer and insured person, in the case of those contributions which count for all benefits.  Contributions which give title to limited number of benefits are being increased by an amount related to the cost of the increases in those benefits only.  A table comparing the existing contribution rates with the new rates which will be effective from 6th January, 1964, is given in the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the increased contributions by employers and workers will increase the income of the Social Insurance Fund by £1,718,000 <Col N="1656" /> a year.  The increases and improvements in social insurance benefits provided in this Bill will cost the Social Insurance Fund an estimated additional £2,379,000.  The additional excess of expenditure over income to be borne by the State will thus amount to £661,000 in a full year making the total State contribution to the Fund about £8,643,000 in a full year, some 36.5 per cent of the total income of the Fund.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes some provisions designed to clarify the law and effect some improvements in relation to social insurance.  A reduced rate of employment contributions which does not count for unemployment benefit purposes is paid in respect of females employed in domestic service.  The term &ldquo;domestic service&rdquo; as originally defined in the Social Welfare Act, 1952, was intended to confine the expression to domestic service given in the home. However, difficulties of interpretation have since arisen and provision is made in Section 7 to ensure that domestic service rendered mainly in relation to the students in a boarding school or college is not to be regarded as domestic service for insurance purposes. The opportunity is also being taken to bring the position in regard to insurability of pensionable teachers in Domestic Science Training Colleges into line with that of pensionable national, secondary and vocational teachers generally.  Pensionable teachers in domestic science training colleges are at present compulsorily insurable for all benefits and pay contributions at the full rate.  However, as they are pensionable, their position is no different to that of pensionable teachers in National, Secondary or Vocational schools, for whom contributions at reduced rates, which reckon only for widows' and orphans' pensions purposes, are payable and Section 9 of the Bill makes provision to enable them to be similarly treated for insurance purposes.</P>
    <P>Some improvements are being effected in the old age (contributory) pension scheme.  In the first place, the existing provision for continuation of payment of adult dependant's allowance to former adult dependants of <Col N="1657" /> deceased pensioners is being replaced by provision that the widow of a pensioner will automatically qualify for a widow's (contributory) pension which will be higher than the allowance and which will also attract additions for her children under age 16, if any.  The allowance as a former adult dependant will continue to be payable to widowers of deceased female old age (contributory) pensioners but the rate will correspond with the rate of widow's contributory pension.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes a provision whereby regulations may be made under which the allowance for a wife or dependent husband as part of old age (contributory) pension may, in certain circumstances, be paid to the dependant.  Under existing law the pension, including the allowance, must be paid in full to the pensioner.  This can result in hardship or serious inconvenience where the husband and wife, due to circumstances outside their control, live at different addresses, for example, where both are in need of nursing and are taken in by different relations, or where the husband fails in his obligation to maintain his wife.  In this connection I might mention that if the wife is over 70 she is disqualified for receiving a non-contributory old age pension where her husband qualifies for a dependant's allowance in respect of her as part of his contributory old age pension.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to social insurance, provision is made in Section 12 to enable payment of an allowance for a child as part of widow's (contributory) pension to be made for a child, grand-child, step-child or adopted child of the widow or her husband who comes to live with the widow after her husband's death.  I dealt with a similar concession in relation to non-contributory widow's pension earlier.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the wet-time insurance scheme, Senators will recall that this is a scheme of insurance which provides for payment of benefit to workers in the building, civil engineering and painting trades, when wages are lost due to stoppages of work caused by bad weather.  Two changes in the scheme, which require legislation, are provided for in this Bill. <Col N="1658" /> There are three classes of insured persons covered by the scheme&mdash;skilled workers, unskilled workers and young persons, each class paying different contributions and receiving different rates of benefit.  At present, a person may not be regarded as a skilled or unskilled worker until the beginning of the insurance year following that in which he attains the age of twenty-one. It is now proposed to reduce this age to eighteen, having regard to conditions generally in the building industry and the fact that the full rates of benefit are payable to male workers under the Social Insurance Scheme from the age of eighteen.</P>
    <P>Again, wet-time insurance benefit is at present not payable for periods of less than an hour included in any period of a stoppage of work.  Arising out of the introduction of the five-day week in the Dublin area, an 8½ hour day is in operation in that area for half of the year and a 7½ hour day for the remainder of the year.  It is proposed therefore to pay wet-time insurance benefit in respect of a fraction of an hour, which is not less than half an hour, where the working day contains such a fraction of an hour and the stoppage of work extends over the full working day.  The rate of payment proposed is half the appropriate hourly rate.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, it may be helpful to summarise the cost to the Exchequer of the various proposals which I have outlined.  In relation to Social Assistance, the total costs are estimated to amount to £4 million in a full year and to £1,688,000 in the current financial year.  The cost to the Exchequer of the social insurance proposals is £661,000 in a full year and £250,000 in the current year.  The overall cost to the Exchequer will therefore be £4,661,000 in a full year and £1,938,000 in the present year.</P>
    <P>As a result of all the proposals in this Bill recipients of social welfare payments will benefit to the extent of approximately £6,380,000 in a full year.  It gives me great pleasure to recommend this measure to Seanad Éireann.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the <Col N="1659" /> decision of the Government as announced in the Budget Statement of 23rd April to increase social assistance benefits from 1st November next and other social welfare benefits from 6th January, 1964.  In discussing this Bill, we must take into consideration the entire budgetary proposals of the Government. Everybody agrees that an increase in social welfare benefits is necessary, even if we did not have the Budget proposals, because the cost of living has increased over the past year and we know that the old age pensioners and social welfare recipients were promised in the Budget of 1962 a further increase of 2/6 a week this year.  Therefore, I believe the present increase is not adequate to meet the existing circumstances of the people who receive them, even without waiting for the full impact of the recent Budget, especially the turnover tax.</P>
      <P>It is a well-known fact that this turnover tax, this iniquitous tax on bread, butter, flour, tea, sugar, meat and clothing, will increase the cost of living and therefore I believe the increases being given to the different categories under the Social Welfare Acts will not compensate them.  The Bill is supposed to mitigate the hardships which the continued upward trend of prices over the past few years, especially since the subsidies were removed, has caused to many hapless people and to cushion them against the inevitable further increase in the cost of living that will occur when the turnover tax comes into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of these people are incapable of serious work.  Many of the old age pensioners gave good service in their day and helped to build up the State. They retired when circumstances were easier, when the cost of living was much lower and they looked forward to comfort and security in their old age.  It cannot be denied that hardship does exist among the social welfare categories in our large towns and cities.  In some cases, these hardships are very severe.  Were it not for the St. Vincent de Paul Society and other charitable organisations, we would have severe malnutrition in many large families.  This turnover tax will place <Col N="1660" /> a further heavy burden on those unfortunate people and also on the different charitable organisations doing such valuable work.</P>
    <P>It was admitted by the Minister for Finance in the Dáil that the Finance Bill will increase the cost of food, fuel and clothing of the people by roughly £7½ million pounds per annum.  There will be a further increase of £3 million charged to the other ordinary purchases of the public.  There is very little being done in this Bill to give these unfortunate people justice or fair-play in their old age, in their sickness or in their less happy times.</P>
    <P>If we compare the 35/- a week the old age pensioners will receive on 1st November with the pre-war value of money, the new rate is the equivalent of 11/8d. in terms of 1939 money. Therefore, since 1939, 24 years ago, we have increased the real value of the old age pensions by only 1/8d. per week.  So we can all criticise this Bill on the ground that the increases are meagre, especially when compared with the increases given to the judges last year.  Speaking in the Dáil on that matter the Taoiseach said that we should give them a salary sufficient to put them in a position in which they would be immune from improper influences of any kind.  It is a pity he did not say that the social welfare categories should get benefits that would put them in a position in which they would be immune from hardship of any kind.</P>
    <P>Many people pay lip service to the 1916 Proclamation.  I take one paragraph from that Proclamation and I quote:</P>
    <P>The Republic guarantees equal rights and opportunities to all its citizens, and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness of the whole nation and of all its parts, cherishing the children of the nation equally.</P>
    <P>Can anyone claim that the Government are living up to the 1916 Proclamation in regard to equal rights and opportunities or cherishing all the children of the nation equally by giving a meagre increase of 2/6d. a week to old age pensioners and £14 a week to a High Court judge who already had <Col N="1661" /> £100 a week?  There is a very big difference between £114 a week and £1 15s. a week&mdash;as a matter of fact there is a difference of £112 5s.  Therefore nobody can claim that the Government are living up to the ideal of the 1916 Proclamation of equal opportunities for all and of cherishing all the children of the nation equally.  I do not want to say that because a judge gets £114, old age pensioners or the recipients of social welfare should get the same, but if we thought it right to give those people an increase of £14 a week to cushion them against the cost of living, certainly old age pensioners and widows and orphans are entitled to much more than 2/6d. a week.</P>
    <P>We should remember that social welfare recipients have mouths to feed, families to clothe and the cost of living hits them harder than any other section because they have to live on bread, butter and tea three or four times a day.  I am surprised at a Government, who talk so much about moving to the left treating these people as they are treating them.  The Government by abolishing food subsidies, and now for the first time in our history taxing the necessaries of life and increasing the cost of living, ought to face up to the fact that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Government should face up to the fact that what they are giving with one hand they are taking away with the other.  That is what is being done in this Bill.  A policy of taking from the shoulders of those who can afford it and putting it on to the shoulders of the poor is a revolting social concept.  If it is the Fianna Fáil 20th century moving to the left and economic efficiency, it certainly does not represent social justice for those classes of people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as this Bill may give some increases to the needy sections of the community, we should support it.  When increases are granted in the Budget to the sick, the <Col N="1662" /> aged and widows and orphans and others who rely on social welfare benefits for their maintenance, there is generally a feeling of satisfaction, even though such increases mean an increase in taxation on the general public.  The amounts to be paid to the various social welfare categories under this Bill are insufficient to maintain them in even the most frugal manner.  I should like very much to have been in a position to congratulate the Minister for the increases in this Bill but I would feel something of a hypocrite were I to do so because I do not think they go any distance towards meeting our obligations to our aged citizens.  Even if the 2/6d. increase were to be given in full, it would scarcely meet the increases in prices which have taken place since the last adequate increase. They certainly will not place the people receiving them in a position of comfort and bearing in mind, as has already been said, that the turnover tax will take back a good share of their small increases, there are no grounds for congratulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As was pointed out when the tax was under discussion, persons drawing social welfare benefits must buy their requirements for small amounts, in shillings and halfcrowns, so they will be forced to pay the turnover tax on their food, clothing and other necessaries at a rate much in excess of the 2½ per cent.  I should have liked to see the Minister taking his courage in his hands by giving decent benefits to the sick, the aged and the other social welfare classes. With the turnover tax likely to produce something in the neighbourhood of £11 million it would not have taken a great deal of courage to have asked for the setting aside of a much larger sum than usual to enable these people to meet the increased charges which they soon will have to meet for every item of food and clothing and which at least would place them in a position of reasonable comfort.  The increase in the benefits payable to insured persons is roughly 5/- per week which, if analysed, is really very small, having regard to the fact that insurance contributions will be increased and those concerned will pay <Col N="1663" /> a good slice of the increase by way of the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, replying to the debate on the Finance Bill, said that the Labour Party always opposed taxation while always looking for increases.  I am not quoting the Minister's exact words.  He said that in 1957 the Labour Party opposed all taxation.  I cannot see any evidence to substantiate that statement.  Senator Yeats, without any knowledge at all, echoed the Minister's words, parrotwise. No doubt the Labour Party opposed the 1957 Budget but this was because it worsened, to a considerable degree, the conditions of the workers and the lower income groups. The completion of the withdrawal of the food subsidies was under the 1957 Budget and there followed immediately a steep rise in prices, the details of which are so well known that I need not go over them again.</P>
    <P>By this time, it was also clear to the public that the Prices Advisory Body was doomed to abolition.  Speaking in the Dáil on the Budget debate of that year, the Leader of the Labour Party said that the Budget was entitled to take its place with its brazen relation, the 1952 Budget, by which the main food subsidies were withdrawn.  It is true that the Labour Party have opposed the raising of taxation where such taxation is placed on the shoulders of those least fitted to bear it. They have consistently sought to have the burden shifted to where it ought rest.</P>
    <P>I find in the Labour Party general election programme for 1957 a paragraph dealing with income tax which reads:</P>
    <P>The Party will urge the new Dáil to undertake a review of the income tax code so as to secure an equitable distribution of the tax burden in relation to the buying capacity of the different sections of the community and in particular to give greater relief in respect of personal and dependants' allowances for persons in the lower and middle income groups.</P>
    <P>In the Budget Debate of 1958, the Leader of the Labour Party said, as <Col N="1664" /> reported in columns 626 to 627 of the Official Report of 23rd April, 1958:</P>
    <P>One felt that the Minister might have done something to relieve some part of increased taxes for a large number of persons.  Single men and single women whose lower rate of pay before the war did not make them liable for income tax &mdash; although their purchasing power today is no greater than it was in 1938-39 &mdash; are now being compelled to pay income tax on rates of wages which have no greater purchasing power than their rates of wages in 1938-39.  The Minister might have found some opportunity of providing relief for these classes, especially when he reflected on the excessively generous manner in which he acted towards the master bakers during the year which has just left us.</P>
    <P>That reference to the master bakers concerns a subsidy gift of about £250,000.  That is not &ldquo;opposing taxation&rdquo; and, speaking against the background of the withdrawal of the food subsidies, increased health charges, the certainty of the abolition of the Prices Advisory Body &mdash; it was abolished in July, 1958, when prices were still rising steeply &mdash; it was a reasonable and restrained approach. The Party did not oppose taxation.  It merely opposed the manner of applying taxation and reminded the Minister for Finance that there were stronger shoulders to bear, and better-filled purses to meet taxation that was necessary to give him the money he required for the national house-keep-ing.</P>
    <P>The Minister must realise the wisdom in the Labour Party attitude to taxation.  It is bad business to take too much from those who have little thus condemning them to malnutrition, as Senator Jessop told us is the situation when he spoke on the Finance Bill, while, at the same time, taking too little from those who have much and who in many cases are in a position to retain their high incomes, no matter what taxation is imposed, by tax evasions.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has made an improvement by easing to some degree the means test and I hope, as time goes <Col N="1665" /> on, he or his successors in office will continue to make improvements in regard to the means which recipients of old age pensions, and so on, may be permitted to hold.  It always did seem to me to be rather a bad principle that a person who was thrifty and saved against old age or ill-health should be penalised by being refused an old age or other pension when no longer able to work to maintain himself.</P>
    <P>A point arises on which I should like some information.  Much dissatisfaction exists because of the fact that the under 18s pay the full adult unemployment contribution but receive only a reduced rate of benefit.  One of the unions with a large juvenile membership asked me to raise the matter and to ask why this difference is made particularly when even the full rate of unemployment benefit falls short of the cost of maintenance when unemployment comes along.  Could the Minister say anything on that point?</P>

      <P>I should like very briefly to congratulate the Minister on bringing in this Bill.  Indeed, I think our congratulations should be extended a bit.  I should like to congratulate him on coming here for I think the fifth year in succession with a Bill of this kind.  I was interested to hear Senator Miss Davidson suggest that this year we might have given a larger increase than usual.  I was interested to hear her perhaps unconscious admission that under the Fianna Fáil Government, it is an annual affair or at least it has come to be expected that it will be an annual affair to bring forward in Bills of this kind to increase the social services.</P>

      <P>Under the Coalition Government, the cost of living went up by 71/2 per cent.  In a moment, I shall deal with that position.  I think everyone in this House would like to see larger social services, better benefits of all kinds, but it is a matter of what the people can afford.  It is unfortunately true that there is only one Party in this House that will ever be prepared to come in here and support the taxation <Col N="1666" /> needed for increasing benefits of this kind.  It is absolutely no use for Senator Miss Davidson to suggest that the Labour Party would in fact support any taxation that may be needed for these kinds of purposes.  It is perfectly correct to say that they have voted against every form of taxation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think they must have misheard the Minister.  Senator Miss Davidson looked up the 1957 Budget. I think she should have looked up the 1952 Budget and seen how they voted on an increase in income tax.  Every year that an increase in tax may be necessary the Labour Party say they cannot vote for the tax, that they would vote for some other tax but not for the one the Government are bringing in or perhaps they say they will vote for a certain tax if the Government will bring in something else.</P>
      <P>Whatever the excuses may be, the fact remains that the Labour Party will not support Fianna Fáil in the necessary taxation for increased expenditure of this kind.</P>

It is no harm to mention briefly the record of the last few years with regard to the main social services.</P>
      <P>Take 1957, under Fianna Fáil. There have been a series of what Senator Miss Davidson describes as annual increases in the old age pension.</P>

      <P>After the passing of this Bill, there will be an increase of 11/-in <Col N="1667" /> the old age pension since 1957. From 1954 to 1957, at a time when the cost of living rose by approximately 7½ per cent, the old age pension increased by 2/6.  Unemployment assistance has increased in urban areas by I think 9/6d. since 1957 for a single man.  For a man with a wife and four children, the total increase is 21/-.  Under the Labour Minister for Social Welfare, in the three years he was in office, in a time of rising cost of living, there was no increase whatever, not one penny, in unemployment assistance.</P>

Widows' pensions, contributory pensions, increased by 12/6d. a week under Fianna Fáil or 41/- where she has four dependent children.  I need hardly add, again, that no increase whatever was given in the three years of Coaliton Government between 1954 and 1957.</P>

      <P>Widows' non-contributory pensions have increased by 11/-or by 27/- where there are four dependent children.  Here an increase was given by the last Coalition Government of 2/6d.  Disability benefit has increased by 12/6d. in the case of a single man and 48/6d. where there is a wife and four children.  There was no increase whatever under the last Government. Children's allowances have increased, where there are four children, by 32/6 a month.  There was no increase under the former Government.  That is the record.  There is no use in talking as Senators have been talking in this debate.  It is perfectly obvious that, while we would all like to see higher benefits, on the record, not only of the past seven years but of the past 30 years, the only Party prepared to act and bring in increases in social benefits <Col N="1668" /> are Fianna Fáil and, where necessary, provide taxation for them.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill. We would all like to see the increases being more substantial.  As they are, they are inadequate.  We cannot really discuss the amount of money needed by people who are poor, elderly or perhaps chronically ill, to meet their various difficulties unless we think about the overall provision made for these circumstances.  In a different type of circumstance, in a different type of State set-up for dealing with these situations, money means different things.</P>
      <P>In Britain, there is a comprehensive social insurance plan and provision is made for difficult circumstances in various ways so that the amounts of money paid directly as cash benefits to different types of people are therefore supplements rather than intended to meet their circumstances entirely.  Here, as we know, we have not comprehensive social insurance.  We tend rather to leave it to charitable organisations to take on a great deal of the work that is done by the State where there is the more comprehensive system.  These charitable organisations are excellent but everybody who has to deal with poor people particularly, realises that voluntary organisations, whether operating in charitable, educational or other fields, tend to leave gaps unprovided for.  One organisation has a special interest in one aspect of the problem; another in a different aspect; and perhaps between these there are people who do not come properly into either.  They, therefore, tend to suffer hardships that are unprovided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in that regard I think we must look at the provision we are making here for the difficult circumstances of poor people.  We have not home helps, health visitors, not the meals and wheels provision that is made in other countries for people who are house-bound and cannot look after themselves or have anybody to help them shopping.  When you are in circumstances in which the only thing you <Col N="1669" /> have to meet your difficulties is a sum of money that comes in each week, then I think the sum of money is not enough.  In the case of the elderly, for instance, it is 35/- from the State, but they are allowed to have £1 a week of their own so that the total amount they have to live on is, I think, 55/-.  I do not believe an elderly person living alone can manage on that amount of money in these days.</P>
    <P>So, while I welcome the Bill, I must express the opinion that the increases are insufficient.  I do not think they would even be sufficient if there had not been a turnover tax and the repercussions it will have on the cost of living.  I strongly suggest to the Minister that when he is bringing in the next Bill &mdash; Senator Yeats has told us that these things come every year and so we might expect another next year &mdash; he will take into account what I have said.  This is the only thing we do in this country for this section of the community.  We have none of the overall provisions which the more comprehensive systems provide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of an old age pension committee since 1945, I have a fair idea of what is involved in this Bill.  The Minister has done quite a bit of tidying up of the Social Welfare Acts in what he has now introduced.  Anybody who is aware of the trouble one had to go to in connection with appeals and so on will agree that an amount of good has been done by this measure.  Relaxation of the means test is something I have long looked forward to and I think the Minister has done fairly well in that regard.  Recently, even before this Bill, it was much easier to get through with an appeal.  I congratulate the Minister on doing that.</P>
      <P>It has been the policy of the Labour Party to support social welfare increases at all times.  When our leader was Minister for Social Welfare, he gave increases in benefits in spite of what Senator Yeats has said.  When Fianna Fáil left office in 1948, the basic rate of old age pension was 10/-a week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry I started this argument.  I understand that about £11.5 million is being collected as a result of the turnover tax and I notice that the amount required to meet increases in social welfare works out at about £4 million, less £780,000 increase in contributions.  I hold that is the smallest increase ever given in social welfare as a result of increased taxation.  I am definitely disappointed that the old age pensioners have been given an increase of only 2/6 a week. Many people do not come under the means test and just because the new Social Welfare Act was introduced a few years ago, they now find themselves in a very happy position.  Quite a number of those on pension qualified because they were contributors and they are much better off on pension today than they were when working. A county council ganger or overseer, for instance, if he has full service, will get £7 13s. 4d. pension and will get £4 7s. 6d. for his wife, while he worked for £11 10s.  People who get a pension according to their means, such as a person who never worked or just did some casual work for hire and had no stamps, have to carry on with £1 a week less than those who are contributory.  We have always stood for increases in social welfare.  We also believe that there are categories which have not been fairly treated.  I cite as an example the old age pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, it is an extraordinary thing that last winter, when many farm labourers had to stay at home because of the weather, they actually earned more by being idle than they would have earned had they been at work.  A friend of mine with a fairly large family found himself at home with £6 17s. 6d. a week as against £6 1s. a <Col N="1671" /> week which would have been his wage, had he been working.  Naturally, he had no desire at all to go back to work.</P>
    <P>The Minister responsible for social welfare and the Minister responsible for wages should get together and ensure that wages are such that there will be no desire on the part of any man to draw social welfare benefits.  I have no objection to social welfare for the sick being as great as the wages earned.  In most of the county councils, a sick pay scheme operates for the purpose of giving a man as much when he is ill as when he is working.  There is sound logic in that. Employers who operate a sick pay scheme ensure that their employees are not at a loss financially should they fall ill.  I approve of sick pay schemes.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that farm labourers, county council workers, Land Commission workers, Board of Works employees, Forestry workers, Bord na Móna workers and others should get more by staying at home than they would earn working.  Such a system is very bad for the country.  I do not believe it happens in any other country.  No farm worker, unless he is specialised, gets more than £6 1s. a week.  A man with five children will get £6 17s. 6d. a week if he is unemployed. This is an aspect of social welfare that should be considered.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party tried to do something about the wages of farm workers. Deputy Tully introduced a motion in the Dáil.  Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael voted against it.  They said the present machinery was good enough to deal with the problems of farm labourers. When the farm labourers went before that body for an increase in their wages they were told: &ldquo;We have a White Paper.  We have a pay pause. Go home and wait until November.&rdquo; The present wage is not an encouragement to work.  The basic wages of workers should be dealt with at the same time that social welfare is being dealt with and the basic rate should be higher than the benefits or assistance a man may get under social welfare should he become unemployed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1672" /> Another matter that arises is the question of redundancy.  Because of the weather, and no one has any control over it, men are being laid off work with Bord na Móna already.  It is an all-time record to have men dropped in the month of July.</P>

That is a position that cries for remedy.  Basic rates should be pushed up so that men would have an incentive to work.  I shall never rest content until basic rates are pushed up.  If wages are high enough there is always an incentive to a man to work.</P>

      <P>Senator L'Estrange said we are not cherishing all the children of the nation equally. This is, I think, actually the first occasion on which we can say we are. For the first time, an allowance of 10/- a month is being given for the first child.  Ten shillings a month is £6 per year.  It is 240 sixpences of the turnover tax, which is 6d. in the £. We are cherishing all the children of the nation reasonably equally, now that we are giving the first child 10/-a month, or £6 a year.  A family with five children will now get five guineas a month instead of £4 1s. 6d. These allowances appear to me a magnificent step forward in social services, but we will never reach the stage of course, of giving them judges' salaries.</P>

    <P>Senator Yeats emphasised the increases in the rates.  I believe he is at variance with the Minister because the Minister described the increases as compensation for the increase in the <Col N="1673" /> cost of living as a result of the 2½ per cent turnover tax.  If Senator L'Estrange spoke on those lines, Fianna Fáil members would accuse him of playing a record.  Both sides of that record should be knocked out of this discussion.</P>

      <P>It is nice to hear them talking about social welfare when not one of them did anything to improve it in either period.  For the record, we must all remember that in 1922 when the British left this part of Ireland, they handed over one service which might have been described as a social service, that was, the old age pension.  That was all they gave us after a legacy of neglect lasting for centuries.  In 1932, when the people, under the leadership of Fianna Fáil, threw the Fine Gael Party into the dustbin, not one single social service had been added to the one the British handed over to us.  In ten years, the only thing the Fine Gael Government had done in regard to social services was a cut of 1/- in the paltry old age pension.</P>

Now we find them moaning and groaning over the alleged inadequacy of the provisions in this Bill.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered that during the past ten or 15 years, social services have been gradually and steadily improving.  They are not ideal.  In my opinion we have a long way to go. My ideal would be to bring our social welfare system into a position where it would be proportionately as good as the social welfare provisions that exist in civilised countries like the German Federal Republic, Holland and Great Britain.  We have a long way to go. We are a small country, and we have not got an unlimited amount of money at our disposal.  Year by year according as the Government saw how far they could go with the resources at their disposal, they have done their best to improve the rate of benefits under the various social welfare schemes.  That has been, and will be, the policy of Fianna Fáil, and quotations from the Proclamation of the Republic by those who do not understand what the word &ldquo;Republic&rdquo; means have no value&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This Bill is a great advance.  It is a step in the right direction but it is only a step.  Many more steps will be necessary according as the country increases in prosperity as a consequence of the Budget of 1963.  As a consequence of the extra money the turnover tax will put at the disposal of the Government, we will be seeing more, and better improvements in the social services and better payments of benefits to the beneficiaries thereof.  It is a good thing we have a Minister for Social Welfare who takes the matter seriously and who does not, like the Labour Minister for Social Welfare in the two Coalition Governments, sleep on it and allow some other Party to dominate his thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I would be wise in attempting to reply to the type of speech that was made here by Senator L'Estrange.  I have the feeling that the Seanad has heard that same speech or a different arrangement of it many times in the past few days and, to my mind, in the past few years.  Certainly it has a familiar ring to me and all that the Senator said has been adequately answered in the other House and, I am sure, also here.  Some other Senators also took the same line.</P>
      <P>I should make it clear that these increases in the rates of all of the social welfare schemes are not being introduced merely to compensate for increases in the cost of living that would be expected to arise as a result of the turnover tax.  What is happening here is a continuation of the process that has been going on, certainly since this Government took office in 1957, ensuring that social welfare recipients generally will get their due share of the increase in national income that has followed from that change of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator L'Estrange went back to 1939 to try and say there had only <Col N="1678" /> been a marginal improvement in the conditions of old age pensioners in that period.  It was not really a great distance further for Senator Ó Maoláin to go back to about ten or 11 years prior to that when that disgraceful occurrence of the reduction in the old age pension took place.  However, I agree with Senators who objected to the Senator going back that far.  There is not much point in going back such long distances and I propose to refer back merely as far as the time when the present system of compiling the consumer price index was initiated, when the consumer price index was fixed at 100 at mid-August, 1947.  To that base of 100 in 1947 the price index is now 159, that is, an increase of 59 per cent.  In the same period the maximum rate of non-contributory old age pension has increased by 133? per cent.  It does not matter what date is taken.  It can be shown that the increase in all the different social welfare schemes has been considerably greater than the increase in the cost of living. I can go back to other dates if Senators wish but it is the same thing no matter what date is taken.  Certainly since the cost of living has been indicated on this basis that is the position and that is largely because of the different increases in all these schemes that were made under Fianna Fáil Governments, as Senator Yeats pointed out.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that practically the only scheme that was referred to here &mdash; and the same occurs in the Dáil &mdash; was the non-contributory old age pension scheme.  Even in that, the record of the alternative Government to Fianna Fáil, the Coalition of Fine Gael and Labour, is very bad compared with Fianna Fáil's but in regard to practically all the other social welfare schemes the Coalition Government have no record at all.  They did not seem to have adverted to the fact that there were other classes in need of assistance from the State.  Therefore we had not only to take care of the situation as it developed under our own administration but also to make up for the neglect of Coalition Governments in this regard, certainly, in regard to all the other schemes.  As I say, that position of 59 per cent <Col N="1679" /> increase since 1947 in the cost of living and 133? per cent in non-contributory old age pension rates is paralleled in all the other schemes now, as a result of all that has been done by the Fianna Fáil Government in that regard.</P>
    <P>These increases, as I said, were not granted to compensate for any expected increase in the cost of living as a result of the turnover tax.  It is rather that the turnover tax is imposed for the purpose of collecting from the people who have gained as a result of the economic expansion that has been taking place some of what they have gained in order that it may be given to the people who, through no fault of their own, are not in a position to benefit from the general improvement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance told us the very opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>He told you it more than compensated them for any conceivable effects of the turnover tax but it does more than that.  It certainly does compensate them for that but it does more.  In relation to that, it was mentioned that, apart from the turnover tax, there has been an increase in the cost of living since the Budget was introduced last year, and that is so. There has been a slight increase from 154 in mid-February, 1962, to 159 at present and that is an increase of 3.2 per cent.  Therefore, even if the full effect of the 2½ per cent turnover tax were to fall on all the expenditure of social welfare recipients, then the maximum amount they would need to be compensated for would be 3.2 per cent plus 2.5 per cent, that is, 5.7 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, we know, the turnover tax will not fall on all expenditure. It is estimated it will fall on approximately 75 per cent and that would reduce the amount of compensation that would be necessary to 5 per cent in every single one of these social welfare schemes, both on the assistance side and the insurance side.  In the case of every category, male or female, married or single, with or without <Col N="1680" /> children, the increases, that are being granted in relation to the Social Welfare Bill go a long way beyond an increase of 5 per cent.  Therefore, the fact is that this year, as last year and as in every previous year of this Government's term of office, a further step is being taken towards improving the position of social welfare recipients relative to the cost of living.  In other words, we are doing more than keeping pace with the cost of living which has been increasing.  We are effecting a relative improvement in the position of every social welfare recipient and this year we are taking a further step along that road.  I, like Senator Jessop would like to see a significant improvement being made.  However, it is an unfortunate fact that we can do these things only gradually.  This Government have been working on these problems over the years and every year since they took office, in spite of the opposition of the combined Parties who formed the Coalition, practically every year a further step has been taken to effect this re-distribution of income in favour of those who are in need.  This will be proceeded with until we reach a stage where we can all feel reasonably certain that the worst-off sections of the community, the unemployed, the sick and the old people are adequately catered for.</P>
    <P>On this occasion, if the strength of the opposition to the proposals for the collection of money from the productive sections of the community, in order to distribute it to Social Welfare recipients is to be taken as an indication of the capacity of the people in general to provide for those who are in need we are very nearly at the stage where that aim is achieved.  As I have said, we have been effecting a relative increase every year in benefits to the more needy sections and it is our policy to continue that, in spite of the combined opposition of all the elements of the former Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there are any details to which I should refer. Senator Miss Davidson raised the question of workers under the age of 18 receiving a lower rate of unemployment benefit than those over that age, <Col N="1681" /> even though they pay the same contribution. That is a fact, but of course their contribution to social insurance covers many benefits other than unemployment. It should not, therefore, be assumed that, because their rate of unemployment benefit is lower, they should pay a significantly smaller contribution. It would not be impossible to work out a scale of smaller contribution for workers under the age of 18 years; but if we started on refinements of that sort, there is no length to which we might not be asked to go.  It is an integral part of a social insurance scheme that the good risks help to pay for the bad risks, and if we start to introduce a grading of contributions we will be faced with the position that one section of workers in which there is a low incidence of unemployment will want to know why they should pay the same rate of contribution as a group of workers where the employment is of an intermittent and uncertain character.</P>
    <P>I do not see why we should get into that situation.  A person who is lucky enough to have a steady job and therefore contributes towards unemployment benefit for those who have not, should be considered to be fortunate. It is a good principle and one we should try to maintain.  Therefore, I do not think there is any case for a reduction of contribution in the case of people under 18 years.  After all, they will not be under 18 for long.  If the person under 18 happens to be married, as some are, unemployment benefit is at the same rate as for a married man over 18.</P>
    <P>Senator McAuliffe adverted to the fact that a lower paid unemployed man with a large family can actually get a greater amount of payment from unemployment benefits than if he were working.  He argued there should be a system of Government compulsory raising of wages all over the entire economy to meet such a case.  I think the moral in this case is that we have probably gone far enough in giving increases in the personal adult rate, and in the child dependant rate and that in future, because that has the effect of a man with a large family getting more in unemployment benefit <Col N="1682" /> than if he were working, in regard to the child dependant rate, we should aim at giving the increases under the children's allowances scheme so that we will give the benefit to the man who is working as well as to the unemployed man.  I say that because the system of wages in employment generally in this country does not take any account of the circumstances of the individual, so the State finds it necessary to assist by means of children's allowances.</P>
    <P>The only other specific point raised was that in relation to appeals by old age pensioners to which Senator McDonald referred.  I am not aware such appeals are taking an excessively long time to decide.  A year ago, there was some delay, due to an accumulation of arrears, but that has been got over and appeals are now being dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    <P>This Bill effectively arranges that the taxation proposals of the Government this year will be adjusted so that practically all the extra taxation will be paid only by people best equipped to do so. The problems of all recipients of social welfare benefits are adequately covered. A relative improvement has been effected in their position.  In the case of those with smaller wages who have young families they will get full compensation through increases in children's allowances.  The result is that only those who have reasonable incomes or who have no families will be affected by the turnover tax.</P>

      <P>This section deals with old age pensions and we feel the sum being granted is not sufficient to meet the increased cost of living brought about by the turnover tax <Col N="1683" /> which means higher prices for the necessaries of life.  It was interesting to listen to Senator Yeats' contribution to the Appropriation Bill but I would remind him that since 1957, the cost of living has increased by 25 points and that since 1948, the increase has been 40 points.  What the Government are giving with one hand, they are taking back from these unfortunate people with two hands.  I want to nail the lie we have been told that the Fine Gael Party reduced the old age pension.</P>

      <P>It is in the section because I am dealing with the old age pension and the increases that have been given.  In 1924 Cumann na nGaedheal reduced the old age pension to pay for the Civil War.</P>

      <P>We were told that the inter-Party Government gave no increases, that all the increases under these headings were given by Fianna Fáil alone.  The old age pension was restored to 10/- in 1928 and remained at that until 1941, when Fianna Fáil gave a food voucher increase of 2/6, and it remained at that until 1947.  In all, the food vouchers increased the old age pension to 12/6 in rural areas and 15/- in urban areas.  The inter-Party Government increased the old <Col N="1684" /> age pension to 17/6 in all areas.  That was an increase of 7/6 in rural areas and 5/- in urban areas.  In 1951, they gave another increase of 2/6, which brought the old age pension up to 20/-.</P>
      <P>In the following year, we had the Budget and £11 million was taken away in food subsidies.  There was an increase of 1/6d. given.  There was a change of Government in the year after that, and despite the fact that the cost of living did not rise, Deputy Sweetman in 1955 gave a further increase of 2/6d.  The point I want to make is that these increases were given when the cost of living was being kept relatively low.  Now, with the cost of living going sky high, especially the cost of the essentials of life, you are giving with one hand and taking it back with two.</P>

      <P>I did not really expect to convince Senator L'Estrange by anything I said.  He argued that the increase of 2/6 is too small.  It is smaller than I would like to give, but however small it is, it is being given in spite of the most bitter and most unscrupulous opposition from all sections of those who are opposing this Government.  They went to every possible extreme to try to defeat the Government.  When they saw it could not be done by Parliamentary methods, they resorted to the expedient of cooperating with vested interests, concerned only with the maintenance of their own profits, in an attempt to intimidate and coerce Independent Deputies into voting against these increases. That was to prevent the collection of the money necessary to give these increases which are deemed to be too small.  We cannot help wondering to what extent they might have gone if we had proposed to collect sufficient money to give the larger increases Senator L'Estrange appears to call for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume I am entitled to reply to the version Senator L'Estrange has given of the increases in the old age pension.  I say the increase in the old age pension given in 1948, if you want to describe it quickly in the same way in which old age pension increases are normally described, was 2/6.  While the basic rate of old age pension was 10/-, there were cash supplements of <Col N="1685" /> 5/- in the case of urban areas, 2/6 in rural areas and, in the case of people with dependants, there were cash supplements of 7/6.  As a result of the introduction of an overall rate of 17/6 in 1948, some people got an increase of 5/-, some got an increase of 2/6 and some got no increase at all.  The fairest way to describe it seems to me to be an increase of 2/6.  If you want to go into greater detail, you can explain the actual position but that was the average increase.</P>
    <P>Senator L'Estrange claimed that an increase of 2/6 was given by the Coalition Government in 1951.  That increase of 2/6 was given in the same way as these increases are being given &mdash; in a Social Welfare Bill introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1951.  It is true they were mentioned in the election Budget of 1951, but whether the money to give them was provided is another matter.  The money to give this increase of 2/6 in 1951 was provided in the Budget of 1952.  The decision to bring in the Social Welfare Bill providing these increases in 1951 was a decision the Fianna Fáil Government had to make. They had to decide whether they were going to honour the reckless election promises made in 1951 but not provided for.  They decided that this had been promised, although the money had not been provided for, and they decided that they would give it and raise the money in 1952.  Fianna Fáil gave that increase of 2/6.  In 1952, in addition to rectifying the state of the economy that had been so damaged by <Col N="1686" /> the Coalition Government, they also provided this money for that old age pension increase.  I have no hesitation in claiming that 2/6 increase in 1951 as a Fianna Fáil increase.</P>
    <P>In 1952, the Fianna Fáil Government, in addition to providing the money for that, gave a further increase in old age pensions of 1/6.  In 1955, the Coalition Government were back and gave an increase of 2/6.  That is the sum total of their efforts in regard to increasing the old age pension &mdash; 2/6 in 1948 and 2/6 in 1955.  Since then, all the increases were given by Fianna Fáil, and were as follows: in 1957, 1/-; in 1959, 2/6; in 1960, 1/-; in 1961, 1/6; in 1962, 2/6; and in 1963, a further 2/6.</P>
    <P>No other social welfare schemes were mentioned.  They could not be mentioned on this section, but they were not mentioned in the debate on Second Reading, either.  Perhaps on some future occasion Senators on the opposite side might like to direct their attention to some of the other social welfare schemes as well.</P>
