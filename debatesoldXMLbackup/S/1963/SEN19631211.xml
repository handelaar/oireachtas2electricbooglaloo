      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 1, 3, 4 and 2.  Further to that, we have received the National Building Agency Limited Bill, 1963 from the Dáil.  It is a Money Bill which will have to be dealt with within the 21-day period.  Unfortunately, the Minister will not be available next week to deal with this Bill and I wonder would it be agreeable to the House if we took it today?</P>

    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) to delete lines 12 to 15, inclusive, and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;incapacitated&rsquo;, in relation to a person, means incapable of looking after himself by reason of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  old age,</P>
      <P>(b)  physical infirmity or a physical injury, defect or disease, or</P>
      <P>(c)  mental infirmity or a mental handicap;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a point which was raised by Senator Jessop on Second Stage.  I support it.  There are people who are old without being incapacitated at that time of their lives and they would feel very upset if it were said they were physically or mentally incapacitated. If we must have an incapacitated person, or a person who is at least an inmate of these homes, must he be either physically or mentally infirm? I am not quite sure on reading the amendment again whether the Minister wishes to include all types of people in this section.  Could an infant not be kept in a home where the other inmates of the home are very old people?  It would not be very suitable for infants.  Would it be included in the terms of the Bill that a child could be kept in a home where normally very old people are kept?  In that respect, I am quite sure that we should not, in the amendment, put in the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; in sub-paragraph (a)&mdash;&ldquo;old age and physically incapacitated <Col N="99" /> or mentally incapacitated&rdquo;.  In other words an incapacitated person means a person incapable of looking after himself by reason of old age and physical infirmity or mental infirmity as the case may be.</P>
    <P>In that respect, we had the Minister replying to a question in the Dáil some time ago, as reported at column 1216 of the Official Report, volume 205 No 9.  The question is headed <i>Homes for Incapacitated and Old Persons:</i></P>
    <P>Mr. O.J. Flanagan asked the Minister for Health (a) the number of homes in the State in which incapacitated and old persons are kept for private profit, and the total number of persons so kept in these homes; (b) the number of homes in which such persons are kept by charitable institutions, and the number of persons kept in such homes; and (c) the number of homes in which such persons are kept (i) by health or other local authorities, and (ii) by State authorities.</P>
    <P>I take it that in this Bill we are dealing with incapacitated and old people.  I certainly would support this amendment in order to get some clarification on that point.</P>
    <P>Further on, the Minister mentions these homes: it is always incapacitated and old persons.  It creates a doubt in my mind as to what is covered by the Bill if incapacitated but not old people can be kept in the same home as incapacitated and old people.  I should like the Minister to clarify that point.</P>

      <P>When the Bill was before the House on the Second Reading, I was under the impression that it was not necessary to define &ldquo;physical infirmity&rdquo; further.  I felt that people who, by reason of their age, had to be looked after in a home were, <i>ipso facto</i>, physically infirm or mentally infirm. However, if it will put the matter beyond all doubt that a home in which an old person, who of himself would not admit to physical infirmity or mental infirmity, is maintained then I shall accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad the Minister does so and I am also pleased with what he says about &ldquo;incapacitated&rdquo; and &ldquo;old&rdquo;.  Will the Bill deal with homes where incapacitated persons of a very youthful age can be kept?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it does.  We do not have to say &ldquo;and&rdquo;.  If we were to do that, then two conditions must be fulfilled&mdash;(1) the person must be old and (2) the person must be physically infirm.  We do not want to do that: at least we assume Senator Jessop did not wish to do that, but rather that his purpose was to ensure that any homes in which an old person <i>simpliciter</i> was maintained for profit would be subject to the provisions of this Bill.  I am prepared to put that matter beyond doubt and to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and that the Bill accordingly so provides.  However, I do not want to accept an amendment which will lay down two conditions, the first being that the person must be old and the second that he must be mentally infirm or physically infirm.  I wish merely to let it run that one condition only is necessary&mdash;either that a person must be aged or that he must be physically infirm or mentally infirm.  If more than one such person is maintained for profit in a home then that home will come within the provisions of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) to delete paragraph (a), lines 18 and 19.</P>
      <P>The object of the second amendment is to make quite sure that all homes may be inspected by inspectors and, if we can amend the Bill further, that they must be registered and must show a certificate of registration in a prominent place.  The two second matters I have mentioned will come up later in the discussion.</P>
      <P>I think as a matter of general principle that all homes of this kind should be inspected and should come under the provisions of the Bill in general. We are very grateful, of course, to the many voluntary charitable bodies who are doing this work.  But, on the other hand, there is the possibility that conditions in these charitable homes may be bad.  I have some vague evidence &mdash;I will not say more than vague&mdash; that in some cases conditions are bad, and that is the kind of thing we should prevent by legislation.</P>
      <P>In a sense these non-profit making homes are in competition with profitmaking homes.  It could be that these homes can take people without charging them only by giving them what might be called substandard conditions. There is a risk of that and it would be well if the Bill prevented that risk so that all homes were liable to inspection and came under the provisions of the Bill.  I do not think there could be any objection to this by any of the homes.  After all, schools run by religious and charitable bodies are regularly inspected.  They do not resent that or feel that it is an infringement of their liberties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I argue on principle that all homes should be inspected.  That is the reason I also put down the second amendment. I do not see why one old or incapacitated person may under the Bill he treated with the greatest carelessness or neglect.  One person does not <Col N="102" /> count.  Is it democratic, is it Christian, to regard one person as not counting? There must be two, three, four, five or six, but I do not see that distinction. On the Second Reading I quoted the text: &ldquo;If one sparrow should fall to the ground your Heavenly Father heeds it.&rdquo;  Why should we neglect one sparrow?  Why should we start only when there are two?  Perhaps there are administrative difficulties.  If they are very great perhaps we should yield to them, but otherwise I put this amendment for the sake of the one sparrow and perhaps the Minister will see his way to accepting one or both of these sparrows.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be against the first amendment, that is, amendment No. 2.  I think this Bill was introduced for the purpose of preventing abuses in the case of people who for reward brought old people or ill people into their premises to look after them and failed to look after them properly or perhaps even neglected them.  I think the important words in the proviso excluding premises in which no incapacitated person is maintained for private profit are &ldquo;private profit.&rdquo;  It is extremely unlikely that a charitable institution run by a religious order, or indeed, by a group of lay people would neglect people under their care or abuse them.  I do not think we have any evidence of abuse in such homes and, therefore, I think it was a good thing to exclude charitable institutions of this sort from the provisions of the Bill until such time as there is evidence that it is necessary to include them.  I would like to feel and hope that that day will never come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would agree with the second amendment proposed by Senator Stanford and would support him there.  If one old person is kept for reward and is not properly looked after or is neglected, the State should see to it that that does not continue. If you go back to existing legislation which deals with young infants who are boarded out you will find that if a person takes one child into his or her house and rears it for reward that home becomes subject to inspection <Col N="103" /> and the enforcing authority sees to it that the child is properly looked after.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first of the amendments under discussion at present, if this section goes into the Bill as it finally passes this phrase in paragraph (a) will be difficult to interpret and difficult to implement. What is meant by private profit?  I notice that Senator Fitzpatrick used the phrase &ldquo;for reward&rdquo;. If &ldquo;reward&rdquo; were mentioned instead of &ldquo;private profit&rdquo; it would be more understandable.  What is going to happen if this section stands in the eventual Act?  Will it have to be proved before a court that private profit was made on keeping these old people?  It might be argued that, in fact, there was a loss.  In fact, we all see in our mind the situation where some money reward is taken for keeping aged or incapacitated people.  I am not happy at all about the &ldquo;private profit&rdquo; phrase in the section and I should like to know what the Minister has to say about this amendment.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second amendment I also think that the Bill should cover one sparrow as well as a nest and I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Seanad to reject both these amendments. As Senator Fitzpatrick pointed out, the Bill was introduced in order to prevent abuses which are alleged to exist&mdash;mind you, not abuses established after due inquiry but abuses which are alleged to exist.  That is the purpose of the Bill.  It is not the purpose of the Bill to establish an inquisition into premises which are ostensibly and genuinely charitable institutions.  That is why the phrase &ldquo;private profit&rdquo; forms part of the definition.  If a person receives another, maintains him and tends him either at a loss to himself or at the expense of charitable members of the community, then it may be said that he is not operating these premises for the purpose of private profit.  The homes which have been singled out for criticism are places which it is <Col N="104" /> alleged are run for private profit and in which old persons or infirm persons or persons mentally or otherwise incapable are taken in and, instead of receiving the attention which should be given to them in return for the amount which is paid, are exploited and, as a corollary, their friends and relatives exploited also. These are the homes which, it is alleged, exist, which may exist but in no single case have been proven to me to exist&mdash;but that is by the way.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that if such homes should be in existence they will not be permitted to continue and that persons will not be exploited and the relatives of persons exploited simply because for one reason or another they have to enter such homes.  We cannot go outside that objective.</P>
      <P>I regard this definition of the word &ldquo;home&rdquo; as it appears in Section 1 as a vital part of the Bill and, so far as the paragraph is concerned, if the amendment is carried then that is the end of the Bill so far as I and the Government are concerned.  We are not going to permit this Bill to be amended so as to set up a system of inspection here which would include within its ambit these charitable institutions which we all know exist and about which no complaint has been made.  But, we are prepared to deal with these homes which are run as commercial institutions where people are taken in to be looked after, to be attended upon, but where, as a result of that, the proprietor of these homes makes a profit&mdash;it may be that the profit is more or less but it is a profit in the sense that he receives from the maintenance of such persons more than he expends in maintaining them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made very clear the attitude of the Government towards the Bill.  But we are speaking as Senators, as one of the Houses of Parliament, whose object is to make Bills as good as possible, irrespective of the wishes of the Government.  Very often the Government have great wisdom but they have not a complete monopoly of wisdom.  It may well be that the Parliament, which is the ultimate government <Col N="105" /> of the country, not the Cabinet, can improve Bills.  That is what we are trying to do in this amendment.  We are trying to do what we think would make a better Bill. If the House says &ldquo;no&rdquo; that is the end of it.  But if the House says &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, the Government will have to think again.  But, it need not concern us in the slightest degree what the Government want to do with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>What concerns us is what is the best kind of Bill this House can produce after consideration and whatever the Government say, in a sense, is irrelevant.  That is the function of this House and on that I stand.</P>
      <P>Now I say this: If these non-profitmaking homes have nothing to fear with regard to inspection or any other provision in this Bill, why should they be exempted?  I agree that probably 90 per cent of them have excellent conditions for the patients, but I suspect&mdash; and I say I suspect; I cannot give concrete evidence for this&mdash;and I have reason for suspecting that some ten per cent at least do not give adequate conditions and these are the people that some of us are trying to get after. We have this kind of inspection, as I said, for religious and charitable bodies in education.  Why should we not also have it in health?</P>
      <P>There are three types of person concerned in this legislation.  Let us have them quite clear in our minds: (1) the authorities of non-profitmaking homes; (2) the authorities of profitmaking homes; (3) possible and actual patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, obviously, as the Bill stands, it very nicely suits the authorities of non-profitmaking homes.  They, naturally, want this exemption.  We all understand that.  But the authorities of profitmaking homes may have a grievance, because if conditions in these non-profitmaking homes, which may be substandard, are such that if brought up to standard they would have to charge something, then, in a sense, these non-profitmaking homes <Col N="106" /> are in competition with the authorities of profitmaking homes.  I am afraid that is rather complicated, but I think it is perfectly clear if you think about it.  If people are doing something for nothing but not doing it up to the standard that the country expects, it is unfair to people who are doing something for a monetary consideration when their standards are up to what the counrty expects.  So, I think there is a certain injustice to the authorities of profitmaking homes in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, there are the patients&mdash;and these are the persons we are really concerned for.  I say there is a risk that some of our elderly or incapacitated relations&mdash;the relations of us in this House&mdash;may eventually go to a charitable institution where, as a result of not amending this Bill, the conditions will be unsuitable and inadequate.  I am not prepared to take that risk, and I hope the House is not either.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is wise in resisting this amendment because, as he has said, its acceptance would render the Bill impossible to put into effect.  I listened to the discussion here several months ago that was initiated by certain members of the Labour group and I understood that they were concerned only with these institutions that were being run for profit.</P>

      <P>If we take it upon ourselves to go about regulating the affairs of those institutions that are not being run for profit or reward we will be going too far.  We will be establishing, to my mind, a totalitarian system here, which nobody wants.

      <P>If it transpired that there were abuses in these institutions that are being run without profit, I am very sure the inmates of these institutions would find a remedy.  They would be able to attract public attention to their plight in these places without any inspection by officers of the State.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The second amendment which proposes to delete from the interpretation the excluder of premises in which not more than one incapacitated person is maintained in fact is consequent upon the first amendment.  As Senator Murphy pointed out it is going to be rather difficult in most circumstances to determine whether or not a person is maintained for private profit if only one person is concerned.  Normally, a person will not take a solitary invalid, that is, one only, into his home for private profit.  He will do it most likely out of the goodness of his heart, going no further than to ensure that he will not suffer significant loss.  I do not want to confuse the issue.  That is why I thought these two amendments should be discussed separately. Senator Standford's first amendment raises the issue that the Bill is to be expanded in order to cover what are ostensibly and genuinely charitable <Col N="108" /> institutions.  Between institutions which are ostensibly and genuinely charitable ones, there is another class of institution where it may be a matter of doubt as to whether the person is being maintained solely for private profit. That is why it would be quite impossible in the majority of cases, as Senator Murphy pointed out, to determine whether or not there was an element of private profit where there is only one single person.  But, where you have two people being maintained in a home, and as generally would be the case, though not invariably the case, they were not related to each other or in any way associated, even by ties of friendship, with the owner of the home, then it is easier to prove that this element of private profit exists.  It would be difficult, as I have tried to show, if there were only one person concerned.  It is much less difficult if there are two people being maintained and still much less difficult, in fact, comparatively easy, if there are three people being maintained. The dividing line in deciding this issue would appear in my judgment to be that if there is one person you cannot prove one way or the other that he is being maintained for profit and it will remain a matter of doubt; but if there are two people concerned the doubt is very much less, and you can proceed fairly safely on the assumption that if there are even more than two people being maintained in any premises, then they are being maintained for private profit. That is why I would ask the House not to accept Senator Stanford's amendment.</P>

      <P>Much of what the Minister says has obviously some force, but let us look at it from another point of view.  If we pass the Bill as it is now then it would mean that in every home, where there is one person, the authorities in that home can do what they like with that person, but where there are two people they must be careful.  Even if the Bill cannot very easily be enforced for one person I think the fact that it is in the Bill means that the one person has the sword of justice protecting him.</P>

      <P>I entirely agree with Senator Stanford.  If the Bill goes through as it is at present drafted there is nothing to prevent an individual taking an incapacitated person into his home, charging him for maintaining him and proceeding to treat him in a most disgraceful manner by neglecting him or not feeding him properly, or not looking after him properly.  The Bill will be powerless to do anything about it.  I think it would be, if we find a person taking an incapacitated stranger into his house and keeping him there.  It is highly likely that he is doing so for profit or reward.  Indeed, it might not be going too far to make it <i>prima facie</i> that he was keeping him for profit or reward.  I think with a little more thought a section could be put into the Bill which would exclude close relatives but which would protect a person who is taken in by a stranger and neglected, while at the same time that stranger is being paid for looking after him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was not introduced on that basis at all.  It was introduced because fears were expressed here, and elsewhere, that inmates of these homes and institutions are subject to exploitation.  I have explained, and I repeat it, that no case of such exploitation has been brought to my notice in terms which would warrant me having that matter investigated and pursued.  So, it is not because such cases are known to exist but because it is feared that they exist that this Bill has been brought in.  We have been told here that by this Bill I am giving permission for people to take persons into their premises and into their houses and there to exploit them and it is said that there is nothing to prevent this being done. That, I think, is what Senator Fitzpatrick said&mdash;there is nothing to <Col N="110" /> prevent a person taking an incapacitated person into his home and not looking after him properly, not feeding him properly.  Of course, that is not the case at all, there is something to prevent it.  After all, the people who have to go to these homes are members of a family and are sent to the homes because the family wish them to be properly looked after and because the members of the family are not in a position to look after them themselves. Therefore, they are prepared to pay for them in a home.  They are not being received for nothing into these homes.  Remember it is only with a home or a house in which a person is being received for private profit that the Bill is concerned.  These people are being paid for by their families. Are we to believe that these families are so indifferent to their welfare?  Are we to believe that their spouses, or sons or daughters are so indifferent that they are going to permit these people to be maltreated in the way in which Senator Stanford has suggested.</P>

      <P>We fear many things in this world but at least we are entitled to proceed on the assumption that every one of our neighbours is as concerned about filial duty and the practice of the virtue of charity as we are ourselves.  We are saying here, if we are to accept this, that people whom we know, whom we meet, people of the ordinary status in society as ourselves, are so inhuman that they will send their close relatives into these homes to be exploited, that they will pay for them in the homes and that they will not see to it that those of their relatives who may be in homes will be properly looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, everybody knows that there are people who are failing in their ordinary social duties but we do not go around saying that because a man is a pickpocket every other man <Col N="111" /> must go around with a lock on his hip pocket, or that every lady must have her handbag chained on to her because there happen to be snatch thieves.  We do not go to that extent, but it is proposed to do that in this amendment, that because some people may act inhumanely every person should be regarded as a potential offender.  I do not think that that is right social outlook. We have to consider the position of people who are prepared to take people into their homes and look after them.  If a son or other close relative will pay for such a person, surely he will be prepared to see that that relative is properly attended to.  That is what is involved.</P>
    <P>We must act, as I have said, on the ordinary principle that everybody else is just as decent and humane as we are ourselves.  If we do that we will not go to the extreme indicated by Senator Ó Ciosáin who pointed out what, in fact, had been suggested by Senator Stanford was that because it was believed that ten per cent of these homes were not being properly conducted then the State had a right to walk in and inspect them.  Carry that just a little step further and say that in one house there is a person living who is not a member of the family. He may be paying for himself or somebody may be paying for him.  We suspect that he is not being properly treated, and, therefore, the State has a right to walk in, to inspect every room in that house, and subject every member of that household to an inquisition, and where do we go?  What is the difference between that and the system which we were all deploring eighteen or nineteen years ago?</P>
    <P>We must realise that if we are going to protect the people against undue interference by the State we have to draw the line somewhere.  The line I am drawing is this&mdash;where there is only one person concerned, we cannot assume that he is being maintained for private profit, nor may we assume that he will not be properly treated. Senator Stanford has referred to a Biblical story, but there was another episode where a person walking with two angels was asked whether if only <Col N="112" /> ten per cent were likely to be just people the Lord would then spare two cities.  That is a much better parallel than the one the Senator quoted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is no doubt aware that the Minister has been referring to Sodom and Gomorrah in his last statement.  I think that if he looks up the actual bargaining between Abraham and the Almighty on that occasion he will find that he has not quite got his statistics right.  Perhaps, however, these Biblical analogies cancel each other out, and we will not refer to them again.</P>
      <P>I still do not think that three-quarters of what the Minister has just said has anything whatever to do with the difference between having one person and two people in a home. His argument means that if one family can look after one patient two families can look after two, and we could go right through the Bill and say that it was all unnecessary.  I ask the House to consider that one person who is weak and incapacitated should not be left to the mercies of exploiters, as may happen if the Bill is not strengthened.  I see certain administrative difficulties, but even if the Minister does not administer it strictly and sharply in the case of one person the fact that the Bill does not leave this loophole for homes with one person will be a deterrent and that is what these amendments ask for.</P>

Does Senator Stanford want that house to be inspected?  There are lots of cases like that, and I would not like to see anybody interfering with that relationship in the country at any rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>Before Section 2 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The Minister shall effect the registration of any person or persons in respect of an incapacitated persons' or old persons' home under this Act and shall issue a certificate in respect of each home, subject to such conditions (to be specified in the certificate of registration) as he may consider appropriate for securing&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that the number of persons received in the home and in particular rooms in the home at any one time does not exceed such number as may be specified in the certificate of registration;</P>
      <P>(b)  that the rooms occupied or to be occupied by persons in the home are suitable in all respects for such persons;</P>
      <P>(c)  that a person with such qualifications or experience as may be specified by the Minister is in charge of the home and of the persons employed thereat;</P>
      <P>(d)  that the administration of sedatives and injections is carried out only by qualified persons and that a register of stocks of drugs be kept in the premises and be available for inspection by a medical practitioner or by the person or persons authorised to inspect the premises;</P>
      <P>(e)  that the home is adequately staffed both as respects the number and as respects the experience of the persons employed thereat and is adequately heated, lighted, ventilated and equipped with suitable fittings, furniture and equipment;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" /> (f)  that suitable accommodation (including washing facilities and sanitary conveniences) is provided in the homes;</P>
    <P>(g)  that the person carrying on the home shall take all reasonable steps to satisfy the Minister that his requirements as to staffing, qualifications and experience of staff and cleanliness of the premises are being complied with;</P>
    <P>(h)  that the premises, fittings, furniture and equipment used in connection with the home are adequately maintained;</P>
    <P>(i)  that the persons received in the home receive adequate care and attention;</P>
    <P>(j)  that there are adequate arrangements for feeding persons received in the home and that an adequate and suitable diet is provided for them;</P>
    <P>(k)  that records are kept in relation to the persons received in the home containing such particulars as may be specified by the Minister;</P>
    <P>(l)  that an adequate properly trained inspection staff be appointed by the Minister, or by the health authorities under the direction of the Minister, with authority to enter such homes or premises for the purpose of ensuring that the requirements of this section are complied with.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Minister shall cause to be drawn up a register of all homes for incapacitated persons and old persons, copies of which register shall be available on request from the Department of Health or from the local authority.</P>
    <P>(3)  Any person aggrieved by a condition subject to which registration is effected under subsection (1) of this section may appeal to the Courts and on any such appeal the Court may confirm, reverse or vary such condition.</P>
    <P>(4)  A person authorised under subsection (1) (1) of this section to <Col N="116" /> inspect premises may visit and interview in private any person in the home&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  for the purpose of investigating any complaint as to his treatment made by or on behalf of the person, or</P>
    <P>(b)  in any case where the person so authorised has reasonable cause to believe that a person in the home is not receiving proper care.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where, in relation to a home, there is a contravention of a provision of this section, the person carrying on the home and any person concerned with the management thereof shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds, and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine (not exceeding fifty pounds in all) not exceeding five pounds for each day on which the offence is continued or, at the discretion of the Court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or to both the fine or fines and the imprisonment.</P>
    <P>(6) (a) Where a person is convicted of an offence under this section, the Court may, either in addition to or in substitution for the penalties referred to in subsection (5) of this section, by order declare that the person shall be disqualified during such period as may be specified in the order for carrying on, or taking part in the management of, the home to which the conviction related or, at the discretion of the Court, any home.</P>
    <P>(b)  A person in respect of whom an order is made under this subsection shall not during the period specified in the order carry on, or take part in the management of, the home specified in the order or any home, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>(c)  A person who contravenes paragraph (b) of this subsection shall be guilty of an offence and <Col N="117" /> shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine (not exceeding fifty pounds in all) not exceeding five pounds for each day on which the offence is continued or, at the discretion of the Court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or to both the fine or fines and the imprisonment.</P>
    <P>(7)  A person who wilfully obstructs the execution of a provision of this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable, on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine (not exceeding fifty pounds in all) not exceeding five pounds for each day on which the offence is continued or, at the discretion of the Court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or to both the fine or fines and the imprisonment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The amendment is already in the hands of the members so I do not propose to read it through.</P>
    <P>I have a feeling that in our thinking on this Bill, the Minister, myself and my colleagues came very close to full agreement as to what was necessary to make the Health (Homes for Incapacitated Persons) Bill, 1963 an incisive weapon capable of cutting through red tape and outmoded practices and leaving only a number of simple, clearly-stated conditions and rules which would safeguard our infirm aged and incurably ill persons who, for any reason, have had to be placed in the homes to which this Bill relates.</P>
    <P>I can see clearly the Minister's mind moving to build his bridge to bring these helpless people across a chasm of neglect to a haven of safety.  What, I ask myself, caused the Minister to leave the bridge only half built?</P>
    <P>The amendment now before us is the other half of the bridge which the Minister should have completed.  With the resources and advice available to him he could have built the entire <Col N="118" /> bridge much better than we can.  Unless the Minister is prepared to put in the steel girder of registration right across the gap, I feel his bridge, this Bill, is unsafe and will not serve the purpose for which it was sought.</P>
    <P>With the registration of these homes the Minister and his inspectors will have a map before them with all the institutions clearly marked.  Having this, he can do his job as Minister for Health in a more efficient manner and ensure that through his inspection staff, whether operated through the local authorities or otherwise, all homes will be inspected at some time or another in the course of a stated interval of time.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary that I should go through the various clauses of the amendment.  I have endeavoured to make them as clear and concise as possible.  Some of them are, in fact, taken from the list of things the Minister proposed to take power to do by regulation.  I feel, however, that the safest way to ensure their being operated is to have them written into the Act for all to see.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should mention clause (d). The Minister thinks I am unduly cautious on the question of the availability and administration of drugs.  I would ask if anyone can be over-cautious where a human life is concerned. An inexperienced person might think a particular drug took too long to act and might, as we say, double up, or a person, with various other duties to do, might forget that a tablet had already been given and give another. A qualified person would hardly be likely to make such errors.  For various obvious reasons, too, there is need for the keeping of a register of drugs which, as the amendment says, should be available for inspection by a medical practitioner or other authorised person. Perhaps, too, it might be wise to have a record of the supply source of all drugs.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of the proposed new section would enable persons to obtain a list of registered homes.  This would serve as a guide to persons seeking accommodation for an infirm relative and make it more difficult for an <Col N="119" /> unscrupulous person to take a chance and receive an invalid or two in unsuitable places under cover of saying nothing about it.</P>
    <P>Subsection 4 (a) and (b) introduce a subject which is, I feel, absolutely necessary to ensure peace of mind for patients and relatives.  The provision for inspectors to interview patients in private is an extra safeguard that they will receive proper care and attention. The provision will not cause inconvenience to anyone and will not add to the cost of running the homes.</P>
    <P>Subsections (5) to (7) are the provisions which the Minister has already put in the Bill, as circulated, with a few minor changes to suit the amendment which I hope the Minister will accept.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not say I am asking too much.  I am merely trying to improve his proposals in some cases and add a few essentials here and there.  If he will give a good look at my amendment, I feel sure he will agree it is quite reasonable and if he is honest with himself.  I do not think he can throw it overboard.  My colleagues and I, however, cannot be satisfied if he still merely wants to take power to make regulations.  We feel we must insist on the most important stipulation in the amendment which is, that the Minister must effect the registration of any person who undertakes to run or, in fact, is at present running a home for persons for whose care and safety this Bill was sought. Without registration, the Bill goes only half way towards solving the problem and half way is not far enough.</P>
    <P>We do not claim our amendment covers all that is necessary to make the homes perfect but it would improve the Bill before us and would not add to the cost of the Bill as introduced. Perhaps, the Minister feels he should have the right to make regulations to cover other essential matters which our amendments may have omitted, such as fire protection, etc.  We would have no objection to his taking that power so long as the requirements set out in our amendment are written into the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="120" /> If I seem to be pressing this matter too persistently or to appear to ask too much for our aged and infirm people, I would ask the Minister and the House to recall a few words from a speech made not so long ago in this building and now holding especial poignancy for all of us:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We need men, who can dream of things that never were and ask why not?&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I missed an opportunity of speaking on the Second Stage of this Bill but I think any remarks I make now will still be relevant on this amendment.  This Bill was introduced, I should like to feel, as a result of a discussion in this House on a motion proposed by Senator Miss Davidson. In that discussion I think it was established that there had been in the past, cases of abuses in homes catering for incapacitated persons within the meaning of this Bill.  I was satisfied that a case had been made on those lines and I assumed that the Minister would accept the motion proposed by Senator Miss Davidson.  I was, then, very surprised, indeed, that, in his reply to that debate, the Minister seemed to resent very much that the motion had been introduced and he seemed to give Senator Miss Davidson a telling off. However, the Bill followed that discussion in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the object of the Bill is to eliminate abuses but that it is not intended to hand over nursing homes and other types of homes covered by the Bill to bureaucrats or to enforce unnecessary interference with the running of these homes.  I am satisfied that there are, indeed, many very well-run homes in this country by dedicated communities or dedicated groups of charitable individuals and that there are no abuses of any description in those homes.  The Bill has set out to eliminate abuses and I feel it is strong enough to eliminate them.  If we have registration, as suggested by the amendment, I think we are going too far.  We would then have a state of affairs where all existing homes would have to apply for registration and be subject immediately to inspection before they could get a certificate and <Col N="121" /> where any other home in which it was proposed to cater for incapacitated persons would have to get a certificate before it could go into business.</P>
    <P>As somebody said earlier, you have to think of the homes and you have to think of the patients in the homes. Not alone would well-run homes become subject to a form of drastic inspection but the patients in those homes would become subject to inspection. You might reach a state where the standard would become very high and the cost of running these homes would become excessive.  If that point were reached the people who can now afford to send their relatives to be looked after in comfort in these well-run homes at modest cost would be unable to continue to do so and in that way the amendment might and I think would defeat its own object.</P>
    <P>I should not like to think that we should reach the stage in this country when all the nursing homes and homes covered by the Bill would be handed over to bureaucrats and subjected to unnecessary interference and unnecessary inspection.  I repeat that I am all in favour of eliminating the type of institution which was described by Senator Miss Davidson when she spoke so forcefully to the motion in this House some months ago and I am satisfied that the Bill as it stands, with the possible exception of subsection (1) upon which the Minister insists and on which there was a Division just now, goes far enough to eliminate the things which we all so strongly resent and would like to see done away with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment specifically with regard to registration.  I have had experience lately of people in these homes which were not registered.  The people were under notice to leave these homes because the amount they had in pensions or emoluments was not sufficient to pay for them with the present day cost of living.  They were actually asked to leave and they had been so long away from their own homes that they really had no homes to go to. The case arose where the county councils concerned with these people were asked if they would subsidise <Col N="122" /> them in the homes.  I had experience of approaching the county councils and asking them to subsidise them. They said they could not do so for the reason that they were not registered or recognised by the State.</P>
      <P>Registration is the most important thing we can have.  These people might be slightly mentally incapacitated.  They might be physically incapacitated or slightly mentally incapacitated but not sufficiently incapacitated mentally to be brought to a mental home.  This is the type of people in whom I am interested at the moment as we have such a case on hands and I should not like to see them brought to a mental home.  If they do not get money from the local authority they have no other source from which to get it and they will be sent out of these homes into mental hospitals.  As we know, there are certain types of people who do not want to be sent to a mental home.  We know quite well that they may be slightly mentally deficient but not a case for a mental home.  I have a letter from a county manager saying he would be prepared to pay a fee for people in homes but that he cannot do so because they are not registered or recognised.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the amendment.  My only fear is that it may be too big a package deal, if I may so phrase it, for the Minister to accept.  It asks for rather more than the Minister would even consider accepting, perhaps, but I should like in that case to appeal to him not to reject it in whole and in part.  I personally support it as a <Col N="123" /> whole, but he may say that he cannot accept the whole.  Then I should like to draw his attention to parts which should be specially stressed and, if necessary, we could bring them in on Report.  I should not like them to fall by the wayside because they are a part of this record amendment in this House, for in the 15 years I have been here I do not think I have seen quite so comprehensive an amendment before.</P>
      <P>There are two matters for special consideration.  One, as Senator McAuliffe has said, is the matter of registration and I do believe that we should, if possible, have that.  The second is paragraph (d) of subsection (1) of the amendment which says that the administration of sedatives and injections should be carried out only by qualified persons.  I do think these are important matters.  If it should be that the whole amendment does not pass, I hope that these two matters will be given special consideration later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I want to put a little emphasis on some points made by previous speakers because they are very important. Despite the fact that Senator Stanford has described as a package deal the amendment before us at present, I think it is a rather important package deal and one which I believe should be looked at in this light seriously by the Minister.  Quite candidly, I submit that unless we can insist on having some kind of package deal of this sort written into the Bill, the Bill is not worth the paper it is written on and will inevitably fail miserably from the outset to achieve what it set out to do according to the promises made by the Minister in this House.</P>
      <P>I want to confine my comments to two aspects of the matter before us. One is the obvious lack of one of the elementary if not the most essential provisions that should be written into this Bill if it is to be even half effective, that is, registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is quite good enough for the Minister to come along to us and say that we are alleging that there are abuses.  By his very speeches even in defence of his attitude to the <Col N="124" /> amendments that have been taken already this afternoon he has conveyed, to me, at any rate, quite clearly, that his object is to throw doubt even on the necessity for this Bill at this stage. But, is it not clear that unless the Bill carries the fundamental element of registration that any Bill of this sort would naturally be expected to contain we cannot possibly hope to get at the abuses that we all in our hearts do know to exist if we cannot, even from this point on, decide on where we are to look for them?  Without registration, it is clearly impossible for anybody to satisfy himself that these abuses do not exist.</P>
    <P>I want merely to make this observation on that aspect of this problem, that I find it extremely difficult to accept a contention that either the Minister or his Department or his Departmental officials are not very well aware by now that abuses do exist and I do not think it is quite fair to suggest that they do not.</P>

      <P>Senator McAuliffe referred to an aspect that rather concerns me.  I am not a member of a health authority but, as far as I understand it, a health authority can make payments to institutions approved under Section 25 of the Health Act. I think the practice with the Voluntary Health Authority is the same.  In other words, if a patient goes into a home and is insured in the Voluntary Health Insurance, payment can be made for the maintenance of that patient, I <Col N="127" /> think, at the discretion of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, but I think they operate on the basis that if that home were approved under Section 25 of the Health Act then it would qualify for maintenance payment in respect of that patient.  The same, I suppose, operates with the health authority.  If they decide to make a payment in respect of a person maintained in an institution or home that institution or home would have to be approved under Section 25.  I have not had the opportunity of looking at the section.  I do not know what is involved in it but I wonder would the Minister tell us, if the section as proposed in the Bill goes through, whether the homes we are talking about will then be approved homes under that section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a small matter. The Minister, when replying, may clear it up for me.  That is one of the reasons why the amendment is desirable. Where registration is required it would certainly be easier to provide that they would be approved under Section 25 of the Health Act, that the inmates who would qualify under the health legislation would get maintenance benefit, and those others who are insured under the Voluntary Health Insurance, equally would get benefit for maintenance when in those homes.</P>

      <P>Senator Stanford referred to this amendment as being a very comprehensive one. Indeed, it is, and if it were accepted it would result in so much regimentation of the people of this country that they would find it very difficult to stand for it.  I notice now in paragraph <Col N="128" /> (1) in the first line &ldquo;the Minister shall effect the registration of any person&rdquo;, any one person, who would be kept in a private house in any part of the country.  Does anybody here seriously suggest that it would be a good thing, that it would be a deserving thing, to have the name of every person like that registered in the Department of Health?  We all know in certain parts of the country old people are taken in. One person would be taken in, an old age pensioner put in by his or her relatives. If that private transaction, which I will call it, has to be registered it would reduce the Bill to an absurdity. Everybody knows that.  We have heard of all these abuses which have taken place, which are alleged to have taken place in these homes.  It is only today that we have got some inkling of what some of the abuses are and that they happen to be in the city of Dublin. I am sure that there will be a means of ascertaining what the conditions are in those institutions that have been mentioned in the letter.</P>
      <P>As I said, the acceptance of this amendment would be another step towards the establishment of a totalitarian society here, which the people do not want.  I was inclined to think, when I read these amendments, especially this one, that the people who expressed such anxiety here in the early stages for the enactment of this legislation do not want it at all because if there were one way more than another of defeating the purpose that these people had in mind it would be the acceptance of an amendment like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this amendment would make it easy to operate the Act.  We know in Section 2 of the Act that the Minister may make such regulations as he thinks appropriate in relation to homes.  That is purely on the basis that if the Minister thinks so he would make regulations.  The amendment, as submitted by Senator Miss Davidson, sets out clearly what is required and I think the Minister should accept all the requirements as set out in the amendment, and which are actually required, despite what some Senators may think, that the regulations would be just too severe. <Col N="129" /> But, our first duty is to protect the ill, the patients, regardless of what home they may be in.  Those of us who are members of health authorities recognise, and point out from time to time, all the requirements that are necessary for patients in various hospitals.  Hospitals are fairly well run institutions where there is a good deal of regularity and attention given as regards medical services and the type of accommodation that is required.  This Bill is principally dealing with homes about which we have very little information on the way they are operated other than information such as we got from Senator Crowley this afternoon. The reason for the Bill at all is that it was felt that such a position did exist in regard to homes, not in regard to hospitals in general, which are run under the control of the Minister and the health authorities.  Some Senators appear to get alarmed at the views conveyed in the amendment, that the regulations in regard to homes may be too strict.  I do not think so.  There is nothing in the amendment making it too strict but the amendment does set out what care is required, which is to have a section in the Bill fully safe-guarding the position of patients in homes.</P>
      <P>The amendment sets out clearly what is required, and, if the Bill is to be effective at all, we would need a clause such as is set out in the amendment rather than just leave it on the basis that the Minister may make such regulations as he thinks appropriate in relation to homes.  There is nothing set out in that portion of Section 2 to indicate what may be required, or if the same kind of regulations apply to each home, or what they are.  It would be much better if it is put into the Bill and it then becomes the law of the land. We would ensure that all our homes would be on an equal basis.  As it is at the moment, or even as that portion of the section sets out, they can evade certain regulations.  We are bound to have changes of Ministers from time to time and there would be no setting out of regulations on a matter of this kind, whereas, if we put it into the Bill, now that we have an opportunity to do so, there would be set out regulations in regard to all homes.</P>

      <P>I was challenged today by Senator Ó Ciosáin to produce evidence in connection with a statement I made.  I have the evidence here now.  If you like, I shall read the letter.  It is from the Kerry County Council.  I will not give the name of the home except to say that there are at least 50 people in it and is run by an order of nuns.  I will not give the name of the person involved.  This is the letter:</P>
      <P>I am directed by the County Manager to refer to recent representations made by you on behalf of Mr. X, shall we say, who is anxious that the Council make a contribution towards the maintenance and treatment of his sister who is actually 85 years of age, who is a patient in such a home, which is run by an Order of nuns in County Meath.  (I will leave it at that.) I decided to inform you that as this home is a private mental home the Council has no authority to make a contribution.  However, the county manager submitted this case to the Department of Health for special sanction for the payment of a contribution of one guinea per week. A reply was received from the Department to say that as this home is neither approved under Section 10 or Section 25 of the Health Act, 1953, that ministerial sanction could not be given to the payment of this contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to suggest, in view of the letter read by the Senator, that the real reason why a contribution could not be made by that particular County Manager was because no contract existed between the Department of Health, the local authorities and that particular institution. Most local authorities maintain mental hospitals at great expense whether in Sligo, Mullingar or Tralee or somewhere near it, and because of that they are not over anxious to have duplication.  I myself ran up against that problem in the case of a particular well-known private mental hospital in Dublin where very good treatment is given.  They took a very long time, indeed, to arrive at a position when a contract could be made between the <Col N="131" /> Department of Health and the particular hospital concerned, that is, St. Patrick's in James's Street.  I have come across cases of hardship where people, maybe on the advice of a local dispensary doctor or a private doctor, sent a patient to such an institution. It was found that Leitrim or Cavan County Council could not in the then circumstances make any contribution from their funds towards the maintenance of a patient even though a hardship might exist.  The only thing that could be done in such a case is that the Department of Health and the local authorities would arrive at a contract. I did not catch where or what was the particular institution that the Senator referred to.</P>
      <P>One must always keep in mind that if you are going to have a growth of private mental hospitals, where there will have to be wide variety of services, it would be a rather severe strain on the funds of local authorities in counties like Cavan, Monaghan, or Leitrim, to maintain them and also to maintain the institutions which they are under a statutory obligation to maintain.</P>

      <P>In regard to the general principle of the amendment, to go too far too fast, as was said in substance by a very great man, is a mistake.  It takes a certain length of time.  Why not give the present Bill a trial to see how it will work in practice?  In the long run the greatest machine in the world, if it can only be operated by its designer, is not much help to anybody.  Simplicity should always be an important factor in the design of a machine, and the machinery designed in this Bill is a step forward.  There has been a suggestion of abuses, but not too many people&mdash;whether they lack the moral courage or for any other reason&mdash;seem to be over anxious to bring home that there has been abuse.  That being so, since the Minister brought in this Bill he is entitled to get a chance of seeing how far it will work in practice.  If the machinery does not work satisfactorily <Col N="132" /> I am sure that he will be the first person to agree that it was time to amend it.</P>
      <P>In regard to the general principle one of the fears I have about the discussion of such homes, whether run by local authorities or by private people, whether they are mental hospitals or homes for aged people who may be regarded as partly mentally deficient as a result of old age, we are drifting willy-nilly into a mental attitude of disregarding the very important principle that children have a moral obligation to maintain their parents just as parents have a moral obligation to maintain their children.  I am beginning to wonder how far that principle is being undermined or forgotten.  If there were a fuller realisation of that moral obligation there would be less need for legislation in this regard.  A wrong mental concept seems to have come in here and to be growing very rapidly. There are quite a lot of people in hospitals run by local authorities or in private homes simply because it is a matter of convenience to their relatives. That is a tragedy because it is undermining that very important Christian principle.  We seem to be drifting into a mental attitude that we ought to have more such institutions for people in that category.  We should be very careful, indeed, because it is very easy to go in that direction.</P>

      <P>Senator Stanford wants legislation because among other things it will enable some control to be exercised in respect of the administration of sedatives and injections.  I am not going to talk about injections, but take the case of sedatives.  Some of us, on occasion, may after a day of debate here wish to sedate ourselves for a night's sleep with a barbiturate.  Are we going to have to send out for a doctor in order that the sedative should be administered to us?  Is there any reason to believe that the people who <Col N="133" /> have persons under their control and in their care and custody are going to treat them in a way that would be dangerous or imperil their lives?  I do not think we can accept that as a general principle.  I suggest that, apart from that, it is not necessary that we should adopt this amendment in order that the danger which Senator Stanford believes to exist and which&mdash;I do not want to blink the fact&mdash;may be in some instances a real danger, can be safeguarded against.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have power under a section of the Bill to make regulations. I cannot forecast what he will do.  It is a matter which will require a great deal of consideration.  One of the matters he may regulate is the manner in which institutions of this sort will be controlled and administered. It is not necessary, therefore, to accept this amendment in order to ensure that there will be a degree of control exercised over the administration of sedatives in these homes.  That, I think, was the main reason why Deputy Stanford&mdash;I do not know whether I am demoting him or degrading him in referring to him as Deputy, but I am bringing him to not lower than my own level anyway&mdash; appears to want registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we can achieve his end in a much simpler way, not by writing it into a Bill but by allowing the Minister to deal with it by regulation.  Talking about writing it into a Bill, I think it is illusory to believe that merely because a matter is written into an Act will ensure that the measure will be more stringently administered than if the Minister deals with the problem by making a regulation in regard to it.  In fact, the Minister, having made a regulation in regard to a particular matter and having taken personal initiative in it, is much more likely to be convinced that it required attention than because it happened that an Act made it obligatory on him to make the particular regulation.  It is the efficiency with which the ministerial head of the Department for the time being and his officers act that really gives a greater or, it may be, lesser assurance that the intentions of the legislature will be carried out and that the general policy of the legislature <Col N="134" /> in regard to public issues will be made effective.</P>
    <P>I do not know to what degree those who are in favour of the amendment are in unison with each other.  It would appear from what Senator McAuliffe said, and to some extent from what Senator Crowley said, that what the Senators who support the proposed amendment are concerned with is that these homes, about which we have heard such appalling suggestions made here this evening, should be subsidised by public funds, that they should be approved of, so that contributions would be made in respect of persons who were sent to them, inmates of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an interesting remark.  It loses sight, however, of the fact that this is a rather nebulous problem.  If you deal with what it was once usual to refer to as nursing homes, but which now are not unusually referred to as private hospitals &mdash;these, I may say, are the homes to which I think Senator Murphy was referring when he asked what was required in respect of a home under Section 25 of the Health Act&mdash;it depends upon whether that private hospital or nursing home can provide the institutional services which a hospital would be required to provide if a patient were in it as a health authority patient, under Section 14 or Section 15 of the Health Act.  As the Seanad knows, a person may elect, instead of going into a generally designated hospital, to go to another hospital or place of his own choice under Section 25.  If he goes there it must be approved by the Minister as a home which will provide him with proper treatment for what I may describe loosely and broadly as an acute condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other homes to which I shall refer in a moment.  The point is that it would now appear&mdash;and this has emerged in the course of this debate but at the beginning the case was not put that way&mdash;that some Senators are in favour of this amendment <Col N="135" /> because it will enable those institutions to be subsidised by the local authorities.  As I say, the institutions envisaged are of a very nebulous character; they fall into a sort of no-man's-land, between what might be described as county home proper, and premises run by private individuals in which amenities might be something above the grade of the ordinary county homes and perhaps equivalent to district hospitals.  Some people have supported the amendment because they think that persons who have to go to these homes should be subsidised by the local authorities. The local authorities provide well-run county homes, homes in which conditions are now greatly improved and which will be improved very much more; but they are county homes, known as county homes, and the fact that they are county homes does not commend them to those who think they are a cut above the ordinary. They will not go into these homes. They want to go into a private home perhaps&mdash;because it has something of a snob appeal.  What really was involved in the letter which Senator McAuliffe put before the House was that there was a man down in Kerry who had a sister incapable of looking after herself.  She could have found a place in a public mental hospital, but that would not be good enough for her.  Of course, she herself was not aware of this in her circumstances&mdash; then I should say that it would not be good enough for her relatives, and so she was sent to a private home. Then her brother went to the local authority in Kerry asking them to pay for her.  The other thing about that letter was that if the local authority in Kerry, under Section 10 of the Act of 1953, had been prepared to recognise and approve that home they could have contributed.  They took the view which most ordinary people will take&mdash;if you want special treatment then you have to pay for it.  You cannot expect ordinary people who have to put up with the &ldquo;run of the mill&rdquo; to contribute towards your personal comfort, when you require it to be rather above the general standard.</P>

      <P>Senator Crowley's letter was more interesting.  It was dated, I think, June, 1962.  It was from the Irish Nurses' Organisation.  The Irish Nurses' Organisation were received in my Department in April, 1960.  The Department on my direction wrote to them on the 9th August, 1961, and the letter wound up by saying that the onus of making a case for registration rests on those who seek it.  In the Minister's view the case for registration had not been adequately demonstrated.  Between the despatch of that letter by me in August, 1961, and sometime in the middle of 1962 the Irish Nurses' Organisation apparently discovered six premises where they believed abuses to exist.  They did not address themselves to me.  They did not address themselves to the Minister for Health.  They addressed that letter to some other person and they made serious and grave allegations in it.  One would think, if they were really and seriously intended, they would try to have an investigation.  I do not know who would have investigated them. Perhaps I would find some residuary powers that would enable me to have an investigation into these charges; but they did not come to me.</P>
      <P>In no instance has an allegation been made to me about a home in terms which would enable me to hold an inquiry, to have the charge substantiated. That is my position.  I am not prepared to say there may not be substance in some of these allegations: I just do not know.  It is possible that the Bill in operation may bring abuses to light; and then perhaps we may have an examination of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, the amendment before the Seanad will change the character of this Bill completely and, therefore, with all due respect to the Chair, although it has been discussed, I think it is contrary to the principle of the Bill.  If people wanted registration they should have said so on Second Reading, they ought to have said that <Col N="137" /> because the Bill does not contain registration they would vote against it and that the Minister could go out of the Seanad and take the Bill with him.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford had a great deal to say about responsibility when he was discussing the second and third amendments but the Minister has responsibility too.  As a member of the Government responsible to his colleagues and others, the Minister has to have a mind of his own on these matters.  It is his solution that has to be considered in the first instance&mdash; his proposals.  If either House of the Legislature does not approve of those proposals, is not prepared to accept them in principle, then it is their duty, as has happened in other cases, to vote against them and put them out.</P>
    <P>If a Bill gets a Second Reading and the general principle of it is accepted, then I think the amendments should be within the general concept of the Bill in the first instance.  If they are not, well, I would not propose to fetter the Seanad in the discharge of its responsibility, but what the Seanad may decide does not <i>ipso facto</i> bind the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says we do not require registration.  He said his regulations would be just as good.  I do not believe that.  I am sure the Minister himself is aware that there are some Ministers who can get very cross on occasion, who can bang their hands on the desk and threaten to run off to sea and not to come back again unless they get what they want. I want to prevent the Minister from doing that.  I want to prevent him from saying: &ldquo;I am running off to sea.  I shall not bring in that regulation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the regulation written into the Bill so that no Minister can run off to sea and leave us high and dry. There is little or nothing in the amendment beyond what the Minister says he wants to take power to bring in by regulation.  There are lots of things we do not like.  One of them would be the inspection of our homes and for some people their nursing homes.  None of us likes to return his income for income tax purposes.  We all have two thoughts about the little bit of something <Col N="138" /> which we possess but we have to make these returns and we do so. The same thing applies when children are put out to nurse, as the phrase goes.  For one child there is provision for inspection.</P>
    <P>I know perfectly well that regulations very much like those in the amendment are working very smoothly and causing no trouble whatsoever in Herefordshire where the county council manager told us things are much simpler since they put in these new regulations.  Senator O'Reilly said we would price these people out of the homes.  On the Second Reading, I mentioned that Newcastle Sanatorium will be emptied and so will Blanchards-town. That involves, I think, maybe the loss of occupation for nurses, and so on.  Why can the Government not face up to their responsibility if these people cannot pay and put these old people in these hospitals and keep the staff there looking after them?</P>
    <P>I think it is the duty of the Government to undertake this work where private people cannot do it.  These are not likely to be long-term cases.  I think the term used in the original motion was &ldquo;aged or incurably ill&rdquo;. If they are aged, there is a limit to age and if they are incurably ill and sent home from hospital they will not live very long so they are not really long-term.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly referred to the machine.  I grant that the machine is in the Bill.  It is a very fine one, nearly a Rolls Royce, but there is no place for petrol and there is no motive power and the machine will not work without registration.  That is why I am so firm that it will not work.  The Bill will not work satisfactorily without registration and registration will not cost any more and will not cause greater hardship on either patients or those responsible for them, or, indeed, for anybody else.  I make a final appeal to the Minister to have another look at it and to see how much good registration would do and how little harm.</P>

      <P>Quite possibly the reason why the Minister did not get the specific complaints I alluded to <Col N="139" /> this afternoon, or possibly even more complaints from people such as the Nurses' Organisation and other people in the country who have information on this point, is that he is not getting that information direct because we have had no Act of this kind on the Statute Book up to now.</P>

I have a certain regard, if not a certain amount of admiration, for the Minister when he refrains from some of his oratorical gymnastics and shows himself to be the efficient Minister he is.  I really mean that.  I have had experience of how efficient the Minister really can be when he wants to.  Only a few months before I received that letter, I had occasion to direct the attention of the Minister to complaints by a number of people who had come to me and drawn my attention to an obvious public nuisance.  To his credit and in all fairness I must say that the moment I directed that complaint to his notice action was taken on it in a matter of days.  The nuisance was abated and the proper remedy applied. I pay tribute to the prompt and very courteous attention given by the Minister when he was acting, as is the case more often than not, in his ministerial capacity.</P>

A member may if he so wishes lay it before the House.  In this instance if Senator Crowley agrees the letter will be placed in the library for the information of Senators, but only if he agrees.</P>

      <P>I was challenged to produce the letter and I am not sorry I did so because it will help to pinpoint one of the social abuses and help to correct it.  The reason why I did not produce it sooner for the Minister's attention is that when the Minister dealt with our motion here last year on the question of the Health Bill I was one who accepted his assurance and undertaking at that time that he would, in fact, bring an effective measure before the House.  Because I know how efficiently the Minister can act I had every confidence that he would bring that type of Bill before the House and I am sorry that I have to expresss disappointment at the measure before us because I honestly believe that it is deficient in these points.  I am fully in agreement with the amendment before the House and I would ask the Minister to accept it in that spirit.</P>

      <P>I should like to endorse what Senator Crowley and Senator Miss Davidson have said because the Bill as it stands is defective. During the course of the Minister's reply he referred to a statement I made and said I was worried about people who would not go to county homes because they felt too swanky and felt that the county home was not good enough.  I have as much experience of county homes as anyone else. We have a county MOH in Meath at the present time who believes that people should get up to 30/- a week for keeping old people at home, that the Minister should be asked to sanction that in order to keep people out of the county home.  At present we have not got a bed in the county home. There is no room.  If homes were registered and recognised by the Department then the local authority would be in a position to make a small contribution which would be only half, a third or a quarter of what it would cost to keep a person in the county home.  The cost of keeping a person in the county home in Westmeath is £4 and quite a number of people could be kept in other homes or in their own homes for £1 instead of £4.  The less people we have coming to the county home the better.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had for some time proposals under consideration which I believe will meet these requirements.  What I have in mind is not a registration scheme but an arrangement for official intervention confined to those cases where there is reason to believe that conditions are unsatisfactory... Health authorities under the procedure which I hope shortly to propose would be empowered by legislation to inspect any premises in which sick or infirm persons are kept for reward and, if the conditions disclosed are such as to justify such drastic action, the legislation would provide machinery to require the occupier of such premises to <Col N="142" /> desist from the practice of taking in and looking after such persons.  It is proposed to exclude from the scope of the legislation any premises in which only close relatives, and these would be strictly defined, are maintained.  The legislation is at present being drafted and I hope it will be introduced in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Bill, I submit, which the Seanad are now discussing follows exactly that announcement.</P>

The Minister replied that he would refer me to a decision given by a late Chief Justice in which the Chief Justice said that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; can always be construed as meaning &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I should like to ask the Minister a simpler question.  Does this statement in the Bill, &ldquo;The Minister may&rdquo; mean that the Minister will, as distinct from &ldquo;shall&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (3) to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(&nbsp;) Homes whose names and addresses have been communicated to the health authorities as prescribed in subsections (1) and (2) of this section shall be inspected by a properly qualified inspector, who shall, if satisfied with the conditions of the home in question, issue a certificate of suitability to the person in charge of that home.  This certificate shall be displayed in a prominent and clearly visibly place in the entrance hall to that home.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is perfectly simple.  It may be that the amendment is not drafted in the best possible way for legislation.  In that case, if the Minister accepts the principle, I hope he will consider bringing in a better-drafted amendment on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>It is perfectly clear what this amendment wants.  It wants what we give in the case of hotels.  When someone comes to a licensed hotel in this country he goes into the hall and he looks for the certificate of Bord Fáilte that this is a decent hotel, which Bord Fáilte will stand behind, and we have other certificates of that kind throughout the country.  They are a very great benefit to people who may be misled. In this case the amendment asks that there shall be inspection, as with Bord Fáilte hotels, and that a certificate will be issued which will make it quite clear that so far as the Department of Health are concerned, the home is satisfactory. This certificate will be displayed in a place where everyone can see it on entering the hall-door.  I do think it may be very salutary to have a provision of this kind.  That is why I propose this amendment.</P>

I want to make it quite clear about this amendment that I am not accepting it but I will give some further consideration to it.  The amendment, I may say, as drafted, is incomplete.  For instance, what is going to happen if the inspector says it is not suitable?  I will give some consideration to this and I will see whether I can introduce an amendment on Report Stage which may go some way towards meeting the Senators.

      <P>The Senator is quite right.  There will be a register. There is bound to be a register but it will not be an officially prescribed register.  It will not prescribe conditions for registration.  It will merely mean that the fact that certain homes exist will be recorded and that the local authority, if it feels it should, can inspect them.  Provided you notify the local authority you can open a home. If there is a complaint about a home the local authority will have power to go in and inspect the premises and if they find the inmates are not being properly looked after they have power, under another section of the Bill, to have the person prohibited from running a home again.  There are no prior conditions laid down for opening a home but before doing so you can call on the local authority, who may inspect the home, if it feels it should.</P>

      <P>The Minister may, if he so thinks fit, on the application of any home, grant exemption from the provisions of this Act to that home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This means to me that the Minister may, without a sign or reason, and on no set of principles or according to any standard, exempt a home from this <Col N="147" /> Act.  Say he exempts you from the provisions of this Act there is no standard set down.  Earlier in the Bill we have exempted certain types of non-profit making homes and that is quite understandable.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I did not bring out precisely the point which is covered by this subsection.  The position is that there are some charitable institutions in this country, and there are certain mental institutions also, where provision has been made by the relatives of some of the inmates for their future maintenance in them, generally by way of establishing and endowing a trust.  These, undoubtedly, are very exceptional cases but, in respect of the particular person concerned, it could be said that that person was being maintained in a home for private profit.  They were making a profit out of a particular inmate of the home, but so far as the general body of the inmates was concerned they were not making any profit at all, since it was unmistakably a charitable institution in its general character.  The subsection is to cover that sort of case.  After the Bill had been drafted one or perhaps two instances of this sort came to my notice.  There are certain institutions in this country, purely charitable, to which at the moment local authority patients are sent at the expense of the authority, though as the capitation fee scarcely ever more than covers the full cost of their maintenance it could not be said that they were being maintained for profit.  In these institutions, however, there may be one or two or a <Col N="148" /> few patients, whose relatives made provision for them when they entered them, by establishing a trust fund. The income from that trust fund goes to the institution.  In some cases it may be that the institution receives a benefit in excess of the cost of maintaining a particular patient and in the case in question the home would not be exempt from the provision of the Bill as it stands.  It may have happened, too, in the case of other homes, of which I have no record, but this one instance did obtain, and it was brought to my notice.  I feel we should make a provision for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  If that is the Minister's interpretation of private profit in Section 1 of the Bill I have misunderstood it because in my reading of private profit the institution or the community as a whole could be making profit on the running of the home.  That would not be private profit.  It would be profit for the institution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, that is my interpretation of private profit in Section 1 of the Bill, that it does not apply to profit made by institutions. Be that as it may, we have gone away from Section 1 and we are dealing with a new section, which the Minister proposes to insert before Section 4.  If subsection (2) of this section is necessary for the purpose which the Minister has in mind, with the greatest respect I say that the Minister should say so in so many words in that subsection and not take on himself in that subsection the right to scrap the Bill.</P>

      <P>It has to be assumed that Ministers will act in accordance with the general tone and principle of the legislation.  There are occasions when it must be necessary to make exceptions.  In this case an exception might be made.  If the Minister does <Col N="150" /> happen to exempt a home and it is felt that he is exempting homes to such an extent that he is exercising his powers under the section in such a way as to nullify the Act, there is a remedy.  He can be called to account in Dáil Éireann for what he does.  It would be quite impossible to cover every sort of case in which exemption might be justifiable.  There is nothing very unusual in this.  Many statutes contain a similar provision that a Minister may if he thinks fit do certain things.  If he does these things he can always be brought to account.  That is the only safeguard the legislature has.</P>

      <P>It appears to me that it is an after-thought.  If we accept this all the rest of the Bill means exactly nothing.  This is legislation entirely by ministerial order, which should be discouraged.  It is undesirable and on principle I oppose it.  I say that if the Minister has a type of institution or a set of homes in mind he should say in this subsection that the Minister may, if he so thinks fit, on application by any home grant exemption, and set out the circumstances which would entitle him to grant exemption.  It should not be beyond the Minister and his advisers to put into the subsection a few more sentences that would cover the situation which he says he has in mind and at the same time save us from the undesirable form of legislation which is legislation by ministerial order.</P>

      <P>I do not want to continue this any longer, but the Senator does not realise that we are dealing with an undefined class of institutions some of which we call homes.  Some of these are charitable <Col N="151" /> bodies.  Some are mental institutions which in general are public charities. I only ask that if something which would not be within my competence to ascertain in advance should arise I would be able to deal with it without asking the Dáil to amend the Bill again.  That is all that is involved.  I suggest in view of the rather experimental nature of the Bill that we should have it this way.  If the Minister does what Senator Fitzpatrick suggests he would or may do the Dáil can call him to task for it and Senators who are interested in this Bill can certainly have it raised here or elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I remind the Senator of what I did say?  I said <Col N="152" /> that there was a case of a mental institution where the general body of the inmates were paid for and maintained by the State on a capitation rate.  It happened that I became aware of the fact that there was in this particular institution at least one person, perhaps more, for whom a trust had been set up the income from which would exceed the capitation rate. Therefore, in this institution this particular person would be maintained for a profit.  A home is defined as a place where no person is maintained for private profit.  That was the first difficulty.  Then thinking it over there are several homes&mdash;I will specify the Nazareth Homes&mdash;where old people are kept entirely for charity but there may be near relations of some of those people who pay for them or there may be some other source of funds to pay for a particular patient.  It is to enable me to deal with that situation that the subsection has been drafted.  In the proper administration of it I am afraid the Senator will have to be content to rely on Dáil Éireann doing its duty and bringing the Minister to account if he fails to do his.  The Senator suggested that I was rather brusque and brief in explaining the section.  The real reason was that I was told you were hoping to adjourn at 6 and I did not want to prolong the debate.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Telephone Capital Bill is, briefly, to authorise the Minister for Finance to advance further moneys, up to a limit of 30 million pounds, for continued development of the telephone service.</P>
      <P>As Senators are no doubt aware, expenditure on the telephone service falls under two heads.  The cost of operation and maintenance is borne out of moneys provided annually by the Oireachtas under the Post Office Vote, but extension and development of the system are covered by funds provided under Telephone Capital Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These Acts empower the Minister for Finance to issue moneys out of the Central Fund for development of the telephone service, and empower him also to borrow in order to meet or repay the issues so made.  The Acts do not of themselves authorise <Col N="154" /> expenditure, but merely ensure the continued availability of capital.  Expenditure is authorised, and issues from the Central Fund are made, on foot of annual estimates approved by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The moneys required for repayment of the sums borrowed are provided annually under sub-head G of the Post Office Vote.</P>
    <P>The latest Telephone Capital Act, which was passed in 1960, authorised the Minister for Finance to issue a total of £10 million for telephone development. This amount, together with a balance of £805,000 on hands from previous legislation, was intended to cover requirements for about 5 years. Owing to the rapid rise in the public demand for telephone service, however, it was necessary to increase the capital allocations each year, and during the three financial years ended 31st March last £8,250,000 was spent.</P>
    <P>During this period, 45,000 new subscribers' lines were connected to the system, 44,000 miles of new trunk circuits were added and over 230 kiosks were erected.  Some 130 new exchanges were opened and the capacity of 460 others was increased. Subscriber trunk dialling was extended to most of the major automatic exchanges and this facility is now available to 73 per cent of all subscribers. Additional cross-channel circuits were provided and direct transatlantic telephone circuits were established between this country and North America.  During this period also a very considerable amount of engineering work devolved on the telephone side of my Department in connection with the setting-up of the Irish television service.</P>
    <P>This expansion and development was, of course, far greater than that of any previous three year period. The progress achieved, however, was not sufficient to cope with the tremendous growth that took place in the public demand for telephone service. As a result the number of applicants waiting for telephones has grown, and during peak working hours, especially in the summer season this year, delays were encountered in effecting calls on many routes, and even the automatic <Col N="155" /> system suffered a serious amount of congestion at times.</P>
    <P>The principal cause of these difficulties was shortage of equipment and this was in turn due to the inadequacy of capital available for investment in the system.  Although the allocations made in the last three financial years far exceeded those envisaged when the 1960 Act was passed, they were insufficient for the needs of the service, that is to say, they were insufficient to provide all the additional plant required to meet the exceptional growth in demand.  Still more did they fall short of what was needed to allow of the timely installation of adequate space capacity in exchanges, trunk circuits and subscribers' cables.</P>
    <P>The telephone service is peculiarly dependent on this kind of advance planning and provision, because of the long period which any major expansion or development of the system necessarily takes.  Delivery terms for much of the equipment required are long, and installation programmes are rendered rather uncertain by such factors as site and building difficulties and technical problems involved in adapting standard equipment to suit existing networks.</P>
    <P>Much of the vital work which was planned as far back as 1959 is only now maturing and schemes for expansion that are at present on the drawing boards will not become effective for several years ahead.</P>
    <P>My Department is now faced with the formidable task of bringing the telephone service up to a satisfactory standard in the shortest possible time and of establishing adequate reserves of plant capacity to cater for future growth.</P>
    <P>The £30 millions capital expenditure provided for under this Bill represents our estimate of the cost of the works programme which it is hoped to carry out in the next five years.  The amount involved, which is almost as much as has been spent on telephone development since the foundation of the State, will give some idea of the work necessary to bring the telephone service up to a generally satisfactory <Col N="156" /> standard.  This work includes the connection of 115,000 new subscribers' lines, conversion of several hundred manually-operated exchanges to automatic working, the opening of an auxiliary trunk exchange in Dublin, the erection of 600 street kiosks and the expansion of trunk circuiting in order to overtake arrears, to establish a no-delay service and to cater for expansion. It is hoped also to provide a new cross-channel link.</P>
    <P>The expenditure is estimated to be as follows: £16¼ millions on subscribers' exchange lines and apparatus, £7½ millions on trunk circuits, £4¾ millions on equipment of new exchanges and extension of existing exchanges, £1 million on buildings and £½ a million on increased stockholdings.</P>
    <P>The work involved in this programme is immense, and considerable problems will have to be overcome in order to complete it.  Provision of the new exchanges required will involve the acquisition of hundreds of sites and the design, erection and equipment of buildings.  The laying of cables for trunk circuits and subscribers' needs gives rise to special problems which demand a high degree of engineering skill and long experience of telecommunications, which is a field of continuous change and development.</P>
    <P>The substantial works programme involved will necessitate a considerable increase in engineering staff.  As many Senators will be aware, there is a general international shortage of electrical engineers and we have been unable in the past to get all those we need.  Special action is being taken to overcome this problem, and to prevent its becoming a serious obstacle to the success of our works programme.</P>
    <P>We have decided to create a new sub-professional grade to take the more routine work from our professional engineers and free them for higher quality work.  We have also decided in principle to introduce a scholarship scheme which will enable young men to attend full-time day courses in order to acquire professional engineering qualifications.  My Department has been building up its workman force progressively in recent years and with the co-operation of the <Col N="157" /> Vocational Education Committees it has made arrangements to increase the annual intake of youths to be trained for the skilled grades and to intensify the training.  Some of these measures will bear fruit only in the long term. To relieve our problem in the short term we hope to give out as much work as possible to contractors and this may include the planning as well as the execution of major jobs.</P>
    <P>As a five year period is needed to bring the service to the desired state of efficiency and to cater fully for traffic and for persons requiring telephones, it will not be possible in the earlier years of that period to meet in full all demands on the service.  The most urgent part of the development programme is to expand the trunk network which suffered more than any other part of the system from the capital restrictions of the past.  I have directed my Department to give special priority to this work, even though the connection of new telephones for a large number of applicants will have to be deferred in consequence.  I am fully satisfied that this course, the object of which is to bring the service to existing subscribers up to a good standard without avoidable delay, is the proper one to follow in present circumstances. Part of our aim over the five year period is to increase greatly the rate of connection of subscribers.  We intend to achieve this as quickly as possible, but the present build up of trunk and exchange capacity is an essential preliminary for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word about the financial position of the telephone service.  The assets created by expenditure on telephone development provide full security for the capital invested by the State.  Furthermore, the telephone service fully remunerates the capital invested in it.  In the commercial accounts prepared in respect of each financial year the revenue earned by the telephone service, which is surrendered to the Exchequer, is shown as income.  Against this are charged expenditure incurred on the operation and maintenance of the service, interest on the total capital employed, and the provisions in respect of depreciation and superannuation.  Having provided <Col N="158" /> for these charges, the telephone service heretofore has shown a surplus over expenditure.  If the existing rate of return on capital is maintained over the period covered by the Telephone Capital Bill, the telephone service will, over the same period, have contributed to the Exchequer over £11 million by way of depreciation and surplus and approximately £9.25 million by way of interest on capital.</P>
    <P>I should add, finally, that although the sum being provided is a considerable one by any standard, much more will remain to be done even after it has been expended.  Our ultimate aim is a fully automatic service, adequate reserves of exchange equipment and circuits to cater for growth, alternative routes to all the main routes and the means to connect new subscribers without delay.  The present programme will not carry us as far as this but it aims at eliminating the waiting list and providing a thoroughly satisfactory service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has said, this Bill is to authorise the Minister for Finance to advance further sums up to a limit of £30 million for continued development of the telephone services over the next five years. We on this side of the House welcome the Bill because the telephone service is no longer a luxury; it is a necessity and it has been such for many years. As the Minister has stated, it is a service that is paying its way.  The Minister has pointed out that the assets created by expenditure on telephone development provide full security for the capital invested by the State and, furthermore, that the telephone service fully remunerates the capital invested in it.  We acknowledge that the money is well spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the further consideration that for a long number of years the telephone service has provided good employment for our own people, a factor which is of great importance in this country.  If we are to hold our own in the progressive and competitive world that lies ahead we must certainly move with the times.  Improvement and further development of our economy cannot take place without <Col N="159" /> the necessary money being provided for them.  We are prepared to support the expenditure of the extra £30 million needed for this development work over the next five years.</P>
    <P>We all sincerely hope that we will have a more efficient service in a few years' time.  We would all like to have the position in which telephones would be available practically on demand and that applicants would not have to wait, for years in some cases, as happens at the present time.  I suppose we may have to wait a few years before we arrive at that happy stage.</P>
    <P>Those in public life receive a steady stream of correspondence from constituents complaining bitterly about inability to get telephones installed and about unsatisfactory service and long delays in making calls after the telephones have been installed.</P>
    <P>The Government have been in office for seven years and the position in regard to the telephone service seems to be much worse now that it was six or seven years ago.  I claim that that is due to the inability of the Government to tackle the position as it should have been tackled and also to the fact that the Minister's predecessor, in 1958 and 1959, cut the expenditure from £1.6 million in 1957 to £1.1 million in 1958.  There was a slight increase, to £1.4 million in 1959 and a further cut, to £1.3 million in 1960. The Minister is not to be blamed for what his predecessor did.  We should give credit where credit is due.  He definitely seems to be tackling the situation at the present time.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying that the Minister did not make the charge in this House that he made in the Dáil, which is a relief to Senators on this side of the House.  He claimed in the Dáil that all the trouble was due to the fact that there was not enough money spent on these services during the 1950s.  He did not repeat that falsehood here.  I suppose Deputy Dillon gave him his answer in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>We do not want to blame the Government for what happened during the war but it would be no harm to point out that in 1946, under the Telephone Capital Acts, £100,000 was made available; in 1947, £153,000; in 1948, £335,000.  There was a change of Government and in 1949 the late Deputy Keyes, who was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, increased the amount from £335,000 to £1,225,000&mdash;four times the amount that had been spent in the previous year.  In 1950, the amount spent was £1,250,000; in 1951, £1,800,000.  The Book of Estimates provided for expenditure of £2,600,000 in 1952. There was a change of Government then.  Fianna Fáil came into power and there was a reduction from £2,600,000 to £1,950,000 in 1953.  In 1954, there was a further cut by the Fianna Fáil Government of another £900,000, bringing the figure to £1,050,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a change of Government and, in 1955, the figure was increased to £1,400,000.  In 1956, which we are told at times was a disastrous year, there was a further increase to £1,750,000 and, in 1957, the figure was £1,650,000.  Fianna Fáil were back in office and in the following year the figure was cut by £500,000 <Col N="161" /> to £1,150,000.  In 1959, there was a slight increase to £1,450,000 and, in 1960, there was a further cut to £1,350,000.  That was a time when people were crying out for telephones.</P>
    <P>I said I would give credit where credit is due.  Definitely, in the past few years the Minister has been doing his best to improve the telephone service and to make up for the harm that was done by his predecessor.  It was a pity the Minister did not give the facts in the Dáil or should try to mislead the people.  He was only covering up for his predecessor's deplorable performance in reducing the expenditure on telephone services in 1958 and 1959, when there was such a demand for the extra services.  Now, of course, many people cannot understand the long delays when they apply for the installation of telephones, especially when they are looking for something that they are prepared to pay for, which provides employment for our own people.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years we have spent millions on doubtful projects such as the Verolme Dockyard in Cork or the mines in Wicklow.  I believe that it would have been much better at that time if those millions were spent in providing better telephone services.  During the past seven years, from 1956 to 1962, 215,000 of our people emigrated.  At least 100,000 of those were able young men.  If the money had been provided by the Government at that time they could have been engaged at home in building for our country and in providing those services for which there was such a crying need.  The provision of capital under the Telephone Capital Acts and other sources was reasonably adequate to meet the demand, and the anticipated demand, during the 1950s.  If it were adequate at that time, why did the Government not increase the amount they were spending in 1958 and 1959 instead of reducing it, as I have pointed out, and then try to throw the blame on somebody else?</P>
    <P>In the past year or so the programme seems to have collapsed and, therefore, we are glad to see that the Minister is now about to tackle the problem.  There is no denying that last <Col N="162" /> summer we had chaos because the Party who were supposed to be the greatest planners failed to plan and provide this essential service for our people.  There is no denying that if plans were to make us prosperous and our country well off we would be the most prosperous people and the best off in the world.  But, the whole fault is due to the fact that those who were supposed to be the greatest planners in the country fell down on the job in 1958, 1959 and 1960 and did not make the plans for the future they should have made at that time.  If the plans were made in those years and the money spent we would not have the backlog we now have.  We would not have had our telephone services going haywire last summer and autumn and we would not have had the chaos experienced in the services over the last years.</P>
    <P>I also want to record my strongest objection for what is known as the double charge priority.  If a person makes a telephone call and is told there is a one-hour delay, a two-hour delay or a three-hour delay, and if he states he is prepared to pay double charge, he gets the number at once. This system is entirely wrong and it should not be in existence.  I believe anybody who has a telephone, and pays the charge for it, is entitled to the same priority as a person who has money enough to pay the double charge.  I believe it is a bad practice. I would not object to a list of priorities being drawn up but I object to that practice.</P>
    <P>I spoke about the chaos which existed for the past year.  I consider it is a scandal, especially here in this city at the present time, and for the past year or so, that you could ring 10 at any time of the day, but particularly at night, and get no reply of any kind. You could hold the telephone for 5, 10, 15 or 20 minutes at times without getting an answer.  That is completely wrong.  We should have a system where the telephone operator could take up the phone and say: &ldquo;Sorry, there will be a 10, 15 or 20 minutes' delay&rdquo; or you could even be told that there would be a half hour's delay.  There is nothing so annoying, or frustrating <Col N="163" /> as having to stand in a telephone kiosk without getting information of any description.  If you were told you had 10, 15, 20 minutes' or even a half hour's delay you could plan accordingly. I should like to know from the Minister if there is a shortage of staff. Can that be remedied?  Are there not sufficient staff on at the peak hours? There should be sufficient staff on at the peak hours especially with a service that is paying adequately and which the people of the country are entitled to and prepared to pay for. There should not be those long delays.</P>
    <P>The Minister, also, in the course of his speech, stated: &ldquo;We have also decided in principle to introduce a scholarship scheme which will enable young men to attend full-time day courses in order to acquire professional engineering qualifications.&rdquo;  I compliment the Minister on that.  It is a very good idea.  I think the various vocational education committees throughout the country are doing very good work and they will be prepared to help and co-operate with the Minister in any way they possibly can in that scheme.</P>
    <P>We hope never again to have a repetion of the chaos we had last summer and autumn and we hope, with the £30 million that the Minister is now able to give, that we will have more efficient services in the future and that the people will get more attention than they have got over the past year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I should like to welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister on introducing it.  Now, when a figure of £30 million was mentioned, people raised their eyebrows and thought that this was a fantastic figure, but I think that those dealing with the problem will agree that the telephone system has been a fantastic problem.  It is only by dealing with it in this courageous way that we can eliminate a lot of the problems and a lot of the delays that we have heard so much about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made in the Dáil&mdash; the matter was alluded to here again today by Senator L'Estrange&mdash;to the delays and the frustration people experienced, especially during the past 12 months.  The Minister on many <Col N="164" /> occasions gave a reasonable explanation for the delays and confusion that were occurring.  In the recent past the telephones have paid.  That is a remarkable feature of the matter.  I believe that, as a result of the expenditure of this £30 million over a five-year period, people can use telephones more frequently, and in consequence it is obvious that this should yield a dividend for the expenditure of the £30 million.</P>
    <P>There are a few matters to which I would like to draw the attention of the Minister.  One of them is the charge to subscribers for telephones.  Perhaps I am treading on thin ice now, but I feel that on an occasion like this we have an opportunity of mentioning what is a grievance of many subscribers. If you live within three miles of an exchange and have a residence telephone you pay £2 5s. 0d. for a quarter, but if you happen to live 3 miles and seven furlongs from an exchange that extra 7 furlongs costs you 8/- per furlong.  In my own area I happened to be on Maynooth exchange. Now there is no Maynooth exchange.  There is no exchange in Lucan.  It is all taken over and it is now Celbridge.  There are people living just outside the 3-mile perimeter who have to pay this extra 8/- for every furlong.  If you live over 3 miles and less than 4 miles you pay £5 1s. 0d. a quarter.  I hope that, as a result of the profits which will come into the telephone account as a result of the expenditure of this £30 million, this problem will be looked at.  I do not intend to delay the House except to say that we welcome the Bill.  We think it is a courageous thing to do and we hope that as a result we will have a very much better telephone service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill also.  I hope that if it does nothing else it will eliminate delays in telephone calls because since the minimum local charge is 3d. it is now cheaper to do your business by telephone than by writing.  We in our county were in the same exasperating position as some of the other speakers were last summer.  It was explained to us on making complaints that <Col N="165" /> because of the fact that it was the tourist season a number of people in the country were telephoning out and so there was a glut of calls and delay.</P>
      <P>I can give an example of very efficient and quick service as against all the delays referred to.  Recently in my area a person who put a call through to America was speaking to the person at the other end within four minutes of the time at which the call was booked.  That is a tribute to the Post Office.  Let us give credit where credit is due.</P>
      <P>Some of the problems under the automatic system that we have found &mdash;and this is a matter over which the Minister has no control since it is a technical matter&mdash;is that often when you dial you get the engaged signal and later you discover that the person to whom you were trying to make the call was not engaged.  I found that occurs on a number of occasions myself.  It is a matter that should receive the attention of the technical experts of the Department.</P>
      <P>One thing which I could never understand in relation to the telephone service was that in my area we are living six miles away from an office but in order to get a call through to that place you would be there quicker by car, because I have to go to the local exchange, then go back to a place called Dowra and then back to the neighbouring parish four or five miles from Dowra which is only six miles from myself, so that I cover about 20 or 30 miles before getting to my destination.  I feel that the service should be made available from the post office from which you are telephoning. If you want another district you should be able to phone it immediately without going through the major exchange.</P>
      <P>I have nothing else to say but to welcome the Bill and to hope that it will eliminate the delays which we know the Post Office has very little control over that occurred last summer. I hope that there will be no repetition of these delays.  At the same time, we have also had efficient and quick service not alone across Channel but to America.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in the welcome to the Bill and to say that the Minister can always be assured that money will be made available to him or to any successor for a desirable project such as the servicing of the telephone system.  He is all the more assured of that when he tells us, as we know, that the telephone service is one State service which pays its way.  I think I am correct in saying that it is the only branch of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs which shows a profitable return.  This is a very desirable state of affairs and I hope it will long continue.</P>
      <P>Like Senator L'Estrange, I feel it is regrettable that the Minister on the Second Stage in the Dáil introduced a controversial note when he alleged that any shortcomings in the telephone service at the present time were due to lack of capital during the 50's and by the implication during the two terms of the inter-party Government.  I am glad to see that he has not persisted as far as I can see in that unfounded allegation in this House.  At least taking his speech at its face value, he has left out the objectionable words in his Dáil manuscript.  I hope that he is not going to persist in it in his reply, because the facts do not warrant the charge.</P>
      <P>It is abundantly clear that adequate funds were made available for the telephone service during the term of the inter-Party Government.  In 1946 there was only £100,000 provided. In 1947-48 approximately £350,000 was provided.  Over £1 million was provided for the first time in 1949 when the amount was £1,225,000.  In 1950 the figure was £1,250,000.  In 1956 and 1957 the sums of £1,750,000 and £1,650,000 respectively were provided. The following year, the year the Fianna Fáil Party returned to power, there was a drop of £500,000 and only £1,150,000 was provided.  In 1959 there was a further drop of £100,000 and there was only £1,450,000 provided.  There was a further drop of £100,000 in 1960.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, and that applies to the years we were in office too.  I am repeating that to keep the record right.  The Minister is more accurate today when he says that the position may be due to shortage of capital in the past&mdash;indeed, in the early 60s when his Party were in office.  At any rate, he is now asking for more money and he is welcome to it and I hope he will make the best of use of it.  He is more courageous than his predecessor.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt about it that the demand for telephones has grown here, and all over the world, in recent years.  There were chaotic conditions in trunk calls last year in the city of Dublin and elsewhere.  I think the worst delay one experiences in the city of Dublin is, strangely to say, from the automatic exchanges in Leinster House.  If one tries to get a cheap call to the country at 8 or 9 o'clock at night one encounters unreasonable and unnecessary delays when one dials 0.  I have had experience of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to raise.  I understand property has been bought in the town of Cavan for the provision of a new automatic exchange in that town.  Reading the Minister's more detailed speech&mdash;even if it were a little more objectionable it was more detailed in the Dáil and he gave a list of exchanges which we might expect in the near future&mdash;I notice that Cavan is not on the list, and I would be glad to know from the Minister when he may expect the Post Office and the automatic exchange building to get under way in the town of Cavan so that we may enjoy the benefit of an automatic telephone service.  I am not saying that services provided in Cavan are any worse than <Col N="168" /> in any other place, but I think that in a town of its size we should have an automatic exchange.  The Minister has had at his disposal for over 12 months a very fine site right in the middle of the main street, provided by the local authority at a reasonable price, and I think it is fair to expect that that building should begin as soon as possible.  I should like the Minister to deal specifically with that in his reply.</P>
    <P>One other point raised in the Dáil interested me because I had experience of the same difficulty myself.  If one goes into a very small sub-post office in the country he is expected to use the telephone across the counter, to the embarrassment of the person who is making the call and, indeed, to the embarrassment of the subpostmaster or subpostmistress.  I think that was raised in the Dáil by a Deputy and a far as I can see the Minister did not deal with it in his reply.  I know of a case myself where I sometimes go into a small post office.  Usually, I am not embarrassed because I am telephoning only about something I forgot, but the subpostmistress and her staff are extremely embarrassed.  They must either stand there listening to me or do something, which is most undesirable, and leave the room altogether. If I happen to be a hold-up man instead of a <i>bona fide</i> customer I might run off with whatever few shillings were in the post office.  It would not take a lot of money to put that right.  I do not know how many post offices are in the country where one is expected to use the office in such conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Ciosáin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief in my remarks on this Telephone Capital Bill because I believe it is a measure that does not lend itself to a long debate.  What it principally proposes to do is to seek additional capital for further and better development of the telephone system in this country. That, indeed, is a very laudable undertaking and one, I think, on which the Minister deserves congratulation and credit.  Because of that I would join with previous speakers in giving a hearty welcome to this Bill.  It is a pity that in a debate like this comparisons <Col N="169" /> are drawn, comparisons that might be unreal because there are so many factors in this problem and so many things to be taken into account that it is very difficult to draw comparisons. As I say, comparisons are odious.</P>
      <P>I cannot say for the life of me why some of the people opposite, and also some of the people in the Dáil, took exception to the Minister's reference to the 50's.  I saw nothing wrong with that I must confess.  He made a general reference to what was or was not done in the 50's.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Ciosáin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is as well to forget what happened in the past and look to the future.  The proposal now is to spend a lot more money on the expansion of the telephone services in this country&mdash;£30 million.  As somebody said, £30 million appears to be a hefty sum but, in my view and judging from what we have been told about the number of applications which have been made for the installation of telephones up and down the country, I am inclined to think that even the £30 million will hardly be sufficient over the next five years if the Minister is to meet all the demands that are being made on the service.  I hope that it will, but even if it does not, if that sum proves to be inadequate, I am sure if the Minister comes along again for an additional sum his efforts will be welcomed by everybody here just as they have been welcomed today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one fact that emerges from this whole discussion and from the <Col N="170" /> debate.  There is a much greater demand for telephones now than there ever has been before.  That, to my mind, is a clear indication of the growing prosperity of the country.  Unless there is prosperity in business circles, and in other circles as well, people will not look for telephones.  People do not look for things which they think they cannot afford and it is because people in business, in social circles, and so on, think they can afford it, that they are making application for the installation of telephones in their homes and business premises.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to what is alleged to have been the chaotic telephone system in this country some time this year.  I do not subscribe to that.  It is true that calls have been held up much longer than people would like but that has been the case over a number of years.  There cannot be perfection in every system but the Minister now is making a valiant attempt to perfect the system and, as has been said, he cannot do that without the necessary capital.</P>
    <P>Senator L'Estrange referred to what he called a priority charge and it seems he is not in favour of it</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Ciosáin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same thing: I shall call it a priority charge. I do not see anything fundamentally wrong with that.  I imagine that a business person who would be concerned about the progress and advancement of his business would not object to paying extra for a call.  His business would be such as would justify it in comparison with other people who might have to make calls on the same telephone.</P>

      <P>Would the rental be described as a black market charge?  All these things have to be attended to.  I want to refer to the acquisition of sites for telephone exchanges. I do not know what steps the officials of the Department take to acquire a site in a provincial town or if they consult the local authority and come to terms with them.  The reason I refer to it is that within recent times a telephone exchange has been established in the town of New Ross and I happen to be a member of the local urban council.  I am not aware that the officials of the Department ever came near us to discuss the pros and cons of the case.  However, maybe some other system was adopted in that instance.</P>
      <P>This is not a Bill on which we can have a very long discussion.  It is purely a Money Bill.  The Minister is seeking a lot of capital now for the extension of the telephone service and we wish him good luck and God speed in his efforts to improve the telephone system in this country.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and I believe the money sought will be money well spent.  There is a great demand for telephone service at the moment all over the country.  Where the telephone service was quite adequate up to recently, a lot of people are now applying for telephones but cannot get them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In North Kerry, I was asked to do my best in this matter.  It is a tourist area.  Very often tourists, especially business people, find it very difficult to get in touch with their homes or their businesses by way of trunk calls and sometimes they have to wait for hours.  That was not the position some years ago.  Things are different now. Ballybunion especially is meeting with <Col N="172" /> a lot of difficulty in that regard.  I recommend the Minister to take a note of that.</P>
    <P>I believe the chief cause the telephone service is inadequate is that there is extra money in the country and business is improving everywhere. I wish the Minister every success in his undertaking in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very seldom that one can welcome a large amount of additional Government expenditure without any reservation whatsoever but this is one of the occasions on which we can do so.  The large sum which the Minister is requesting to be provided will be invested in a truly productive investment in the sense that the assets created will pay their own way and will not leave any dead-weight debt to be met by additional taxation. It is unlike the position with so much capital expenditure that, even though it may be productive in the very long run, it saddles the taxpayer during the short period with additional taxation to pay the interest on the debt.</P>
      <P>The investment proposed now is self-liquidating. Therefore, merely from the narrow financial point of view, it is one with which we can all agree without any strain on our conscience.  The telephone in modern times is a necessary help to the development of business.  We live in a highly competitive period.  We are entering on the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> in which we shall find ourselves competing more and more with the outside world.  Everything that adds to what is now called the infra-structure of efficiency in society can help us in that struggle.  All forms of communication&mdash;post, telegraph or telephone&mdash;are a help in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most up-to-date means of communication are necessary in modern times.  The Minister proposes to use this money in order to increase the number of telephones in the country and to increase the efficiency of the whole telephone service.  Therefore, from the point of view of our productive efficiency, of our capacity to compete in this very difficult period which lies ahead in the second period, <Col N="173" /> this is truly productive expenditure which everybody can welcome.</P>
    <P>But there is the other side to it. As Senator Costelloe said, telephones are not only useful on the productive side but they are a sign of prosperity, a sign that people are seeking a new social amenity, a sign of a rise in the standard of living.  It is one of the signs of what has now come to be known as the affluent society.  If a country becomes better off more of the national income is spent on durable consumer goods of one sort or another and among those durable consumer goods the telephone ranks very high.</P>
    <P>Expenditure out of the money raised under the Bill will have both a productive and a consumption justification. It can be justified from every point of view and, therefore, the Seanad should welcome the proposals with enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>There is one small technical matter to which the Minister referred: the shortage of engineers.  I wonder why there should be a shortage of engineers in view of the fact that so many engineering graduates of Irish universities have to emigrate to look for employment.  I hope that the Minister will keep in the closest contact with the engineering schools of the universities so as to ensure that graduates produced there will be able to find productive employment at home.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to hear that he proposes to allow some employees to attend full-time day courses in universities. It is being done in other Departments and it is, I believe, yielding a rich dividend.  It is certainly a step in the right direction.  I hope that the Minister will employ as many existing graduates as he can and find as many young people as he can to release for day courses.  This would increase efficiency, would be a step towards giving employment to young graduates and would further the aims of the measure which we all welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good to hear Senator O'Brien in favour of a measure of this sort which entails extra capital expenditure.  It is good, furthermore, to hear him say that he regards it as genuine capital investment.  I <Col N="174" /> thought that at best he would regard it as non-recurring investment or take the view that in the long run it might liquidate itself.  I am glad to hear him express the view that it is capital investment which because of the profits accruing would ultimately liquidate itself.  It is good that he should take that view and it is hopeful, but I wonder if that is not a bit over-hopeful on his part so as to create an atmosphere to encourage the recruitment of people who he seems to think should give service because of this expenditure, people from the universities. Being from a rural area I am inclined to make that little criticism, but I agree with Senator O'Brien that this expenditure can be regarded as genuine capital expenditure.</P>
      <P>It might be argued by some people that it could be regarded as a social investment that might not necessarily liquidate itself but even if it did not that the investment was justified because it provided a better service for the people.  If it can be regarded as creating to some degree a service for the people then that service should as far as possible be evenly distributed. The people of the rural areas would be entitled to a fair share of the service created, entitled to an even break.</P>
      <P>It may be easy to make a case for automatic exchanges in Carrick-on-Shannon or in Cavan.  They are very desirable things I agree because without those facilities, that equipment, that mechanism, you cannot have a good service.  Telephone lines, speakers or call offices without that organisation in the backroom would be of very little value because people would be so annoyed by the delays that they would feel the telephone was more a nuisance than a help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the criticisms at the moment and in the recent past by people who use telephones is that they cannot get the on-the-spot service that they think they should get.  We all appreciate when the annoyance passes over that delays are due to additional traffic. When too many people want to use a circuit at the one time somebody must get annoyed and the people who get most annoyed are probably the unfortunate people who must operate the <Col N="175" /> system.  It is not the sort of employment I would like to take.  I would lose my temper very quickly, I am afraid.  I am inclined to do that anyway.</P>
    <P>There is one matter that deserves the Minister's attention.  There are areas in the country where three post office dioceses or districts seem to meet&mdash;one word is just as good as another.  Where, say, the circuits of Cavan, Carrick-on-Shannon and Longford happen to meet you are bound to have a rather forgotten area where people have to travel rather a long distance to get to a phone and when they do get to the phone of their choice they are over-priced.  That always happens in rural areas.  I have had complaints from many people about this.</P>
    <P>A person living on the perimeter of the area served by Cavan may want to ring Longford.  Even though he may be in County Longford his post office routes take him to Cavan, Mullingar and ultimately to Longford, a distance of perhaps 15 miles and the cost is much greater.  A person in North Longford ringing Oldcastle or Clones would get the same call for three pennies.  There are several such areas in the country.  They are not confined to one particular place.  Where post office districts meet you seem to find a no man's land.  The Minister may not agree that there is a no man's land but by comparison with the service which exists in other areas&mdash;and all things are comparative&mdash;I think I could truthfully say that there is something resembling a no man's land and that lines are not being developed to give good coverage or good service to the people of the perimeter areas where districts meet.</P>
    <P>I am hoping, by bringing this matter to the notice of the Minister, that he will have it examined.  When this House agrees to the provision of extra capital investment in the telephone service, that investment should be fairly spread and a fair share of that capital should be spent in the development of the service in the areas I have mentioned where people at the moment seem to suffer hardship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and <Col N="176" /> I should like to congratulate the Minister on the improvement that has taken place in the telephone service in the area where I live in the past twelve months.  Long ago great delay was experienced in making trunk calls.  On one occasion I had to wait one and a half hours when making a call to Ennis, which is a distance of only twenty miles by road from where I live, but all calls had to go through Limerick.  On two occasions I had to wait one and a half hours to make a call to the courthouse there.  There is a new line from Limerick to Scariff and the waiting time is only three minutes.  I want to thank the Minister and his Department for that.</P>
      <P>There is a great demand for telephones. People have asked me to get them telephones.  As Senator Ó Ciosáin and other Senators have said, the priest, the veterinary surgeon, the doctor, the farmer all require telephones. The demand for telephones is due to progress.  Long ago, milk went by horse and cart to the creamery. Now it is taken by motor vehicle.  The demand for private telephones is due to the fact that people are better off and are anxious to move with the times and avail of modern amenities.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for the extra accommodation provided in Scariff and Tuamgraney which facilitates calls to Ennis.  For calls that one had formerly to wait 1½ hours the waiting time is now only three minutes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill can be taken in sequence to the 1960 Act.  That Act authorised the Minister for Finance to make available £10 million over a specified period of time and, as I have already told the Seanad, that money has been used over a shorter period of time than anticipated.  There is something more in the development of a telephone service than the mere injection of capital.  You must have a staff and we have been building up our staff since 1960 to meet the growing demands of the service.  Since 1960, we have increased the working staff by 50 per cent and we are using the capital at a certain rate, one year so much more than another&mdash;£4½ million this <Col N="177" /> year and £6 million next year&mdash;and we will increase the staff to usefully employ the amount of capital that will be made available next year.</P>
      <P>I am thankful to the Seanad for the manner in which it has met this Bill. When dealing with the Bill the Senators have been co-operative in their approach to this matter.  They realise, of course, as well as I realise, that the deficiencies in the telephone system that became so very apparent during last summer, were due mainly to the very increased call demand that was made on the service.</P>
      <P>A telephone service is efficient insofar as its network and equipment are capable of meeting the calls that the public put upon it at any given time or over a period of time.  Whenever the calls put upon a telephone service exceed the capabilities of the equipment to carry the calls, you are in trouble.  The same thing applies to an automatic exchange.  If the outlets from an automatic exchange are not sufficient to carry the additional traffic on the automatic exchange that the exchange is capable of taking you get all classes of queer results&mdash;extra-ordinary results&mdash;and there is nothing that the engineers in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs can do about a matter such as that except to provide the additional circuits that are needed to meet the demand and the anticipated demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said here in connection with this question of capital allocations and my reference to capital restrictions as a cause of the present defects in the telephone service has been challenged here and it was challenged in the Dáil also.  It has been asserted that I sought to blame my predecessors for the present defects. Nothing could be further from my purpose.  My aim is to put the service right and that is why this huge sum is being sought.  But, there can be no denying the facts and the facts are that the telephone service was not given enough capital during the 1950's to provide enough capital for future growth and it was this failure to provide enough capital for future growth that has led to the present defects, such as they are.  You have to take <Col N="178" /> that along with the unprecedented demand that has occurred for telephone services, both call traffic and for telephones, since the commencement of 1960.</P>
    <P>It has been asserted that the provisions then made were sufficient to meet the demand then existing or anticipated.  At least, that is what I understand from the statements made here by the Senators who raised this matter.  That is, in fact, incorrect.</P>

      <P>The money was provided in the 1950's.  There was £8 million provided in 1951.  That is what the Telephone Capital Act authorised the Minister for Finance to advance to the Post Office&mdash;£8 million in 1951. That Act was brought in by the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Mr. Childers, the present Minister for Transport and Power.  The 1956 Act&mdash; I did not intend to go into this&mdash; provided for the authorisation of £6 million.  That is a drop of £2 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>For four years.  I am saying that.  That is, £14 million of capital was made available.  The Minister for Finance was authorised to invest £14 million of capital in the telephone service in the 1950's.  I am asking in the 1960's for the investment of £40 million and, certainly, the investment of £40 million in the 1960's and its proper utilisation by an increased staff will have a profound effect on the telephone service in the 1970's.  There is no denying that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in very good company in saying that there was a shortage of capital in the 1950's.  The then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, when he was introducing the 1956 Telephone Capital Bill, which by the way, provided for £6 million, as I say&mdash;made it quite clear that that sum would not be sufficient to meet completely, on the basis of recent demand&mdash;that was the demand then&mdash;the anticipated needs <Col N="179" /> of the service over the next few years. He went on to say that in consequence they would not be able to install all the subscribers' lines they wished, to undertake all the underground development schemes required in built-up areas, to meet, and to anticipate, applications for telephones, to equip as many exchanges for automatic working as they would wish, nor to provide all the additional trunk lines they would do if there was no capital shortage.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt they did the best they could with the money that could be got.  All I wish to say is that there was not enough money available and no bandying about of figures will prove otherwise.  If any further proof is necessary, I think the fact that we are now looking for £30 million for the next five years, which is almost as much as has been spent in the past 40 years, ought to be sufficiently indicative of the massive investment necessary to bring the telephone service up to a statisfactory standard.  I think that is about the last we will hear about that in my view because this Bill gives the Minister for Finance authority to make advances to the Post Office and the necessary capital for the purposes indicated in the Bill.  We hope to utilise the £30 million over the next five years at the rate of £6 million per year but that is dependent upon the capital formation being such that the State can afford to invest the capital and have the capital to invest in the national <Col N="180" /> development programme.  That has already been outlined in the general sense.  The Bill does not provide the capital.  The capital formation obtains in this country on a sound fiscal policy followed by the Government in office.</P>

      <P>In 1956 there was a withdrawal of £350,000 from stores. You have to deduct that from the figure the Senator gave and you also have to take into consideration that up to 80 men belonging to the Engineering Branch of the Post Office had their services dispensed with during 1956 because the Post Office was not in a position to employ the full staff they had in the development of the telephone services.</P>

      <P>I have already indicated to Senator L'Estrange that to get a full picture of the capital investment and the work done by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in the provision of an efficient telephone service you have to take something else into consideration besides the necessary capital investment.  You have got to take into consideration the stores on hands, the stores on order and the strength of the technical or labour force.  When you have the full picture then you can compare what happened in any particular year.  Up to 80 men were let go from the Engineering <Col N="181" /> Branch in 1956 because the Post Office was not able to employ them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I would want notice of that question.  I will give you the withdrawal from stores.  I am not going to follow every hare.  There was £14 million provided in the 1950's and I am asking the State to invest £30 million. We are confident that the State will be able to provide that over the 1960's if we have a good Government.</P>
      <P>There has been a good deal of complaint about the speed of answering by exchanges, particularly Dublin Exchange, during the peak traffic period last summer.  As I explained in reply to such criticisms in the course of the Dáil debate on this Bill last week, I am aware that the speed of answer was poor on occasions.  The fault lay, not with the operating staff, but with inadequate equipment which was unable to cope with surges of traffic, as a result of which heavy additional burdens were thrown on the operators in making connections and in assisting on calls that would ordinarily be dialled direct by subscribers.</P>
      <P>I wish to make it clear, however, that the speed of answer at almost all hours of the day has for a considerable time past been generally satisfactory. No effort will be spared to improve matters further and to maintain a good standard at all times.  Senators will appreciate, however, that on special occasions some deterioration is inevitable.  Unexpected surges of traffic occur, for which I cannot expect my Department to make advance staffing provision.  In addition, there are very special occasions on which it would be unreasonable to expect normal service. For example, I am making a special appeal to the public to limit their telephoning on Christmas Day to emergency calls or calls which do not require operator service.  This is necessary in order to allow as many as possible of the operating staff to spend Christmas Day at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the special charge for trunk calls to which Senator L'Estrange <Col N="182" /> referred, the aim is to ensure that, when a particular trunk route is congested, urgent and important calls on it will be given precedence over ordinary calls.  The only practicable way of confirming that a particular call is genuinely urgent and important is to apply the special rate, which is double the normal fee.  My Department is not interested in the special rate from the revenue aspect and would gladly drop it in favour of any other suitable and effective means of affording priority on a fair basis.  Approximately one trunk call in every one thousand is made at the special rate.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick referred to the lack of privacy in telephoning from sub-post offices.  In most cases a silence cabinet is available and, generally, it may be taken that in cases where there is no cabinet the reason is lack of space in the sub-post office. I do not know if Senator Fitzpatrick has any particular office in mind.  I would not know what he would know, by looking at the office, whether it could carry a silence cabinet or not, but we like to put them in wherever we can even though it means further capital cost.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald referred to extra mileage charge made to subscribers more than three miles from the exchange. In regard to this I wish to say that the cost of installing and maintaining the long lines in question is generally very high and even with the extra charge the revenue from those lines is rarely enough to meet the annual cost.  Sometimes we do not get interest on the amount of capital involved but if the telephone network expands we will have to have more exchanges and it will narrow down the area serviced from a particular exchange.  It may be that in time a problem such as that can, and will be, met, but I would not wish to say anything definite on it.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien asked me if the universities were approached in relation to the engineers.  The technical officers of my Department visit the final year classes in the university to inform students of electrical engineering and physics of the employment offered in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. <Col N="183" /> It is true that a number of them emigrate and do not come to us. We would be anxious to get them. Insofar as the Department and myself are concerned we would be glad to see many more of them come to the post office when this money is available and the organisation is being perfected to carry out this immense task and this work which is waiting to be done. There will be opportunities for electrical engineers in the post office.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick asked me about the exchange in Cavan.  There is an automatic exchange and a new post office proposed for Cavan on that site. The position is that we are only in the preliminary planning stage in the post office building branch and in my view it will be a long time before the buildings are erected.  The Office of Public Works comes into this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to mention this again.  May I be pardoned for mentioning it now?  If this is the case would the Minister and his Department take steps to see that this large site in the central markets in Cavan is tidied up and kept tidy so as not to disfigure the town for some years to come?  It is under the control of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs now and has been somewhat neglected.  I had occasion to write to the Department about it.  If it is neglected in disuse it will be very unsightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to look at that.  It is something that should not be allowed to happen.  A site of that nature should be kept as well as possible in present circumstances.  Senator Ó Ciosáin referred to the selection of sites and asked if local authorities are consulted.  I cannot say that if that is what happened at New Ross, but it is the ordinary practice to consult the local authorities and the other interested parties in a matter of this kind. The Office of Public Works comes into the selection of sites also, and I am unable to say what happened in New Ross, but from my own experience apart from ministerial experience I know that in some cases people call to the county engineer or the local <Col N="184" /> engineer attached to the local authority and, having done that, they have discharged their function.  If the members of the council do not know about it then I suppose it is a matter for the office routine in the council concerned.</P>
      <P>I think that I have answered all the points raised by Senators, and I want to say again that I am grateful for the manner in which the Bill has been received.  I hope that when it becomes law the telephone system will improve out of all recognition over the next four or five years.  I am unable to say what will happen next summer in relation to telephone traffic.  If it is a good summer and we have a very large influx of tourists it may be that the telephone service next summer will be taxed to its capacity, but, nevertheless, the orders that were placed in 1960 for equipment are coming to hand now only over the last year, and the necessary equipment that has come is being installed at the fastest possible rate.  I hope that by next summer the telephone service will be able to carry the traffic offering, but I would not wish to forecast in advance what the position will be next summer.  I hope that it will not be like last summer when I admit it was taxed beyond capacity.  It is not fair to say that our telephone service is chaotic or obsolete. The fact is that the telephone branch, the operators in it and the automatic exchanges handled successfully last year 167,000,000 calls&mdash;a tremendous advance in the number of calls in any year during the fifties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Building Agency Limited is a private company <Col N="185" /> incorporated under the Companies Acts.  It has a nominal capital of £100. The primary object in its establishment was to facilitate the provision of houses required in connection with industrial expansion where the need for such housing could not be met appropriately by local authorities or is not otherwise met by private enterprise. It was intended that the Agency should also participate in the provision of housing for State personnel, including Gardaí, whose duties involve a transfer to different parts of the country.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment the Agency has been financing the construction of houses for industrial personnel by means of temporary advances obtained from the Industrial Credit Company. Money required for houses for the Garda Síochána is recouped from the Vote for Public Works and Buildings, the day to day needs being met by temporary bank overdraft accommodation.</P>
      <P>When speaking in the Seanad on the 8th March, 1961 on the motion that the company be scheduled to the State Guarantees Act 1954, I said that when the extent of the operations of the Agency could be foreseen more clearly consideration would be given to making adequate long term arrangements for the financing of its operations. The operations of the Agency are now such that appropriate long term arrangements for financing them are warranted.  The Bill now before the House provides for direct finance from the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The Bill follows the general lines of legislation relating to the financing of similar semi-State bodies.  No new principle is introduced.</P>
      <P>There is provision for the taking up of shares by the Minister for Finance within a limit of £100,000.  This provision is not, however, intended to be the main source of finance.  It will, however, give flexibility in the financing of the Agency if, for example, the Agency should find it appropriate to invest in or sponsor another company engaged in housing or ancillary activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 makes provision for <Col N="186" /> repayable advances by the Minister for Finance to the Agency and will be the principal power to be availed of for the purposes of financing the industrial housing programme.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for power for the guaranteeing by the Minister for Local Government with the consent of the Minister for Finance of borrowing by the Agency.  It is hoped that this section will be availed of from time to time to provide funds from the Agency as an alternative to or in addition to Section 6.</P>
    <P>There is an overall limit of £2 million in the amount provided by Sections 6 and 7.  Fresh legislation to extend this limit will be necessary if this figure is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>Senators will I am sure be interested in the progress of the Agency to date.</P>
    <P>On the industrial side the Agency has undertaken to provide or assist in the provision of some 285 houses for industrial workers at various centres scattered throughout about 20 counties. The persons for whom houses are being provided include skilled technical and executive personnel whose services are essential for the establishment and development of the industries and for whom houses are not otherwise available locally.  The total commitment involved to date is about £686,000. Of the 285 houses, 82 have been completed or substantially completed, while construction work is in progress or contracts have been allocated in respect of a further 66 houses.</P>
    <P>The Agency is in a position to give a comprehensive service to industrialists anxious to provide housing accommodation for their workers.  The comprehensive housing service entails a full technical and administrative service on the part of the Agency. Under this service, the Agency makes arrangements to select and purchase a suitable site, prepares site layout plans and specifications, designs the houses, invites tenders and recommends the appointment of a building contractor.  During the course of the building contract the Agency's technical staff controls the building operations by supervising the work in progress. In addition, similar loan facilities <Col N="187" /> are extended in respect of the project as obtain under the partial housing service.  Recently the tendency has been for industrialists to avail of the full comprehensive service.  The industrialists who have availed of this service include both established firms wishing to expand and new firms setting up in business.  The service is found to be attractive to the industrialists as under it they are relieved of the major problems and difficulties involved in providing houses and are left free to concentrate on industrial development proper.  The success of the Agency in this sphere suggests the possibility of its being able to assist in other housing operations in the future.</P>
    <P>As regards Garda housing the Agency has on hands the provision of some 530 houses as part of the Garda Housing Programme.  So far, sites are being or have been acquired for about 410 houses, tenders have been invited for the erection of 255 houses and contracts have been entered into for the erection of 219 of them.  About 80 are completed or substantially completed. These houses are being provided in widely separated centres throughout the 26 Counties.  In many centres only one or two houses are being provided.</P>
    <P>In Templemore 23 houses are being provided on four different sites in connection with the new training depot.</P>
    <P>I have recently had the opportunity of seeing some of the houses which are being built for the Gardaí.  The schemes which I visited were widely dispersed and the works in progress were at the various stages of construction. I was very much impressed with the results achieved both from the point of view of economy and cost, and, what is equally important, high standards of construction and design. It was evident to me that the Agency had given much consideration to these important aspects.</P>
    <P>I think that these remarks will give a general picture of the progress and activities of the Agency up to the present.  I feel that Senators will agree that the new arrangements proposed in this Bill are justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>As we all know there is a dearth and shortage of <Col N="188" /> houses in the State at the present time. Insofar as this measure will increase the number of houses to be built and made available in any part of the State, I welcome this Bill.  We are glad to see that such progress as the Minister has pointed out here has been made with regard to houses for the Garda Síochána.  The provision of those houses will no doubt relieve the local authorities in the different counties of their obligations to provide houses for those people and will leave extra houses available for perhaps more deserving people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I think we are all aware, the National Building Agency was established with the primary object of facilitating the provision of houses in connection with industrial expansion, where the need could not appropriately be met by local authorities, or is not otherwise met by private enterprise. We are glad to see that it is expanding. I do hope that as regards this new Agency and this new Board more information will be given to Deputies and Senators by the Minister concerned with this new State Board, and that more information will be given to members of the Oireachtas than is being given about State Boards at the present time.  I hope that in the future the Minister, or should I say perhaps his successor, whoever he may be, will not tell Deputies, when they ask questions, that he has no responsibility in the matter, or that he will not take the line which the Minister for Transport and Power takes when questions are put to him in regard to the operations of the ESB or CIE.  I believe that all State companies should be answerable to Parliament.  I believe an undesirable state of affairs has grown up in this country whereby the elected representatives of the people are refused vital information when they seek it in the Houses of the Oireachtas; all our State companies should be answerable to Parliament.  We want to ensure that in this Board, and in any board that is set up by this State, everything is done by the board and that the normal procedures are followed.  For example, with this Board all contracts will be advertised for public tender and there will be no question of patronage in the allocation of contracts.  We know that <Col N="189" /> mention was made in the Dáil and other places about what happened in Radio Éireann a few years ago.  Only a certain number of tenders were invited for that work which was never publicly advertised&mdash;and I state never publicly advertised.  We certainly do not want this undesirable procedure to happen under the National Building Agency.  The worst feature of that whole unsavoury procedure was that when the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was questioned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying I hope these State companies will give information when they are asked for it and that everything will be done above board, that they will advertise contracts, that there will be no political patronage, and I believe that when questions are asked as they were asked of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in regard to another board&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will be responsible for the actions of the local authorities and if he is questioned in the Dáil he will give the information required.  If anything goes wrong in the future I hope he will not say it is a matter for the board and that as Minister for Local Government he is not prepared to answer the questions, but that he will give all the available information to the members of the Oireachtas.  We are against political patronage.  We know that there is an alarming amount of political patronage in State and semi-State bodies throughout the country at the present time.  Those who fought and died in 1916 fought for equal rights and opportunities for all our people and I do hope that this Board will see to it that everybody gets an equal opportunity and equal rights as regards contracts.  I claim that what is happening with many people when they become <Col N="190" /> directors of State and semi-State bodies is deplorable.</P>
      <P>I agree with the principle that civil servants are members of the board of directors, but I loathe what has been done, or what they have had to do, and I should like to know from the Minister that these civil servants are free to use their discretion in the selection of people to work for this Agency. If they are free, for example, to use their discretion in the selection of solicitors&mdash;and I claim they should be &mdash;is it not strange that they have selected Fianna Fáil Party hacks in every county?  I believe civil servants of the type we have in Ireland would not have stooped to that if they did not get direction from somebody or from somewhere.  It is a deplorable state of affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the question of information about the activities of this company, all reasonable information will be given by me.  I cannot talk for my successor: the Senator seems to feel there may be one.  However, in so far as I am concerned, as Minister for Local Government, all reasonable information will be available to the members of the Oireachtas at any reasonable time and, naturally, when asked for in any reasonable manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the suggestion that patronage might be allowed to creep into the giving of contracts is concerned, experience to date on costings over the whole field of the operations <Col N="191" /> of the Building Agency would suggest that they are getting better prices&mdash; that is, more economic prices &mdash; for these house contracts than the local authorities are able to get from the same contractors in their counties.  If this suggests patronage, I am afraid I cannot say I shall try to prevent it because one of the purposes of the Agency is to do the job speedily and economically.  To date, at any rate, they have been doing just that.</P>
    <P>The Agency have been getting jobs done with a greater speed than would the normal local authority which is subject to all these stipulations about publication, the time that must elapse before the closure date and all the examination that must be gone through before they can get down to work.  It is, to a large degree, to obviate many of these drawn-out delays of which we are aware in our public authority building that we have seen fit to institute this Agency as a company so that it may have, in its dealings on behalf of industrialists and others who commission it to get building done for them, the same freedom as the commercial companies with whom it is dealing and for whom it is acting.</P>
    <P>The usefulness of this Agency, I think, is fully accepted by all concerned even including the Senator who has just spoken.  It is true that in their building operations, particularly widespread building operations for the members of the Garda, they are contributing in a very direct way to the housing of the people in those local authority areas where they are operating. Every house they erect probably relieves another house.  Whether it is a local authority house or a private house does not materially alter the picture of another house provided and, therefore, another vacated.  It follows then, that some person or persons or family may come to be housed as a result.</P>
    <P>The programme for the Gardaí is going on at quite a good rate.  In fact, I do not think anything other than this type of Agency, with the freedom of operation that it has, could have got done in the time the same work that the Agency has accomplished.  As I have already <Col N="192" /> indicated, in their very short time in existence, they have actually got around to dealing with sites for 410 of the 530 houses for the Gardaí which is the first stage of the operation on behalf of the Department of Justice.  When you consider that very few groups of houses are contained in their operations and very few sites, therefore, are contained in that figure of 410, it will readily be understood that a great deal of work was necessary and that that work was done with the greatest possible expedition.</P>
    <P>The greater part of that work, in the initial stage, was done by the legal people who have been abused here this evening by Senator L'Estrange.  They have done that work well, competently and expeditiously.  If, for their pains and their trouble in doing that job well, they are to be described as they were described here by Senator L'Estrange, I am afraid he will not get much support for that abuse in this House or outside it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>You indulged in it for years.  You got promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That brings me to the suggestion that this company and this Agency may follow the ways of other State boards and that there is, in the words of Senator L'Estrange, an alarming amount of patronage in the activities of those boards at present. If there is evidence of patronage, all I ask Senator L'Estrange is: whose patronage? If he has the evidence, I want to know from him just who is being patronised, who has been patronised&mdash;and who knows better than Senator L'Estrange and members of his Party just how patronage is dispensed when they have the power to do it? If he thinks over that and examines some of his suggestions about what we should avoid he will realise they come either from a guilty conscience or a full knowledge of how these things are and were manipulated by his Party when he had the opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I leave it to the Senator to think of it in those terms. The Bill before the House is, as Members are fully aware, quite simple and straightforward.  Its terms have been examined and gone through in detail on previous occasions when dealing with the sponsoring of other similar organisations.  There is little further I can add to what I have said except that the expectations that I expressed when I set up this Agency are being realised.  I believe this Agency is doing not only good work at the moment but that there is great <Col N="194" /> scope in it at the moment and that it will prove itself a very great asset to the nation and the national economy in the years that lie ahead.</P>
