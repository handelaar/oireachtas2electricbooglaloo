    <P>Sections 1 and 2 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 3 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister how the powers under this section will be enforced. If a proprietor refuses me admission to a hotel, can I go for the Guards? Do I have to wait and report the matter and have it investigated?  As I see it, this whole section is in default. I think a hotel proprietor could say the next day: &ldquo;We had no staff&rdquo; or: &ldquo;We had rooms positively booked&rdquo; or make some suggestion like that which would be reasonable or held to be reasonable.  I should like just to bring that whole question to the Minister's mind again.  I am not suggesting that the idea to make a hotel receive people is not a good one but it will be practically impossible to enforce the section and bring a successful criminal prosecution against them. In that regard I think the section is <Col N="342" /> to a great extent useless legislation. I regard it very nearly in the same way as I regard such hopeful clauses in Bills as:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Minister shall after consultation with the Minister for Finance or after consultation with the Minister for Local Government&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not think these sort of things have any force at all.  I think that in relation to receiving guests and also with regard to food Section 3 is unenforceable.</P>
      <P>What is a reasonable refusal to serve food or what is reasonable food at one o'clock at night?  The staff have gone and the night watchman or the receptionist may be the only people there. Will they be compelled to rouse the staff to get food or are they supposed to get it themselves and leave whatever job they might be engaged on? What is the position?  I cannot see Section 3 being enforced at all or a criminal prosecution under the section ever being brought or ever being successfully enforced.  For that reason I feel that the Minister should have made it more a matter for a civil action and cut out the criminal side altogether.  I do not think he can possibly enforce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to ask a question, but Senator Cole has asked it.  I was under the impression that it was not a matter of criminal action by the Guards.  I may be wrong.  I consider that the person asking for accommodation would have a civil action against the proprietor of the hotel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems the right of civil action is of no use whatever. I can conceive of nobody taking that kind of action except, perhaps, a certain type of crank.  This type is in a small minority.  I am not a hotel proprietor. I cannot see how this would be enforced.  I wonder whether the Minister has any information as to whether any prosecutions or any action of any kind were taken under this kind of provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an action <Col N="343" /> a few years ago against the Wicklow Hotel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the case of an overcoat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a civil case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a civil action taken against two hotels, I think, because a man would not be served lunch as he was wearing an overcoat. Those cases are very, very rare.  I wonder if a man went into a hotel in his shirt sleeves would there be reasonable ground for refusing him? I know, for example, that in a golf club members are not served lunch if they are in their shirt sleeves.  That has been tried in one or two places. It is also the case in Spain.  The whole thing seems to be&mdash;as Senator Cole stated&mdash;rather unworkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister just briefly with regard to the phrase &ldquo;unless he has reasonable grounds for refusal&rdquo;, where are those grounds to be determined?  If it is left to a civil action, surely it would be very hard for the person aggrieved to find the necessary proofs to establish his case once time had elapsed and unless he went to call the Guards straightaway?  What more right then have the Guards to enter the premises?</P>
      <P>They are brought to the hall door and the doorbell rings again and it is answered.  The Guards say: &ldquo;This man tells us that you have refused him admission.&rdquo;  The hotel proprietor or somebody speaking on his behalf gives the same reply to the police: &ldquo;We are booked out; we are full,&rdquo; or some other such excuse.  What more right then have the Guards got after they have been given that answer than the person who was refused in the first place?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I said on the Second Stage that I thought the section was unnecessary, but the Minister is determined to have it in the Bill and I do not propose to push that any further.  I should like to clarify this point.  Am I right in thinking that, for <Col N="344" /> all practical purposes, this section only applies to hotels registered in the register of hotels kept under Part 3 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>It applies to them in a compulsory way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some very substantial hotels which never came in under the Bord Fáilte scheme.  They refused to register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>For all practical purposes it only applies to hotels registered under that Act because in order to escape the provisions of this Bill, all another hotel has to do is to hang up a notice saying: &ldquo;Right of admission reserved&rdquo;.  It is not then holding itself out as ready and willing to accept all comers.  I should have more properly raised this on the definition section, which states that a hotel is an establishment which provides or holds itself out as providing sleeping accommodation, food and drink for reward for all comers without special contract.  Then it goes on to say that every establishment registered under the Act is deemed to be a hotel.  Supposing an establishment that is not so registered hangs up a notice that it is not prepared to cater for all comers, then there is no obligation on it to do so.  Am I right in thinking that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with the last question first, I do not think so. This would be a question of fact to be determined in each particular circumstance and it would be a question of fact whether or not a hotel did, in fact, hold itself out to receive all comers. It could not escape its liability under the Bill simply by hanging up a notice, as suggested by the Senator, if, in fact, the reality of the situation was that it did receive all comers and thereby brought itself within the scope of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Senator Cole is concerned primarily with the question of criminal prosecutions under the section.  Speaking on the Second Stage of the Bill, he indicated that in his opinion that section was unnecessary, because, in <Col N="345" /> fact, we now had so many hotels that the situation was that the hotels were actually looking for business and there was no question of their turning anybody away and, therefore, to a large extent the section was unnecessary.  As I indicated on the Second Stage this provision with regard to the refusal to accept persons calling to a hotel is already in the law.  It is already a crime not to so receive people and we who examine the law have to consider whether or not this particular provision should be retained.  It might be argued that it is slightly anachronistic in present circumstances.  I did say that on balance we decided to retain it because I think it is important that society, as it were, through the instrumentality of the State, should have the power to see that the provisions of this Bill are enforced, as distinct from the entitlement of any individual citizen to assert his civil rights.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Hayes that, by and large, the rights which are set out in the Bill and the obligations which are placed on hotelkeepers will be enforced as a matter of civil law &mdash;as a rule by private citizens.</P>
    <P>Apart from all that, however, it might be desirable in the interests of social justice from time to time that the State should insist on these provisions being enforced.  One of the matters I mentioned was that we might have at some time the emergence of some kind of colour or racial bar in Irish hotels.  I do not think that any member of the Seanad would welcome or countenance any such development and in any such circumstances it might be well that the State should retain the power to enforce the provisions of the Bill by criminal proceedings if necessary.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Hayes that it is very unlikely that we would invoke the provisions of Section 12 except on very rare occasions.  Nevertheless, we did decide that on balance it was better to keep it there.  I do not think there is any question that it need be any more difficult to enforce criminal proceedings under Section 12 than any other of the various provisions under which the police must proceed <Col N="346" /> from time to time.  Any time that a crime is committed there is a problem for the police to procure evidence and to establish that evidence to the satisfaction of the court afterwards. Probably there would be difficulties but every time the police go out to secure a conviction they have to face up to difficulties of one kind or another.  They have all the powers here that they have in criminal law generally: questioning, taking statements&mdash;all the things that are available to the police in a criminal matter are available to them under the section.  So I do not think the fears the Senator expresses on Section 3 from the criminal point of view are valid.</P>
    <P>These were the only points put to me, I think.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that there is now under the Bill no civil right whatever on the part of a person who is refused accommodation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 (1) states:</P>
      <P>The duties, liabilities and rights provided for by this Act shall have effect in place of the duties, liabilities and rights which heretofore attached by the common law to innkeepers as such.</P>
      <P>That would seem to abolish all liabilities except such as are created by the Bill.  Subject to correction, it seems to me that the only liability would be criminal liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>All sorts of statutory duties are now imposed on hotelkeepers under the Bill, in Sections 3, 4, 5 and so on, and those liabilities which are imposed on hotelkeepers will be enforceable by any citizen under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am wrong, but suppose a man goes to a hotel, looks for accommodation and is refused accommodation.  Where in the Bill is it provided that he can take civil proceedings against the proprietor of the hotel if as a result he can get no <Col N="347" /> accommodation locally and has to sleep in his car for the night?  He can, I know, complain to the State and have the State institute proceedings afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>He can enforce the statutory duty under the section. Section 3 states that the proprietor of a hotel is under a duty to receive as guests all persons unless he has reasonable grounds for refusing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>That surely is a public duty and enforceable only criminally? That is how it appears to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, these are statutory duties imposed by the Bill on hotel proprietors and as such they render the proprietors open to an action in tort for any breach of that statutory duty by the hotel proprietor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell me if there is any provision in the Tourist Traffic Act to allow the Guards compulsorily to inspect the books of a hotel to see if it were full on the night I presented myself at the door?  Otherwise what proof is there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what is in the Tourist Traffic Act about that but if the police decided on the basis of a complaint by a citizen that a hotel proprietor was in default of his obligations under this and they decide to take criminal proceedings then all the normal instruments would be available to them.  They could take statements from the proprietor of the hotel and from the hall porter and they would be able to establish whether the hotel people had reasonable grounds for refusing.  It is not too easy to hoodwink the police in matters of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>If the hotel proprietor locks his books in the safe the next morning&mdash;the attendance book, the visitors' book or whatever it might be &mdash;how will you convict him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The police can take a statement from the bookkeeper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>She need not make a statement.  I maintain that under this section the police have no more right <Col N="348" /> than the person first aggrieved to enter the premises on being called upon. I do not think it gives them any power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>They have no power under this Bill but ordinary police powers are available to them and they are adequate under the circumstances to enable them to enforce the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us reduce this to a simple happening, which all of us I am sure have in mind.  A person arrives at one or two in the morning to a hotel and seeks admission.  The porter or somebody at the hotel opens the door to him and answers his request for accommodation by saying: &ldquo;I am sorry we are full up.&rdquo;  The fellow may have reason to believe, rightly or wrongly, that they are not full up or he may be a crank who says: &ldquo;The Minister for Justice recently put a Bill through the Seanad to protect fellows like me and I am going to the Guards.&rdquo; A Guard comes up with him.  The same person answers the door and says &ldquo;Well Guard, I have already told this man that we are full up and we are.&rdquo; What can the Guard do then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not for me to speculate on what a Guard should do in any particular circumstance but commonsense indicates that the Guard should take a statement to that effect from the hotel porter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Who need not make it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>He might indicate to the porter that the complainant had reasonable grounds to believe that the hotel was not full and that it was a matter which the Guards would investigate fully&mdash;not necessarily there and then&mdash;to see whether criminal proceedings would lie.  I am not suggesting that it would be open to them or desirable at that point to search the hotel to see if they could find an empty bed&mdash;that might have dreadful results.  It would be a matter that they would investigate in the ordinary routine way in which police investigate matters of the kind to see whether a prosecution would lie or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal thing which this section will prevent is a <Col N="349" /> hotel proprietor picking and choosing his guests.  It does mean that if he is, in fact, doing that and does not like a particular guest he will be in the position if he refuses that guest, and if he takes anybody else later, that he will be liable to have that person called as a witness to show that there was, in fact, accommodation. If he wants to refuse a guest he has to refuse all other people who present themselves that night, or else run the risk of having an action taken against him because the person who is received subsequently could be called as a witness to show that there was not a room. I think that is the principal thing that this section is designed to prevent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the point made by Senator Cole and Senator Lindsay is that if a hotel proprietor knows the law sufficiently well it would be impossible to convict him under this Bill, because under this Bill there is no power&mdash;I am not saying there should be but I am showing the futility of the Act&mdash;given to the Garda to enter and inspect the register.  As I understand it, the Garda cannot enter on private property to make investigations and search a house unless under statutory authority.  There is no such authority contained in this Bill.  I think that is the point made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Searching the house would be the least effective instrument available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Searching the house and inspecting the register.  If they were entitled to inspect the register for the night that the complaint was received they would know whether all the accommodation was availed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>We seem to be trying to visualise a rather odd situation. Someone turns up and asks if there is a room in a hotel and the proprietor says &ldquo;No, you cannot get in because I have no room&rdquo;.  I understand most hotel proprietors are in the business to make money and will not turn away customers.  I presume that if he turns <Col N="350" /> someone away, the hotel proprietor will have grounds for so doing.  It would be presumed that he had reasonable grounds: the man might be roaring drunk and kicking up a row.</P>
      <P>He would not, just because he was crooked about it, be likely to turn away a customer.  What I want to raise is the point mentioned by Senator Fitzpatrick to which the Minister replied but the answer to which I do not understand. He wants to know about the case where an establishment under this Bill which was not a registered hotel existed and the owner sought to provide the provisions of this Bill by hanging up a notice to say that he did not accept all comers.  The Minister said, if I understand him aright: &ldquo;Ah, but it is not established in that way.  Hanging up a notice is not any good.  It is the facts that matter.&rdquo;  Surely if the case arose it would mean that he had in fact, restricted entry and therefore the case would already have been proved.  I cannot see what could arise to show that he did, in fact, accept all comers in spite of his notice and if a case arose it could be proved that he did not receive all comers,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of proofs, as practitioners in the House know better than I do.  Many a citizen has an excellent cause of action from time to time but it often turns out to be unenforceable because he is not able to produce the necessary proofs.  In this case there would be a question of fact to be determined if somebody wanted to take an action against a hotel proprietor, on the basis of the nonobservance of the duties imposed by Sections 3, 4, 5 or 6.  If the hotel proprietor is registered with Bord Fáilte it is a different matter.  He is liable anyway.  Senator Fitzpatrick spoke about the liability of the proprietor who is not registered and who endeavours to throw off his responsibility under the Bill by the simple device of putting up a notice to the effect that he reserves right of admission. I say the simple act of putting up that notice would not be enough because the definition section&mdash;Section I&mdash;speaks about an establishment which provides or holds itself out as providing accommodation for all comers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, an establishment which provides accommodation for all comers.  The person taking the action may be able to show that, despite this notice in the foyer of the hotel, the establishment does in fact receive all comers and does provide accommodation.  If the hotel proprietor proves that this notice means what it says and that he does not hold himself out as receiving all comers, then presumably the action would fail, but it would be a question of fact whether or not he did, in fact, provide for everybody who came along or, alternatively, hold himself out as providing for everybody who came along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>What I cannot understand is how the man could hold himself out as providing accommodation for all comers if he had a notice up to say he did not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says he could prove whether, in fact, he did accept all comers.  Suppose I run an inn to provide bed and breakfast and out of the first two thousand guests there is not one at whom I could raise an eyebrow.  I am restricting entry but I accept the lot.  The two thousand and first fellow comes along but he is refused.  He says: &ldquo;You accepted the two thousand, therefore the hotel is open to all comers and you cannot exclude me&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  That would be the commonsense of the thing.  If two thousand people come along and he, in fact, provides accommodation for them, then he is a hotel for the purposes of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister on this.  I do not want to be unduly querulous on it.  This is a Bill which by definition applies to all hotels registered with Bord Fáilte and to such establishments as hold themselves out for the reception of all comers.</P>

Once the notice is up, or right of admission reserved, in my view it is no longer a place that provides for all comers, or holds itself out to receive all comers.  Once that notice is there that is a salient fact to be considered by a judge if a case comes before him &mdash;is the right of admission reserved and if it is, is it displayed in a prominent place?  I do not see that it can be enforced in that regard.</P>

      <P>It is a fact that where an establishment does fall within this definition, merely by saying that this is an establishment which although it appears to provide and holds itself out to provide accommodation for all comers it is, in fact, not technically a hotel, it can escape all the obligations imposed by the Bill. Then, unless registered under Bord Fáilte it seems very easy for every hotelkeeper in this country to escape the obligations of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to point out that to a large extent we are dealing with an unreal aspect of the matter because there is no doubt about it that the provision that every hotel registered with An Bord Fáilte as such comes within the ambit of the Bill is the main thing on which we rely for the effectiveness of the Bill. Over and above that, it is possible, I think, to visualise an establishment which is in business as a hotel but does not call itself a hotel and is not registered with Bord Fáilte.  Once it does not call itself a hotel it does not <Col N="353" /> have to be registered as such with Bord Fáilte.  I know one or two fairly large establishments which are not registered with Bord Fáilte but, nevertheless, carry on full business as hotels. In such a case if a hotel, as a question of fact, does provide for all comers, then even though it may have some notice of the sort referred to in the hall of the hotel, it comes within the ambit of this Bill.  It is a question of fact for some one to establish that the notice in the foyer of the hotel means nothing, because the premises is a hotel which provides food, drink and accommodation.  Alternatively, if a hotel advertises itself as such and is generally in business and by its activitives and management conveys the impression that it is, or holds itself out to be, a hotel which is prepared to receive all comers, then the fact that it has some bogus notice in the hall of the hotel would not take it outside the scope of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I think these fears are unreal even in the case of a hotel which is not registered as such with Bord Fáilte.  It could be fairly readily established by someone who was anxious to enforce his rights under the Bill whether or not a hotel did, in fact, carry on business as a hotel despite some bogus notice it had on the premises.</P>

      <P>Many hotels operate on the basis of keeping reserved accommodation available for regular customers.  They know that commercial travellers may be visiting their area on a certain date and it is quite reasonable for them to set aside a certain number of rooms in the expectation that Mr. X, who usually comes on the first Tuesday of the month, may possibly arrive.  I think it would be quite unreasonable that any chance person who comes along should be able to demand that accommodation even though the hotel proprietor might have a reasonable expectation that his regular customer would come along later.

      <P>I do not want to hold up the debate but I should like to reply to Senator Murphy.  What the Bill is practically doing&mdash;although it is changing the word &ldquo;innkeeper&rdquo; to &ldquo;hotel keeper&rdquo;&mdash;is affirming the common law in respect of innkeepers.  The common law in respect of innkeepers grew up many centuries before Bord Fáilte was ever heard of, and in the middle ages the innkeeper did not put up a notice to the effect that it was an inn or a hotel or anything else.  An establishment which held itself out to receive travellers was an inn in common law.  Under this Bill an inn is a hotel and all this Bill is doing is reaffirming the common law in relation <Col N="356" /> to the rights of travellers.  Whether or not we in this House think it reasonable, that was the common law and it will remain the statutory law under this Bill.  The proprietor of a hotel has certain common law obligations which this Bill simply enforces.  That is my attitude.</P>

We had representations by the hotel proprietors and at their instance an amendment was inserted in the Dáil and the word &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; put in.  Now, when the word &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; is included it ensures that a hotel proprietor will be under a liability to receive property only if he has accommodation suitable for that particular property.  In that connection it seems clear to me that unless a hotel proprietor had accommodation specifically reserved for dogs he would not be under an obligation to receive them, or, in fact, animals of any sort.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to subsection (2).  It imposes a liability on the hotel proprietor for the safety of a motor car which is brought to the hotel and placed in any <Col N="359" /> garage, car park or other premises provided by the proprietor of the hotel for this purpose.  Now, I have in mind a number of hotels which have a large unenclosed car park in front of the hotel.  I think this subsection does place a very wide obligation and liability on the hotel proprietor.  Suppose during the night some other car owner comes along and backs into the car which is parked in the open car park outside the hotel, the hotel proprietor, I think, is clearly liable under this Bill.  I think it is too wide a liability and is an unreasonable liability. I suppose I should be standing up for the rights of car owners but I think the person who leaves his car in an unenclosed car park outside the hotel accepts the liability.  I know subsection (5) of the same section does give some relief but it only gives relief where damage is due to an &ldquo;unforeseeable and irresistible act of nature&rdquo;.  It does not say it is unforeseeable.</P>
      <P>I think in the case I have mentioned the hotel proprietor would be clearly liable and the limit of £100 does not apply to cars.  Therefore, he might be liable to the extent of several hundred pounds.  As a matter of fact, I think under the Bill&mdash;and I should like to hear the Minister on this&mdash;if somebody stole a car from the unenclosed car park&mdash;a person who had no connection with the hotel, or a guest&mdash;and crashed the car and damaged it to the extent of £700 or £800, the hotel proprietor would be liable</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing here with a matter which is to some extent difficult.  We are trying to preserve a proper balance between the rights of the hotel guest and the obligations to be placed on hotel proprietors.  I think in the section as it is drafted we have succeeded in arriving at a fair compromise.  The section provides that a hotel proprietor shall be fully liable for the car which is the property of a guest staying overnight, subject to the important proviso that the guest must bring to the notice of the hotel proprietor the fact that the car is there. That gives the hotel proprietor an opportunity of directing the guest to put the car in some particular place. <Col N="360" /> Once the hotel proprietor has that notice and is given that opportunity, then I think it is not unreasonable that he should be fully liable for the property in this regard.  It must be borne in mind that the hotelkeeper is in business as such and that he has a certain obligation to provide garage accommodation, or suitable accommodation of one sort or another, for the cars of the people coming to stay in his hotel.  It is to some extent an onerous obligation on him but, nevertheless, I think it is one that must be placed on him if we are to preserve a proper balance between himself and his guest.  Of course, the hotel proprietor will be able to insure against any damage which may be done to the cars of guests.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, there is another matter I want to point out to the Senator and it is this.  Under the Civil Liability Act if the guest is guilty of any form of contributory negligence, that would have to be taken into account in any award which would be made to him.  By that I mean if the accommodation provided by the hotel proprietor was in the form of an open or unenclosed car park, then I think it would be reasonable to expect the guest to at least lock the car.  If he leaves an unlocked car in such a car park, then I think you could reasonably say that he was guilty of contributory negligence.</P>
      <P>It is not an easy matter, I admit, and we gave a great deal of thought to it. I think, as it is drafted at present, it strikes a fair compromise between the rights of the two parties, the hotel proprietor and his guest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to confirm an Order which I have made under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, on the recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission, regarding the operation of resale price maintenance in the supply and distribution of hand knitting yarns.</P>
      <P>I propose to give here a summary of the Commission's report of their Enquiry into the matter, of which Senators have already received copies.</P>
      <P>At the time of the Enquiry, most of the market in hand knitting yarns was supplied by three large home manufacturers.  Imports were small, and were subject to 33? per cent. Customs duty, except in the case of some specialty yarns which are not produced in this country.</P>
      <P>All three firms specified retail prices for their goods.  The list prices suggested by two of them, if adhered to, would give wholesalers a margin of 15 per cent. to 17 per cent. and retailers 23 per cent.  The prices suggested by the third manufacturer allowed wholesalers a mark up of 9 per cent. and retailers 33? per cent. Settlement discounts were also provided in all cases.</P>
      <P>These three manufacturers stated at the Enquiry that they supported the policy of resale price maintenance, although not enforcing it at that time, because, as the bulk of their sales was through wholesalers, enforcement was not considered practicable.  Some wholesalers also testified that they were in favour of resale price maintenance, although they stated that it would be very difficult to enforce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Evidence at the Enquiry revealed that one of the largest manufacturers had adopted a policy of resale price maintenance in 1956, following representations by wholesalers.  They applied it principally to the wholesale trade, but also to some large retailers <Col N="364" /> whom they supplied directly, and they enforced it to the extent of withholding supplies in a number of cases.  Even though they announced their intention of abandoning the policy in 1961, on the ground that its operation was not effective due to the non-co-operation of some wholesalers, they still refused to accept orders from some traders from whom supplies had previously been withheld, and continued to advocate price maintenance at wholesale level.  They stated, moreover, that if extreme price cutting were again to cause inconvenience to their trade they might have to take further action against it.  The Commission pointed out that this firm were in a position of some dominance, and their products in considerable popular demand, so that any trader who was refused supplies by them would be placed at a competitive disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The Commission considered that the action taken by this firm to maintain prices unreasonably restricted competition in, and entry to, the trade in hand knitting yarns and retarded the development of a competitive price structure; also, that the attitude of the firm, and of other manufacturers and wholesalers, to the principle of resale price maintenance in this commodity could lead to an extension of the policy if suitable circumstances arose.  The Commission accordingly recommended that individual resale price maintenance at all levels of the trade in hand knitting yarns should be prohibited.</P>
    <P>The Commission found no evidence of the operation of a collective system of price maintenance, and did not, therefore, put forward any recommendation on that subject.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, provides that an Order of this kind shall not have effect unless it is confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas. The Bill now before the Seanad is the Confirming Bill which is necessary to give the force of law to the Order concerned.  The arrangement in the case of Confirmation Bills is that the Order which it is proposed to confirm would not be subject to amendment by the Oireachtas but would be accepted or rejected as it stands.  The matters with which the Order deals have been <Col N="365" /> the subject of a detailed Public Enquiry by the Fair Trade Commission, and their Report sets out the arguments in favour of adopting the provisions contained in the Order.  I recommend this Bill to the Seanad, and I believe that its enactment will provide a necessary safeguard against any future attempts at restricting normal competitive conditions in the trade in this commodity and consequently be of benefit to both traders and the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this Order is to prohibit resale price maintenance by a supplier in relation to hand knitting yarns.  We had a number of these Orders before us since the setting up of the Fair Trade Commission under the restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, and I think I am right in saying that on all occasions these Orders have gone through without very much comment.  In view of the fact that at the time when this Act was introduced there was much opposition from large sections of the business community and, of course, on the other hand, some elements in the business community called for action about what are called restrictive trade practices, I thought it well to find out from those in the trade concerned with this matter how they felt the Act had been working in the intervening 11 years and what were their opinions on it.</P>
      <P>I thought that this was a matter not only of general interest and of interest to the business people concerned but of interest to Senators and members of the Dáil, because I noticed that when this matter came up in the Dáil it got very cursory treatment.  That was, I think, because there are so many matters coming up in the Dáil that there is not somebody there to deal with every Bill that comes up, especially as they come up so often and in such numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Act was introduced certain elements were opposed to anything being done in this matter, and they gave reasons which I do not propose to quote now.  At the same time, there was a general belief in the trade in the idea of price maintenance.  The <Col N="366" /> system had worked pretty well for a great number of years and, in fact, right up to that time.  Undoubtedly, there were certain flaws in the system and certain injustices and, perhaps, a certain amount of restrictive practice, but, on the whole, it was felt by many people in trade that the price maintenance system had a lot to be said for it.  It was believed that it was a good thing not only for the merchant himself but for the customer as well.  It assured the merchant a fair and, generally speaking, not exorbitant working profit, as can be seen from the figures quoted in the Minister's opening statement, because those margins, as quoted, are considerably lower than those prevailing in other countries for similar commodities, as can be found by examination; and for the customer there was an assurance of both the quality of the article and of service.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of opposition to the Act, but, on the other hand, it is fair to say that the Act was brought into being by a call from other elements in the business community, as can also be seen from the Minister's statement where it is stated that in the inquiry for this particular Order the manufacturers as a whole and also the wholesalers seemed to be in favour of price maintenance.  Generally speaking, it seems that most retailers were in favour of the abolition of price maintenance.</P>
    <P>I am not going to make any case against this particular Order, but I have asked the Dublin Chamber of Commerce in a very telegraphic form for the points they have found in their experience of the past 11 years.  I propose to quote very briefly what the Chamber have told me:</P>
    <P>Against the action of the Fair Trade Commission and against the abolition of the system of price maintenance it is stated that in those distributive trades where price cutting exists a law of the jungle seems to apply.  If price maintenance were observed a semblance of order, which is considered desirable, would exist.</P>
    <P>It has been the experience in some cases that price cutters do not provide <Col N="367" /> the customer with any accommodation in the field of after sales service.</P>
    <P>That is a point which is often made in the motor trade.</P>
    <P>Another point against is:</P>
    <P>It can also be said that some of the premises from which price cutters carry on their business do not in any way measure up to providing a standard for the customer or proper facilities for their staffs.</P>
    <P>In those distributing houses which are operating a price cutting system frequently the labour employed is not of a very high standard, again resulting in poor service for the customer.</P>
    <P>In favour of the system of price maintenance it says:</P>
    <P>That the Commission served a very useful purpose in getting rid of the system of &ldquo;closed&rdquo; lists with which distributors had to comply in supplying goods.  As a result of the closed lists which existed before the Commission was appointed some distributors could not open new accounts.</P>
    <P>That the Commission itself in making an enquiry into a particular trade causes a lot of inconvenience and embarrassment to that trade but that in the long run the findings of the Commission appear to be in the interests of the community in general.</P>
    <P>That it would appear to be very fair for the small trader but not so fair for the larger trader.</P>
    <P>That the activities of the Commission at times seem to be to interfere unduly in trade practices.</P>
    <P>So much for what I got from the Chamber of Commerce.  It is not always remembered on this point of making goods available to anybody who can afford to buy them that the realities of their standing must be considered, perhaps their irresponsibility or the standing of their business operations&mdash;their ability to pay does not come into it because they must be able to pay.  Under the present system now and under the particular Order, people must be served with goods and, <Col N="368" /> sometimes a very great hardship can be inflicted by unfair abuse of the privileges afforded of free access to suppliers.</P>
    <P>In this context I should like to quote a case in point from the January number of the <i>Irish Hardware and Allied Trader</i>.  It will be a very short quotation from the leading article:</P>
    <P>The liquidation of Thomas Henshaw and Company as we go to Press this month comes as a shock to the entire trade.  It is the third major liquidation in the hardware trade in Dublin in 18 months.</P>
    <P>Blame for the failure of this firm and any resulting unemployment must be laid upon the Fair Trade Commission.  It was the longstanding policy of the Commission which encouraged Henshaws and their voluntary chain group, FAIR to sell goods at less than cost prices, and after this had begun the Commission was quick to reprimand manufacturers (including some outside this State) who had withheld their goods from the company for that reason, and to stand in the way of those who would protect the firm from the consequences of its own folly.</P>
    <P>But Henshaws apparently, and quite understandably, believed that they could bully manufacturers into conforming to the firm's price policy by the threat of invoking the big stick of the Fair Trade Commission should they refuse supplies and thus eliminate all competition.</P>
    <P>Finally it says:</P>
    <P>Distributors find it difficult to understand why that body has ignored its duty to provide adequate safeguards against extreme price competition, the whole purpose of which is to eliminate trade competitors by unfair means.</P>
    <P>The Commission was set up with an obligation to deal with the problem of unjust competition.  Until its £3,100-a-year members come to admit that unjust competition includes more than resale price maintenance, that body will continue to work against the interests <Col N="369" /> of the State.  And in a time when co-operation between the various sections of the community is required as never before, it will continue to set one section against another. Under such an unfair anti-trader policy, Henshaws will not be the last failure in our trade.</P>
    <P>The point is referred to in another quotation which I shall make later.</P>
    <P>Fair trading is not only fair trading in the interest of the consumer&mdash;and sometimes the misconceived interests of the consumer because quality and service enter into the question.  Fair trading must be more than fair trading one way; it must be fair trading both ways.  It must be fair trading with regard to one's competitors.  If a firm has access to a market and to wholesalers and even if, knowing that it is going into liquidation, it sells goods below cost price, that aspect of the matter should surely attract the attention of the Commission.  It is felt in trade circles generally that the question is one-sided because of this particular matter.  I should like to quote further.  The Minister might have something to tell us because this refers to a memorandum sent to the Minister by the Federation of Trade Associations on December 31st.</P>
    <P>It accused him of allowing the Commission to take much too narrow a view of their responsibilities in that regard.  The abolition of price maintenance and the giving of free access to overcrowded trades were not the sole purposes for which that body was set up.  Guiding principles to assist it in regulating unfair trade practices had also been established.</P>
    <P>In the Schedule to the Act, unfair trade practice had been defined as &ldquo;a practice which had or is likely to have the effect of unjustly eliminating a trade competitor,&rdquo; and distributors, therefore, found it hard to understand why the Commission had so far ignored their duty to provide adequate safeguards against extreme price competition as an unfair practice.</P>
    <P>For my own part I should like to say that there has been a considerable change in the philosophy of retailing <Col N="370" /> since this Fair Trade Commission was established in 1953.  I myself at that time subscribed to the system of price maintenance as it was operating at that time, but methods have changed very much since and there is a case for more free trading of the kind allowed and provided for in this Order. There are exceptions and I would make this exception: it is too broadly worded.  In mass-produced goods there is no case for price maintenance especially now with the large markets and large groups of markets created by multiple stores.  It is both impracticable and undesirable that there should be any question of price maintenance regarding mass-produced goods.</P>
    <P>In the case of specially goods which have to be so expensively advertised and certain kinds of luxury goods, there is no case for price maintenance.  Not only the question of price maintenance but the supplier having to supply under the law should not apply to such things as cosmetics.  In the case of cosmetics the condition of the article which the customer purchases in the shop is of great importance.  In the case of cream, if every chemist or shopkeeper in the country were allowed to be supplied from the cosmetic suppliers it would be found that most of the stuff would be dangerous to use.  It might be a long time in stock and might have deteriorated and become full of bacteria.  In that particular instance I had a case where people in the country wrote to me to see if I could get agencies for these well-known makes and the answer I got was that they could not supply these people because of risk of deterioration in their stocks which would do very great harm to the customers here.</P>

      <P>As I said, the effect of this Order was to prohibit retail price maintenance.  I think under present circumstances there will be an acceptance by the trade of this Order in good spirit. At the same time, anybody who reads the report of the Commission cannot help being struck by the fact that very often there is a tendency by the Commission <Col N="371" /> to disregard the long experience of the people who come there to give evidence, although in this particular case I do not think that that has been too bad.  I know of other cases where there is an honest feeling amongst traders, and people in trade disputes, and especially in the wholesale and manufacturing side where they felt they have not really got a satisfactory or fair deal and that they are inclined to be over-ridden and ignored.  Subject to those remarks, I support this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am not criticising the Senator.  I think I am entitled to remain strictly within the rules of order by referring only to what this Bill contains and provides for.  It provides for the bringing into operation by way of statute of recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission in relation to hand-knitting yarns.  There are very wide issues involved in what Senator McGuire raised.  They go to the root of the establishment of the Fair Trade Commission, and I think another occasion will be used for wider debate on the effect of price maintenance and price cutting on reasonable competition in trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission on this occasion investigated two particular commodities&mdash;ladies' nylon stockings and handknitting yarns.  I think, if I quote from the final paragraphs of the recommendation in respect of each of these commodities made by the Commission, it will indicate clearly why in this case&mdash;the case of handknitting yarns&mdash;the Commission thought fit to recommend that an Order be made, to be covered by statute.  In the first place, as far as stockings are concerned, they found that there was no collective price maintenance in operation by the manufacturers or wholesalers. If there was such, no doubt the Commission would have recommended the making of an Order in respect of stockings.  They did find <Col N="372" /> that there was price maintenance operated by one particular supplier but, having regard to the variety of stockings available and having regard to the number of manufacturers who had access to this market, they state that the effective price maintenance operated by one particular producer was not significant and did not operate sufficiently against the public interest to justify the recommendation to make an Order.</P>
    <P>It was different, however, in the case of handknitting yarns because, as the report points out, there are only three main manufacturers of handknitting yarns in this country and one particular firm of these commanded a very high proportion of the Irish market. In other words, their particular hand-knitting yarns were in very great popular demand.  Because, therefore, this firm did at some stage operate a price maintenance system they felt that entry to the trade was undoubtedly restricted insofar as if that particular manufacturing firm found one of its customers not operating its price maintenance system then it would, and did, withhold supplies from a particular retail outlet.  It is because of the position of dominance in that particular firm that they decided to recommend the making of an Order.</P>
    <P>They found, incidentally, that there was not collective price maintenance in handknitting yarns but the fact that the major manufacturer did operate, at some stage, price maintenance and did suggest in evidence before the tribunal that if circumstances warranted they would at another stage have likewise recommended price maintenance. It was only in these circumstances, because it would be against the public interest and against the maintenance of reasonable competition in the trade that they pressed the making of this Order.  I think it is reasonable in all the circumstances.  As far as the wider issues raised by Senator McGuire are concerned, I think these can be discussed at another time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>This is something I am in favour of with the Commission. Objection has been taken to the fact that although there is a limit to a maximum price there is no limit to a minimum price.  In other words, the goods can be sold below cost.  I can quite see the Commission's difficulty that it would not be possible to fix a minimum price at which they would be sold because that would prevent people selling at sales and so on.  Many people have to realise their stocks at less than cost.  They may be out of fashion or for one reason or another. It is an important thing and traders believe there should be a lower minimum as well as a higher maximum.</P>

      <P>I must agree with what the Senator says.  While I appreciate the difficulty created by excessive price cutting by some traders, it must be realised that it would be extremely difficult to legislate against it, having regard to what the Senator has just said regarding the incidence of sales in the ordinary case in this country. Something on which I again agree with the Senator is that traders do not always take into account when they make a case for price cutting.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this measure is to amend and consolidate the existing law relating to trade marks, as embodied in the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Act, 1927, so as to liberalise it in certain respects in line with present-day commercial needs in this field.  The <Col N="374" /> use of trade marks to identify particular products to the purchasing public has increased very noticeably in recent times.  This trend is clearly one to be encouraged in the interests of the public at large, for trade marks afford them a ready means of identifying and selecting goods which past experience has shown them to be worth buying again. It is, therefore, as much in the general interest, as in the interests of trading concerns, which own and use trade marks on their products, that it has been considered necessary to review the law and to introduce the changes provided for in the Bill, so that it will become better adapted to modern requirements.</P>
      <P>The main changes introduced by the Bill are as follows: the expression &ldquo;trade mark&rdquo; is re-defined; the condition that a trade mark must have been in use for at least two years, before qualifying for registration in Part B of the register, is abolished; it is made permissible to effect a valid assignment of a trade mark without having to assign the related business goodwill at the same time; provision is made for the defensive registration of well-known trade marks consisting of invented words; a system for recording registered users of trade marks is introduced; certification trade marks are provided for separately under what is regarded as a more appropriate system of examination and registration; and, lastly, provision is made for the first time for creating a register of trade marks agents and for limiting the practice of the profession of trade mark agent to persons who are entered in that register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking these matters in turn, the expression &ldquo;trade mark&rdquo; is defined in the current Act of 1927 as &ldquo;a mark used or proposed to be used upon or in connection with goods&rdquo;.  As this definition must be taken as meaning that a mark is a trade mark only when used in physical connection with goods, it is regarded as too restrictive.  Trade marks are often used in advertisements, pamphlets, invoices and the like, and it is thought essential that the definition of a trade mark should cover this kind of use in relation to goods which are on sale.  Furthermore, on this aspect of the matter, it has been held that, <Col N="375" /> under the existing definition, a trader may make use of his rivals' trade marks in pamphlets and the like for the purpose of comparing his goods with theirs, thus making use, for his own benefit, of the reputation of his competitors' marks but without committing an infringement.  This needs to be remedied, and so, with all these considerations in mind, it is proposed by Section 2 (1) of the Bill to define a &ldquo;trade mark&rdquo; as meaning &ldquo;...a mark used or proposed to be used in relation to goods ...&rdquo;.  A further change in the definition is necessary on account of the new registered user provisions.  As the law stands, a trade mark can validly be used only by its proprietor, so that in order to be consistent with Section 36 of the Bill, it is necessary to extend the definition to provide for use by a registered user. The definition in Section 2 (1) expressly excludes certification trade marks because these are dealt with separately in Section 45.</P>
    <P>Next, there are the new provisions in Section 18 of the Bill as to what may be registered in Part B of the register, which exists for the protection of trade marks of a less distinctive character than those which qualify for registration in Part A.  The main change here, as already mentioned, is the abolition of the existing condition in the 1927 Act that a trade mark cannot be registered in Part B until it has been in use for at least two years.  No reason is now seen for denying the benefits of early registration to new trade marks which inherently qualify for registration in Part B, although at the same time, of course, there is nothing in the Bill which will prevent traders from applying to register trade marks which they have used over a period of two years or more, as they can already do under the 1927 Act.</P>
    <P>With regard to the assignment of trade marks, it is proposed to change the present law whereby a trade mark can be validly assigned only together with the whole goodwill of the business in the goods for which it is registered. This has been a severe handicap to firms, especially to related commercial or industrial concerns, <Col N="376" /> wishing to re-organise their arrangements to meet developing trade, but hampered in so doing because of the risk to the validity of the registration of valuable trade marks if they were assigned with less than the goodwill of the business.  The concept formerly held was that the purpose of a trade mark was to identify the goods with the proprietor of the mark, but present-day experience goes to show that the public tend to identify a trade mark with a particular product, rather than with the maker of the product, and that, therefore, the goodwill is inherent in the mark itself.  It is proposed by Section 30 to permit trade marks to be validly assigned without the goodwill of the business, and it is also proposed to enable trade marks to be assigned in respect of some, only, of the goods for which they are registered. At the same time, Section 30 provides safeguards designed to protect the interests of the public in respect of assignments of trade marks which are likely to lead to deception, and which will accordingly be deemed not to have been valid.</P>
    <P>Coming next to the so-called defensive registration of trade marks which consist of invented words, and which have become well-known to the public, it is recognised that these marks are in a special category.  Having been coined by its proprietor, a trade mark of this kind is of necessity unique in character and tends to denote to the public that the goods on which it is used all come from the same trade source, whether such is the case or not.  As the law stands, there is nothing to prevent others from registering or using such marks in respect of goods which are not of the same description as the goods in respect of which the real proprietors use and have registered their marks.  It is true that the originators and genuine owners of such trade marks may have recourse to the common law to defend their legitimate interests, but it is felt that provision should be made in the law so that, on proving that their marks are well-known to the public, they can obtain registration even in respect of goods in which they do not intend to trade and thereby be afforded a wider protection against <Col N="377" /> infringement, without incurring the risk of removal of such registration from the register which the continued non-use of a registered trade mark normally entails.  The necessary provisions are contained in Section 35 of the Bill, and have the further result of giving effect to our obligation under the International Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, which was effected in 1958, of giving wider protection to well-known trade marks.</P>
    <P>The proposed registered user provisions contained in Section 36 of the Bill are designed to meet modern conditions of trade, under which trading concerns often find it commercially convenient to have goods made for them, and marked with their trade marks, and distributed direct to the public, by other firms.  Under present law, this use of trade marks by persons other than their registered proprietors is not valid and, for that reason, endangers the registration of the marks concerned.  This state of affairs is hampering to trade in the State, for the owners of valuable trade marks are naturally reluctant to embark on trading arrangements which might imperil the validity of their marks.  In other cases, large corporations sometimes wish to establish subsidiaries, and similar risks to the validity of trade marks are entailed if they are used by the subsidiaries but registered by the parent bodies.  It is felt that, in cases where it is clear that the registered proprietor will have control, either of a financial or of a contractual nature, over the use of his trade mark by a permitted user&mdash;for example, as to the quality of the goods made and marked by the user&mdash;the public interest will be adequately safeguarded, and that such use should be validated as proposed by Section 36.</P>
    <P>Under the existing Act, there is provision for the registration of trade marks having the purpose of denoting that the goods in relation to which they are used have been certified as to their origin, mode of manufacture, quality, accuracy or other characteristic.  Such marks are, however, registered under the same conditions as ordinary trade marks.  Section 45 of the Bill provides <Col N="378" /> that these marks be separately defined and clearly distinguished from other trade marks.  In future these marks, to be known as certification trade marks, will not be registrable in the name of any person who carries on a trade in the goods in question.  The conditions of registration as well as certain safeguards against misuse by the proprietors are set out in the First Schedule to the Bill, the Minister being charged with the responsibility of ensuring that the registration of such marks, individually, is to the public advantage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the setting up of a register of trade mark agents, as proposed by Section 69 of the Bill, there is at present nothing to prevent any person, however unqualified he may be, representing himself and practising as a trade mark agent.  In order to ensure that matters relating to trade mark law, which is often very complex and under which traders can procure valuable rights, are dealt with by properly qualified persons, it is proposed to provide for the compulsory registration of trade mark agents and to provide that only persons or firms whose names are on the register shall be entitled to practise or represent themselves as trade mark agents.  Section 69 sets out the conditions of eligibility for entry on the register of trade mark agents and thus ensures for the public a minimum quality of service from agents.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other changes proposed in the law.  The provisions in Section 37 enable a trade mark to be registered where the applicant himself does not intend to use the mark but proposes to assign it to a body corporate yet to be constituted or proposes that it be used by a registered user.  The provision in Section 48 enables a trader, before actually lodging an application for registration, to obtain an official opinion as to the suitability for registration of a trade mark which he proposes to adopt, thus saving him the trouble and expense of filing an unsuccessful application.  There are also a number of minor improvements introduced.</P>
    <P>I recommend the principle of the Bill for approval by the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as the Minister has said, was introduced for the purpose of bringing the law on trade marks up to date and making the necessary provisions for modern trade and commerce.  In so far as the Bill attains its object, and I think by and large it does, subject to what I will say later on, I welcome the Bill, reserving my rights to appeal to the Minister to make one or two essential amendments in it.</P>
      <P>The Industrial and Commercial Property Protection Act of 1927, which followed closely on the British Acts of 1909 and 1919, is the Act which at present regulates the law regarding trade marks.  That law is, therefore, nearly 60 years old and it follows that it needs to be brought up to date; it needs to be amended.  I think the British Government amended their trade mark law in 1938 which means that the British Act is a quarter of a century old.  Now, as I understand it, this present Bill follows very closely on the terms of the British Act of 1938, notwithstanding the fact that certain flaws have become apparent in the British Act.  I know, too, that it goes somewhat further in some respects than the British Act.  I am sure that the desire of the Minister is to produce an Act that will be as nearly perfect as possible, an Act that will give satisfaction to everybody who comes into contact with it, whether it is the Controller of Industrial and Commercial Property appointed under the 1927 Act or various professional people who have to appear before the Controller or the ordinary business people who have to avail of the Act to protect their trade marks.  Now, in so far as the Minister has that in mind, and I am sure that is his ambition, he deserves the complete support of the House and the help of every Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking for myself and for those whom I speak for here I can assure the Minister that he will get that support, I would, however, in return appeal to the Minister to come into this House on the Committee Stage of this Bill with an open mind and not come in here with his mind made up that his advisers are infallible.  Trade mark law is a very dry subject if I may say so.  It is a branch of <Col N="380" /> the law in which very few practitioners claim to be experts.  Indeed, it is a branch of the law which very few legal practitioners are ever called upon to deal with.  I make no secret about it; I do not claim to be an expert on the subject, and having read the Dáil reports, I do not think the Minister claims to be an expert on it either.  For that reason, I think the Minister might be inclined to see one side of the story only and to accept that as the answer to all problems which have been presented from time to time.  Nobody is infallible and especially in a specialised subject like this I think the Minister should welcome advice and assistance of people in a position to give it</P>
    <P>Having made those general remarks, I think that this is a Bill which can be dealt with in Committee.  It is essentially a Committee Bill.  There is no great principle involved.  It is not a controversial Bill.  There is no political kudos in it for anybody.  I propose putting down some amendments on the Committee Stage and I would ask the Minister to seriously consider accepting them.  If he does accept them, he will have an Act which will meet with the approval of people such as the Association of Registered Patent Agents who have a wide experience in this type of law and are really in a position to put forward the view of the practitioners and the view of the trade mark owner.</P>
    <P>I should like on this Stage to refer briefly to Sections 18, 22 and 30 in the hope that the Minister will consider them seriously before the next Stage. Regarding Sections 18 and 22, as I understand it under the present law, as the Minister has told us, only trade marks in use for at least two years could be registered in Part B of the register.  However, there is at present no provision for registering a trade mark in Part B of the register subject to the disclaimer.  That is technical talk but a disclaimer means that a trade mark may consist of five or six words and the trade mark may be registered, but the owner may be required to announce or disclaim an absolute right to two of those words. That is what a disclaimer means.  At the present time as I say, only marks which have been in use for two years can be registered in Section B but <Col N="381" /> when they are registered they are registered without the obligation of disclaiming any of them.  Therefore, under the Bill, as at present drafted, the Controller or the court may insist on any trade mark which is registered in Part B of the register being registered subject to a disclaimer.  It follows, therefore, that although it would appear at first sight that Section 18 is extending the right to register in Part B and conferring additional rights on the owners of trade marks, it is, in fact, doing no such thing because it is obliging, or may oblige, the owner of a trade mark to register it subject to a disclaimer.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, there is no necessity for that because in order to infringe a trade mark which is registered in Part B you must steal the whole thing so to speak.  You cannot infringe it by taking a couple of the words or by taking one word.  There are several cases and lots of authority for saying that the register should not be cluttered up by the registration of unnecessary disclaimers.  I shall quote these cases for the Minister on the next Stage.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to amend this section by removing from the Controller or the court the right to insist on a trade mark which has been in use for two years, or if he likes to make it three or four years&mdash; but I suggest two years &mdash; being registered subject to a disclaimer.  I propose to conclude my remarks on Sections 18 and 22 by informing the Minister that experienced patent agents, trade mark agents of long standing, would prefer to have the law remain as it it rather than have the right to register new marks in Section B, but make them subject to a disclaimer.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made that point clear. I understand that when the association were asked whether they would prefer to retain the present law in regard to Part B applications rather than extend Part B to unused marks and make all Part B marks subject to disclaimers, they answered without hesitation that they would prefer to retain the present law on this matter in spite of its disadvantages. That is the considered opinion of people who have given this matter great thought and who have spent a lifetime in this type of work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="382" /> That brings me to Section 30.  In his opening statement the Minister informed us that under the present law it is not possible to assign a trade mark without assigning the goodwill attached to it.  That is quite so.  In these modern times of intensive advertising, take-over bids and one thing and another, it is highly desirable that it should be possible to assign a trade mark without the necessity of assigning the business or the goodwill attached to it.  The Minister and his advisers are to be thanked for introducing that provision into the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is, however, according to my information, another matter which could conveniently have been dealt with at the same time.  It is not possible at the present time to assign or transfer an interest in an application to register a trade mark.  As I see it, a person is the owner of a trade mark.  He applies then to become the registered owner of it and by becoming the registered owner of it he gets protection and he can sue anybody who infringes his ownership in that trade mark.  It takes, I understand, anything up to two years to get a trade mark registered and to become the registered owner of it.  In these times businesses are changing hands and it may well be that the owner of a trade mark may sell his business between the date on which he makes an application to have his trade mark registered and the date on which the registration is completed.  If he does so, he is placed in an impossible position under the present law and the present procedure, because he is not entitled to assign his interest in the application to register his trade mark, and his successor cannot continue the application which he has lodged.  He must withdraw it and start off all over again.  That means that he may lose priority and it leads to endless trouble, inconvenience, expense, loss of priority, <i>et cetera</i>.  Again, I shall be able to quote to the Minister on the Committee Stage specific cases of hardship brought about by the impossibility of assigning interest in applications to register trade marks.</P>
    <P>I am reliably informed that these <Col N="383" /> difficulties crop up weekly.  They may not come to the knowledge of the Minister; they may not come to the knowledge of the Controller, because it is known that at the present time you simply cannot substitute the name of the purchaser for the name of the vendor and continue your application. That is something new because I understand that some years ago it was possible in the industrial and commercial property office to continue an application in the name of the purchaser of a business, just as the Minister knows it is possible at the moment in the case of an action started in the High Court, in the name of one person, to continue it in the name of that person's personal representative. That is not possible in the Industrial and Commercial Property Office at the present time.  It was possible a few years ago but the procedure has changed and now the application must be discontinued and a fresh application made.</P>
    <P>I must say that for the life of me I cannot see the objection to allowing the assignment of the application.  I know full well that when the trade mark is registered it is registered as at the date of the original application. What is wrong with that?  The purchaser merely pays his money, gets into the shoes of the vendor and takes over where he left off.  That sort of detailed argument could more appropriately be put forward on the Committee Stage.  I am putting it forward here in the hope that the Minister will bring in these amendments rather than rely on any amendments which I may put down.</P>
    <P>I am not raising any points about the registering of patent rights; I am not raising any points about the right of the Minister to regulate the fees which will be charged by patent agents.  I am prepared to accept the provisions in the Bill which regulate these matters.  I am satisfied that if the Minister accepts my suggestions, which I make no secret about were inspired, on Sections 18, 22 and 30, he will have a much better Bill than he has now.  He will have an Act which will meet with the approval of the only <Col N="384" /> people in this country outside his own advisers who really know anything about trade marks.</P>
    <P>I might in conclusion respectfully suggest to the Minister that he should consider between now and the Committee Stage receiving personally a deputation from the patent agents about these points for the benefit of the House.  There are only three or four of them in the whole country so that they are a small but highly specialised group of people.  Subject to what I have said, I welcome the Bill, and my remarks on this Stage and my efforts on the next Stage will be to put the best possible Act on the statute book.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Fitzpatrick, I very much welcome this Bill.  It is in a highly technical field of law but one which is constantly being used by practitioners, particularly in commercial matters which are becoming so important in the country at the present time.  Our present law is based on the British Trade Marks Acts of 1905 to 1919 and until this Bill we have had no move from those Acts. There was a British Act in 1938 and our new Bill is based very largely on it. We have taken a long time to get this far, but the Minister is to be congratulated on bringing in this Bill because we are constantly finding in practical law the great difficulty of the transfer of trade marks and the assignment of trade marks and the lack of registered user.</P>
      <P>Two great improvements in practice which will come from this Bill are the ability to assign a trade mark without having to assign the goodwill attached to it, and the ability to have a registered user of the trade mark.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Fitzpatrick, I have been approached and had a number of discussions with one of the members of the Association of Patent Agents in this country.  I must echo what he says in that those agents are a very highly skilled group of men and that they are worried about these two particular points he has brought up&mdash;the question of disclaimer and the question of assignment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not know that any approach <Col N="385" /> was going to be made to the Minister, but I should like to echo Senator Fitzpatrick's plea to the Minister that if an approach is made he will see these people, because they are to my own knowledge extremely skilled and are the few people who practically administer the assignment and registration marks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Fitzpatrick has said, there is no political kudos of any kind in this Bill. As I said in the Dáil, I am not by any means an expert on trade mark legislation. My limited practice at the bar did not extend to this highly technical field.  Therefore, any knowledge I have of it stems from the time when I started studying the amendment of existing legislation in my Department.</P>
      <P>It is true that the Bill follows closely on the 1938 British Act, but I want to assure the House that in so far as the 1938 British Act disclosed any defects we took care to avoid whatever defects were shown up in it so that our Bill, in so far as we could do it, is nearly as good as it can possibly be made in the existing trade conditions.</P>
      <P>I will not deny that there are certain difficulties that were raised on behalf of the patent agents in the Dáil.  They referred particularly to the sections mentioned by Senator Ross and Senator Fitzpatrick, namely Sections 18, 22 and 30.  I do not want to go into any detail because I think it is not necessary in view of the fact that we will have detailed discusion on these and other sections on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say this in respect of the remarks made by Senator Fitzpatrick about disclaimers.  He very aptly described how the obligation to enter a disclaimer arises.  Some people have trade marks registered with words or letters that are in ordinary usage coupled with some other distinctive sign or mark.  Thus we might find the letter A with some little design inside the angle of the A.  I have no particular trade mark in mind but Senators can envisage such a trade mark being registered.  The letter A is the property <Col N="386" /> of, I suppose, all Roman languages; therefore, no trader should be permitted to register an exclusive right to the use of the letter A in his trading arrangements; but if he has some other distinctive sign or design inside the angle of the A then he is permitted to register that as his trade mark.  He must, however, disclaim in respect of the letter A.  That is a very fair provision. It protects the public interest, and it protects other traders who might for reasons of their own see fit to seek registration of a trade mark which incorporates the letter A.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I not right in thinking that registration under Part B. affords protection for the entire trade mark only, but not for individual parts of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difference between Parts A and B in that respect. However, this is a matter we can go into in more detail on the Committee Stage.  I am just putting this forward as a general proposition to the Seanad, that we should not easily permit people to establish an exclusive right to a word or letter in ordinary usage for the purposes of his trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the assignment of the rights in an application for the registration of a trade mark, that, too, was raised in the Dáil, and having listened very carefully to the arguments made, I decided that it was not necessary immediately to assign the rights in an application, certainly not on the grounds of hardship, because experience has shown that no real hardship ensues as a result of continuing the application for registration in its original form.  With all respect to Senator Fitzpatrick, I do not think that his analogy of continuing an action in the name of the personal representative of the original plaintiff who has died is quite in point.  When an application is made to register a trade mark the date of the application is all important.  It is from that date that the ownership of the trade mark subsequently registered will stem.  The change of the name of the plaintiff in an action does not matter in the same way because it does not make such a <Col N="387" /> difference to the ultimate result of the case.</P>

      <P>Apart from the question of being statute barred, the date of commencement has not any effect on the ultimate result of the action.  I do not think it is necessary to go into further details at the moment.</P>
      <P>In response to the request of Senators that I should receive a deputation from the Association of Registered Patent Agents, I have no objection but it is rather late in the day.  I did not receive any application to see such a deputation until now.  I should like to point out to the House that three Bills are going through the Oireachtas and another is forthcoming about the rights of performers.  Each is highly technical and the provisions of each affect a wide variety of interests, particularly the Companies Bill.  The others are the Copyright Bill which we will take after this one, the Trade Marks Bill and the Performer's Rights Bill which I mentioned. They affect a lot of people and I have received numerous requests to meet deputations.  Even though I should like to meet them it would be physically impossible for me to meet all these deputations.  However, I shall consider the possibility of meeting these trade mark agents since the suggestion was made in the House that I am not going to regard this as a precedent: that because a request was made in the House I ought to receive deputations.</P>
      <P>As this is mainly a Committee Stage Bill, I would be delaying the House and possibly become repetitive at a subsequent stage if I continued to discuss the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to bring the law of copyright up-to-date to meet present day conditions, and to replace the existing Acts, which deal with the matter, by a single comprehensive statute.</P>
      <P>Copyright law is the law that protects the authors and composers of original intellectual works such as writings, plays, music, paintings, etcetera.  It is the law by which such persons are enabled to derive an economic benefit from their works after they have published them to the world.  Basically, the rights which the law gives to authors are the rights to prevent their works from being copied or from being performed, without their permission.</P>
      <P>The law at present is contained in Parts VI and VII of the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Act, 1927.  There have been a number of minor amendments to this over the years, the last being in 1958. The law enacted in 1927 was substantially the same as that contained in the Copyright Act of 1911; and in the half-century that has passed since then, there have developed new methods of exploiting literary and musical works such as by radio and television, and also new claimants for copyright protection, such as the broadcasting organisations and the cinematograph industry.</P>
      <P>The Bill which is now introduced does not make any very fundamental change in the rights of authors and composers over their original works of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic character, but it defines these rights more exactly.  It also introduces some new copyrights in subject-matters other than literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works, and I think I should say a few words about each of these at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 17 of the Bill, a copyright is established in sound recordings. This replaces a provision in existing law under which records and the like were given a copyright as if they were musical works.  The contents of recordings need not, of course, be music, and it is more appropriate that <Col N="389" /> the copyright in such subject-matters should be separately defined, as the copyright in recordings is independent of any copyright in any literary or musical work that may be incorporated in the recording.  The scope of the copyright in sound recordings, under the Bill, is a right to prevent copying, and a right to payment when the recording is played in public or broadcast.</P>
    <P>Section 18 of the Bill deals with cinematograph films, and gives them a copyright on their own standing, irrespective of whether the film is of a dramatic character or a simple record of passing events, and it vests this copyright in the maker of the film whether it be a person or corporate body.</P>
    <P>A new copyright is set up by Section 19 in sound and television broadcasts, and it is vested in Radio Éireann.  The scope of this copyright is a right to prevent the unauthorised recording or re-broadcasting of a broadcast, and to prevent a television broadcast from being shown to a paying audience. As in the case of sound recordings and cinematograph films, the copyright being established in broadcasts is separate from any copyright that may subsist in any work or subject-matter contained in the broadcast.</P>
    <P>There is a further new class of copyright established by Section 20. It is for the benefit of publishers and consists of a right for the publisher to prevent the photo-copying of any edition he may publish.  It does not give him any special right in the work contained in the edition; it merely protects his typographical arrangement from reproduction by photographic means.</P>
    <P>For the first time, a certain measure of control over the exercise of certain copyrights is being introduced into the law.  It is well known that the performing right in musical works is exercised by composers by means of an organisation set up for that purpose.  This was probably inevitable, as it would be extremely difficult for an individual composer to keep track of all the various public performances that might be given of a work which he had published, and of which a copy could <Col N="390" /> be bought in a shop.  But the fact that the great bulk of what may be called popular music is within the control of one organisation, and that this music must be used by classes of persons such as cinema proprietors, dance promoters and entertainment organisers of various descriptions, has given rise to suggestions that there should be some means by which disputes between such an organisation of copyright owners and users of copyright works could be resolved.  I may say that the use of gramophone records for playing in public is a similar case.</P>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, in Part V, proposes to set up an appeal body, consisting of the Controller of Industrial and Commercial Property, before whom cases of dispute may be brought.  Royalties charged by an individual author for the use of his works will not be a matter that could be brought before the Controller but licensing schemes operated by an organisation of copyright owners can be reviewed at the instance of an organisation of persons requiring such licences.</P>
    <P>There have also been some questions raised from time to time about the costs that may be involved in copyright actions.  Under the 1927 Act, such actions could be started only in the High Court.  The present Bill does not require that actions should be commenced in any particular court, but a provision is introduced in Section 23 which limits the costs that may be recovered on an action taken in the High Court that could have been taken in a lower court.  This places copyright actions in the same position as other types of action for infringement of property rights, as governed by the Courts of Justice Act of 1936.</P>
    <P>Under present law, actions for infringement of copyright must be commenced within three years of the infringement but this provision is not being continued, and the matter will in future be governed by the Statute of Limitations.</P>
    <P>Amongst the miscellaneous provisions being made in Part VII of the Bill is a continuation of the obligation on publishers to send copies of books <Col N="391" /> first published in the State to certain libraries, to which St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, is now added.  There have been, I know, criticisms of this, but it is a long time in the law; I think it is a desirable provision and I should not like to sponsor its removal.</P>
    <P>And, speaking of libraries, there is a provision introduced at Section 58, enabling the King's Inns Library to dispose of books which they may have acquired and have been obliged to retain, under the terms of old Copyright Acts or the King's Inns Library Act of 1945.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the protection of copyrights is largely a matter of international agreements. Ireland is a party to the two main Conventions on this matter, namely, the Berne Convention and the Universal Copyright Convention.  We have also signed, but cannot yet ratify, a Convention for the international protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms, and Broadcasting Organisations, which was concluded at Rome in 1961. The proposals in this Bill are in accord with our obligations under the two copyright conventions I have mentioned, and are also designed to meet the requirements of the Rome Convention in so far as it relates to records and broadcasts.  The Bill does not deal with rights for performers, which will have to be the subject of a separate measure.  There is provision in Section 43 of the Bill continuing the existing arrangements by which the Government can make orders extending the benefit of this law to the works and to the nationals of foreign countries to which we give reciprocal protection under the Conventions.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Anything relating to codification or the bringing up to date of legislation is always to be welcomed. At the very outset, there is one thing I do not understand about this Bill if it is to be a codified effort and an effort to bring things up to date.  I am really mentioning this now probably for the benefit of practitioners of the law more than for the benefit of the public.  For instance, in the Second <Col N="392" /> Schedule &mdash; No. 21 of 1958: The Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) (Amendment) Act, 1958, the extent of repeal is &mdash; The whole Act (other than Section 4).  Why could Section 4 not be brought in and reenacted in this and get rid of the piece of legislation that might be hidden away somewhere which would do untold damage if somebody forgot it at an appropriate time?</P>
      <P>As has been said about the Trade Marks Bill, this is essentially a Committee Bill.  Copyright is not alone a very precise portion of our law but is also extremely delicate.  Difficulties of proof in matters of infringement are involved.  It is a brand of law where performers can become guilty, quite unwittingly, of crimes that would involve them punitively and also civilly. In my view, in legislation of this kind the question of definition is extremely important.  Definition should be simple, clear, succinct and, in so far as is possible having regard to the fallibility of human speech, incapable of misconstruction.</P>
      <P>There is one thing in the definition list &mdash; I do not want to be too detailed at this stage &mdash; which I think the Minister should look at.  As far as I can see in Section 2, there is no definition of the word &ldquo;court&rdquo;.  Not so long ago I appeared in a copyright action and it was something that appeared to be generally accepted that you proceed on copyright action in the manner of damages in the High Court only.  There is a section further on that regulates the costs in the event of the damages being less than the High Court jurisdiction and also in the event of damages being less than the Circuit Court jurisdiction. I think definition in relation to the court, or, shall I say, the appropriate court, as the case might be where there are actions of this kind, might be initiated so as to clarify it once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extremely difficult from time to time for people who collect anonymous stuff, have it published in various forms &mdash; whether in an album or by themselves&mdash;when they find themselves up against somebody claiming copyright, whereas, in fact, no trace of any copyright has been registered anywhere in respect of the said works.  I <Col N="393" /> had another case some time ago where an action was taken by certain people in this country against publishers abroad.  The publishers abroad contented themselves with a search of the British Museum and they found nothing there and then proceeded to publish whereupon they were sued successfully in this country and had to pay damages. They were very small damages from the point of view of the assessment of the actual damage because it was actual damage within the State, but there was a punitive damage awarded against them as well, only to the extent of the fine of the Industrial and Commercial Property Act.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to that, curiously enough, quite an amount of correspondence came into the solicitor's office from people in different parts of the country claiming that they had heard the particular songs sung long before the person who claimed the copyright said he composed them.</P>
    <P>I do not understand this business of register of licensed holders and their application for licences.  I think there should be some form for the registration of original works immediately upon their composition in some register or other, where it would be mandatory upon persons about to produce any part of it, or the whole of it, in any album or otherwise, first of all, to look and see if there is anything registered resembling what they propose to publish.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased about the section that allows the King's Inns Library &mdash; I take it that it is a matter of space &mdash; to sell off the books that have to be presented to them by virtue of the various enactments.  I do not know whether it should not be extended to the others as well.  I think it is something that should be considered by other universities and libraries, which must receive by all enactments and by this enactment, copies of every published book and pamphlet.  They should have the same right to get rid of stuff that would not be appropriate to them.  One could easily conjure up the kind of things that would not be suitable for some colleges and would be extremely suitable for others and <i>vice versa</i>.  I do think, of course, <Col N="394" /> on the other hand, as the Minister has said, there has been criticism.  He says, of course, it is the law for a long time.  It can be very hard on small publishers to have to send so many copies of every first publication.  It can be very difficult.  The Minister might do well if in consultation, say, with the Minister for Finance and, perhaps, the Minister for Education, he established a fund out of which publishers, particularly small publishers, could be recouped to some extent at any rate for contributions to libraries. That would ensure that nobody is done in in the process, so to speak.</P>
    <P>I do not know that there is anything else I need refer to further on this Stage because, as the Minister intimated, this is a Committee Stage Bill.  The Bill deals with a part of the law that is extremely interesting and one worthy of study by the members of the House interested in it.  I hope when it comes to the Committee Stage we shall have a mutually fruitful discussion.</P>

      <P>Before I deal with the Bill proper, I should like to make a general comment.  It seems to be a practice in Seanad Éireann that when there is a detailed measure such as this a copy of the Minister's Second Reading speech is given to the front benches of the various Parties.  However, I notice that a copy is never made available to the Labour Party benches, which compares unfavourably with the practice in similar circumstances in Dáil Éireann.  I hope that will be rectified in the future.</P>

      <P>It is a remunerative one anyway.  I am principally concerned in this Bill with the effect on musicians as such, and how Part III of this Bill affects their livelihood and <Col N="395" /> their prospects of future employment. The Bill deals generally with copyright.</P>
      <P>In Part II of the Bill we get a general understanding of what is meant by copyright.  The general understanding is that the owner of a work retains, in effect, the ownership of that work and no other person is allowed to reproduce it except by the permission of the owner of the work.  Copyright is infringed by a person who, not being the owner of the copyright and without the licence of the owner thereof, does, or authorises another person to do, certain things.</P>
      <P>When we come to apply that general approach to Part III of the Bill, which deals with the use of recordings made, we find that there is a completely different concept.  We find, in effect, that a record can be broadcast, and can be used for public entertainment, without the express permission of the owner of the copyright.  All that is involved then is that if the person broadcasting or performing to the public has not got the permission of the owner of the copyright, the owner of the copyright can recover some recompense, and there is provision where agreement is not reached as to what payment would be equitable remuneration, that the matter can be referred to the Controller.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point here is that the owner of the copyright of the record cannot withhold permission.  We have heard recently of instances of the owner of a copyright of a play, for example, refusing permission for the reproduction or putting on of that play in this country.  That is a right which is continued and defended in this measure. We may not agree with the reasoning behind it but it is there, and we accept that it is right and just, but in regard to a record which can affect the remuneration and the continued employment of the people making that record, the owner of the record cannot prevent its broadcast, or its diffusion, as it is expressed here, or its performance in public.  He cannot withhold permission.  In effect, his permission is not required.  It can be <Col N="396" /> broadcast without the permission of the owner of the copyright.  The only recompense that the owner of the copyright has is that he may get some payment for that broadcast or diffusion.</P>
    <P>I think we are holding two different measurements in this matter and that our approach in regard to records is inequitable.  That is underlined by further sections in Part III under which records can be played to the public, for example, in a hotel or a holiday camp provided there is no charge for admission to the place where the records are being played and where the music and entertainment are being provided.  If the people in a holiday camp are there for the purpose of sleeping in and staying at that establishment, then the music and entertainment can be provided for them without the permission of the owners of the copyright, and all the owners of the copyright can hope to get is some payment eventually.</P>
    <P>If any of us have something for sale I think we would expect to have the prior right to decide whether or not to sell it.  If you are compelled to sell, and someone else may ultimately decide the payment you will get, that amounts, to some extent anyway, to confiscation.  This is important, not so much to the owners of the records, the people who manufacture them but to the people who put their talents into the production of the sound or the entertainment.  It could mean that those people would find their continued employment affected in the future.</P>
    <P>There are circumstances at present where, for example, in a large hotel or a holiday camp the employment of a band would be necessary and desirable. Under the Bill as it is now before us, the proprietors of those establishments could provide that music, or that entertainment, through records and without the permission of the owners of the copyright of those records.  I do not think that is fair or just.  The matter was mentioned in the Dáil and I do not accept the Minister's reply to what was said there at the time.  However, we shall go further into it on Committee Stage. <Col N="397" /> At this stage, all I want to do is to draw the attention of the Seanad to the different approach to copyright in regard to the artistic works, books and plays, as against the approach to records. I am suggesting it is an unfair and inequitable approach and should be mended when we come to the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall address my remarks to Section 56 following on what was said by Senator Lindsay. This section provides for the delivery of books to certain libraries.  At the outset, I think I should be honest and declare that I have a double personal interest in this section.  First of all, as a director of a publishing firm in Dublin, I am concerned with the giving of books and, secondly, as a Trustee of the National Library I am concerned as a recipient of books.  Therefore, I am not speaking without some personal interest in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the section stands it appears, on the face of it, rather unfair to Irish publishers that every Irish publisher has to give away seven copies to the libraries, and possibly four others if he is asked.  He may, therefore, have to give away 11 copies of every book he publishes, whereas in Britain a publisher has to give only six copies, one of which comes to Trinity College, Dublin.  Speaking as a Trustee of the National Library for many years, I can certainly say that from the point of view of the country we are benefiting <Col N="398" /> by the exchange.  There is no question whatsoever about that.  Publications in England and particularly in London are so numerous and so many books of great importance are received in Trinity College Library &mdash; the Library receives a copy of every book published in Great Britain &mdash; that from the national point of view it is a very good return for the comparatively few books which Irish publishers send to Great Britain in return.  Therefore, I have no doubt at all that from a national point of view this is an extremely good arrangement, that Trinity College receives a copy of every book published in Great Britain.  That means that the National Library and other libraries in this country, out of their limited funds, do not have to buy some very expensive English books because they know that there will be at least one copy of these books for students in this country.  That means that we can devote the funds of the National Library and other libraries to the purchase of American books knowing that students of any subject will be sure of finding all the English books in Trinity College.  Therefore, from the national point of view I think the exchange is a fair one.  In fact, I think we are likely to gain.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the Irish publisher it is rather a burden to have to send a minimum of seven, and possibly a maximum, of 11 books published and many of the new Irish publishers are small.  They are publishing books on a rather elaborate scale, rather expensive books, very good books.  Some of the new publishers who have come into existence in the past few years are doing very good national work.  This obligation to send out several free copies can impose quite a serious burden.  Therefore, I join with Senator Lindsay in asking the Minister to try to find some possibility of giving a small subvention from some cultural fund or from the Department of Education towards helping Irish publishers to carry out this liability.  It may be quite a serious burden on the individual publisher but from the point of view of the nation as a whole it is an arrangement from which I have no <Col N="399" /> doubt at all Ireland gains more than she loses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I say that I am entirely in agreement with what Senator O'Brien and Senator Lindsay have said about the desirability of some small subvention for struggling publishers in this country who become liable under this Bill.  It is perhaps a little hard on them.  If necessary, I would have tried to make a case myself justifying the Trinity College enjoyment of copyright, but Senator O'Brien has done it already, and there is no need.  But, if the Minister could see his way to compensating those who are just beginning their work or struggling, it would be a good thing generally.  We want as far as possible to encourage the publishing business.  At the moment we are sadly behind with it.  Most Irish authors send their books abroad for publication, that is, to Great Britain usually or America.  Almost all Irish musicians send their works out of the country for publication.  If that state of affairs could be remedied it would be very much to the advantage and benefit of the country.</P>
      <P>In this Bill we have to consider three different types of people.  We have first the authors and composers.  Without them there would be no Bill of this kind.  They are the creators, they are the makers, they give us the material for what is in this Bill. Secondly, we have the publishers.  On the whole, I think those are the people who are best able to look after themselves. They are generally shrewd business men, very much on the spot in matters of this kind, and I do not think they are likely to suffer under this Bill for any lack of intelligence and pressure on their part.  The third group are the performers of musical works.  Senator Murphy has already said something about those.  I should like to support him later on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I first say a word on behalf of the composers?  On the one hand they have been treated fairly and generously under this Bill, but there is one fact which may hit them.  I am assured by one leading composer in this <Col N="400" /> country that it will hit them.  That is Section 16.  This is one in which a work of joint authorship is referred to. It is defined later on.  Section 16, subsection (1) reads:</P>
    <P>In this Act &ldquo;work of joint authorship&rdquo; means a work produced by the collaboration of two or more authors in which the contribution of each author is not separate from the contribution of the other author or authors.</P>
    <P>Now, what will be the position under this Bill in the following circumstances? A simple tune is devised by somebody outside this country, a &ldquo;pop&rdquo; tune if you like.  A composer in this country orchestrates that, with a great deal of work and does it very successfully.  He, in fact, has created another work of art, if it is well done. Is he not entitled in justice to some copyright for this, what is virtually a new work of art?  After all, if we consider the work of Bach or of other great composers, what they did was to take tunes which were going around Germany or wherever it was in their day and develop them into magnificent chorales or other works of high musical merit.  It seems to me that it is only fair that if a man transforms a simple tune of this kind into a major work of art he should have some copyright in the matter.  He will not under the Bill as at present.  It may be that I misunderstand the clause &mdash; and here I should like to express my gratitude to the Minister for the correspondence in which he has clarified certain matters for me &mdash; but, I would ask him now whether it would not be possible to introduce some kind of amendment by which our Irish composers would get some return in this way.</P>
    <P>I understand that at present the law in Great Britain is what is envisaged here, but that this is not the law in other countries abroad.  In fact, I understand that the law in Great Britain was not changed to what we have here until the war, and then under the usual excuse, a justifiable one no doubt, of war and necessity, certain rights under the previous copyright law were changed.</P>
    <P>The position will be, I understand, <Col N="401" /> under this Section that composer X in Ireland who takes a simple tune, orchestrates it and makes a considerable work of art out of it, will get nothing except his original fees. All the other monies on that will go out of the country because we have no big musical publishers in this country.  Now, I understand if a composer in France were to take a simple tune and do that kind of thing with it he would get certain copyright fees.</P>
    <P>I am speaking from information provided from somebody else.  I am open to correction, but I know the person who gave me this information was acting in good faith.  If I am wrong in this matter I shall of course withdraw it. But if I am right in the general outline I suggest to the Minister that possibly amendment is desirable to see that these people who are doing work of high artistic merit in this country should get some copyright fee.  It is a very complicated Bill and it may be that the matter is safeguarded elsewhere but to put it quite simply, if a simple tune is taken and made into a major orchestral piece, must our Irish composers receive no copyright for that considerable work?</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this section might be amended rather simply&mdash;this is a dangerous thing to say about such a complicated Bill as this &mdash; if we could change the phrasing to &ldquo;in which the contribution of each author is not separable from the contribution of the other author or authors.&rdquo;  The section at the moment reads &ldquo;separate from the contribution of the other author or authors.&rdquo;  You see it would be perfectly possible in the case that I have mentioned to say: here is the simple tune which is protected under copyright. All the rest of this elaborate orchestration has been done by Irish composers with possibly some originality in it.  They are separable.  Therefore, it is not a work of joint authorship under the Act and some copyright fees may be obtained.</P>
    <P>I know I am treading in very labyrinthine ways in this Bill.  If I put my foot in the wrong direction the Minister will, I hope, put me right.  If what I say is correct, I think it is unjust to Irish composers that because <Col N="402" /> they live in Ireland and not in France or, possibly, Canada or the States &mdash; I am not quite sure of the exact law in these places &mdash; they will be prevented under this Bill, from getting certain copyright fees which they would get in that other country.  We are adapting ourselves to British law, where British law is not the model in certain other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>To turn from the composers to the performers, I do think that a fair case has been made by Senator Murphy that performing musicians in this country will face the risk of considerable unemployment if certain provisions in Section 17 still stand.  If these records of their music can be used a good deal more freely than in the past, it is perfectly clear that many places will dispense with bands and play records.  It might be argued that when performers make records they know they are taking that risk and they need not make the records.  That is not a justifiable line of argument. They have to make these records to eke out their very slender fees.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister very earnestly to see if he could cut down this risk of unemployment amongst the practising musicians of Ireland by some amendment of this section. Again, it might be a very complicated process.  I would not care to try to undertake it by way of amendment myself.  I do think it is called for.</P>
    <P>We have a great tradition of music in this country.  On the Minister's letter which I have before me, the harp is on the lefthand corner.  It is also on our coinage.  Part of the fame of Ireland depends on that music which is symbolised by the harp.  Under this legislation, those who are as it were, the descendants of the ancient harpers of Ireland, will suffer.  I hope the Minister will reconsider the matter in that light.</P>

Sin í an trioblóid is mó atá i gceist sa Bhille seo.</P>
      <P>Mar a dúirt cuid de sna Seanadóirí tá baol ann go mbeidh dífhostú nó dith oibre imeasc roint ceoltóirí má mhéadaíonn an nós chun taifeadáin a úsáid in ionad buíonta ceoil.  Táim ar aon aigne leo sin agus is rud tábhachtach é maidir le h-obair sa tír seo.  Ach chím a lán deacracht san scéal sin. Conas a gheofar teacht ar táille a bhaint de dhaoine a úsáidfidh taifeadáin in ionad buíon cheoil chun caitheamh aimsire i dtithe nó i hallaí ar fud na tíre?  Ní heol dom aon ghléas chun táille do bhaint díobh sin. Tá nós ann i dtíthe óil faoi láthair na taifeadáin a chur ar siúl.  Is eol dom go raibh dlí in gcoinne cúpla tígh chun íocaíocht a bhaint amach ar son lucht úinéireachta na dtaifeadán, ach ní tháinig sé fós ann go mbeidh cúis ghearáin ag buíonta ceoil toisc go seinntear ceol ar thaifeadáin a cheannaítear i siopa nó ó na daoine a dheanann iad.</P>
      <P>Sí an trioblóid atá sa scéal, dar liomsa, ná conas a thiocfaí ar aon táille a bhailiú ó dhá-dtrian de sna hallaí agus na ranganna agus na háiteanna a bhainfeadh feidhm as taifeadáin in ionad feidhm a bhaint as buíonta ceoil.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks on the last Bill apply equally to this one.  I do not think it is necessary for me to go into any detail.  I shall, to some extent, try to meet or rather answer some of the points raised by the Senators.  I find myself again in a difficulty I was in once before in referring to Senator Lindsay's remarks, that I am now addressing him as LeasChathaoirleach. I think I can allay one fear he expressed about the Second Schedule of the Bill in its reference to Section 4 of the 1958 Act. The 1958 Act applies to all industrial and commercial property, and provides that rules of court under the 1927 Industrial Property Act must be made by the courts and not by the Minister. As I said, that Act did not relate only to copyright, and, therefore, it is retained in existence because it refers also to rules of court in respect of trade marks and other industrial and commercial properties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not a definition of &ldquo;Court&rdquo; in the definition section of the Bill, but Section 23 provides that an action may be brought in an appropriate court and sets out in detail what these courts are, from the High Court down to the District Court.  The provisions of Section 23 relieve a long-standing complaint that infringements of copyright were prosecuted exclusively in the High Court, and on many occasions where an innocent infringement might have occurred, done perhaps by the proprietor of a small dancehall in a rural area, he would have to face a claim brought against him in the High Court.  Section 23 does not preclude the bringing of such cases in the High Court, but it enables the Judge to award costs appropriate to the amount of the damages he gives.  In other words, if the damages given against an infringer of copyright are appropriate to the District Court, even though the case is brought in the High Court, then costs on the District Court scale may be given.  That will relieve what is undoubtedly a hardship particularly <Col N="405" /> in the case of innocent infringers.</P>
    <P>The power that the King's Inns Library are given to sell certain of their books was given as a result of representations directly made.  As far as other libraries are concerned who have the right to receive books from publishers, they do not necessarily have to take books willy nilly, because there is provision whereby they can, through appropriate means, request that published books be sent to them.  If they do not want them, they do not have to apply in the approved way.</P>
    <P>As far as Senator Murphy is concerned, I do not know whether I am responsible for his not getting a copy of the speech I delivered.  Sometimes I wonder whether it is wise for a Minister to give a copy of a speech. On one occasion recently I circulated a copy of a speech I made in the Dáil when there were about two Deputies present.  Other Deputies wandered in, picked up copies which they found lying around, and picked passages out of it and then made irrelevant contributions. I am not suggesting that such a thing would happen here, but it often tends to delay proceedings.  However, I can assure the Senator that in future on any occasions when I will cause copies of an introductory statement to be circulated he will get one of them.</P>
    <P>As far as his point is concerned about the difficulty that Part 3 of the Bill will cause to musicians, a point on which he was supported by both Senator O'Brien and Senator Stanford, Senator Stanford anticipated the type of reply I would have given, which is, nevertheless, a valid one.  If a record is made of a work, then the person who makes it can do what he likes with it.  He can put it into his own archives and nobody can use it.  If he puts it on sale then a person who pays the appropriate cost is entitled to buy it.  If that record contains musical or dramatic works of individual performers, then there is an obligation on those performers to ensure that any contract they made with the record owners will ensure that they will be adequately remunerated for their contribution to the record.  Once the record is put on sale, then it is only <Col N="406" /> fair that members of the public who buy it should have the right to use it.</P>
    <P>If a record is played &mdash; and this, I think, will answer the problem of Seanadóir Ó Siochfhradha &mdash; in public there is remuneration.  In other words, the proprietor of a public house is charged a fee for his customers listening to the record.  He will be obliged to pay the appropriate fee to the record owner.  The person who plays a record in public has paid already a £1 or maybe more, of which a certain percentage is given to the people who own the copyright in it, so that, by and large, in the first instance, it is a matter for the person who makes the record to put it on sale or not as he likes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Brien made some references to the habit of Irish musicians of having their works recorded abroad, apart from Irish authors having their works published abroad.  As far as the making of records is concerned, we do make records here but there is the basic element in this called the matrix, which is the key imprint.  We do not, unfortunately, make matrices in this country, but we can make reproductions from them.  We have to have these matrices made abroad and imported, <Col N="407" /> so that is one matter that we cannot provide for in this Bill.  We cannot help Irish musicians to have their works recorded from the ground up, so to speak, in this country.</P>
    <P>The other main point raised was the obligation on publishers to provide libraries in this country and in Britain with copies of each book they publish.  As I said already, there is provision in the Bill whereby such people make application for a copy through certain channels.  If you examine the obligation you will see that it is very much in favour of this country as everyone agrees by and large, even though it might be remarked in passing that some British publishers are complaining about the advantages we enjoy.</P>
    <P>Take the average book published in this country, let it cost £1, £3 or £4. Assume that it costs £2 as an average figure &mdash; I do not know whether it would be or not.  The obligation to present 11 copies is not, I suggest, a very onerous one.  If it retails at £2 the cost to the publisher is considerably less and a £2 book may cost the publisher only £15 for the 11 copies he would have to provide.  Dearer books would cost more, of course.  I see few cases in which the publisher would have to pay more than £30 or £40 for the allocation of these books to the libraries to which we give entitlement under the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be a severe hardship and while it may be possible to have some administrative provision to give compensation in suitable cases I do not think you could write such a provision into the Bill because you would have to define what a weak company is and every publishing company might have a claim for compensation from the State for the obligation imposed by the Bill.</P>
    <P>It was suggested to me elsewhere &mdash; not here&mdash;that this forced Irish publishers to have their printing done <Col N="408" /> abroad.  I do not think there is anything at all in that.  I do not think it is any valid argument against this provision.</P>
    <P>These are the main points which were raised I think.  I am obliged to the Seanad for hearing out the Second Stage without adjourning.</P>

      <P>In respect to that, the Senator's letter to me was my first intimation that any difficulty was experienced with that problem.  As I understand the Senator's case here this evening he said that when a person adapted a tune and made a reasonably good composition of it some copyright should reside in him.  In the first place, in order to adapt a tune like that the composer or adaptor would have to have the permission of the person who composed the song and in whom the original copyright would have been.  It would be a dangerous precedent to permit a copyright to be created in a work already composed by somebody else.  The essence of copyright, the essence of the subject of copright must be that it is a creative work, something creative, something which the person who composed it created himself.  To give the right to a person to claim copyright for the adaptation of such work would, I think, lead you into dangerous fields.  The Senator's letter which was received only some days ago on February 26th was the first intimation that a difficulty may exist and between this and the Committee Stage I will give it further consideration.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
