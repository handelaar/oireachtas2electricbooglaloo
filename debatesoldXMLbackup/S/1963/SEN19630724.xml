With a bit of luck, we may be able to deal with the remainder of the Appropriation Bill, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (Amendment) Bill, and the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous <Col N="1360" /> Provisions) Bill tommorrow, to obviate sitting on Friday.  It is proposed to meet on Wednesday next to take the Second Stage of the Planning Bill.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 48 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 48 specifies the persons who will be liable to pay this tax.  When the Bill was introduced in the Dáil, a person whose receipts for the sale of goods did not exceed £500 per month had the option of not being accountable for this tax.  On 16th July on Report Stage, the Minister moved an amendment to delete £500 and substitute £750 and it was agreed.  Does the Minister know exactly what he wants in this Bill?  First he said £500; then £250 was mentioned by members of the Fianna Fáil Party; and some of the Independents who supported the Government wanted the figure increased to £750 per month.</P>
      <P>Seven hundred and fifty pounds per month is about £9,000 per year. Therefore, people on less than £750 per month will not be personally liable for the tax but they can purchase from the wholesaler who will undertake to pay the tax on their behalf.  It means that there will be no inquisition as to their sales: they will be free from form filling and free from inspection by the Revenue Commissioners.  But how is the Minister to know whether their sales are under or over £750 a month?  If they are purchasing from the one wholesaler, that wholesaler will make the returns for them but if they are dealing with six or seven wholesalers, the position will be different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that business is not static <Col N="1361" /> and that it varies from month to month.  We know also that, due to inflation, money can lose its value very quickly.  I should like the Minister to tell us how the Revenue Commissioners are going to deal with this matter if money should lose its value within the next few years.  We are told that by increasing the figure to £750 a month, we exclude practically 80 per cent of the retailers.  Then why have two sets of collecting machinery, one for the 20 per cent and the other for the wholesalers?  We in Fine Gael are against this tax entirely.  If the Government want to get this £11 million, surely they have other methods of getting it.</P>
    <P>I should like to reply to the remark made by Senator Flanagan last week by saying that all the shopkeepers are not robbers, rogues or black marketeers. The majority of them are decent, respectable people.  The money must come from the consumer and if that is the Government's aim, I think the best thing to have done would have been to extract it from them by the simplest machinery possible.  Then why set up two systems of collection if the result is to be exactly the same? Under the complicated system now proposed by the Minister, 80 per cent of the retailers need not keep books or accounts but can purchase their supplies from the wholesalers and they will have to pay the wholesalers the 2½ per cent tax on the goods they buy. The retailers will have to pass that on to the consumers.</P>
    <P>The other 20 per cent of the retailers must become unpaid tax collectors. They must keep accounts and be ready for inspection by the Revenue Commissioners. They must purchase from the wholesalers at a price different from that at which the other 80 per cent of the retailers will purchase.  If they are to recoup themselves, they must add that 2½ per cent to the consumer price, keep their returns and pay the 2½ per cent to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>This will all add up to extra work and expense on the wholesalers as they must themselves sell at two different price levels.  They must sell to the 80 per cent of the retailers at the <Col N="1362" /> cost of the goods, plus 2½ per cent and to the remainder of the retailers at the ordinary wholesale prices.  The wholesalers will also have to compensate themselves for the extra cost and expense and perhaps, instead of charging 2½ per cent, they will have to charge 3 per cent or 3½ per cent to cover their expenses.  All this is bound to increase the cost of living. There is little use talking about wages standstill orders because this increase will have to be passed on.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is determined to collect this £11 million annually, why not do it in an efficient manner?  Why not go the whole hog and allow it be collected in the same way as it will be collected from 80 per cent of the retailers?  It was admitted in the Dáil that 80 per cent of the retailers can purchase from the wholesalers and that the wholesalers will keep the accounts and forward the tax to the Government. If the Minister is determined to get this money, why not let the wholesalers collect from all the retailers? It would be a much more efficient way of doing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator L'Estrange has put his finger on something that requires elucidation and further thought before the machinery for collecting this tax is finally decided. When this tax was conceived, it was intended that everybody should come under it.  Then the figure of £500 was arrived at as an exclusive figure for those who would be allowed purchase through the wholesaler and who would not have the burden of book-keeping. Now we have the figure of £750.  These two figures are only arbitrary figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there will be great confusion at the point of £750.  Trade varies from month to month.  Most people trade, if they are successful in business, on an upward scale.  Then you get the transitional period when people will move from the £750 scale into another scale of business operations. It is well known we have creeping inflation in our economy, which will probably go on indefinitely.  That can be seen in the banking figures. Over a ten year period, the amount of money handled by the banks has practically <Col N="1363" /> doubled itself.  It is only reasonable to suppose, therefore, that the figure of £750 may be £1,250 in six or seven years.  There is a good case for making whatever is decided applicable to everybody.</P>
    <P>I cannot help feeling that some form of purchase tax would have been better, now that we are getting away from the original idea.  If the original idea had been carried through, at least everyone would know where he stood, but we are now getting into the realm of confusion, as to who is to buy from the wholesaler and who is to be registered. If the purchase tax system had not been used, the tax would have been flexible.  It could have been heavy on luxury goods, less heavy on the more commonly used goods and not at all on the essentials of life.  We are interested to hear from the Minister if any decision has been come to as to how this will be carried out and how the demarcation line between the people of £750 and less and the others will be maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see difficulties for the people at the £750 and less level.  Different categories of workers are paid weekly, fortnightly or monthly.  Civil servants, Guards and bank officials are paid monthly and, therefore, they pay their accounts monthly.  If the shopkeeper decides to pay the tax at source, he will have to carry that 2½ per cent for the month.  Quite a number of farmers pay their accounts half yearly or even yearly.  In that case, the shopkeeper will be forced to carry the tax for the year or half year.  Teachers and road workers are paid fortnightly. In their case, the shopkeeper will have to carry the tax for the fortnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The shopkeeper who pays at source will also have to carry bad debts.  He has to pay at source because he could not afford to keep a girl at nothing else but looking after the accounts. Forestry workers, Bord na Móna workers and Land Commission workers are paid weekly.  They would not create such a problem.  If everyone bought for cash, there would be <Col N="1364" /> no trouble, but the person who pays the tax at source will find he is paying much more and perhaps carrying a bank overdraft.  We disagree with the tax completely, but if it is to be collected, there should be an allowance for people who have to give credit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the plea made that the provisions of this section should be extended to all traders; in other words, that all traders should have the option of purchasing their goods tax paid. The Revenue Commissioners, who advise the Minister on these matters considered this whole question very carefully some years ago.  They came to the conclusion that it would not be feasible to collect a tax at retail level. A Commission was set up to advise the Minister on income tax some years ago.  That Commission was sitting in 1957 when the Government came into office.  The Commission invited interested parties to submit memoranda of evidence.  A number of people gave evidence, but the Revenue Commissioners submitted a memorandum dated 27th August, 1957, which read as follows:</P>
      <P>Theoretically, the retail stage is the ideal level, i.e., the tax would be charged on the actual price at which the commodity is sold to the final consumer.  In practice, however, because of the huge number of traders who would be brought within the tax net, a tax at the retail level would be costly and difficult of administration, and taxation at an earlier level is to be preferred. A tax at the wholesale level would seem to be feasible in this country.  It would not be unduly expensive to administer and would be preferable to taxation at the manufacturing level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That represents the considered views of the Revenue Commissioners in 1957, only a short time ago.  I am sure they advised the Minister on this very point within the past 12 months. I wonder have they given the Minister different views now?  The Revenue Commissioners have a vast experience of trying to collect income tax and I <Col N="1365" /> am sure they have found it very difficult to get individual returns from every trader in the country.  I rather think it is the experience which the Revenue Commissioners have gained in their capacity as income tax collectors that persuaded them to put this memo to the Commission on Income Taxation in 1957.  In their wisdom, they realised what a hardship this would impose on traders, that it would not be feasible and that this type of tax should not be imposed at that level.  As I say, this Party are entirely against this tax in any shape or form, but, if a tax there must be, then we suggest it should be imposed in a way that will cause least hardship and in a way that will be workable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephQuigley" hpid="Mr. Quigley Mr. Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems certain that this tax will be imposed and I support Senator L'Estrange's recommendation that the wholesalers should charge it to the retailers.  The big objection I have found as I go down the country is that of the small shopkeepers who would have to keep these accounts and collect the tax.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister carefully to consider Senator L'Estrange's recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained in the Dáil on more than one occasion the difference between the £250 tax and the £750 tax, and I cannot make up my mind whether the failure of certain Deputies to understand it was due to stupidity or malice, both of which they are capable of cultivating, and the same applies here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Senator L'Estrange understands this very well. There is a difference between the £250 and the £750.  Senator L'Estrange said the Minister should be clear in his mind what he is talking about and I am trying to be as clear as I can.  The £250 refers to a retailer who buys untaxed goods and he may not sell more than £250 worth without registering. If he buys taxed goods, then he may <Col N="1366" /> sell up to £750 worth without registering. That is the difference and I wish Senators would understand that and not put to me that same question over and over again as they have been doing for the past few weeks.</P>
      <P>There is a change of front in the Fine Gael Party in regard to this tax, They have come to admit it is inevitable.  It is like RGDATA who sought, by political measures, to defeat this Bill in the beginning and who when they saw that was not possible, attempted to have it put on at the wholesale level.  Fine Gael are adopting the same attitude&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as they have from the beginning.  It was not possible, as I explained to RGDATA when they came to see me, to change the whole structure of this Bill when they changed their minds in regard to the tax.  I do not see it is any great burden on the wholesaler to keep two separate accounts, one where the tax is not paid and one where the tax is not paid by the wholesaler.  I had deputations from the wholesalers and practically every wholesaler who came to me admitted they have different prices for different people, even at the present time.  For a small customer, they have one price and for a big customer, they have another price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VictorCarton" hpid="Mr. Carton Mr. Carton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>
      <P>Different prices for one article?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, for the same article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephQuigley" hpid="Mr. Quigley Mr. Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never heard of a wholesaler having different prices for customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the wholesalers are capable of keeping different accounts at the present time, I do not see that this will put an extra burden on them. They put it to me also they had these cash registers and where a person came and ordered a certain amount of goods which he took away with him, it would just go through the cash register. Again I asked them would it be a great burden on them to put down the registered number on the cash docket going out and they had to admit it <Col N="1367" /> would not be a great burden at all. They would have to sort out these small dockets, as they have to do at present for various reasons.  Whether the wholesaler sells under £750 to a small man who is unregistered, or sells free of tax to those who are registered, would not create any great trouble for the wholesaler.  It is true, as was said, that this £750 exemption would permit about 80 per cent of the retailers to avoid registration but it would cover only about 25 per cent of the volume of trade because those who are above the £750 a month have the greater volume of trade on their hands.</P>
      <P>I explained very fully in the Budget speech and afterwards on more than one occasion my objections to the purchase tax.  I said that by having a retail tax on a broad basis, the amount of tax can be low, a very small percentage.  If certain items are left out and the retail tax is still adhered to, the tax must be higher, naturally, in order to get the same amount of money.  If there is a purchase tax, it would be higher still, in fact, very much higher, in order to get the same amount of money.  The big objection to that is that the goods taxed under the purchase tax would be practically taxed out of existence and the manufacturers, and so on, dealing in these goods would have a very lean time.  It would lead to unemployment and would cause upset in the trade.  Naturally, if the same amount of money could be obtained from a purchase tax and without touching such things as food and clothing which are essential, any Government would choose that method rather than the other.  Therefore, there must be very good reasons for choosing this tax which was obviously going to be unpopular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McAuliffe was mistaken, if I heard him rightly, in thinking that the retailer who purchases his goods free of tax will be in any way hurt by having monthly accounts or yearly accounts.  It does not matter as far as the tax is concerned because the tax will be payable only on cash received. If he does not receive the cash for 12 months, he does not pay tax until <Col N="1368" /> then, or if he does not receive cash until the month is up, he does not pay until then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>What happens if he is registered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the man who is registered.  If he registers and pays his own tax, then he pays on cash received.  If the cash does not come in for 12 months or a month, he pays the tax only at that point. As far as bad debts are concerned he is free of tax because he is never paid and, therefore, he has not got the cash. If he pays at wholesale level, then it is true that he does meet with these difficulties.  Where he pays at wholesale level where the tax is paid he has paid his tax and he may sell his goods to a customer who does not pay him for a month or for twelve months.  He may meet with a bad debt and he has paid his tax so he has no way out. All that applies to a retailer who buys from a wholesaler who has paid tax but it does not apply to a retailer who pays his own tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>He gets no refund if he buys from a wholesaler who has paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>From that point of view, it is better for a retailer to pay his own tax than to buy it from a wholesaler who pays it.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzpatrick referred to the Report of the Revenue Commissioners stating that though theoretically retail level was ideal, for administrative purposes it was not advisable.  When this report was made, the Revenue Commissioners asked me what the intentions of the Government were regarding a retail tax.  I said I would like to have it fully examined.  The Revenue Commissioners did examine the matter and made inquiries in Continental countries where a tax of this kind was imposed. They then came to the conclusion that a retail tax was the most easily administered and certainly the most profitable as far as the revenue was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is easy, of course, to see the case for such a tax as it is higher at retail level than at wholesale level.  Two and a half per cent at retail level would get more money than at wholesale or <Col N="1369" /> manufacturers' level.  It is also less trouble to administer at retail level than at any other stage in the process of trading.  I, like Senators here I am quite sure, would have the idea that this was rather hard to understand but they did convince me.  It was a fact that administratively they could do it better at retail level than at any other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I should like to make.  The Minister would agree that the Revenue Commissioners did say in 1957 that a retail tax would be costly and difficult of administration and that a tax at an earlier level was to be preferred.  They stated that view clearly and without doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  They did say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems annoyed that I should question subsection (3) of this section but I make no apology for querying him on it because I was not clear about it. Maybe Senators on the Minister's side of the House know all about it but I must confess that I did not.  The first £250 turnover is completely free of tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that was what the Minister said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to explain.  Perhaps I had better take an example and that might be easier.  There are certain trades where a person buys goods from a non-taxed source.  A butcher is a very good example.  He buys from a farmer where tax is not paid.  Some butchers, however, in Dublin especially, buy from a taxed source and it would be unfair if one man could have his cattle from an untaxed source while another was taxed and a limit of £250 is put on that type of trade.  The small butcher is free if his business is under £250.  That covers very few butchers but if he is not in excess of £250 he is free; that is coming from an untaxed source but he must register and pay tax above it.  A person buys from a taxed source where he buys wholesale from a wholesaler who is paying tax.  He can go to £750.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say what I had in mind in making that exemption of £250.  Very few butchers would be under £250.  If a butcher killed one beast in a week he would exceed £250.  I had in mind the small greengrocer throughout the towns of Ireland or people selling milk which came from farmers.  We do not bother if it is under £250.</P>

      <P>I wonder whether I could ask a question.  I have in mind small shopkeepers who might buy from a number of wholesalers.  What arrangements have you to check on their total sales in a month to know whether they were under £750 or over £750?  There might be a number of cases of people getting stuff from wholesalers under different names and it would be difficult to keep a check on them.  Is there any provision in the Bill for them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked that.  I asked what will happen if he bought half a dozen things from one and a dozen from another.  If we have inflation and money loses its value, can you change this by order or must you come back to the Dáil or what happens?  Say money loses its value, how do you meet that situation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>With regard to Senator Hogan, it is laid down in the Bill that a person who exceeds £750 a month for two months in succession&mdash;we do <Col N="1371" /> not say one month because that might be casual business or a big order&mdash;but over £750 for two months, he must register.  The inspector of taxes will be in charge of this and those people are fairly good judges of matters of this kind.  If they have a suspicion that a person is exceeding £750 over a long period, they may require him to make a return showing where he was getting goods and they would check with the wholesaler.  Whether there was more than one wholesaler or not it would be all the same.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senator L'Estrange, I have power by order to mitigate anything in the Bill but I have not power to make anything worse.  I could do what the Senator says but I would not be inclined to.  It would be a major matter and I think we would have to wait for another Finance Bill before I would do that.</P>

      <P>Will it be necessary to register all persons&mdash;manufacturers, wholesalers or retailers&mdash;who for business purposes buy or sell goods or persons who provide services?  There are about 40,000 retailers in the country at present and if 80 per cent are freed under this new provision there will be roughly 8,000 retailers, 5,000 manufacturers and wholesalers not to speak of the thousands of hotels, guesthouses, restaurants, boarding houses and bookies down to barbers, taxi drivers, jobbers, plumbers and general handymen. Having regard to the fact that this scheme is intended to govern retail transactions in goods and services throughout the country, is the Minister not unduly optimistic when he estimates that the cost to the State of administering this scheme will be less than one per cent of the yield?  I remember the Minister for Agriculture stating that he would fill ten fields with inspectors but I think he will want a lot of inspectors now, if this tax is <Col N="1372" /> imposed, to collect the money.  It is unfair to the traders of the country who are decent respectable people if they are to be made further instruments of collection of State revenue.  They are to be unpaid tax collectors under this Bill. Senator Ó Maoláin cannot deny that.</P>

      <P>There is something introduced in this section that is objectionable, and that is that goods brought into the shopkeeper's own house will be brought in at retail value for tax.  That is something that never happened before.  Many people have started shops and get nothing out of it <Col N="1373" /> except the goods at wholesale.  I do not think the owner of the shop should be asked to pay on the retail value, but on the wholesale value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has a perfect right to argue the point, but it depends on whether we think that the shopkeeper should get off with a little less tax than another consumer, whether he should pay tax on the wholesale price or on what is called the current retail price, that is his retail price whatever it may be.  This will not be gone into every week.  What usually happens here with those who pay income tax is that there is an agreement made between the inspector of taxes and the shopkeeper and that agreement will hold for some time.  If we take a grocer's shop, which is the type of shop where most would be taken for the household, the Inspector will agree with the shopkeeper that he will put down, say, £4 or £5 a week, whatever he thinks is fair, for the shopkeeper's own goods from the shop and that will cover the matter.</P>

I know a colleague of mine, a doctor, who had not any more complicated records as regards income than I have but he was compelled by the Revenue Commissioners to get audited accounts. They did that because they had some trouble with him.  If they have trouble with a shopkeeper they may insist on him keeping more records than the ordinary shopkeeper, but in 80 or 90 per cent of cases the shopkeepers will be making an honest estimate of their sales and there will be very little trouble given to them with regard to keeping records.</P>

      <P>I see that under this section stamps may be affixed. Will it be provided that if a shopkeeper decides not to pay the tax at source he could pay it through stamps?  I should like to know if it will be possible where a person buys 10/- worth of goods to affix a stamp for 3d on the receipted bill, or where he buys a £'s worth to put on a 6d stamp and let him have no further records.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that the Senator is reading this as if the retailer will put a stamp on the invoice he is giving to his customer.  It will not be like that.  This provides that where a shopkeeper has a rather small account at the end of the month and maybe has no banking account, instead of sending a money order he may send stamps if he wishes.  If he has only to pay 5/- he would put a 5/- stamp on it and that would be all right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I might refer to a point raised on the Second Stage by Senator Cole, the question of annulment by the Dáil which comes under subsection (3) of this section?  The Minister indicated in a reply on the Second Stage that in Finance Bills in the past there have been variations in practice and in many Bills there has been annulment by the Dáil alone.  I should like to raise this not only in regard to this Bill but in that so far as it is allowed to be passed in this Bill we might be consolidating a precedent which might be undesirable.  The position is that though the powers of this House in regard to money matters are limited, nevertheless, this House does have the duty and right which are exercised at all times to make recommendations to the Dáil on money matters.  If regulations are made under any of those Money Bills a similar situation exists in regard to those regulations as exists in regard to every section of the enabling Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, it would be only reasonable that this House, if not being given power to annul regulations under Finance Bills, should at least be given power to make recommendations to the Dáil that they be annulled whenever this House thinks fit.  What is being done here is, as the Minister says, what has been done in the past and is perfectly legal, but I do not think it is in the spirit of the way in which financial business is transacted by the two Houses of the Oireachtas. With regard to regulations of this type, this House should have power to make recommendations with regard to annulment whenever the Seanad thinks it should, otherwise it is possible to put things in regulations and let them pass <Col N="1376" /> into law without adverse comment from the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I am as jealous of the rights of the House as Senator Dooge but I think he is labouring under a slight misapprehension.  The difficulty in this case is that this House has not the right to make recommendations on a Money Bill except under specific circumstances.  That only applies to a Bill because the Bill has come from the Dáil to the Seanad and it is duly allowed for in Standing Orders because the Bill has to go back to the Dáil and the Seanad can make recommendations.</P>
      <P>Under Section 52, the regulations are made by the Revenue Commissioners. I cannot see how this House, because of its constitutional position, can make recommendations to the Revenue Commissioners.  The powers of the House are not taken away from it in this respect.  It does not really matter that the Revenue Commissioners are concerned because the power of the Seanad to recommend to the Dáil that something should be annulled exists by means of a motion, so it is only a matter of wording.  The machinery already exists to recommend to the Dáil to annual anything.  The Seanad can pass a motion so while it may not look very well that one House is left out of the section, in practice, it does not make any difference to the actual powers of the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support what has been said on this point by Senator Dooge.  This House has the power to examine Bills and make either amendments or recommendations.  These regulations will be made by the Revenue Commissioners.  I wonder what is the necessity for their being made by the Revenue Commissioners and not the Minister?  If they were made by the Minister, I presume the House could then make recommendations on the regulations, as is the case with other Bills.  The House has power in other money Bills to examine the reports of companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sheldon has said we can put down a motion, have it debated here, and sent to the Dáil.  We know <Col N="1377" /> that is a long process.  Apart from that, the same could be said about any piece of legislation.  It could be said: &ldquo;Do not let it go to the Seanad, and if the Seanad like, they can put down a motion asking the Dáil to annual it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We should have power to consider any legislation the Dáil has power to consider.  When I use the word &ldquo;consider&rdquo;, I include making amendments or recommendations, where they are necessary.  We should have the power to consider any important piece of legislation.  To my mind, Section 52 is just as important as any other section of the Bill.  Senators may be experts on certain aspects of legislation and surely it was intended by the Constitution that for that reason the Seanad should have power to examine any regulation made under the Finance Bill?  It has been pointed out that this has happened before but I do not remember coming across any instance of it.  I feel the matter should be looked into, if not in this Bill, certainly in future Finance Bills.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Senator Dooge and Senator Cole on this point.  I would not approach it from the point of view of the rights of the House; I would approach it from the point of view of what is best for the country.  There is a certain amount of knowledge, experience and wisdom in this House.  It is for the benefit of the country that is should be applied in any matter of importance dealing with Government. The wisdom of our legislation may lose a little if this House has no direct opportunity of considering and recommending on these matters.  I do not imagine we can make any change in this Bill, but I urge the Minister to consider, in future, whether it is not worthwhile, even on the off-chance of getting, some useful and sensible information from us, making provision that matters of this kind should come before the Seanad.  The country may lose something if they are not laid before the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the attitude of Senator Dooge, Senator Stanford and Senator Cole on this issue.  I fully support the attitude that this House has the right to rescind <Col N="1378" /> regulations.  Under Section 52 (1) (f), the Revenue Commissioners may make regulations providing for:</P>
      <P>the production to and inspection and removal by persons authorised by the Revenue Commissioners of invoices, receipts, books, records, accounts and other documents for the purpose of satisfying themselves as to whether tax has been duly paid.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the collection of this tax will be largely a matter for the inspector of taxes.  Am I to take it that the inspector of taxes, being human, will be at liberty to use information which he may get under a regulation made under paragraph (f) for the purpose of determining the liability of a business man to income tax?  If that is so, it seems to me that it is putting the business community in a worse position regarding income tax than the rest of the community.  The inspector of taxes in dealing with the accounts of a professional man will not have the right to invoke regulations such as I have mentioned, whereas if he is dealing with the accounts of a business man he will be able to have regard to the information which he will extract under a penal regulation made under paragraph (f) of Section 52.  If that is so, it is hardly in accordance with fair play or justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked back over the history of regulations being laid before the two Houses and I find that in some cases the Seanad was mentioned as well as the Dáil.  I was trying to think how the draftsman would draft it.  He would have to say: &ldquo;...laid before each House of the Oireachtas ...&rdquo; and then he would have to say: &ldquo;It can be annulled by the Dáil, or the Seanad can make recommendations&rdquo;.  I presume that if the draftsman tried it, he gave up in despair and said he could not draft it any better than it is.  As I said before, I certainly have no desire to take from the powers of the House. I can only make a note of it, and see what the draftsman thinks of it, if he is the proper person to advise, and see if in future we can arrive at an acceptable solution to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These regulations are made by the <Col N="1379" /> Revenue Commissioners, not by the Minister, which is rather unusual in these Bills.  I should say that it is not unusual in Finance Bills for the Revenue Commissioners to make the regulations although in Bills generally it is the Minister who makes them as they deal only with procedure and administration.  That does not take from the point made by Senator Dooge, Senator Cole and Senator Stanford that this House may be as wise in these matters as the Dáil, but this House has not power to annul.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Fitzpatrick's point, the inspector will be the same inspector.  He will be dealing with both income tax and turnover tax and I suppose we can hardly expect him to forget what he has learned when dealing with turnover tax when he is dealing with the other matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 5:</P>
      <P>Between lines 26 and 27, page 66, to insert &ldquo;Sales of bread, butter, tea, sugar, milk, flour and meat.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this recommendation is to remove from the scope of the turnover tax certain commodities, namely, bread, butter, tea, sugar, milk, flour and meat.  It was suggested during the Second Stage debate in this House that there was an element of dishonesty about the opposition to the turnover tax because nobody would die of starvation as a result of it.  I want to make it clear, once again, that we object to this tax and to any tax put on food.  We feel that this opposition is justified and that we do not think it is necessary to wait until a coroner's jury returns a verdict of death from starvation before we oppose such a tax in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe this tax is fundamentally bad and we believe that no adjustment of social welfare benefits will ever compensate for it.  The Minister has repeatedly put forward the argument that increased social welfare benefits will more than compensate the recipients for this two and a half per cent increase.  If we take the position of the social welfare beneficiaries now as compared with 1st November next, when this tax comes into operation, we shall find that they will not be compensated. There has been an increase of over five per cent in the cost of living since the last time social welfare benefits were increased.  I do not know what increase there will be between now and <Col N="1381" /> the beginning of next year, apart from the inevitable increase in the cost of living due to the imposition of this tax on food.</P>
    <P>The position is that those who oppose the introduction of this tax consider the inclusion of essential foods as particularly deplorable.  Even those who accept the Government's thesis that the turnover tax is unavoidable are disturbed at the inclusion of essential foods.  This final extension of the tax to cover essential foods is objectionable not only for what it is doing but also because we believe the Minister has not proved the necessity.  We believe it was away back in the Government's investment policy that the decision to impose this tax on food was made.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he has no alternative. We believe if the Government's investment programme had been more carefully carried out, this would not have arisen.  Nobody on this side accuses the Minister of taxation for taxation's sake, but I am afraid there is a very dangerous tendency among the Minister and his colleagues to indulge at times in investment for investment's sake.  The Government's capital programme has been argued always on its size.  We hear about how much is invested in this and that, but we hear very little about the merits of the proposals and about the criteria on which these proposals are judged.  For this reason, we believe the Government are particularly open to criticism on this point.</P>
    <P>If we take the Third Report of the Commission on Income Taxation, where they discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a purchase tax, whether at wholesale or retail level, we find, when we examine the advantages they cite and apply them to food, that they become very hollow indeed; and when we take the disadvantages and apply them to food, we find these disadvantages become greatly magnified. If we take the list of advantages and disadvantages given in page 30 of the Report, we get, first of all, at A:</P>
    <P>The person who pays a tax as part of the cost of an article is not usually as conscious of the tax as <Col N="1382" /> he is of income tax the amount of which is set out on a demand note or pay slip.</P>
    <P>There are many people in this country who never were conscious of income tax but who will be extremely conscious of the effect of this taxation on food from 1st November next.  By placing it on essential foods, which is unavoidable expenditure, it means these people are certainly not going to illustrate this advantage.</P>
    <P>Advantage B is:</P>
    <P>A purchase tax, unlike income tax, allows an option of spending either on taxable articles...</P>
    <P>or on alternative non-taxed articles. But there is no alternative to expenditure on essential foods.  On what non-taxed article can a person spend as an alternative to milk, bread and sugar?  This supposed advantage vanishes utterly when food is included.</P>
    <P>Advantage C is:</P>
    <P>There is less scope for evasion of purchase tax than income tax.</P>
    <P>This advantage certainly holds.  There is no scope whatever for the evasion of the tax on food.  When people are making out their family budgets, they can cut down on clothes and many other articles, but food they cannot cut down.  The parents of this country will bear this tax on food for their children's sake, but they should not be asked to do so.</P>
    <P>The final advantage is:</P>
    <P>A purchase tax is a flexible instrument for effecting changes in social and economic policy.</P>
    <P>It is as well it is a flexible instrument, so flexible, indeed, that this tax on essential foods can be removed as quickly and as easily as possible. Indeed, we all look forward to that being done.</P>
    <P>If we look at the disadvantages listed, we see these are all magnified when we consider them in relation to food.  The first is that such a tax would be regressive.  This is discussed at great length in the Report.  Howover, they do not bother to discuss food at all, because they never believed <Col N="1383" /> any Minister for Finance would tax food.  The whole discussion is on commodities other than food.  Is there any doubt that a tax on food is the most highly regressive tax of all?  This is unavoidable expenditure.  Food is the item that bulks as a higher proportion in the budgets of the poor than in the budgets of the rich.</P>
    <P>Another disadvantage listed is that the tax will be inflationary.  What could be more inflationary than a tax on food which cannot be avoided?  The objection to this tax is not that anyone is going to starve but a fundamental objection that, by including food, the Minister has imposed hardship in an area in which it can hardly be borne. The Minister has shown great flexibility in making exceptions and in introducing devices to cover special cases.  Surely here is one thing he could use his imagination on?  It is no defence for him to say he does not like doing it but that he has no way out.  We agree he does not like doing it, but we believe he has failed in his job by not being able to find a way out.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Senator Dooge.  There is an impression generally current that the people in this country have more than enough to eat.  A survey was done by the Medical Research Council in 1947-48.  It showed there was a very high level of food intake in the general population.  While that may be still generally true, there is definite evidence that sections of the population, not inconsiderable either in numbers or importance, are not in this happy state and that they will be very definitely adversely affected by the increase in the cost of the more essential foods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am thinking particularly of the evidence I know to exist of the very high incidence of anaemia in adolescents and pregnant women in Dublin. All the maternity hospitals know this very definitely, and our studies into these problems have completely confirmed the knowledge they have clinically.  This affects not only the women concerned, but the children they are bringing into the world.  We have in this town a higher instance of congenital deformities of the nervous <Col N="1384" /> system than exists anywhere in which accurate records are kept.  At the moment there is no definite evidence as to the cause of it, but it is not improbable that malnutrition or defective nutrition has a good deal to do with it.  These conditions lead to expenses in various directions.  Productivity is bound to be reduced if you are not feeling well or if you are undernourished. Illness occurs which leads to hospitalisation and expenses are incurred in the community which may go a fair length towards offsetting the amount of money collected under this tax.  I wish to support Senator Dooge in this recommendation.</P>

      <P>The Government have no mandate to impose this additional <Col N="1385" /> taxation on the necessaries of life, especially when we take into consideration the promises they made in the past and are making even at present.  They are speaking about moving to the left.  I am surprised that a Party who are supposed to be moving to the left are putting the same taxes in this Budget on bread, butter, tea, milk, flour, sugar and meat, on the necessaries of life, as they are putting on the man who can buy caviare, gin-and-it, a fur coat or a second car for his wife.  That is what the Government are doing in this Bill.</P>
      <P>We differ from Fianna Fáil and people will see the difference between the two Parties.  We believed in the past that subsidies should have been maintained in the interests of the poor people.  We have never taxed food; we have never taxed the necessaries of life.  As a matter of fact, the inter-Party Government in 1954, when they came back to power, took 5d. off the lb of butter. Fianna Fáil replaced it and then increased it by 5d.  We believe that necessaries should not be increased in price.  The Minister has told us and will tell us that the 2/6 increase that has been granted will cover the increases in the cost of the necessaries of life.  We all submit that is completely wrong, that it will not cover them.</P>
      <P>In any case, last year in the Dáil, Deputy Sherwin, who supported the Government, then stated that he had been given a categorical promise by the Government when he looked for a 5/- increase for the old age pensioners and the widows and orphans. He got an increase of only 2/6 and when he was taxed in the Dáil as to why he accepted that, he said he was given a promise that the extra 2/6 would be given next year.  This is the next year he spoke about at that time. If it is the 2/6 that was promised to Deputy Sherwin and if the cost of living has increased since then, as we all know it has, how can the Minister claim now it is enough to cover the unfortunate people for the increase in the cost of living which this undoubtedly means?</P>

      <P>Senators opposite <Col N="1386" /> who have spoken on this have entirely exaggerated the effect of the First Schedule, under which certain activities are exempted from this tax, on the poorer section of the community. Senator L'Estrange has tried to persuade us that the increased social welfare benefits will not compensate the poorer sections for the tax on food.  He is quite wrong in that.  They will more than compensate them and, furthermore, will benefit nearly half the population of the country.  He shows great concern for the poorer section of the people but we know exactly what his colleagues did in the past for the poorer section of the community.  I do not propose to go into that now but merely to say that their objection to this Schedule is entirely unrealistic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in full agreement with this recommendation by Senator Dooge.  It is the most important recommendation made so far, in view of the fact that the Government have apparently decided that the turnover tax is to become a reality.  As Senator L'Estrange said, the inter-Party Government subsidised food.  At the present time, we are subsidising food in England and every other country in the world to which we export food and yet at home we tax the food of our own people.</P>
      <P>I teach in a rural school to which children come at 8.30 in the morning and from which they do not arrive home until four or 4.15 in the afternoon. I have never seen those children eating a ham sandwich at school.  Nine out of ten of them belong to workers' families who have meat about once a week.  They may have a couple of sausages or something like that for the rest of the week but in a worker's house, the main food is butter, bread, tea and sugar.  I cannot understand how any Government could bring themselves to tax food in those circumstances, in view of the fact that a few years ago all these items were subsidised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I doubt very much if the social welfare benefits will compensate for the tax on food items but I do not see any great benefit in giving a half-crown, with one hand, and taking it <Col N="1387" /> back with the other.  It is my opinion that increases in social welfare benefits should be given in order to improve the standard of living, not just to keep the standard of living as it is.  For example, when we collected an extra £2 million or £3 million from the people in taxation we gave 2/6d.  Now we are collecting £11½ million extra and we still give 2/6d.  It does not seem to add up.</P>
    <P>Another matter the Minister is not worried about is the control of prices. As he said, he does not care where the tax is collected as long as they get it, and he no longer stands for control of prices.  If he wants a wage pause as he asked for in the White Paper and still wants this tax but is not prepared to control prices, he is going to start something new in this country in the line of very strong agitation for big wage increases.  I have no doubt that there will be an all round increase in the cost of living of at least five per cent in November.  It will be impossible for shopkeepers to collect tax on these goods unless they overcharge.  That is going to be difficult but they will have to overcharge.  Take a bottle of milk which costs 6½d.  It will go to 7d.</P>

      <P>No; Irish sugar was taxed.</P>
      <P>Let us get back to the 2/6d. on the social welfare benefits of 35/-.  If the tax is 6d. in the £, the amount to be paid on 35/- is less than a shilling so 2/6d. would be a very good cover for that&mdash;more than a cover.  Children are getting about a shilling a week on average.  That should cover expenditure of £2 on each child.  Senators will admit that a working man with five or six children cannot possibly spend more than £2 on food for each child so they will be covered also.  We have to admit therefore that the compensation in social welfare benefits is ample to cover increased costs as far as they are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been arguing since this tax came in that the most desirable tax of this kind is a tax at retail level because it gives the highest possible yield to the Exchequer at the smallest possible cost to the consumer.  Obviously, if it were put on at a lower level, it would have to be higher in order to get the same amount of money.  Wholesale prices are likely to be 18 per cent lower than retail prices and if the tax were put on at manufacturers' or wholesalers' level, margins <Col N="1389" /> would be increased up the whole way so the consumer would pay a good lot more in order to produce the same amount of money.</P>
    <P>Arrived at the conclusion that a retail tax is the most desirable type of tax in this particular case, we have, I think, to come to the next conclusion that it is also necessary, or, if not, necessary certainly most desirable, that it should be on a broad basis, that everything sold by retailers should be taxed.  For one thing of course, it would be almost impossible to check on retailers' sales if a large amount of goods were exempt and, secondly, the tax would have to be higher.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by the Commission who examined this that food and clothes should be exempt.  If they were exempt, I calculate that the tax would have to be six per cent, not 2½ per cent, and that would be a high tax on many other articles as well as making it very difficult to collect.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have any more to say.  We have gone over the ground so often that I would only be repeating myself if I said any more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that if food and clothes were exempt, there would have to be a tax of six per cent on other things.  If food were excluded, however, would he have any idea what the percentage would be?  We did not ask for clothes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>So clothes would bring in only one per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Roughly, that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this tax on food will affect the cost of living considerably. At earlier stages of the debate on this proposed tax, there seemed to be some doubt whether it should be borne by the consumer or by the trader, but at later stages it became perfectly clear that the Minister <Col N="1390" /> accepted that the trader would pass the tax on to the consumer.  If the trader is to indemnify himself completely against this 2½ per cent tax, he will have to add more than 2½ per cent to the cost of commodities such as food, clothing, <i>et cetera</i>.  If he adds 2½ per cent that becomes part of turnover and he pays tax on that 2½ per cent. To indemnify himself, he must add considerably more than 2½ per cent.</P>
      <P>The Minister at some stage stated that competition would see to it that high charges were not imposed as a result of this tax but the Minister is aware, I am sure, that in many parts of the country, there is really not much competition between traders. Because population has fallen to such a degree and there has been so much emigration from rural parts of the country, there are many little villages and crossroads where there is only a one-man shop.  If that one-man shop at the village or crossroads accepts the invitation&mdash;that word is perhaps too harsh&mdash;the licence of the Minister to pass on to the public, he will certainly do so and to indemnify himself completely: instead of increasing by 2½ per cent, he will make a substantially higher increase in the cost of food.  Then bang goes the cost of living and all will come for higher wages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>If a person wants to buy a motor car, a washing machine or a wireless set, with moneys which are not his own moneys, he has various ways of raising the money.  He can go to a bank and borrow it; he can go to a moneylender and borrow it; or he can go to a finance company and get the article on hire-purchase or credit.  In the First Schedule of the activities exempted from the turnover tax, there is a specific exemption of banking services.  Similarly, there is a specific provision for the exemption of moneylending, but after moneylending, there is added: &ldquo;...otherwise than in connection with hire-purchase or credit-sale transactions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Possibly the reason the Minister made an exception of hire-purchase and credit-sale transactions is a legal reason.  Possibly the reason was that in the Hire-Purchase Act, 1946, there is a definition of &ldquo;hire-purchase price&rdquo;.  It is defined as being &ldquo;the total sum payable by the hirer under a hire-purchase agreement in order to complete the purchase of the goods to which the agreement relates...&rdquo; In other words, the hire-purchase price is not merely the price of the article, but the price, plus the hire purchase charges of the finance company.  It was defined in that Act purely for the purpose of arriving at a simple definition. It is a legal definition, but I submit it has no real relevance outside <Col N="1393" /> that Act.  It is not the real price of the goods.</P>
    <P>The real price is the cash price, plus nothing else.  The hire-purchase charges are added on afterwards.  It is the same as if a man goes into a bank, borrows money, puts down money for the real price, and pays the bank interest.  It is the same in a moneylending transaction.  There is no difference between any of the three transactions. Yet, for some reason&mdash;it can only be the legal reason of the definition in the 1946 Act, I think &mdash; the exemptions in this Bill differentiate between articles bought with money which is not, initially, at any rate, the purchaser's money.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that it is an unfair distinction.  It is unfair, in the first place, because it puts the hire-purchase company in an unfair position when competing against a bank or a moneylender. Ultimately, there is no real difference between the transactions. It is also unfair because it puts the person who is supporting an article on hire-purchase in the position that he is paying more for goods he is getting on hire-purchase than the person who gets the same goods from a bank or a moneylender.  He is paying more in tax because the tax will be passed on to the ultimate consumer.  More tax is being paid on a hire-purchase or credit-sale transaction than is being paid on an ordinary banking or money lending transaction.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I put down this recommendation to delete the words &ldquo;otherwise than in connection with&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;including&rdquo; so that the exemption would read, as amended: &ldquo;moneylending including hire-purchase or credit-sales transactions&rdquo;.  That seems to me to be the only fair and proper way of dealing with these transactions. In the normal way, it is the poorest person who has not got a bank account who goes to a hire-purchase company, and he is the person who will be hit.  He will be hit harder than the wealthier person who has a bank account and can finance the purchase of a car, a washing machine or a wireless set, by borrowing from his bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a bit difficult to enter <Col N="1394" /> into a legal argument with the Senator. So far as I understand, the position is that the hire-purchaser hires an article from the retailer who eventually sells it to the purchaser.  Strictly speaking, in that case, we should regard the hire-purchaser as the retailer, and charge taxation accordingly, but for convenience as between the retailer and the hire-purchaser, it was decided to charge tax on the retail sales from the retailer to the hire-purchaser, and then tax the hire-purchaser on the added value, as it were, of the goods.  That is fair and in line with the general principle underlying the turnover tax.  I think it is different from borrowing money from a bank or a moneylender.</P>
      <P>There is one analogy I should like to give.  If a retailer has an article for sale, cash down, he says: &ldquo;The price is so and so, and if you want credit, it will be more.&rdquo;  The retailer may well say the cash price is £100, and if a person wants to pay for it over 12 months, it will be £110.  In that case, we have no hesitation in charging the tax on the £110.  That would be the cash received by him and it would, therefore, be taxable.  It would be very much the same type of deal in respect of a retailer charging £110.  He could pass the article on to the hire-purchaser for £100 and they could sell it to the eventual purchaser, say, for £110 in 12 monthly instalments. I am not sure whether that would be the right price but let us say that was the position.  Therefore, we are logical in the way we approach this and say that the tax will be put on the hire-purchaser at whatever he gets for an article, less what is already paid by the retailer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>With great respect, I think the Minister misunderstands the actual position at the beginning of the transaction.  As I understand it, the retailer sells the article to the hire-purchase company, and at that point there is a sale.  The hire-purchase company says to the hirer: &ldquo;You may hire this article with the option to purchase it,&rdquo; at certain monthly rates which are part of the repayment of the original price, part interest charges and part services provided by the company. <Col N="1395" /> There is an actual sale to the hire-purchase company but there is no sale to the purchaser.  There is no question of an element of hire-purchase at that point until the hirer gets it with the option to purchase.</P>
      <P>There is a distinct difference between that position and the position where the retailer says: &ldquo;You may buy your motorcar or washing machine or wireless set at a certain price.&rdquo;  The retailer in fact receives £110.  In a hire-purchase transaction, the retailer receives the same price as he would receive if he were selling for cash.  The transaction is no different from a banking transaction or a moneylending transaction.</P>

I said I was quite prepared to listen to further arguments on this matter and, if I am convinced the Senator is right, I have power to make concessions where I think concessions are warranted.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 7:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1396" /> To add at the end: &ldquo;Provision of services and entertainment provided by the Royal Zoological Society of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I set down this recommendation because it appears to me that the Zoological Society stands in a peculiar position in relation to our cultural life. It is a national asset.  We have only one Zoological Society and it seems to me that it should be wholly exempt from the turnover tax.  Since I put down the recommendation, it has been whispered to me that the Minister is prepared to make some concessions but I would like to ask him if he would consider making a concession to the Society in respect of all its proceeds. I had a look at the accounts of the Society for last year and it is calculated that if all the proceeds were taken into account for turnover tax, there would be about £2,200 payable on receipts from members' subscriptions, entrance charges, services provided by the restaurant and so on.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the scale, the Government already grant £1,500 a year to the Zoological Society through the Department of Education and there has always been an annual grant from that Department.  They appreciate it to be an educational and cultural asset. It seems pointless to me to charge turnover tax on any portion of the proceeds of that Society and then find an appeal made to the Department to have the grant increased. Would the Minister consider giving an assurance to the House that he will exempt all the proceeds of the Zoological Society from the tax rather than that they should be broken down into parts which would be liable to tax and parts which would not be liable?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ross on this recommendation.  I have the honour to be a member of the Council of the Society and I know we put a great deal of work voluntarily into making the gardens a success. The Zoological Society is on a par with a number of other institutions in the country, such as the National Museum, the National Gallery and others which have a very important <Col N="1397" /> part to play in the educational system of the country.  These other institutions are run by the Government or by some local authority and, therefore, the cost of running them falls entirely on the State; but in the case of the Zoological Society, the only charge which falls on the State is the £1,500 grant which I believe was increased to this figure this year for the first time.  It was usually £1,000.  This is the sum which is produced yearly by the State for the Zoological Society and it is the only extent to which the State is at a loss for the enormous educational value of this organisation to children and adults.</P>
      <P>The Zoological Gardens have a very important value where the tourist traffic of the country is concerned.  A very large number of people come there who are visitors to Dublin.  They enjoy the gardens and they are part of our tourist traffic so that the Society is also contributing to that extent. The Department of Education, in conjunction with CIE have been organising trips from various parts of the country, from the west and south-west, to bring school children in large parties to the gardens.</P>
      <P>The income of the Society comes mainly from members' subscriptions and from catering which is done in two sections, the provision of lunches and snacks for visitors and the dances and entertainments which are run in the hope of producing some profit which is ploughed into the income of the Society and goes towards the purchase of animals and the payment of staff.  If we cannot make ends meet, we will have to ask for an increase in the grant given by the Government or cut down on some of the activities of the Society.  Cutting down on the activities of such a Society is a sort of folding-up process because if you cut down it means that fewer people will come to the gardens and so the income will continue to decrease.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Ross in putting it to the Minister that this organisation is in a special position and that it is doing work of sufficient importance to warrant its receiving special consideration in this regard.</P>

      <P>I should like to put it to the Minister, in support of the recommendation, that if the Royal Zoological Society of Ireland did not exist, it would be necessary for the State to institute something of a similar nature.  If the Society were to collapse, the onus would fall on the State to fill the gap.  It should be treated as something that is of an educational nature and something that has a national purpose.  The Dublin Zoo has a reputation which extends far outside the country and for that reason, I support Senator Ross's recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the recommendation.  I should like to say that the imposition of the turnover tax on the takings of the Zoological Society demonstrates, if any demonstration were needed, the absurdity of this tax. The Zoo, as has been pointed out, is an educational amenity.  It is a tourist attraction.  It is something that is being carried on by voluntary effort. I am sure the Minister would like to exempt the Zoo from this tax.  As I say, it demonstrates the absurdity of the tax.  When you think that you have the takings of what is really a voluntary effort such as the Zoo, being taxed, on one hand, and food being taxed, on the other, it is very difficult to see how members on the opposite side of the House can so wholeheartedly support this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, educational activities are exempt from the tax and therefore I would have no hesitation in saying that admission charges to the Zoo will be free of tax.  Subscriptions and members' fees will also be exempt but there is one reservation I must make, that is, the restaurant, because the restaurant is a trading business. It is there for the sale of food.  Other restaurants are taxed and therefore I am afraid that this restaurant must be taxed, too, because if prices in restaurants go up generally as a result of this tax, it might be claimed that it was leading to unfair competition if the Zoo restaurant were exempt.  I do not think there are any activities in the Zoo where the tax would apply, other than the restaurant.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately I have not got the accounts with me but so far as I remember, the restaurant takings were about £31,000 or £32,000 last year so that the tax would be around £800.  I wonder could I get the Minister to stretch his generosity?  I know that it is trading but they make a very small profit, I think it was under £2,000, and if they have to pay £800 turnover tax to the Minister, they will have to come back to the Minister for Education and ask for a grant of £2,300.  Could the Minister not stretch a point and be generous?  It is really a very small amount of tax.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Senator Ross.  The Minister has made a very generous gesture and should not spoil it for £800.  The trading is designed to provide income for the Zoological Gardens and I feel he should go the whole hog and exempt the trading in the restaurant as well.  The Zoological Gardens provide immense pleasure for young people. They are highly educational and the Minister should go the whole way in the matter.</P>

      <P>Trading in the restaurant is not really to provide income. We run the restaurant primarily to enable children who have come there in the morning or early afternoon to have tea or a meal because there is no other place anywhere near the Zoo where they can get food.  If we did not provide the restaurant, these children, and visitors generally, would have to go into the city to obtain food and therefore would have to cut short their visit.  It is really an amenity rather than a trade.</P>

      <P>I should like to support this recommendation.  Even if the restaurant succeeds in making a profit of £2,000, anything obtained in the way of taxation will have to be got elsewhere.  Either admission fees or the annual subscription will have to be increased.  I certainly would ask the Minister to consider this.  This is really part of the outing and it is very hard to draw the line between looking at the animals in their cages and having tea.  As an old member of the Zoological <Col N="1400" /> Society, I must say that the Minister might stretch a point in its favour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that it is not easy to consider a matter like this because the restaurant is a trading concern in competition with other restaurants.  It has been contended here generally by Senators that this tax will be passed on.  I think that is true, that it will be passed on.  I presume other restaurants in the city will be putting up their prices slightly in order to meet this tax and it will be possible for the Zoo to do the same, as far as the restaurant is concerned.  I might say that although it might appear silly to say: &ldquo;We will take the £800 from you and you may go to the Minister for Education and make your case,&rdquo; I am afraid that is the way it must be done.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the Society is in competition with other restaurants.  It is not.  The experience of everybody is that this is an amenity and a means of giving a full day's outing, particularly to children.  This has been my experience. You bring children to the Zoo and they can have a full day's outing, due to the fact that the restaurant exists within the gardens.  If the restaurant were to close down, it would mean the visits would have to be contracted.  I would ask the Minister&mdash;possibly now in the atmosphere of this House when the Minister is tired at the end of the session is not the time to ask him&mdash;to look at this point again the next day he is feeling in a really good humour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say that the catering activites of the Zoo are divided into two sections: the provision of meals in the restaurant, lunches, teas and so on, for visitors who have paid at the turnstiles, and for members and the immediate guests of members.  If they did not have this amenity they would have to cut short their visit or bring their sandwiches, and so on, with them.  This is a recent activity.  We certainly do make use of our catering activities for this other type of activity which Senator Ó Maoláin has mentioned, namely, wedding breakfasts.  We have a popular dance each year and we have other dances throughtout the winter.  Money is charged.  Of course, there is a fee for coming to these dances and suppers and the profits there go to the society. Perhaps the Minister would care to look at these two sections of the catering activity separately.  I think we would have a very strong case for the maintenance of our amenity free of this tax.  I do not know what he would say about the other.  We might easily have to pay a sum of money in respect of the other part to him on the tax and ask for it back from the Minister for Education.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 8:</P>
      <P>To add at the end:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Sales of books.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I put down this recommendation to add to the schedule of exemptions the sales of books&mdash;in practical support, I hope, of Senator O'Brien's suggestion on the Second Reading that the Minister should exempt books from the turnover tax.</P>
      <P>At the end of the Second Reading, the Minister told us that, when considering the turnover tax, the two countries he and his advisers had looked at most closely were the United States and Sweden.  It is interesting that both of these countries exempt books from sales tax completely. There are numerous precedents in other countries for the exemption of books from sales tax or turnover tax&mdash;Norway, Switzerland, Finland and recently Ceylon which has brought in a 10 per cent sales tax has exempted books.  So has Canada.  Even during the very worst period of the war, when the British introduced a purchase tax, they put no tax on books.</P>
      <P>I believe that one of the difficulties which the Minister's advisers have in relation to the exemption of books from this Schedule is that it would be difficult to administer an exemption for books in a store which was selling, say, a number of other commodities besides books.  I do not think that should present too much of an administrative difficulty.</P>
      <P>Even the First Schedule itself has a number of cases in which the trader must make out separate accounts. Therefore, I should like to ask the Minister to consider this last point.  It concerns me very much that in an age when people are listening to the wireless, are going to the cinema, and are constantly looking at television, ideas are planted in their minds without their having to make any real mental effort or, if they make it, it is very much more difficult for them to do so than if they read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However small the amount of a 2½ per cent tax on the sale of books, it <Col N="1403" /> is to me a tax on reading and learning. My feeling is that apart from the reading of novels, fewer books are being read today and there is a greater temptation not to read books than there was ever before.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to exempt books from this tax.  If he does not feel he can exempt books as such from the tax, perhaps, he would consider exempting educational books because the cost of educational books is constantly rising.  Even for the primary school, the cost of books is something which parents have to bear.  However, when it gets to the stage of technical education, university education and professional education, the cost of text books increases with almost every month that goes by.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that those who cannot afford books can go to the public libraries.  I do not believe this is so.  In my experience, I have never found that going to public libraries constantly for books is practical.  If you are a student, you must have certain books beside you.  All books for post-secondary education are very expensive indeed.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter along the lines of this recommendation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this recommendation from the point of view of school books and text books.  If this recommendation is not accepted it means that would-be scholars, and scholars, are paying a double taxation here in a sense.  They have to pay for their food and everything of that kind and also for books that the normal person in the country will not be reading.  It is putting a tax on learning for school books and text books.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of practical politics, I can see that there is very little chance of changing the point at this stage. Therefore, I would urge the Minister to put it to the Minister for Education that, perhaps, next year he would find some means of making it easier for schools to purchase text books, particularly, and also, perhaps, universities to purchase text books.  The fact is&mdash; this will come up more properly on the <Col N="1404" /> next Bill, perhaps&mdash;that in Northern Ireland and across the water text books and school books are free.  It is a little hard when school children or parents have to pay for books in this country, which they would not have to do elsewhere, if they have to pay another 2½ per cent.  There is something of a grievance here.  I hope the Minister will do his best to meet it.</P>

I would not go as far as Senator Ross has suggested that reading books should be exempted from this turnover tax.

I think he has the power to make an Order to that effect.</P>

      <P>I would make a special appeal to the Minister at least to consider text books for primary schools and vocational schools.  The sixth class boy is in the position that his books cost him in the region of 35/- to £2.  If he gets the books he really requires in the sixth class, another 2½ per cent on the cost may not look big but still the difficulty is to get that amount from the parent for the child.  Teachers find they get the money in dribs and drabs.  They must wait for it because people find it hard to get 30/-.  This morning I got a note from Messrs.  Browne &amp; Nolan telling me that orders supplied on credit after the 1st August, 1963 will be subject to 2½ per cent tax unless paid for before the 31st October and that orders supplied for cash or on credit after the 1st November, 1963 will be subject to tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make a very strong plea to the Minister to do something about text books for primary and vocational schools, especially.  In vocational schools we find the children of the workers or, at least, that has been the case up to now.  There may be a change in the new conditions, as a result of the Apprenticeship Act and so on.  These children's parents found the books were costing a lot, vocational <Col N="1405" /> school books costing up to £5 per year.  Any addition to that would be a hardship on the parents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one particular aspects of this matter that I should like to mention and that is public libraries.  Public libraries are largely financed by the Government but they spend a considerable amount of money on books and it seems very hard that they should have to pay tax on books available for the general public.  I shall just give one example. There has been a certain amount of correspondence in the newspapers about the Ormonde Deeds.  They were purchased by the National Library out of a very generous grant provided by the Government of £30,000.  If this 2½ per cent purchase tax was applied, the purchase would cost the Library £500 more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to support the suggestion that books used in schools should be exempt from this tax.  The Minister should realise that in Northern Ireland school books are free to all children at all levels of education, whereas here the only contribution made by the State is the provision of books for necessitous children, as set out in the Estimate, £5,000.  If the Minister had to face the position that exists in Britain or Northern Ireland it would cost the State a considerable sum.  It would be very wise to exempt school books from this tax as, obviously, if the cost of books arises any more parents will be unable to meet it and a very heavy demand will be made on the State to meet the entire cost of these books, as in Northern Ireland and elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a discussion on this matter with the Irish Booksellers' Association.  My approach was that you start with the newspapers which I do not think we can claim are very educational.  The same would apply to many periodicals.  Then we go to the cheaper novels which are not very educational either.  The difficulty is to know where to draw the line.  Text books would have to be included if we were to do anything about this matter. It is much easier to draw the line in regard to the type of shop dealt with <Col N="1406" /> rather than the type of book.  The people who discussed the question with me did not push that point, although it might have suited them. They mostly dealt with the type of book that might be regarded as educational.</P>
      <P>I am very sympathetic to this request for exemption but I find it difficult to know how it can be done. However, I am considering it very carefully to see if we can find a way of exempting what might be regarded as educational publications, including text books, and, at the same time, not exempt publications that are not, or could not be classed with the educational group.  This is difficult.  As Senators know, the customs duty is applied to periodicals coming in, including newspapers.  The Revenue Commissioners are required to give a permit for what may be regarded as educational and they find it very difficult to administer that particular clause.  It is very hard to get agreement on what is and is not educational. I might think something was not educational and the Seanad might think it was.  It would depend to some extent on our approach and to some extent on our prejudice.  That is our difficulty.

      <P>This Schedule gives a list of exempted activities among them being sales of earth, stone, gravel, sand and cement subject to such limitations, if any, as may be specified by regulation under Section 52 of the Act and sales of seeds, fertilisers, <i>et cetera,</i> subject to the same limitations.  What has the Minister in mind?  What type of limitation does he propose to enforce by regulation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The general policy is to exempt, first, building materials and, secondly, raw materials for farming. <Col N="1407" /> Fertilisers and seeds are certainly not difficult to define.  The only trouble is that it would be inadvisable to give a total exemption because a shopkeeper, who has very little to do with farming requisites, might sell a very small quantity, say, a few packets of flower seeds or, perhaps, a pound or two of sulphate of ammonia for some purposes. It would not be worth while recognising that and complicating the accounts.  That was the principal reason why we wanted to make some definition of the quantity that might qualify for exemption.  There would be no trouble about the ordinary country merchant dealing in feeding stuffs and fertilisers.  He will get exemption without question.  The genuine merchant dealing in these commodities has nothing to fear.  I do not yet know how this is going to be qualified.  The Revenue Commissioners have discussed the matter with me on a couple of occasions but I have not got a final recommendation from them on this matter.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, in the case of machinery, it was to be in bulk but we found that inadvisable because a very small part, such as a moving machine section, could not be used for anything else and I think we should exempt it. It is different when a person buys something which might be used for farming purposes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, such as a bucket. A man who engages in pig-feeding might buy six buckets but townspeople going in and buying a bucket should not, I think, be exempt.

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, it is consumer purchases that are taxed in this Bill.  Anything used for increased production will not be taxed, or anything used by a trader in his business, and that, of course, would include a farmer.  Lorries and tractors are exempt.  That is fairly obvious from the definition.  The vehicles not exempted will be those used for other purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Will five-cwt. vans, pick-up trucks, lorries, anything that can be used for conveying goods, animals or merchandise, any type of vehicle other than a passenger vehicle, be exempt?  Some of these, such as the pick-up vans and the five-cwt. trucks, are used for carrying goods, <Col N="1410" /> but they can also be used for carrying passengers.  In order to be subject to tax, am I to take it that the vehicle must be primarily intended for the the carriage of passengers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  In another part of this Bill, it is stated that a registered trader is entitled to the requisites for his trade free of duty.  A retail shop, for instance, would be entitled to a van free of duty because that van is required for the shopkeeper's trade.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a legal matter but its effects are far flung: this Schedule provides the type of execution order which shall be issued by the High Court or the circuit court in respect of a judgment for tax. If a person falls into arrears with his income tax, or turnover tax, presumably, and is sued in the court, and judgment is given against him, an execution order will be issued, directed in the first instance to the county registrar or sheriff.  If the county registrar or sheriff is unable to collect from the defaulter because he is, or has become, a pauper, through his own fault, or through circumstances beyond his control, the county registrar or sheriff has to so certify.  He sends the execution order to the local superintendent of the Garda Síochána, who is commanded to arrest the defaulter, irrespective of whether or not he cannot pay, through his own fault or because of circumstances beyond his <Col N="1411" /> control, bring him to Mountjoy, or some other prison, and lodge him there for six months.</P>
      <P>I know this type of provision has been incorporated in past legislation for this type of execution order.  I also know it is very seldom put into operation by the Revenue Commissioners. It was, I think, challenged recently in a case in Drogheda and it is now doubtful whether it is constitutional. It is very undesirable that one should try to get blood out of a stone and it seems wrong that an unfortunate man who cannot pay should be put in prison for six months.  It is not reasonable; it is not fair.  I should like the Minister's views on it.</P>

The powers are not extended in any way. They are as they were.  I think they have been used reasonably.  As I say, I lost a good friend, but I think the Revenue Commissioners were right in putting him in because he had the money but would not pay it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel very strongly about this, because I think it is fundamentally wrong.  There is adequate machinery for dealing with a person who has the money but will not pay. There is the Enforcement of Court Orders Act.  Under it a man can be brought up and an instalment order <Col N="1412" /> sought against him.  He can be put into the witness box and cross-examined on oath.  If the district justice is satisfied he is able to pay, he can order him to pay; and if he refuses, he can send him to prison for six months in respect of each instalment.</P>
      <P>That is only if the man has the money to pay but is determined not to pay.  Under this form of execution order a man can be sent to prison for six months irrespective of whether he can or cannot pay.  I violently object to that because I believe it is unjustifiable. It could be a man who was liable for income tax a few years ago and did not make a return, or a man who did not make a return but did not pay.  His circumstances could deteriorate and he could find himself in the position that, although he owed the money, he could not pay it.  Yet that man can be sent to prison.  It is placing the State in altogether a privileged position compared with the ordinary plaintiff owed money.  It is placing in an impossible position the person who owes money to the State.</P>
      <P>In a case like this it is no answer to say this power will be used with discretion or used very seldom.  It is wrong, and there should be a safeguard put into the certificate to the effect that the man is able to pay but will not pay.</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1963&mdash;Report and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Bill received for final consideration.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be returned to the Dáil&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to be inevitable that the Finance Bill of 1963 will shortly become law but it would be wrong to allow this occasion to pass without registering a final protest against it.  I rise to do so because, in the words of the Taoiseach, this Bill effects a revolution in the tax structure of this country, a very undesirable revolution, I suggest.  It imposes tax without regard to the capacity of the people being taxed to bear it.  It imposes a tax on everybody, a tax on the poor as well as the rich.  It imposes a tax which will equally affect the necessaries of the poor and the luxuries of the rich man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Early on in the debate on this measure, there seemed to be some doubt as to whether or not it would affect the cost of living, but as the debate dragged on in the Dáil and as we discussed the measure in this House, it has become clear, and has been accepted by the Minister, that it will affect the cost of living; in other <Col N="1414" /> words, it is now agreed that the business people of this country are not philanthropists, that they are not enjoying huge margins of profit and that if they are to stay in business, they will have to pass this 2½ per cent tax on to the consumer.  That is the first reason I object to this Bill, that it will hurt the people who are not in a position to protect themselves against it.</P>
    <P>It may be said that organised labour will protect themselves by demanding an increase in wages.  That may be so. It is, in fact, my opinion that that will happen, but there are very many people throughout the length and breadth of the country who have to buy food, clothes, boots and other necessaries of life, who will not be able to protect themselves against this iniquitous tax on the very existence of mankind in this country.  It has been stated that up to now there has been no rebellion from anybody except the organised traders, but I venture to suggest that it will not be long after the 1st November until you have a universal outcry against the tax and a demand for increased wages all over the country.</P>
    <P>In fact, it is not correct to say that there has been no protest on a general line against the tax.  I must again refer to the by-election in the largest constituency in the country.  The people there in no uncertain way by a vote of two to one registered a protest against the tax.  In fact, the Government know perfectly well that this tax is not acceptable to the people of this country because on the Fifth and Final Stage of the Bill in the Dáil the Taoiseach used language which meant, in effect, that he believed that if the Government fell on this measure and went to the country they would be hopelessly beaten.  I think that is a fair summary of the Taoiseach's speech in the Dáil.  I can quote it if necessary.  On the 17th of this month he said that if the Government fell on this measure the result would be that there would be unstable government for a long time.  I do not accept that in its literal sense.  I do not accept it as an admission from the Taoiseach that his Party would be defeated, that he would not have a majority on the issue <Col N="1415" /> of this tax, that other Parties would have the majority.</P>
    <P>This tax is being imposed on the people against all advice.  An independent commission on income tax, after hearing expert evidence, gave its report and advised that some sort of sales tax be introduced but it made two qualifications.  The first was that exemption from tax should be given to goods essential for agricultural production, goods essential for industrial manufacture and goods for export, agricultural and industrial.  Food, particularly essential food, fuel, newspapers, books, household non-durable goods, goods already subject to heavy customs or excise duty such as tobacco and works of art should also be excluded. That was their recommendation; that a tax excluding those items should be introduced.</P>
    <P>It had a further proviso in its recommendation: the tax should be substituted for income tax or rather certain reliefs should be given.  They recommended a minimum relief of 2/-in the £1 in income tax if even that limited sales tax were introduced.  What have we here however?  An all-embracing turnover tax that covers everything a person has to eat, to wear or to use and, at the same time, we have measures to ensure that more income tax will be collected as well as this sales tax.</P>
    <P>The people who gave evidence before the Commission on Income Taxation consisted of professors of economics from three university colleges and each and every one of them advised against a sales tax.  The Revenue Commissioners prepared a considered memorandum and submitted it to the Commission late in 1957 and for reasons, which I have given earlier, they advised against such a tax as this as costly to enforce, difficult to enforce and involving too many people.  Therefore, you have the experts all against this and as far back as 1957 advising against the tax.  The people of Dublin North-East a short time ago registered their protest against this tax and still it goes through by a majority of one vote in the Dáil.  I do not think there is any necessity to labour further the turnover tax, which hits the poor <Col N="1416" /> person and hits the essentials of life and cannot be justified according to any standard.</P>
    <P>I oppose this Bill on the ground that it creates another undesirable precedent in that it makes provision for the levying of tax retrospectively in the form of corporation profits tax.  If the Government want to increase the rate of corporation profits tax and think it is necessary, they are entitled to do so, but the people of any country are entitled to know from year to year what tax they have to meet. When a business firm closes its books at the end of the financial year and has made provision for tax for the year which has ended it is entitled to say: &ldquo;I have no further tax to meet here.&rdquo;  The Minister, however, in reply to a query of mine on Committee Stage, admitted that under the provisions for increasing retrospectively the corporation profits tax, a company which has already paid tax in respect of an accounting period can now be called upon to pay a further five per cent tax in respect of that period.  That is retrospection, and it is a bad precedent.</P>
    <P>The Minister also admitted that under the provisions of this Bill very many limited liability companies whose profits for the year did not exceed £2,500 and who were free from corporation profits tax will now be told: &ldquo;We have changed our minds; you must pay the tax.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a drive to induce foreign capital to come in here in the form of companies setting up industries and bringing with them their know-how and some foreign capital.  We are expending a considerable amount of money on advertising in order to attract such companies here and to put before them the privileges and advantages to be gained, such as grants, cheaper labour, <i>et cetera</i>.  I venture to suggest that this retrospective provision in this Bill will far outweigh any publicity we can engage in to attract foreign industrialists here.  The amount involved in this retrospection appears to be £2½ million, and it is not worth it.  The amount being taken in in the additional revenue in this Bill is £14 million, I understand.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1417" /> There is another provision in the Bill which I violently oppose because it is quite unsettling to the people of this country, that is, the provision which coerces the commercial banks into disclosing the business of their depositors to the Revenue Commissioners. A lot of us here have knowledge in one way or another in dealing with the ordinary countryman, and we know from our experience that he wants to keep his business private.  We know that he has a considerable amount of money on deposit in the banks because he thinks it is the only place he can put it where it will not be known to his neighbours and to the Revenue Commissioners.  I say that the provision in this Bill which compels the banks to furnish a list of depositors of £1,500 and over to the Revenue Commissioners is a bad provision.  Not alone will it put out of the banks large deposits but it will discourage the small depositor of even £500, £600 or £1,000 from depositing his money in the bank. He will refuse to do it because he will fear that his business will be known.</P>
    <P>Up to now, it has been very difficult to get the farming community to invest in Government loans or even to put their money in the Post Office.  The reason is that they fear their business would be known and that it would have some queer consequences for themselves.  It is obvious from that that money which would otherwise be deposited in the banks will now be hoarded in small or large amounts in the homes of this country.  The economy of the country in general will suffer as a result.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to drag out this debate any longer than necessary, but I feel that this House should and must protest against this measure on the grounds I have given&mdash;the turnover tax, the retrospective provision in respect of corporation profits tax, and the interference with the confidential relationship of banker and customer.  I sit down now after listening to this debate and reading all that has gone on in the Dáil and the Seanad, and having regard to the lack of intervention in this debate by members of the opposite side of the House, I find it indeed extremely <Col N="1418" /> difficult, in fact, impossible, to understand how they can support this Bill.</P>

We all know some can be wiser in their thoughts than in their speech, and that, in all probability, is the reason why Fianna Fáil Senators have not intervened in this debate. This Bill is about to pass because Fianna Fáil have a large majority in the Seanad and there is therefore nothing we can do in the people's interests to prevent its implementation. Our Party in the Dáil and here have done their best to make the Government and the Minister see the light of day, but unfortunately without success.</P>
      <P>Included in this Bill are two retrograde steps, two very dangerous precedents. First is the Minister's intention, despite the pleas in the Dáil and here, to proceed with the retrospective corporation profits tax.  That is a very bad precedent because it will leave the way open for some even more unscrupulous Minister for Finance to indulge in further retrospective taxation. The second retrograde step is the Minister's decision for the first time to tax bread, butter, tea, sugar, flour, fuel, clothing and the other necessaries of life.</P>
      <P>The Minister contradicted me earlier to say that Fianna Fáil removed a tax on imported sugar in 1932, put there to save the first of our sugar factories which had been described as white elephants.  Many people, many Senators, are dismayed and annoyed by the Government's resolution to impose this retrospective taxation which adds up to a clear levy on capital, since last year's undistributed profits are part of this year's capital, used to run a business.  Many people claim that this retrospective legislation is of doubtful legality under the Constitution and that, in all probability, it will be tested in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil and Seanad have fought successfully retrospective legislation of this type in the past.  If we look back to 1958, we remember the Minister finding it necessary to take steps in the Finance Bill against dividend <Col N="1419" /> stripping, regarded at the time as a kind of legal raid on the tax fund. When the Minister brought in his proposals, the Dáil accepted them then, on condition that he withdrew their retrospective effect.  There were lengthy discussions in the Dáil and the Minister had the good sense to appreciate the arguments against retrospective taxation, however right he may have been in attempting to stop that particular abuse at the time. He saw the light then and took it out of the Bill.  At that time, Fianna Fáil Deputies spoke against the retrospective taxation.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House believe Fianna Fáil have no mandate to proceed with this legislation.  In none of their published policies did they ever forecast their intention to put a tax on bread, butter, sugar, tea, flour, fuel, clothing, and if they had they would not be in Government now and they know that very well.  As a matter of fact the provisions of this Bill are directly contrary to their published statements and policies of the past. The only opportunity the people got of protesting was in the Dublin North-East by-election where, for every vote cast for the Government, two were cast against them.  That was the only opportunity the people got to show what they thought of this iniquitous tax.  They rejected it, and if the country as a whole got the opportunity in the morning, the people would reject it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect it is a waste of time at this stage to oppose the introduction of the turnover tax, around which discussion on the Bill has centred.  In every other year, the <Col N="1420" /> main debate has been on the Appropriation Bill, the Finance Bill getting through in a few moments.  The reverse has been the case in Dáil Éireann this year and I expect the same will apply here.  When I see the commodities exempted from this tax, I begin to think.  For example, we have earth, stone, gravel and cement exempted.  Food for animals is exempted.  Sales by farmers are also exempted because the Minister knows right well that there are no sales by farmers directly to the consumer.  The farmer does not sell milk directly, the consumer having to buy it from the shops.  The Minister knows this and knows that he will be assured of his 2½ per cent from milk.  Potatoes are not sold directly.</P>
      <P>The same thing applies to butter. There is no such thing as farmer's butter now: you must go to the shop for it and there you will pay the 2½ per cent tax.  People would not have opposed this tax so strongly, had it been a device to provide concessions in income tax.  Nowadays, Bord na Móna workers and forestry workers are among those who pay income tax.  The latter class pay small amounts, if they earn over £7 a week.  Bord na Móna workers pay a large amount of tax each week.  If they had been given some relief in income tax, I do not think their opposition to the turnover tax would have been so great.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooge recommended that butter be exempted.  Is it not extraordinary that our people who emigrate to England can buy our butter there at 2/7d. per lb. while its prohibitive price here denies it to their brothers and sisters, to the farm labourer who earns £6 a week?  That man has to pay 4/7d, plus 2½ per cent taxation. There can be no argument for putting a tax on food.  One thing the Minister has in mind is that he will not face the country this year.  He may face it next year.</P>

      <P>Next year as a result of this taxation&mdash;and the Minister will get nearer to £15 million instead of £10½ million&mdash;the Minister will have a few million pounds to play around with.  He knows that the public have a very short memory.  He will go to the country and say: &ldquo;We have done a wonderful job.  We have taken corporation profits tax retrospectively. We have taken 2½ per cent. Forget about that.  We are giving you a Budget now and you will not have to pay any more tax.&rdquo;  That is the way I see it.  For quite a long time there has been agitation to have people in the middle income group relieved of the 10/- per day charge for hospital treatment.  That would cost only £230,000.</P>

      <P>I oppose the final passing of this Bill which contains a number of highly undesirable features, the first of which is the widespread turnover tax.  I think a majority in the country feel that a tax on essentials is wrong.  It is scarcely necessary to debate that.  It is a remarkable step from food subsidies to food taxation, and that is what we have come to in a space of ten or 12 years.  Apart from taxation on essentials, a worse feature still is the uniformity of the tax.  When we find we have to pay exactly the same tax&mdash;an increase of 1½d&mdash;on a glass of whiskey, on a dance ticket and on a lb. of butter, it is shocking.  We all know there are some commodities <Col N="1423" /> that could carry a great deal more taxation, and certainly any tax which equates a tax on butter with a tax on whiskey is obviously wrong.</P>
      <P>The tax on a mink coat is roughly the same as the tax on a suite of furniture, that is, a tax of 50/-.  Perhaps you might not get a very good mink, but that would be the tax on an average mink.  There is something wrong with that equation.  Likewise if you buy a watch, or a necklace, or any article from a jeweller, if you are in the mood for a slight luxury, you pay a tax of something like 5/-, the same tax as you are now asked to pay on a ton of coal.  Again, I submit there is something wrong with that equation.</P>
      <P>Let us now take the question of travel.  If you are so patriotic as to decide to take your holidays at home rather than go to the south of France or Spain, you will pay turnover tax on the food you eat, and probably also on the increased wages that will follow from the turnover tax.  In short, the price of your holiday at home will go up.  You can go abroad with impunity and there will be no tax on what you pay to the airlines.  Neither is there a tax on the money you take out of the country.  Again, I submit there is a lack of justice in that equation.</P>
      <P>I do not want to drag out this debate but there are one or two other features with which I want to deal.  The next objectionable feature of the tax is the arbitrary manner in which it is levied, and the absence of regulation in the manner in which it is levied.  The shopkeeper is to collect 2½ per cent, and it does not matter how he collects it.  The Bill makes no provision for that, and the Minister has not taken any power by order to regulate that.  The worst feature of the Bill is that we are handing over to the chain stores a mighty weapon with which to completely destroy the family grocers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two and a half per cent is a small price to pay to put the local grocers out of business.  That is what will happen on the passing of this tax.  You will find the big chain stores advertising: &ldquo;We pay your tax.  Butter at the <Col N="1424" /> same price as before.  Bread at the same price as before.&rdquo;  The local shopkeeper will have to put up his shutters and then, when he has done that and left for England, the chain stores will charge not only two and a half per cent but will say that they have also to charge their own expenses and overheads and you will be paying four per cent or five per cent instead of two and a half per cent.  That is the worst feature of the Bill.  The Minister could have legislated down to the last detail to prevent the use of this measure as a discriminatory measure by the chain stores.</P>
    <P>This tax is claimed to bring in about £8 million in a full year.  A certain amount of that will have to be given back by way of social welfare benefits so that if all our future expansion depends upon £8 million in this way it is a very small item when one considers that we are raising a Budget of £169 million in the same year.  If the return from this turnover tax were to be £32 million or £35 million, there might be some justification for the extravagant claims of what it is going to do.  I say that we are now setting up this tax as a means of increasing taxation but we are also permitting it to be used in a very discriminatory and ill-advised manner.</P>
    <P>However, we can now do no more than register our protest at the Bill and hope that the many bad things we believe are in it do not come to pass. We hope that if the results of the Bill do turn out to be serious the Minister and the Government will not hesitate to step in before the family grocer has packed his bag for England because he has been taxed out of existence.</P>

      <P>Senator L'Estrange was complaining about the silence on this side of the House.  That silence was due to the fact that, having read the reports of the debates in the Dáil during the three months since the Budget was introduced, people on this side of the House felt that since Fine Gael or Labour did not reveal to the Dáil any alternative proposals to the turnover tax or any alternative way of raising the money, they must be <Col N="1425" /> reserving that secret weapon for the debate in the Seanad.  So we sat and listened to Senator L'Estrange reading out that long harangue which he could more usefully have put on tape and played in the ante-room where we could have listened to it from time to time.  However, even Senator L'Estrange did not produce the alternative or any evidence to show that the turnover tax would hit anybody unfairly.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinlan brings up the usual bogey man and I suppose Senator Quinlan would find himself in agreement with the statement made by Senator Fitzpatrick about the Bill when he said:</P>
      <P>The very existence of mankind is threatened in this country by the Bill.</P>
      <P>How Fine Gael could expect anybody to take statements of that kind seriously is beyond my comprehension and how anybody could be expected to place any credence in their statements when, during the debate, they have failed to suggest an alternative and failed to show any other way in which the money could be raised which would be as fair as this turnover tax is also beyond my comprehension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The turnover tax does not, as Senator Fitzpatrick said, hit the poor because the social welfare beneficiaries to whom he referred will get more than they contribute.  As the Minister pointed out, 1,300,000 are covered by this and the remainder of the people can well afford to pay the two and a half per cent.  I do not think they are going to complain about it either, despite the organised effort made by Fine Gael to get them to do so. Senator Fitzpatrick said that the tax was being imposed on the people <Col N="1426" /> against all advice.  Against whose advice?  Against the advice of a group of grocers who attempted to use political pressure to further their own interests.  I remember the scarcity during the Emergency and I cannot see anybody weeping salt tears about the grocers.  I do not think they are going to lose anything as a result of this and I do not think the prophecies of vast increases in prices are going to come true.  Competition will regulate prices to such an extent that not even the most rabid members of RGDATA will have an excuse for not charging honest prices for what they have to sell. &ldquo;The very existence of mankind is threatened&rdquo;&mdash; Senator Fitzpatrick should remember that expression for all time.  We heard quite a lot about majority rule.</P>

      <P>According to the Opposition, we have not a mandate to proceed with this legislation.  We have a mandate to govern and to ensure that the finances of this country are kept in order.  We have a mandate, through the confidence which the electorate placed in us, to ensure that every citizen in this country gets a fair deal.  That is precisely what this Finance Bill ensures.  It enshrines the Government's policy of a fair deal for all citizens and the Government's intention of ensuring that the social welfare beneficiaries of grants and schemes of assistance will not lag behind whenever organised groups of labour are able to obtain advances in their own standard of living.</P>
      <P>It is quite obvious, since we are on that point, that our social welfare system lags behind not only our neighbouring country but many of the more progressive countries in Europe and it is quite obvious that we must improve it.  It is obvious it will require money to improve it and if this turnover tax, which will not bear heavily or unfairly on any section, will bring in more money to enable the Government to bring social welfare benefits up to the standards which prevail in progressive modern democracies, it will be well worthwhile and the people will appreciate what is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we do not keep pace with modern democracies in our social attitude and outlook, then we will slip back, instead of going forward.  It is necessary that we should have more money to do this and this is one way of getting it.  I am quite certain that nobody with commonsense will criticise the Government for having taken the steps they are taking under this Bill, to ensure sufficient money is raised as painlessly as possible.  This Bill has been before the Dáil and Seanad for the past three months, since the Budget was introduced in the Dáil, and we have not heard one suggestion from Fine Gael about where the money would come <Col N="1428" /> from if the turnover tax were not introduced.  Neither have we heard any alternative proposals.  When asked about this, they have fallen back on the quibble that it is no part of the duty of the Opposition to suggest ways&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to comment on one point raised by Senator Ó Maoláin.  He said that the Opposition had been lax in not revealing their alternative proposals.  He also asked us to look to Britain as an <Col N="1429" /> example.  I want to say categorically that the British Labour Party have not revealed their future taxation policy. They have talked a good deal about policy but have not said what the taxation policy will be.  It is still a matter for speculation as to whether a capital gains tax, a capital tax, or some other sort of tax will be brought in under the first Labour Budget in the British Parliament.  The British Opposition do not reveal, and there is no onus on any Opposition to reveal their taxation policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it makes for good legislation to have recriminatory remarks of an extremely savage political nature used in a debate of this kind.  All our people are affected by fiscal legislation, whether Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or of any other political affiliation.  This Government, if they continue as a Government, will regret this legislation on three grounds.  They will regret that they adopted this form of tax which in many cases operates as a tax on a tax&mdash;at least double&mdash;and which of course will give rise to the easy trend of increasing it if money is needed for some purpose or other.  Secondly, there is the retrospective nature of the legislation which, while it might not go so far as to be not in accordance with practice, or unconstitutional, or come under any of the heads of legislation that are not in accord with tradition, nevertheless is an undesirable feature of legislation and gives rise to a precedent that might well be abused. Thirdly&mdash;and this is really the most important point&mdash;it will have an extremely bad psychological effect on our people.  It will make them live in what I might call financial terror from year to year, not knowing what is going to happen, whether we are to have a 2½, 3½, five or ten per cent tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well to say that the shopkeepers and those resenting this tax are afraid it will have other repercussions, that they will have to make returns which will involve them in <Col N="1430" /> greater income tax or even surtax.  As a people, our whole history has made us look unkindly upon taxation.  We have inherited that and it is extremely bad when a native Government impose something by way of a fresh tax without any relief in the matter of taxation.  This makes our people feel very badly.  That is probably the most important aspect of this particular matter because all shades of opinion will admit that it is a very long time since popular feeling was so stirred, and the protest came from the people themselves.</P>
    <P>There are accusations that one Party, the Party to which I belong, organised groups such as RGDATA, chambers of commerce and such people who have made an active study of the matter and have made their protests in an orderly way.  I think I am stating what is the truth when I say our Party did nothing to organise that. As a matter of fact, I think that, if they did, it would not have been such a unanimous protest as it was.  I understand traders of all shades of opinion took part in protest marches and even resolutions were passed by local authorities.  From that point of view, the popular feeling stirred up is as indication of the great resentment that is felt.</P>
    <P>Somebody has said there was no protest on behalf of the consumers. The consumers have only one way of making a protest, that is, through a ballot box.  So far, they have not had any nationwide opportunity to do so. While I do not venture to prophesy, I shall go so far as to say it will have a repercussion.</P>
    <P>There have been references to the result of the by-election in Dublin North-East.  That is a city constituency and in so far as the city is concerned, it is an indication of how the people feel in relation to this tax.  So far, we have had no indication of what the reaction will be in a rural constituency. Accordingly, from a national point of view, it is too early to make an assessment as to what reaction this turnover tax will provoke from our people, both urban and rural.  However, the House can be quite certain that there will be a reaction.  Whether it will be <Col N="1431" /> big, small or middling, is a matter which I am not prepared to prophesy.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate what Senator Dooge has just said.  It is not the function of an Opposition to disclose their policy and particularly their taxation policy, either between elections or immediately before an election. I belong to the school of thought of which the Taoiseach is the leader when I make that statement because he is on record as having gone so far as to say that.</P>
    <P>I dislike to use the label &ldquo;political Parties&rdquo; in this House because I subscribe to the vocational idea, however little it is manifest in this House.  I think that if we made an effort to subdue our political feelings in discussing matters of this kind that affect all our people, we would probably get a good deal further.  We had a very good example this afternoon in the course of the discussion of recommendations. Senator Ross and Senator Jessop and many others appealed on behalf of the Zoo.  There were appeals also to exempt books from the turnover tax and there was the question of hire-purchase.  I could not help feeling that these recommendations, having come dispassionately from a very independent part of the House&mdash;university representation&mdash;made the Minister sympathetic: in fact, he was.  I should imagine that if he had a free hand, he certainly would have gone a long way to meet them.</P>
    <P>It is in this House, particularly at this time, having regard to recent events, we must take a full hold on ourselves not alone in discussing the Finance Bill but in discussing everything else and make an earnest and true return to standards that are so urgently required in our public life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the word &ldquo;retrospective&rdquo;.  There are few people in this House with a more analytical mind than Senator Lindsay. <Col N="1432" /> I am sure that when he used the word, he used it in all good faith.  I wholeheartedly agree with him that, in a matter such as this, which concerns all our people, we should endeavour to give the facts to the people as they really are.</P>
      <P>An ill-educated democracy, a democracy which does not understand the principles of its taxation, is a democracy that ultimately will not survive.  It depends on how you use the word &ldquo;retrospective&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The very same principles apply to income tax, surtax and corporation profits tax.  For all three, the yardstick upon which you pay your tax this year is the yardstick of the profits which you made during your accounting period last year.  There is no difference whatsoever.  That is a fact that is beyond controversy.</P>
      <P>During the some 40 years this State has been in existence, the rates of income tax and surtax went up and went down on many occasions.  This is only the second occasion on which the rate of corporation profits tax is being altered.  The very same principle has been applied to corporation profits tax as has been applied to income tax and to surtax.  That is absolutely beyond dispute.  I am dealing with these accounts constantly.  I know there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever about it.  Why, then, apply the word &ldquo;retrospective&rdquo; to corporation profits tax and not apply it to the others?</P>
      <P>There is a very grave danger of misinforming and misleading our public.  It is retrospective in all three cases, if you will, but it is charged on the profits in the previous accounting year and the profits shown in your accounts are the profits you return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With great respect to Senator Lindsay, if he will pardon me, I feel it is a disservice to the general public to misinform them in a matter of that nature that has been repeated over and over again because one comes to feel ultimately that people will not repeat matters of that nature unless they are accurate.  It is absolutely beyond controversy that it is inaccurate.  That is the only aspect of this Bill with which I propose to deal at this stage.  It is <Col N="1433" /> only fair to the public and fair to the House that that matter should be put beyond doubt.</P>

      <P>I might be excused for starting with that sentence after such a long struggle to get the Bill through both Houses.  The Senator went on to say that the Minister for Finance had accepted the fact that it would affect the cost of living.  It is not true, as Fine Gael speakers tried to make out in the Dáil&mdash;I do not say Senator Fitzpatrick said the same thing here but it might be taken as the same&mdash; that I had come to admit that, because I said it in my Budget speech.  I said that as this tax&mdash;perhaps not in such plain words&mdash;would be borne by the consumers, it would therefore be necessary to compensate the social welfare classes.  If I did not believe it, I would not have tried to provide £4 million for the social welfare classes this year and whatever it will be next year. There is no doubt that I always believed this tax would be passed on to the consumer.  I believe every tax is passed on to the consumer.</P>

    <P>Senator Nash dealt with the corporation profits tax better than I can and I am not going to go into it again, except to say to Senator McAuliffe, <Col N="1434" /> who gave his excuse for not supporting the tax the suggestion that it was retrospective, that he must have taken that interpretation from the Fine Gael Party.</P>

      <P>Senator Fitzpatrick went on to criticise the provision requiring the banks to disclose those who are getting more than a certain amount of interest in a year.  It is hard to understand why any responsible Party should object to this.  If income tax is to be imposed, we can only make the burden equitable and fair and as light as possible on everybody by making all those who should pay income tax pay it.  If it is impossible to get the information necessary except by requiring the banks to give it, I think we are right in asking the banks to do so.

      <P>According to Senator L'Estrange, it is all right to do it when it costs only 5d. but when it goes to a shilling, we cannot do it.  It may be that it cost only 5d. at that time. Last year, for instance, the price in England was the same as here, I think; in fact, I think, it went higher at one stage.  Now it is almost the same again.  I am talking about the principle of subsidising butter for export in order to keep the price up for the farmers' milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McAuliffe went on to say that the Government were very anxious to hold out because they could hope <Col N="1437" /> to give very good concessions in the Budget next year&mdash;lower income tax and take some taxes off altogether&mdash; and then go to the country.  It is evident that the coalition Parties&mdash;to group them in that way&mdash;are dreading that situation.  They know that all this legislation we are putting through now can be made to appear awful to the people and if they could appeal to the people now, they might get a majority.

I do so for two reasons, first, because they have agreed to a tax which every country in Europe, and most countries in the world have found to be the best tax ever introduced. The experience in all these countries is that there is no Party in any one which would dare suggest that the retail or turnover tax could be substituted by some other form of tax.  The Oireachtas is, therefore, to be congratulated on passing this measure. This will be one of our major taxes in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Before section 2 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No pension or gratuity permitted under the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1963 shall be withheld or reduced except for a stated reason which shall be communicated to the person concerned and until the Minister has considered any representations made by or on behalf of this person made within one month of the communication of such stated reason.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give effect to a statement made by the Minister when replying to the debate on Second Stage.  I refer to column 1021 of volume 56 of the Official Report of Wednesday, 3rd July.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>As Senators are aware, civil servants recruited in the ordinary traditional way through a selection board are entitled to a pension.  The wording of the old Act may be &ldquo;at the pleasure of the Minister&rdquo; but, of course, we all know that these words do not count for anything and he is entitled to a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have put down this amendment because I believe the time has come to remove these archaic words &ldquo;at the pleasure of the Minister&rdquo;.  The Minister has quite definitely indicated that every civil servant recruited through <Col N="1439" /> the ordinary channels receives a pension. What this amendment asks is not that a pension properly due will be withheld but merely that no pension ever be either withheld or reduced without reason stated.  We are all perfectly clear, I think, that such an action would never be taken except for a very good reason and, if the reason is good enough to withhold from a person &ldquo;at the pleasure of the Minister&rdquo; in his absolute discretion, something to which that person is entitled under the superannuation code, then surely that reason is worth putting in writing to the person and capable of standing up to his written representations to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I am not inclined to go back over the Superannuation Acts to see what the wording may be.  I am inclined rather to deal with the practice. As Senators are aware, in practice, every civil servant gets the pension to which he is entitled.  There is no such thing as asking the Minister if it is his pleasure he should get it.  I see no reason why we should criticise the administration by an amendment like this.  We know that a civil servant, in practice, if he has reason to think he is not getting a proper pension, invariably writes to the Minister concerned, very often writes to me, and the case is, of course, investigated.  If a mistake has been made&mdash;I cannot remember ever having come across a case where a mistake was made&mdash;naturally, it is put right.  Those who have a grievance sometimes also write to a Deputy to complain, and Deputies get on to me. There are many ways of ventilating grievances and there is, therefore, no need to insert an amendment of this kind in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I think the change made in 1951 made all the difference here. In 1951, for the first time, unestablished service was counted for establishment as to half.  Before that, you were either established or not, and that was the end of it.  If you were unestablished, it counted until you became established, and then your unestablished service went by the board.</P>

If there were a small number of cases between 1951 and 1963 of the type subsection (2) now remedies, would the Minister consider retrospection in regard to them?

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (6) to insert the following subsection:-</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() In every case where the Minister or the authority controlling the approved organisation refuses to agree to apply to a person the appropriate subsection of this section the Minister or the authority shall furnish such person in writing with the reason for such refusal and shall consider any representation made by or on behalf of such person within one month.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that under Section 4 there is general approval for the transfer of persons from one part of the public sector to another.  I do not think there is any need to go into detail about it except that the Bill says it applies to persons who are transferred <Col N="1443" /> or appointed to an office.  I take it that it is intended to cover both those whose move from one job to another is initiated at high level and also to cover under certain circumstances those moves which are initiated by the individual himself?</P>
    <P>The position is that there is no difficulty in regard to moves where the initiation is by the employing authority, but where the move is initiated by the person himself, there is the point that, if it is still in the public interest for the person to be transferred from job A to job B, a good case can be made for the person to be allowed to transfer completely his pensionable service.  I think the Minister will admit that is reasonable in the public interest.  What I seek to do in this amendment is, in the case of any individual who makes this transfer on his own initiative and applies to have Section 4 applied to him, that he can transfer his pensionable service from his first to his second job and, in cases where this is refused, the reason for the refusal should be made known to him in writing and, if necessary, his representations should be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Dooge in this, but I would go a bit further by putting forward the principle that a person entitled to a pension from the State should have that pension based on his prior services to the State.  That is simple justice.  If in one section a person has rendered service and has been remunerated by the State, if that person should transfer to another section and receive remuneration from the State, there should be a transfer of his pensionable service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The excuse was put forward by the Minister in the Dáil that such transfers are often for the purpose of self-interest. There may be a wider public interest.  If a person is not serving the State happily in one section, it is far better that he should, of his own volition, move into a section in which he will be happier and, more important, in which he will be able to make a better contribution towards the <Col N="1444" /> efficient working of that State Department. Many people find themselves bottled up in certain jobs in various Departments in which they are soured and frustrated, in which they pass on their frustration to their colleagues. They may wish to opt into another section where they will be far happier, where they will be able to mesh in better with their colleagues and make a better contribution.</P>
    <P>The public interest principle is a far more important principle than the narrow self-interest suggested by the Minister.  National teachers, for example, have provided personnel for various other services under the State. Where a teacher is working in a school and has no real vocation for teaching, he is only blighting everything before him; whereas if he moves into another section, he might make an excellent contribution.  That national teachers who move into Departments of State should have their entire service to the State cancelled out does not seem to be justice.  We have, for example, in the Houses of the Oireachtas, a number of people who were serving national teachers and who came here as translators. Their pensionable service has been cancelled out, although they are doing work of an educational nature and bringing an expert knowledge of grammar and vocabulary into the translation processes of Leinster House. As a matter of fact, the former Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, when he sought a group to standardise Irish spelling and grammar, selected the translators in the Oireachtas for the task, and the outcome of their work is being used in the schools throughout the country.  The Minister was probably right when he said in the Dáil that theirs was a borderline case, and I hope he will examine it.</P>
    <P>Also in relation to national teachers, we find they are discriminated against as compared with vocational teachers. Vocational teachers do carry their service into State Departments.  I would appeal to the Minister to establish the broad principle that a person's pension for service rendered to the State should be based upon a person's aggregate service to the State and that no part <Col N="1445" /> of that service to the State should be cancelled out for the purpose of pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very thankful to Senator Brosnahan because he has dealt with the point I wanted to bring to the Minister's notice.  The number of people involved in this case is very small.  On the Committee Stage of the Bill in the Dáil, the Minister said that where a person transferred himself, the rule he has applied is that if it is done for the good of the country, we should count the service but where it is done for the good of the individual, we should not count it.</P>
      <P>I should think the Minister would find it difficult to decide whether a person who changed from one job to another did it for the good of the country or for his own personal gain. Generally when a person changes from one job to another, there is a personal side to it.  He must see an opportunity of improvement.  He will never transfer where he will have worse conditions than he had in the previous job.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said on Second Stage that one of the fundamental principles underlying the Superannuation Acts is that pension should be related to length of service, so that if one person serves the State for the whole of his career and another for half, the latter's pension should be half that of the former.  I agree with every single word the Minister has stated there but why does he select just one group of people?  These people to whom we are referring may not have been civil servants in the strict sense but they did serve the State and are serving the State.  These people changed their job when it was difficult to get translators in Leinster House.  It is a highly skilled job and although they had ten, 12 or 14 years' previous service to the State, they find that service will not count for pension purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of people involved is small and the Minister could easily include them.  We should be very grateful if he would do that and he would be doing only justice.  If a vocational teacher changes his job, no question is asked, whether it is to improve himself <Col N="1446" /> or not.  If a teacher becomes an inspector, no question is asked as to whether it was for his own personal good or for the good of the country. He will get full recognition for his service as a national teacher or as a vocational teacher.  However, a national teacher who changes from one service to another will be penalised and some sort of judgement must be passed on him as to whether he did it for his own personal gain or for the good of the country.</P>
    <P>A person coming from the teaching profession to the Civil Service will have degrees.  If he leaves the teaching profession within five years of coming out of training, he must refund every penny spent on him, because a teacher is subsidised while in training.  I would appeal to the Minister to include this small number of people who are really experts at their job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonallOConallain" hpid="Dónal Ó Conalláin Dónal Ó Conalláin">
      <NameTxt>Dónal Ó Conalláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support my colleagues here in their appeal to the Minister to reconsider his attitude on this matter of transfers.  Like them, I am interested in the position of teachers and I think there is no justification at all for not giving recognition to any one form of State service when a person goes into another form of State service.  I do not subscribe at all to the principle&mdash;if it is a principle; personally, I feel it is the negation of a principle &mdash; or rule of thumb procedure laid down in the Dáil of judging a transfer on the basis of its being initiated for the good of the individual or for the good of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who is to say whether any transfer is for the good of the country or not? Who will say, for example, that if a medical doctor becomes a Minister for Finance, his transfer from one service to another was for the benefit of the country?  The criterion that is imposed there is altogether too vague.  The fact that, on transfer to the Civil Service, service as a teacher is not recognised for pension purposes is indefensible.  If a civil servant who found himself developing a vocation for teaching after a number of years decided to enter the teaching profession, I suppose the position would be the same&mdash;that has not been cleared up&mdash;that his pensionable <Col N="1447" /> service in the Civil Service would not be recognised for the purposes of teachings.</P>
    <P>There is the position of a teacher who was a secondary teacher and who became a national school inspector. His service as a teacher would be recognised for purposes of pension, had he continued to be an inspector, because his service as a teacher is supposed to have fitted him better for inspectorial rank.  However, he reverted to teaching for family reasons after five or six years and now his service as an inspector is not to be recognised or is not recognised at the moment; I hope it will be.  I would subscribe to the view that Senator Brosnahan has expressed, that such transfers of service should be automatic.  There should be no quibbling about it.  If service to the State in one capacity is pensionable service, then if the person transfers to another Department of State similarly pensionable, the two should count as one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the case made by my colleagues.  It is essential we should facilitate mobility within the various services.  It is about the best means there is of ensuring that new ideas percolate around and to leave the position that superannuation rights can be an obstacle in the way of a person going from one organisation to another organisation is wrong. I think the amendment is a very reasonable one.  In fact, I would have gone further.  I should have thought that subsection (b) of Section 2 should be deleted altogether and that we should at least aim in future at reaching a position of maximum mobility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In supporting this amendment, I am conscious of the fact that the university position in this country offers the ridiculous situation that in the three federal colleges of one university, pension rights cannot be transferred within the system.  This is the worst form of it.  While this is a step in the right direction.  I do not think the Minister should take two steps where one would suffice.  He should rid himself completely of the necessity for intervening in these cases and let the pension go with the man.  Certainly he should <Col N="1448" /> accept this very moderate amendment proposed by Senator Dooge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment implies that a person should be allowed pensionable service, unless there is good reason to the contrary.  Section 4 has a different intention altogether. Section 4 enables the transfer of pensionable service only where it can be shown that the transfer will have beneficial results, apart from its benefits to the person concerned.  I think that if Senators consider this section, they will see that it would be unfair to ask the organisation to which a person transfers to agree to pay higher superannuation, unless they give prior consent.  That organisation might, if it were recruiting, get some from outside and some from the State service who would be equally good and there is no reason why they should be asked to bear a higher superannuation charge on a person who came from another Department.  In the same way, the Department, or organisation where he was working before should also give prior consent to the transfer if they were going to bear that part of his pension that would relate to the years spent with them.</P>
      <P>Section 4 as it stands is correct.  We are putting a burden on organisations and Government Departments regarding superannuation where they believe it to be in the public interest that a certain transfer should take place but I do not think we should put the obligation on them to pay higher costs of superannuation if a person transfers from one place to another without their prior consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it would be fair to make these organisations or Departments answer questions about why they allow superannuation to a man. If a person is about to transfer, he should put the question to the organisation he is with and ask them if they would be prepared to give him the pension rights he would ask in these circumstances.  He should go also to the organisation to which he is going and ask them also if they are prepared to come under Section 4 which would involve them in heavier costs <Col N="1449" /> in respect of him than in respect of a person coming from elsewhere.  He should, however, get the consent of both parties before the transfer takes place.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers only to the future. It is not retrospective in its application and it does not therefore refer to some of the cases mentioned here by Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither in the amendment, nor in moving it, did I in any way suggest that these transfers by individual initiative should take place without the consent of the authorities.  It says only that where authorities refuse the transfer of personal service, then the reason for such refusal should be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister has said about consent and the arguments he has adduced as to why there should be consent by both authorities are quite beside the question put in the amendment. We could argue for a long time on whether the Minister is right on this, but I accept the position that in his first movement towards transfers in the public service, the Minister is moving cautiously.  I think it a pity that he is not going a bit further.  In Britain, this was initiated as long ago as 1949 and in the report of the Commission which later considered the matter, the Priestly Commission, the policy was given that such consent was not withheld without good reason.  That is the British Treasury attitude, that consent should not be withheld without good reason.  If there were good reasons, the person who was refused should be entitled to be told: &ldquo;No; we did not consent to your transfer.&rdquo; There could be distinctions because the organisation to which the person was going to transfer could say: &ldquo;We refuse to agree to transfer your pensionable rights because it is not our policy to agree to a transfer regarding the particular grade in which you have applied for a job.&rdquo;  That would be a refusal for one type of reason, or they could refuse on the ground that the employment of this person over and above other people who were available without transfer of pensionable rights would not be justified in the public interest.  There are classes of reasons <Col N="1450" /> and the person transferring has the right to know the reason.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that refusals would be given arbitrarily.  I do not suggest that they would be given for other than a good reason, but I do not think the good reason should be stated and that is all the amendment asks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps they have gone further in Britain than we have.  I shall accept the Senator's statement on that. We are going only so far as to give organisations power to transfer people without worsening their superannuation position.  The only thing they have to ask is the reason they agree to the transfer, not the reason that they will not agree.  We are going so far now and may go the other bit of the road at another time.</P>

In many cases those authorities are distinct.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated on the Second Stage that he was introducing these provisions to apply to a large number of organisations.  He said he did not know what organisations it might apply to in the future and for that reason he did not want to designate the actual classes of organisation. I want to raise the point in this amendment as to which is the proper authority to be given power of amending a superannuation scheme.  Should it be the authority controlling the organisation&mdash;the board of directors as it stands in the Bill &mdash; or the management board of the superannuation fund which in a typical case would probably consist of representatives of the board and of the employees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that, under the Bill, the organisation controlling the authority, that is, the board, has an absolute right of veto over every exchange that <Col N="1452" /> could possibly take place.  Therefore, the actual efficiency of the operation of the board would be safeguarded by this absolute veto; but in the case of the superannuation fund and the superannuation scheme the defence of these funds is involved when a transfer takes place because then there will be a drain on those funds in one organisation or the other.  In this case it is only proper that it should be the organisation controlling the fund which will have some say as to the manner in which the amendment should be made.</P>
    <P>In the Bill, power is given either to the authority controlling the organisation by itself, or to the authority where it can amend the scheme with the consent of other bodies.  There might be an organisation in which the authority controlling the organisation, the board of directors, had no power to amend the superannuation scheme in any respect.  If we had such an organisation and it was designated under this Bill, the Bill, as drafted, would not cover the case properly at all.  I think that primarily it should be a body which represents both the board and the employees and which at present is responsible for the custody of the superannuation funds and their general running.  As it is, the board has its own defence in being able to veto each individual transfer, and the management committee of the superannuation fund should defend its scheme and its funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot contradict the Senator in his views on the law as it stands, but I am advised that it is not desirable that the law should be in the way he has stated.  The authority here is the authority that rules the organisation, like the board of an organisation or the Minister in the case of a Department and so on.  In these State bodies the authority, as laid down here, in all cases prepares the superannuation scheme.  There is no doubt about that. In some cases it administers it, and in some cases there is another authority administering the scheme, sometimes, as the Senator says, composed of a joint body as the board and the employees, sometimes, perhaps, constituted in another way, and sometimes run by an <Col N="1453" /> outside body such as an insurance company or an insurance broker.  I am advised that the section, as it stands, would be sufficient to enable the authority concerned to make a change in the scheme.  In all cases they initiate the scheme and produce it, whomever they may have given it to to administer. I think this is all right as it is.  I am advised that that is so and I would ask the Senator, therefore, to allow it to go through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am worried about is that what we do in the Bill and what the Minister does under it can cost public money.  It can cost the authority money, but it can also involve money for the superannuation fund.  If there is a superannuation fund in existence and the position is that there are a large number of transfers under this Bill, then the authority of the fund could find an increased charge upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>This, then, would affect the superannuation position of all the existing employees, because in the case of this particular fund whether it was done under an insurance company with actuarial advice or not they could find that the actual contributions they have to pay might be affected if the movement were all in one direction in regard to that particular organisation. I am rather anxious about the position of existing employees who could be affected if there were a substantial one-way movement in regard to a particular organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be something in what the Senator says about the fund being affected, but if we are thinking of the organisation which the individual person leaves and to which he has paid in contributions for the first ten years, he is not going to go out on pension for another 30 years.  The fund is going to have no trouble there because it will hold the money for 30 years to come.  As far as we know, in the case of those bodies we have examined&mdash;we have not examined them all&mdash;they are covered.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>To add the following subsection:-</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) Every regulation made by the Minister under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House within the next subsequent twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is to the usual 21-day annulment of regulations section, and I have inserted it here because I think the regulations made under this section are things that might properly come before the Houses of the Oireachtas. This question of regulations to be made in regard to transfers within the public sector is just as important as the regulations with regard to redundancy under Section 6 of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 4 there will be some rather simple regulations, for instance, naming the bodies to which this Bill will apply, which will be a simple matter, perhaps, important but with nothing very mysterious about it.  There will also be regulations some of which may be somewhat involved, for instance, cases of transfer of a public servant who transfers to an approved body and, again, from that to another approved body.  Where two transfers take place, it will create a good lot of trouble and calculations. The regulations dealing with that will be somewhat involved and take some time to draft.  I must say that if this had been put to me at an earlier stage, <Col N="1455" /> I would certainly see no objection whatever to laying the regulations on the Table of both Houses of the Oireachtas, but I think it would be a pity to hold the Bill up until October for this reason.  I do, however, give an undertaking that the regulations will be laid in the Library.</P>

      <P>Subsection (1) deals with the designation of organisations and there are several questions I should like to ask the Minister in relation to it.  He said he does not wish to put into a Schedule the organisations designated since the list might be incomplete.  Are the Defence Forces to be a designated organisation, are the various branches of the teaching profession to be designated organisations, are such bodies as the Irish Management Institute to be designated organisations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot really answer that question.  I could name some organisations who are, because we have their applications for transfers. Some of them have gone through, such as Bord na Móna and the ESB, but if you ask me about the Army, all I can say is I have not seen an application for a transfer so far.  It can only be decided when the application comes along, but I can say I see no objection to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>That is sufficient. We had difficulty during the Second Stage in regard to the Ordnance Survey when it was suggested this was a matter for the Minister for Defence rather than the Minister for Finance.  These difficulties would be obviated if the Army were a designated organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Ordnance <Col N="1456" /> Survey would be appropriate under the provisions of this Bill in any event.  I am told that is being looked after by the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the different branches of the teaching profession?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see any objection to that.  If a teacher is required by one of the State bodies as the most desirable person they could get for a job and they come to me and say: &ldquo;I cannot get this person unless his pension is fixed,&rdquo; I would have no objection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>You certainly can revoke by regulation but I cannot see any reason why we would revoke.  I think there is no harm in leaving it as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that goes quite far enough.  Unless there is a clear indication that it would not ever be revoked, the position would be somewhat unfair to people who <Col N="1457" /> might transfer from one organisation to another.  When people transfer into an organisation they should at least have some guarantee that that organisation is not only within the ambit of the Bill but will remain so, so that they could transfer at a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator need not have any fears that we would remove an organisation.  Take it that a person transfers from Bord na Móna to the ESB.  The ESB have said: &ldquo;That is the person we want,&rdquo; and Bord na Móna says: &ldquo;He is a very good man as far as we are concerned and we will not stand in his way.&rdquo;  The usual negotiations go on and they make an agreement.  Bord na Móna, having lost the services of that man after ten years will say to the ESB: &ldquo;We will fix up with you when you come to pension him.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my wording.  Supposing Bord na Móna and the ESB are both designated bodies.  Then take the position of somebody who wanted to make a career in a particular direction.  Once they are both designated organisations, the person can choose which organisation to enter in the knowledge that he could be transferred from one to the other. This would be present in his mind when choosing his career.  There are many spheres in which these organisations overlap, but if one of the organisations seek to be designated, then I think this exception of the individual at a point in his career would be rather unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Under subsection (2), the position is that a person cannot get more added years than the difference between his age and 65 years.  While I appreciate that the Minister wishes to go slowly in this first move in introducing this new redundancy scheme, I think this is a little too harsh.  The Minister should recognise that when a person retires with 20 or more years' service, there is not only the question of the pension which he would get if he carried on until he was 65 years, but there is also the fact that he is forced to give up work.  It is generally realised nowadays that forcing a man to give up work before the actual date of his retirement may be rather damaging to him.  There is provision in Section 7 for special severance allowances.  I should like to know if that would cover such cases as this?  Is any allowance made for the handicap imposed on a person who has to stop work before his retirement age?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the person who is retired because of redundancy.  If he is retired at 62 years, he would not get credit for the years between 62 and 65.  The Minister is giving him a pension, but he is making no allowance for the fact that <Col N="1461" /> between the age at which he is retired and 65 years, he is getting pension instead of pay.  At that age, a person finds it difficult to get supplementary employment, and he has to be very careful about the employment he finds. It is now recognised that nearly always it is better for a person to be working between the ages of 60 and 65 years. It may do a man more harm than good to release him from work at that age, and there is no allowance for that in any section in the Bill.</P>

Not many people are involved, but they are very anxious to know if that incremental service will be added to their service for pension purposes. Most of them will come out at a maximum age of 65 with only about 15 years' service.  I wonder is it possible for that incremental service to be added for pension purposes?</P>

      <P>The Departments concerned have been making representations to me for some time that they were finding it hard to get professional people.  One of the points made by their representatives is that it is impossible to qualify for full pension.  The group that I am most familiar with <Col N="1462" /> are the medical men.  A doctor is about 24 years of age when he is qualified and he must have had seven years experience before getting into the Department of Health.  He is 30 before he gets there so that he cannot get a full pension.  That condition militated against recruitment and it is to remedy that complaint that we are putting in this amendment.  It is really to help recruitment that we are doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to recognise that if we are doing this as a recruitment device we are going out of line with Section 4 of the Bill.  Under that Section if it is in the public interest there is power to transfer officials from organisations like Bord na Móna to the civil service. The position is that the most valuable people to the public service and the people we should try to get in there are those who have experience abroad. The Minister may say that this is, in effect, being done because the years of experience are allowed under this Bill but then the matter should be considered as being in the public interest rather than as a recruitment device.  If recruitment became easier might the Minister not then drop this thing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the intention to drop it.  It could not be done.  We found when we had agreed to this provision that we could not ignore the men already there.  A person coming in under this Bill will have seven years added for pensionable service and he finds himself sitting beside a man who was recruited three years ago.  That man would be in a worse position than the man newly coming in and in order to placate them we said we would give them half of their service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see that principle seems to be getting into the matter rather than expediency and I hope that in future the Minister will recognise that there is a sound principle in this matter.  Another point is the question of the number of years of professional experience required.  My experience when sitting on professional boards for the civil service commissioners or the local appointments commissioners was that there was a certain <Col N="1463" /> number of years specified by the Commissioners for a particular job but when the applicants came before the board the person who was appointed always had experience well in excess of the number of years specified.  The position was that a person who came in with the minimum experience specified would probably not be put on the qualified list at all.  I would suggest to the Minister that he might consult with the professional organisations as well as with the civil service and local appointments commissioners before he designates the number of years of professional service required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to go back again to the plea that this is a recruiting provision.  If the advertisement says that the applicants must have seven years experience and you get applications from persons with 15 years experience the job must be a good one.</P>

The Minister referred me to the Minister for Defence when I mentioned soldiers who got incremental service when joining the Civil Service but I would like to point out that they have finished with the Minister for Defence when they become civil servants and come under the baton of the Minister for Finance.  They have been granted four years incremental service and they will be retired at the age of 65, or whatever the appropriate age is, lacking those four years of service towards pension.  Would the Minister consider those men for full pension when they reach the appropriate age and grant <Col N="1464" /> them the incremental period that they got from him originally.</P>

      <P>I do not know if I am answering the question exactly but in many of these professions the advertisement states that so many years' experience are required.

      <P>There is a further point on Section 6 and this is the reduction of added years in certain cases with regard to computation. There is one point I should like to raise, that is, in regard to subsection (3) (b) where added years cannot be added both at entry to a job and at redundancy so far as to effect more than ten years.  Whose fault is it that a position is considered important enough for added years to be given on entry and then some years later it is found to be a redundant position? I think this is an error on the Minister's part and on the part of the employing organisation.  The person recruited on this basis should not be penalised in this regard.  An entrant who comes in with added years should not be robbed of his right to redundancy years.  It may be something which is completely unforeseeable that results in the redundancy of this particular post.  If the post is important enough for a special recruitment incentive it is rather unfair that this person should not be allowed the added years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should repeat the point.  There is a bar in Section 6 against a person getting more than ten years of added years but the added years are made up of added years at entry and added years to redundancy.  I put the point that it is unfair that a person who is recruited with the promise of added years at the beginning should be penalised in regard to redundancy which occurs in the future and which we must assume is not his fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is as stated by the Senator.  It was thought inadvisable that a person coming in with added years, if redundancy should occur, should be entitled to the added years for redundancy as well as the added years in his professional recruitment. It must be understood, however, that the person is not bound to go on redundancy.  He will be bound to accept another post so that he is not thrown out on the road.  He will have the option of taking another post or going out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>This in itself is a penalty.  It may be not as harsh a penalty.  Am I right in thinking that under subsection (8) of Section 6 a person who gets professional years cannot retire at 60, whereas a person who gets none can?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He does not have to go at 60 but if he does, he is penalised.  The added years are reduced.  He must serve until 65 in order to get them.  The ordinary civil servant who comes in at <Col N="1467" /> 20 and goes out at 60 gets a pension on the number of years served.  He may have a full pension because he may have served 40 years.  In this case, it is thought that if added years are given, he should at least serve to 65 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>

      <P>A final point on Section 6.  I understand the redundancy offer was made to the main class involved on 21st February and that acceptances had to be in by 31st March.  I understand there has been at least one death since and that in this case the person who died accepted the offer of retirement on redundancy. Would it be possible to deal with this case or does the fact that the Bill has been delayed and not passed up to now mean that nothing will be paid in this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The position as I understand it is that this scheme was worked out a long time ago.  I think legislative delay has held up the matter. I would ask the Minister to consider this particular position.</P>
      <P>Here was a man who had, before his death, accepted the offer that was made.  He did so within the time the Minister asked for it to be done&mdash;I would ask the Minister to see if any <i>ex gratia</i> payment could possibly be made in this case.  It is an isolated instance.  It does not recur.  The Minister will agree that it is very hard, in this case, that the Bill, in passage of legislation, should affect an individual's dependants who have been left without the breadwinner.  They would be in a better position if the Bill had passed before 31st March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill was passed to compensate people who retired before the normal time and will apply only when it is passed.  It would be unreasonable to try to make it apply to people who died between the time the Bill was agreed, as it were, and passed because these unfortunate people did not suffer as a result of the suggestion about retirement on redundancy. Therefore, the Bill could not apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The general question of an automatic correlation between pensions and the cost of living does not arise on this Bill.  There is a very strong case to be made for a person who is retired on redundancy that the pension should be adjusted to the cost of living or in regard to any increase in grading which might occur following his retirement.  The Minister intends to give such person the pension he would get if he remained in the Civil Service until 65 years of age.  As I read the Bill, he will get the pension at the time he is retired due to redundancy which he would <Col N="1469" /> get if he served to the age of 65. Surely, where a person retires to facilitate the proper operation of a Government Department, any increase in his grade, salary or in pension should be allowed.  Take one person who retires now due to redundancy and another of exactly the same age who remains on.  If there is a cost of living adjustment in between, then the man who remains on until 65 gets the benefit of that adjustment but the man who retired on redundancy does not. There is a case to be made here over and above the general adjustment of pensions.  I urge the Minister to bear it in mind when dealing with these matters in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Seán Ó Donnabháin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate Senator Dooge on the immense amount of information he has in connection with this Bill.  The explanatory memorandum dealing with Section 11 is clear enough to me but there are certain clauses in the section itself which I should like to have explained.  The section applies to veterinary officers who were engaged through local authorities in Dublin, Limerick and Cork and who had service which was not available to the State at the time.  These officers would be paid entirely by the local authority but the money was refunded by the funds of the Oireachtas so that actually they were practically wholetime established officers of the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>The conditions of service of those men who were transferred to the Civil Service, established, are actually the same as those applying for unestablished servants.  Half the period in respect of which they operated through the local authorities is to be recognised for pension purposes.  It is just the same as the Civil Service unestablished officers are getting.  Phrases such as &ldquo;if the Minister in his discretion so directs and to such extent and subject to such conditions as he decides, be reckoned as unestablished service&rdquo;, are a bit different from the simple statement in the explanatory memorandum submitted to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says these officers are <Col N="1471" /> getting the same conditions as if they were unestablished in the Civil Service during the period they were working under local authorities.  Is there any particular reason why there should be these provisions?  Are there any restrictions applied to unestablished men?  That phrase would indicate that the Minister might have some restriction on what they would have if they were unestablished in the Civil Service the whole time?</P>
    <P>As Senator Dooge pointed out, this is described as the Superannuation and Pensions Bill, 1962 and we are now well into 1963.  Subsection (2) of Section 11 applies to a person who is alive at the date of the passing of the Act, so that if a person&mdash;I think Senator Dooge referred to such a person a while ago&mdash;were alive at the introduction of this Bill and died in the meantime he will be debarred from any consideration?  For this section to apply to any of the persons included in it, they must be alive&mdash;they may have retired already or retire in the future &mdash;at the date of the passing of the Act. If such a person dies before the passing of the Act which is now two years on the tapis, there is no redress?  His dependants cannot get any consideration?</P>
    <P>Further, paragraph (a) says: &ldquo;The direction shall have effect as from such date before such passing as the Minister appoints.&rdquo;  Does that restrict the position of these officials transferred from local authorities?  They were permanent and wholetime in the local authorities and transferred to the State when the State had a Department in which they could work.  If these phrases mean any restriction I should like to have them explained by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>What Senator Dooge might refer to as archaic phrases came into this clause because there was a difficulty which I think we have now largely surmounted.  We have now reached a conclusion on the matter and I do not think the Senator need have any fear.  At one period these men were actually working for the Department but were employed by the local authority and it was hard to make a <Col N="1472" /> distinction.  Therefore, the archaic phrases were put in.  The intention is to take them as established from the time they were taken into the Department&mdash;about 1936&mdash;and that will give them good pensions.  The period during which they were with the local authority will be regarded as unestablished service and they will get half that.  As this agreement was made with these men some time ago, this is retrospective to some extent and the men who have retired will get the benefit of it.</P>

      <P>I cannot find the appropriate sections in the Bill and I crave the Minister's indulgence in this matter.  I am speaking mainly of ex-Army personnel identified with the Civil Service.  I hope the Minister will not look at the section of the Bill until he has answered my question.  Certain ex-soldiers qualified for and are now in posts in the Civil Service.  They were officers; they were entitled to pensions on leaving the Army.  Would the Minister explore and if possible remedy the position in which at present their limited Army pensions are being withheld while they hold Civil Service posts?  I do not want to be sentimental but they are soldiers who have given service and I think it is a great pity that the pensions of these officers&mdash;<Col N="1473" /> there are only a few of them&mdash;should be withheld in these circumstances.</P>

      <P>It is a departure from the usual fraction, the idea being that the person who is recruited to this post is likely to be middle-aged or approaching middle-age.  Therefore, you could not apply one-eightieth as you do in the Civil Service.  We give a better fraction on account of age.</P>

      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating the <Col N="1474" /> Minister on bringing within the scope of the Pensions Acts an old IRA man from my county.  He was one of the few in Galway who went out in 1916 and did his bit, thereby depriving himself of the opportunity of equipping himself later to earn a reasonable livelihood. He became a member of the Lower House and held his seat for some years.  Through circumstances beyond his control, he did not remain long enough there to come within the scope of the original scheme.  Through this Bill, he will now qualify for something. He is one of those who should not be forgotten by the country and I am glad he is being remembered now in this Bill.</P>

      <P>On this section, I should like to ask the Minister about the arrangements for district medical officers who have been compulsorily retired at very short notice.  We all have a great deal of sympathy with them and we welcome this section in this Bill, but I wonder is the provision adequate.  I ask merely to get an assurance from the Minister.  The provision at the top of the scale looks very good; if a man retires without any notice at all, he gets an additional 50 per cent. If, however, there is six years' notice, that dwindles to ten per cent.  That seems to me to be inadequate in view of that very short notice.  Six years is not a period within which a man could make provision for pension.  The average dispensary doctor might have a pension of, perhaps, £600 a year for a full period of service; an additional 50 per cent of that would be £300.  Ten per cent would be only £60.  That is a big difference.  If the Minister says he has gone into the matter and found that, in all the circumstances, this is a fair allowance, I shall be prepared to accept that, but, on the face of it, it does not look like that.  I should have thought that a ten-year notice scaled down by five per cent per year from 50 per cent to, say, ten per cent, <Col N="1475" /> or even five per cent, of the ordinary allowance would be more equitable.</P>

      <P>As far as my information goes, the representatives of the doctors concerned were satisfied, as satisfied as people like that usually are.  That is all I can say.  Anyway, they were agreed terms.  These extra terms were given in the case of doctors who were over 70 and who would have to retire almost within a year, or two, or three, on very short notice.  It must be remembered, too, that the county manager can add up to ten years.  These added years are also being given in the case of those who had to go out at rather short notice, say, within ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few brief remarks I should like to make before the Bill passes.  As a first step and as an earnest of what he can do with a limited amount of money, the Minister is to be commended on this measure.  On the Second Stage, we expressed disappointment that he could not do more, but he has, I think, initiated in this Bill some policies which will be of permanent benefit.  So long as it is recognised that this is but a first step and, so long as it is recognised that the second step must not be too long delayed, we accept this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say the Minister seems to have some rather quaint ideas about intervals of time.  In the course of the Second Stage, the Minister mentioned that the recognition of half the period of unestablished service for pension purposes had evolved only very recently.  The actual year is 1951 and I should have to think the <Col N="1476" /> Minister uses periods like this as his time scale.  The Minister also said that Section 4&mdash;a section we all approve&mdash;was something first raised when he was Minister for Health.  I think he will agree that is a good few years ago, too.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to look on this merely as first step and to ensure that the second step will not be unduly delayed.  This is not a matter of forgetting all about superannuation for a few years.  It is a matter of carrying on from here.  I sincerely hope too many years will not pass before the Minister brings in another Superannuation Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that I am in hearty agreement with what Senator Ryan said earlier; we are all grateful to the Minister for his patience and the good humour with which he has borne a heavy day here.  I am particularly grateful to him in that he bore the many inquiries I put to him with such fortitude.  If, in endeavouring to disentangle the intricacies of the superannuation code, I have been responsible for unduly harassing him, then I am sorry.</P>

      <P>I should like to associate myself with what Senator Dooge has just said.  I should also like the Minister to reply to the point I made. Why are these officers' pensions stopped because they are working in the Civil Service?  If the Minister answers that question, then I shall be even more grateful than Senator Dooge.</P>
