      <P>Senators will recall that the recommendations in the first Interim Report of the Joint Committee on the Electoral Law, were implemented, with <Col N="1054" /> minor modifications, in the Electoral Act, 1960.  This Bill continues the work begun in that Act by implementing, also with some modifications, the recommendations in the Committee's remaining reports, except those in regard to eligibility for membership of the Dáil and Seanad, which will be the subject of separate legislation later.  The Bill also contains some proposals not dealt with by the Joint Committee and applies the changes proposed in the Dáil code, where appropriate, to presidential elections, referenda and local elections.  The proposals in the Bill are summarised in some detail in the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with it, and this sets out also the principal departures from the Joint Committee's recommendations.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not deal with the Seanad elections code, principally because that code differs fundamentally from the other ones.  It has a different electors registration procedure, a different electorate, and a different nominations procedure and it uses the postal, instead of the personal, voting method.</P>
      <P>Before introducing the Bill, I gave serious thought to the question of whether we could get the whole process of consolidation done at one bite, as it were, but the difficulties were too great. The Joint Committee, I think, also recognised this, for in their Second Interim Report the Committee said clearly that consolidation must be a long-term objective, and it recommended specifically that the interim legislation, of which this Bill is a part, should repeal all relevant statutes in full, avoid legislation by reference and be self-contained.  We have followed the Committee's recommendation in this respect.  The results are a longer, but, I hope, a more comprehensible Bill than would otherwise have been the case.  The length of the Bill is further increased by the necessity of keeping the presidential elections, referenda and local elections codes in step with the modernised Dáil code.  I do not think anyone would question the desirability of this.  Uniformity will avoid confusion on the part of the public, candidates, returning officers, agents, and election staffs generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1055" /> The Bill sweeps away seven centuries of pre-1923 electoral legislation.  Most of this is obsolete, spent or otherwise inoperable, but its existence is a constant source of doubt and confusion. The post-1923 legislation dealing with elections is also trimmed very considerably. The statute law dealing with the registration of Dáil and local government electors will be contained wholly in Part II of the Bill.  The conduct of Dáil elections will be governed by Part III of the Bill and by a very small number of statutes enacted in 1923 or subsequently.  Presidential elections will be governed by the 1937 Act, Part IV of the Bill, and the applied provisions of the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Acts, 1923.  Referenda will be governed by the 1942 Act, Part V of the Bill and the applied provisions of the 1923 Abuses Act.  Local elections will be governed by regulations to be made under Part VI of the Bill instead of by the collection of Acts, Orders and Regulations, which contain the existing provisions.  The new regulations will be laid in draft before each House of the Oireachtas and will not become operative unless they are formally approved of by the Dáil and the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Not only has the number of Acts dealing with elections been reduced as far as possible, but procedures have been simplified and streamlined.</P>
    <P>At present, a person who is not an Irish citizen can be registered as a local government elector only if he has occupied property in the area of a local authority for six months (or is the wife of such an occupier) and is a British subject.  Under Part II of the Bill, every person aged 21 years or more on a prescribed date, who normally resides or occupies property in the area of a local authority, will be registrable there, irrespective of whether or not he is an Irish citizen.  The number of non-citizens affected by this proposal will be small, but a simplification in procedures will result.</P>
    <P>Further, the provision for the registration of Dáil electors where they occupy business premises, which serves only to complicate registration, will be abolished.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> The disfranchisement of persons as part of the penalty for certain electoral offences will also be abolished, and instead the more tangible penalty of heavier fines or longer imprisonment will be provided.</P>
    <P>The result of these changes will be that every person over 21 years of age on the prescribed date&mdash;apart from soldiers, certain inmates or patients in hospitals, county homes and prisons&mdash; will normally be registered where he was ordinarily resident on the qualifying date.  If he is a non-citizen he will be registered only as a local government elector.  If he occupies, for a qualifying period, property elsewhere he will also be registered as a local government elector there but nobody will be registered more than once as an elector for the same local authority, no matter how many properties he has.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for registering electors is shared between officers of local authorities, for most of whose functions I am the appropriate Minister, and county registrars, for most of whose functions the Minister for Justice is the appropriate Minister.  The Bill proposes to end this divided responsibility by making local authorities alone responsible for registration. To safeguard the rights of electors, county registrars, most of whom are returning officers at Dáil elections, will adjudicate on claims for corrections in the register.  This concentration of responsibility will enable some further rationalisation to be effected.</P>
    <P>Another step in the same direction is the proposal to replace the complicated arrangements for dividing costs between the State and local authorities by a 50-50 sharing of expenses.  The saving to local authorities is estimated, on the basis of the figures for a recent year, to total about £10,000 annually.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill has for one of its principal proposals the abolition of the requirement, dating back to the Ballot Act, 1872, obliging a candidate seeking nomination to obtain the sponsorship of ten electors.  In future, a candidate can nominate himself, or can be nominated by any elector in the constituency for which he proposes to stand.  Severe penalties are proposed <Col N="1057" /> for nominating a candidate without his consent and these, together with the £100 deposit, should ensure that there is no abuse of the new and simpler nominations procedure.  The procedures for ruling on nominations will also be simplified and, to discourage the nomination of unqualified persons, nomination papers may contain a brief summary of the principal qualifications and disqualifications for election and a candidate or his proposer may be required to subscribe a declaration that he has read this statement and that he believes the candidate to be qualified.</P>
    <P>The name of a candidate's political party will appear on the nomination paper and on the ballot papers.  A further change in the ballot papers will be the inclusion of a space for the official mark.  Short instructions to voters will also be inserted on the paper, including a warning to ensure that the paper does, in fact, bear the official mark.  This will help to do away with the particularly irritating situation where a ballot paper, otherwise valid in every respect, must be rejected at the count because it does not bear the official mark.  The instructions will also enable the long and cumbersome prescribed forms of &ldquo;Directions for the Guidance of Voters in Voting&rdquo; of which nearly 30,000 are used at a general election, to be dispensed with.</P>
    <P>Another proposal which, I feel, will be generally commended is that for the elimination of the pink tendered ballot paper given to voters who have been personated.  Although only a hundred or so of these papers are used at a general election, tens of thousands of them must be printed and distributed to presiding officers.  They are not counted except in the event of a petition.  The new arrangements will cut out this waste and will provide for the inclusion of the tendered ballot papers in the count.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to do away with the form of declaration of secrecy, of which about 60,000 are issued at an election for signature by returning officers, candidates agents, election staffs, and others.  The forms will be replaced by notices which will be <Col N="1058" /> displayed at all appropriate locations. The penalty of up to six months' imprisonment for breaches of secrecy will, of course, remain and there will be no relaxation in the precautions for preserving the secrecy of the ballot. In fact, the new provision that the number on the back of the ballot paper should be in as small a type as is compatible with legibility will strengthen the security arrangements.</P>
    <P>It had originally been proposed to do away with oaths for voters as to their age, identity, or whether they had voted already and also to do away with oaths for blind and incapacitated voters.  Under the Bill as it now stands these oaths will, however, remain and, in addition, oaths will be provided for illiterate voters on the same basis as for blind and incapacitated voters.</P>
    <P>The most striking change proposed in Part VII of the Bill and in the First Schedule is the abolition of the limitations on the amount of the expenditure which a candidate may incur or the number of persons he may employ in furthering his candidature at a Dáil election.  These limitations were introduced a century ago when the electorate was much smaller than at present, illiteracy more widespread, and means of communication less developed.  The limitations are now a useless anachronism.</P>
    <P>The changes made in the Dáil code will be incorporated where appropriate, in the law relating to presidential and local elections and to referenda.  A new proposal included in the presidential elections code is that for a special tribunal to consider objections at nominations, other than objections to the form of the the nomination paper.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill sets out to codify and modernise the law relating to local elections.  It is visualised in section 84 that local elections will be held on the same day throughout the country.  This should lead to a greater interest and, possibly, a higher poll than under the present system, which permits local authorities to fix as the polling day any day between 23rd June and 1st July, inclusive.  Greater public interest in local elections should be prompted also by the power <Col N="1059" /> to be given to local authorities by Section 83 to issue polling cards.  To curb the nomination of candidates who could have no reasonable hope of being elected, candidates will be required to lodge a deposit, the amount of which will be large enough to deter irresponsible nominations, but not so large as to prevent the candidature of anyone who sincerely believes that he has a prospect of being elected.  Of course, if his belief is justified in the eyes of the electorate, he will get his deposit back.</P>
    <P>To avoid a situation which has arisen at past local elections at which very large numbers of candidates stood for a large number of seats, resulting in the ballot papers being the size of a newspaper and the counts stretching on for days, it is proposed under Section 87 to take power to divide the cities of Cork, Limerick and Waterford into electoral areas by ministerial order, which will be subject to annulment by resolution of either House of the Oireachtas.  The Minister has power at present to divide Dublin city into electoral areas by order, subject to annulment by either House.  He can also divide a county into electoral areas by order and has, in fact, divided every county.  The boroughs of Galway and Dún Laoghaire will be divisible also in the same way as other boroughs and urban districts, that is, by order of the Minister.  Although power is being taken in the Bill to divide these areas, it may not, in fact, be used before the next local elections as I should like to see the effect of the provision for deposits which may reduce the number of candidates seeking election, and possibly render the division of some of the areas at least, unnecessary.</P>
    <P>It would be ungracious of me to conclude without thanking again the members of the Joint Committee on the Electoral Law, of whom seven were Senators.  The Committee did an excellent job in analysing the proposals put before them and in making recommendations for the general improvement of the electoral law.  I am sure that in years to come the reports of the Committee will be regarded as a <Col N="1060" /> milestone in the development of the Irish electoral law.  I think that this House could hardly do better by way of tribute to the Committee than to accept this Bill in principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill, as has already been stated, is to modernise and to liberalise the law relating to elections to Dáil Éireann, and also the law governing presidential, local government elections and referenda.  We on this side of the House welcome the Bill because I think the Minister in the Dáil, where there was a full and frank discussion on the measure, met our principal objections to the Bill when it was introduced in the Dáil and accepted some of the amendments and we are now satisfied with the Bill.</P>
      <P>In this Bill I think approximately 80 Acts of Parliament dealing with elections are being repealed.  The 1923 Act is to remain.  Great credit is due to all concerned with the introduction of the 1923 Act because it is still to remain on the Statute Book.  Perhaps it is a pity that we did not succeed in producing one comprehensive Bill to cover all elections.  The Minister has, in his concluding remarks, paid what I believe to be a very well deserved tribute to the Joint Committee which did the spade work in regard to the Bill now before us.  As I happen to be a member of that Committee, I shall not say any more about it but, at the same time, I thank the Minister and I agree with his remarks.  Our best thanks are due to the officials of the Minister's Department who worked so hard in producing this very modern and comprehensive Bill before us today.</P>
      <P>The Minister, his Department and his officials should also be thanked for the explanatory memorandum which accompanied this Bill and which enables those of us not used to legal phraseology to understand more fully what is contained in the Bill.  We can certainly say that, in the main, the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Electoral Law have been accepted, but there are a number of proposals the Joint Committee saw fit to make which it is not proposed to implement in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1061" /> Most people who have experience of elections will agree that one of the greatest safeguards against personation was the deterrent inherent in an individual having to take the oath. Average decent Irishmen do not look on the oath as an empty formula, but there is no doubt that it was a deterrent and did prevent a lot of personation in the past.  Therefore, I am glad to see that the Minister was prevailed upon in the Dáil to accept the amendments, and the oath still remains.  The Joint Committee recommended that the oath be retained as a deterrent and as a safeguard.  The Minister when introducing the Bill in the Dáil took it out.  It is now back in the Bill again, and I have no doubt that it will be a deterrent.  We will have, I suppose, fairer results in elections due to the retention of the oath.</P>
    <P>I welcome the powers given to local authorities to issue voting cards.  I sincerely hope that it will stimulate interest in local elections because this is badly needed at the present time. At present only roughly 30 to 40 per cent of the electorate vote at local elections and we will all have to admit that this is a deplorable state of affairs, especially when we consider that the county councils of Ireland are responsible for spending 50, 52 or 53 million pounds of the taxpayers and rate-payers' money or almost five times what it cost to run the whole country in 1922.  That is what they are responsible for spending and it is a pity that a greater number of people would not take an interest in local elections and go out to vote.  The new procedure allowing voting cards to be sent to those people may stimulate interest in the elections and I hope it does.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that our system of local government has earned a bad name but the inherent taint of corruption or near corruption has now almost completely gone.  We all know that for a long number of years&mdash;I do not blame one Government more than another&mdash;different Governments have passed the buck, pushing more work on to local authorities and more responsibility on to their shoulders. With the amount of work they have to do and the huge sums of money <Col N="1062" /> under their control, it is very desirable that those who take an interest in local government should be of the best quality and the fact that under the Bill they will have to deposit a sum of, I think, £10 in future when standing for election to a local authority will add some dignity perhaps to the candidature.</P>
    <P>The electorate, especially here in the city of Dublin, do not take the interest they should in local elections notwithstanding the fact that the majority of local councillors&mdash;and I think this can be said for the whole country&mdash;take a very considerable interest in their constituents and in the work of the various committees, health, mental hospitals, agriculture, finance committees or whatever they may be. The members of these bodies are entitled to our best thanks for the work they do.  They are unpaid legislators, as it were.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see a section in the Bill introducing uniformity at the counts regarding marks on papers.  Those of us who have been at by-elections know that in the past one presiding officer would allow an &ldquo;X&rdquo; while another would not be inclined to allow it. Now we will have uniformity.  Many old voters mark &ldquo;X&rdquo; and continue 2, 3, 4 and 5.  In the past, these papers were disallowed by some presiding officers but now, in future, we will have a measure of uniformity and agreement throughout the whole country and those papers will be allowed. That is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly agree with and approve of the provision on the limit of expenses.  Definitely it is time that logic should apply.  It must be admitted that there were fraudulent returns all over the country in the past.  Few candidates could keep within the limit yet returns were sent in stating that they did and it is a good thing that logic will prevail in the new situation.</P>
    <P>I also agree with the provision allowing candidates to state their political affiliations.  It is a new departure and one with which I entirely agree.  It gives the electorate a better opportunity of making a choice especially under our system of proportional representation.  It will also, I <Col N="1063" /> suppose, save the different political Parties a certain amount of expense on getting out specimen ballot papers, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>I also favour the provision on self nomination by candidates.  All of us who have been candidates in Dáil or county council elections in the past are aware of the time, trouble and anxiety expended when a candidate goes to the county registrar's office with his nomination paper and the time it takes to check the nomination paper.  The assentors', proposers' and seconders' names, the centres and the townlands must be exactly as they are on the register.  Even if the name of one of them is wrong on the register, and it is corrected on the paper, the candidate must take it back to the people and get the assentor, proposer, seconder and seven other people to sign.  Then he goes back and may find that some of the others may have made a mistake and back he must go with the paper again.  A lot of nonsense was attached to it and I am glad the Minister has introduced a new provision which brings the whole matter in line with modern practice.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased that the person has not to live in the area for which he stands in a local election.  I am glad that that system also is being brought into line with modern requirements. I would be in favour of the Minister doing something in the way of national publicity advising people of the necessity to register and to examine the electors' list to see whether their names are on it or not.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the number of people in all counties who come up to one on election day saying: &ldquo;I am over 21 and I have been living here for five, six or ten years, but my name is not on the electors' list and I have not a vote.  What can you do about it?&rdquo; As we all know, we can do nothing about it then because it is too late. Everyone entitled to vote should have a vote at election time if at all possible and a national publicity campaign would help in that direction.  There have been far too many defaults in the past and whether the new system will make it any better or not I do not know but I hope it will.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> There are many other matters which might perhaps be more appropriately dealt with on the Committee Stage. I have little else to say except that I think the time has come to allow free access to polling booths.  In many areas, especially in large urban centres, you have almost intimidation of voters, as they go in to vote.  People are standing in front of them thrusting canvassing cards into their hands, although the majority have their minds made up already.  An Order should be made allowing nobody within fifty yards of the polling booth.  There are certain rules and regulations governing free access but they are very seldom carried out.  There is no doubt that people are pestered and hampered as they go to the polling booth although they have made up their minds already and if the Minister did something in that direction it might be a good idea otherwise I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like with Senator L'Estrange to welcome the Bill which the Minister has now brought before the House and to join in with the Senator, as a member of the Committee, in paying a compliment to the very efficient and very keen staff which the Committee had on that occasion.  I am very sorry that the Minister was not able to produce a Bill bringing the whole of the electoral law up to date in one Act but I hope that we will sooner or later be able to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot altogether agree with Senator L'Estrange or the Minister on the question of the oath.  To my mind a person has a right to vote whether he is correctly described on the register or not.  I know country people who may be wrongly described, say, as Eliza instead of Elizabeth Jane, are very nervous about it, and I have seen them absolutely refusing to go in to vote because they knew that they would be asked: &ldquo;Are you the person on the register?&rdquo;  and they felt a lot of nervousness about saying: &ldquo;I am Eliza Jane&rdquo; even though they were the only person of that name in the townland. This oath is not going to stop the person who goes in to personate.  Such a person going in deliberately to give a vote he should not obtain will be prepared to take the oath too.  If he is <Col N="1065" /> going to risk that penalty, he will risk whatever penalty he may have to pay for taking the oath.  I am, therefore, sorry to see various oaths regarding blind persons and others in the Bill. We should increase the penalty if you like, but I should like to see the Bill without the oath.</P>
    <P>The only other question of importance I should like to refer to is the new principle introduced in this country of allowing a political party to be named on the ballot paper.  The Committee did recommend, as will be seen from the memorandum, that independent or non-party people would be entitled to describe themselves in five words.  That has been cut out, and if you are not a registered party you can only put &ldquo;non-party&rdquo; on the ballot paper.  The idea of putting a political party on the ballot paper at all was introduced for two reasons.  The first was, no doubt, to distinguish between parties and similar or nearly similar names.  But it was also to eliminate a certain confusion particularly in local elections.  In my own county I have known where you can get two people with exactly the same name in different parties, but you could also have two people with exactly the same name as independent or non-party men.  It is rather unfair when we have gone so far that we should not have some way of allowing those two to distinguish themselves.  In one local election in my county there were in each of two areas people with similar initials and names.</P>
    <P>For the Dáil election alone, I should like to inquire from the Minister if he thinks that a single man who before an election has decided that he is going to stand would be able to register himself as a political party.  I do not know what the definition of a political party might be.  The registrar is the person to decide, with an appeal to a committee of the Chairmen of both Houses and a High Court judge, but to my mind if I have one supporter and myself I am a party.  If my wife is prepared to support me I would be a party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>She might not agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>If I got her to agree.  If <Col N="1066" /> a person before an election is prepared to stand at the following election and has a certain amount of support, that person should be allowed to register himself as a party.  He might grow into a party, and surely if he has supporters he is a political party.  I should like to see some section in the Bill suggesting that nothing in it would prohibit a single candidate from registering himself as a political party, to give him an equal opportunity of displaying his aims, on the ballot paper, just as a party can do, and also in local elections to allow him to distinguish himself from another person of the same name on the ballot paper.  I am quite prepared to see even fewer than five words if the Minister thinks that that is unfair to a party candidate.  I am prepared to see two words.  To put them all down as non-party is not really carrying out the wishes of the Committee and I do not think it is a reasonable solution of the question.</P>
      <P>There is another point in connection with the matter which is more of a Committee matter than a Second Reading point.  That is the last day for registering a political party.  I take it that in the case I am mentioning of perhaps a single man or two men who might be putting themselves up as candidates they could be taken by surprise by the declaration of an election. The Bill provides for the closing of the register of political parties under Section 13 and for the sending of the register to the returning officer on the third day after the issuing of a writ. If a writ were issued today, can I register a political party tomorrow?  There should be some fixed day after the election is declared and no further registration then allowed, otherwise there will be confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point I wish to make is a small one.  A candidate can nominate himself or be nominated with his consent. In a lot of instances the Committee cut out the requirement about his consent because they felt that in many cases the returning officer would have no means there and then of knowing whether the consent was that of the candidate or not.  If the returning officer knew his writing or signature, he could say that a paper handed in <Col N="1067" /> with £100 saying: &ldquo;I consent to my nomination&rdquo; was signed by Mr. so-and-so. Otherwise, the provision is absolutely useless, and it could be left out altogether.  The fact that there was a lodgment of £100 should be quite sufficient to check any wrong, doubtful or frivolous nomination.  The only other point I should like to raise arises better on the Committee stage.  With these few points I will support the Bill fully. I am very glad to see so comprehensive a Bill as far as it goes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two brief comments I should like to make on this Bill.  The first is what I regard as an omission.  In Section 5 the qualifications for voting in an election to the Dáil are that a person should be a citizen of Ireland and ordinarily resident in the constituency.  I understand that the position in Great Britain for Irish people who go to live there for a while is that they can fairly easily get the privilege of voting for the House of Commons at Westminster. I wonder whether it is not a matter of justice that we should treat British residents in this country on similar terms.  If the British have given this privilege to our people who go there, in common justice we should grant it to them in return.  I imagine that this matter was considered very carefully by the Minister and the Committee. There may be good reasons in his mind, and in their minds, why no suggestion of this kind was adopted. But I think it is only right that he should give us his reasons today so that we may all be satisfied.  In the comity of nations to which we are proud to belong, there should be equity in matters of this kind.</P>
      <P>In my view the British acted with considerable generosity after 1948 in the matter of giving citizenship to our people.  I should like that we should not be behindhand in extending similar generosity to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the conditions for voting in our local elections are much easier.  In fact, British citizens can very quickly get votes, I understand, in the local elections.  I am also informed that British citizens are quite often empanelled for jury service.  They are <Col N="1068" /> doing a certain amount of work for our State.  They are good citizens; so I think we should consider whether they should not be enabled to become full citizens rather more easily than they can at present.  I know that these questions of nationality are very complicated. I should, however, be grateful to the Minister if he would tell us why we have not gone any distance to meet the British point of view.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I want to refer is quite different.  In this country where we are all trying to promote a better spirit of citizenship, and where we are all trying to create a better-informed citizenry, the Minister could do a good deal to help towards that aim if his Department would prepare a booklet of some kind which would explain the privileges of citizenship and the privilege of voting, which would also explain the machinery of voting, with, perhaps a specimen voting paper, and which would give something of the history of how Irish citizens won the vote&mdash; a hard and bitter struggle it was, as many of us know, for the majority of those citizens.  If the Minister could see his way to getting his Department to issue a booklet of that kind it could do a great deal of good.</P>
    <P>The kind of booklet I personally have in mind would be one that school teachers could use and give to the more intelligent school children.  It might also be the kind of booklet that citizens themselves might like to have and study.  Its main aim, as I say, should be to encourage better citizenship and greater respect for the Oireachtas, and generally to promote the aims that the Minister's Department is there to promote.  I hope the Minister will give consideration to this notion of producing an educational booklet of that kind.  If he is not prepared to do it, perhaps he might persuade the Department of Education to co-operate in the matter.</P>

      <P>I should like to support this Bill.  The amount of work that has gone into it is obviously tremendous, and the Committee who made their recommendations, and the draftsman are certainly to be congratulated. I was looking at the First Schedule <Col N="1069" /> which contains amendments and I saw that a total of more than 60 Acts have been repealed.</P>
      <P>On the general principle of the Bill I want to say that I support Senator Stanford in what he has said about reciprocity for British citizens.  The same idea was going through my mind when I read the draft of the Bill, but it occurred to me that there is a fundamental objection to both our points of view.  In the Constitution, voting is restricted to Irish citizens.  Therefore, if we were to give British citizens reciprocity we would have to amend the Constitution.  I should like to ask the Minister in that connection if he would consider whether at some stage a constitutional amendment should be introduced because the point is absolutely valid.</P>
      <P>British citizens living here contribute to taxes and to rates.  They perform jury service.  They contribute in every way as citizens, but they are restricted from voting.  The position is particularly unfair to them because the British generously give us a vote if we go to reside in Britain.  I should like to ask the Minister if he would let us know whether, during the drafting of the Bill, he considered that point, and if he would consider a constitutional amendment.  Possibly it is a point that he would not want to introduce alone as a constitutional amendment, but if the Constitution were being amended on some point, it could be brought in, in fairness to quite a large number of our community who contribute in every other way to the wellbeing of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>To a great extent I agree with most of the sections of the Bill which is bringing the electoral code up to date and clarifying different matters which were not clear before.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to something I consider is not as democratic as it might be.  In Section 87 the Minister may, by order, make changes in the cities of Cork, Waterford and Limerick, without any reference to the local authorities or the corporation.  That is a departure from the usual consultation with the local authorities and, especially, with corporations <Col N="1070" /> of such standing as the corporations of those three cities.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that a case could not be made, perhaps, from making changes and dividing up the cities.  That may be worthy of consideration.  The point I am making is that the corporations and local authorities are entitled to be consulted about any views they may have on such matters.  They certainly would have views in the light of their experience, and they could help to put the Minister in a stronger position to make an order along certain lines, if it was required.</P>
      <P>I notice in the explanatory memorandum which the Minister has provided with the Bill that one of the reasons it did appear was the unwieldy ballot papers.  That probably would be true but that is perhaps now being safeguarded to some extent by the fact that the Minister is bringing in in the Bill a clause to the effect that there will have to be deposits.  I think he stated in his speech today that he is inclined to consider the effect of that in regard to some of the areas where he may decide to further divide other areas before finally making a decision in the matter.</P>
      <P>That is something, of course, the effect of which we will have to wait and see but certainly the other point is something that is worthy of consideration. It is something that the local authorities, I think, are entitled to consideration on.  Their view in the different areas, particularly in the areas referred to, is that any views now expressed in this matter, or whether they have a view or not, do not count because the Minister under this Bill makes an Order and that is the end of it.  I think it is a pity it has been put in in that way without first giving them an opportunity of expressing their views in the matter.  I should like to hear the Minister on that.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with the other Senators in expressing my appreciation of the amount of work the Joint Committee put into the Bill, modifying portion of the electoral law and producing this very comprehensive instrument&mdash;the Bill we are now considering.  I had not intended to speak on it because I have not got <Col N="1071" /> any authority on matters like this. But, I should like to comment on a point raised by Senator Stanford and Senator Ross.  I agree with the view expressed but I think there is a difficulty which is so obviously insurmountable that it makes it impossible to proceed with it any further.</P>
      <P>You cannot really consider giving reciprocity to a citizen of one country unless you are prepared to do the same thing for another country.  In certain other countries this would create difficulties for which I cannot see any way out.  I am thinking particularly of the USA.  We have citizens of the USA taking up residence here in increasing numbers.  Of course, it will be a long time, however, before there are as many American citizens as British citizens but, certainly, the number is not negligible and it is increasing.</P>
      <P>If you reside in the USA, you cannot vote unless you become a citizen. Thereby, you relinquish citizenship of any other country of which you may have been a citizen previously.  Conversely, if you are an American citizen in this country and you vote in any kind of an election here, you automatically relinquish your American citizenship so that unless there is some change in the American Constitution altering that situation you cannot possibly have any reciprocity with America.  Unless we can do that, I do not see any way in which we can pursue reciprocity with any other country much as we might like to do so.</P>

      <P>This Bill is designed to make democracy work in the most efficient and effective way possible.  I am glad to know Senators are satisfied that it is a good Bill and I think all will agree with the tributes which were paid in the Dáil to the Minister on its production.  As the Minister said in his introductory statement, the Bill is based largely on the report of the Joint Committee on Electoral Law, which, itself, worked on a draft submitted to it by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear the reference to the work of the Joint Committee from the Senators who have spoken and I think it no harm to recall the fact <Col N="1072" /> that that Committee was composed of 15 Members of the Dáil and seven of the Seanad.  It was representative of all Parties and of the Independents in both Houses.  I think it well also to recall that the Committee held its first meeting on the 8th June, 1960, when Deputy, now Senator, Gus Healy was elected Chairman.  The Committee held 28 meetings and completed its work on July 12th, 1961.  The Committee submitted three interim reports to the Minister for Local Government, the first on the 17th August, 1960, the second on the 15th March, 1961, and the third on the 17th April, 1961.  The final report was submitted on the 12th July, 1961, and it was a unanimous report.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated from this résumé that that Committee lost no time in doing the job which it was given to do.  I should like to point out the value of such Committees charged with the consideration of Bills of such a technical nature and I hope it will be found possible in future to avail of that expedient for the consideration of many more pieces of proposed legislation.</P>

      <P>The members of the Joint Committee, although they were divided in political outlook, approached the task of giving us this piece of electoral law.  I must say, in fairness to all concerned, it was a most refreshing and encouraging experience to find such unity of purpose at every meeting.  As this is the first opportunity that presents itself, I feel it is something which should be put on record. I should also like to avail of this opportunity to pay a tribute to the Chairman, Senator Healy, for his thorough grasp of the job which was before us.  His intelligent summary of the discussion of moot points and his unfailing good humour were in great measure responsible for the fact that every meeting was a business meeting which stuck to the point under discussion and little or no time was lost on extraneous matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to join with other Senators, who have made reference to it already, in paying a tribute to the officers of the Department of Local <Col N="1073" /> Government whose wide knowledge of the whole subject was placed at the disposal of the Committee at every meeting and on every point on which they wanted information.  That knowledge was of invaluable help to the Committee in its deliberations.  As is known to all, the details of the Committee were limited to dealing with Dáil elections and it did not deal with the law relating to such things as local authorities or the referendum but I am glad those points are covered in the Bill now before us.</P>
    <P>I think that the outstanding proposals in the measure before the House are the inclusion of the names of the political parties in the ballot papers for Dáil and local elections, the nomination of a candidate by himself, the abolition of limitations of election expenses, new elasticity relating to hours of polling, registration of electors where they ordinarily register, institution of deposits for candidates in local elections, institution of polling cards by local authorities and the holding of local elections throughout the country on the same day.  These are all very desirable innovations in accordance with the aim in view and are, with many others in the Bill, more suitable to be discussed, should there be a desire to do so, on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I should like also to join with other Senators in complimenting the Minister on the very informative Explanatory Memorandum which was circulated to Senators and which, in my case, and in the case of many others I am sure, has proved of great assistance in understanding and analysing the proposals in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to support Senator Stanford very strongly in his plea for the publication by somebody&mdash;I do not care by whom&mdash;of a booklet dealing with citizenship.  I think it is appalling that in this country at the present moment our young people are leaving the schools without the slightest idea of the fundamental law under which they live, without the slightest idea of their rights as citizens, with very little idea of what their local government is, what their national Government is, what constitutes it, or <Col N="1074" /> what the process of voting is.  I think the publication of a booklet, as suggested by Senator Stanford, would do a great deal to inform the younger generation, particularly those who are now coming to manhood and who will be on the register in due course as voters, of not only their rights but also their responsibilities as citizens.  I think it is imperative that some such booklet should be issued as soon as possible, and I hope that the Minister will take note of this suggestion and bring it to whatever quarter is most likely to give effect to it.</P>
    <P>This Bill, as is obvious, can be taken to be an agreed measure.  It passed through the Dáil without a division, and I trust that the Seanad will expedite its passage into law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">

      <P>I should like to join in the welcome extended to this Bill from all sides of the House.  It is a Bill that will certainly be welcomed by those seeking election to Dáil Éireann and, more especially, by their election agents.  It simplifies the machinery for election to the Dáil in a few respects.  As has already been said, this Bill, for all practical purposes, gives legislative effect to the recommendations of the Joint Parliamentary Committee set up to investigate and report on the electoral law.  I certainly should like to join in the congratulations and thanks to the members of the Joint Committee for the very fine job of work they did.</P>
      <P>The fact that the Bill had such a speedy passage through Dáil Éireann, I think, in itself reflects great credit on the Committee.  I think the Bill would have had an even speedier passage through the Dáil were it not for the fact that the Minister sought in one respect to refuse to implement the recommendation of the Joint Committee by removing the oath which could be administered to a person who sought a ballot paper.  To the Minister's credit, however, it must be said that he gave way to the Opposition on the Report Stage and that very necessary safeguard against personation still stands in the Bill.  The Committee, the Minister and the Dáil are to be congratulated on the manner in which they dealt with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1075" /> The basis of our electoral law prior to this Bill was the Electoral Act of 1923 which for all practical purposes, remains intact on the Statute Book. When we are expressing our appreciation for work done in the field of electoral law, we would be less than fair if we failed to put on record the fine job of work which was done by the Minister, the Department and the Oireachtas in 1923 when they put on the Statute Book the Electoral Act of 1923 which has stood the test of time and which remains fundamentally the basis of our electoral law.  I say that particularly because the Electoral Act of 1923 implemented the provision in the first Constitution of this State which provided a new form of election machinery, namely, proportional representation. It was a new departure in this country.  It must have been a very complicated job for a new Department and a new Minister.  They did the job well and time has proved that.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in his opening speech that it was hoped to codify the electoral law and provide one comprehensive measures to which candidates and their agents could refer.  Some considerable progress has been made under this Bill in that direction.  It is a pity, even if it meant some further delay, that further progress was not made and that we could not have one entirely comprehensive measure incorporating the Electoral Abuses Act and other Acts in this one measure.</P>
    <P>I say that because this Act and the Acts dealing with election to Dáil Éireann have very frequently to be dealt with, and have very frequently to be interpreted, by people who do not possess any legal training.  Of all the election agents in any general election, I would say a very small percentage of them are people with legal training or specialised legal training in this particular department.  Therefore, it is very important that the law on the subject should be codified, and, while a move has been made in that direction, it is a pity that it was not possible to finish the job in one effort.</P>
    <P>I agree with the provision in this Bill which transfers the duty of compiling <Col N="1076" /> the register from the county registrar to the local authority.  I agree with that for a couple of reasons. First, the local authority have better machinery for carrying the job into effect.  Secondly, if the rate collectors or the local officials slip up on it, the elected representatives, who are vitally interested, can be on the job, and the officials made answerable.  Thirdly, I think we now have a right of appeal from the local authority to the county registrar who will be sitting as an independent official hearing appeals. Heretofore, when he sat as the returning officer, he was really hearing appeals from himself and that was not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>On this point I think it is a pity that the State did not accept the entire case of compiling the register.  I suppose it is sought to justify asking the local authority to bear half the cost on the grounds that the register is required for local elections but the register is primarily required for Dáil elections, Presidential elections, referenda and the provision of jurors' lists and I think the State should have borne 100 per cent of the cost.</P>
    <P>Of course, we must all be delighted at the abolition of the limit on candidates' expenses and I trust that means that a return of expenses of any description will no longer be necessary. This new departure is merely facing up to the realities of the situation.  I am not so sure that the stipulated maximum was exceeded in the past because I think it was fairly fair but I do know that it was impossible to keep any sort of accurate record of what it cost to elect a member of Dáil Éireann or in many cases to attempt to elect a member of Dáil Éireann and the lot of the election agent who was asked to sign his name to this return was unenviable.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the necessity for eight assenters has been done away with because that led to all sorts of difficulties. I hope the occasion never arose that a handwriting expert was called in to vet the signatures of all these assentors all over the country.  Again, this is facing up to the realities of the situation and making things simple.</P>
    <P>There is one thing, I think, on which <Col N="1077" /> the Minister did not follow completely the recommendation of the Joint Committee and that is the deposit.  The Joint Committee recommended that the £100 deposit should still stand but that the number of votes required to save the deposit should be reduced from one-third of the quota to one-fourth. I think that anybody who received one-fourth of the quota in an election would be justified in standing and should save his deposit.</P>
    <P>Senator Desmond dealt with the powers taken by the Minister to divide the cities of Waterford, Limerick and Cork into wards without being requested to do so by the city councils there.  At present the Minister can move in this matter only if he is requested to do so by the city council and the Minister should have left the law as it was in that respect because no one is in a better position to know whether a city should be divided into wards than the citizens of that city.  I would go further and say that if the Minister in his wisdom thought he should have this power he should have left some safeguard to the members of the city council.  Under the Bill as it stands the Minister can decide that he is going to divide the city of Cork into wards without any consultation with anybody.  I think he must lay the regulations before the Dáil and Seanad and if they are annulled they do not become law.  I do not even know if that is in the Bill but I hope it is.</P>
    <P>There is another provision for making regulations for the holding of local elections and its says that a draft of the regulations must be laid before Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann and that it shall not become law until it is approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That gives each House the opportunity of discussing the regulations, suggesting amendments to them and that sort of thing and I think the Minister should have made a similar provision here.  Before making an order dividing the cities into wards he should have to lay the regulations before both Houses of the Oireachtas where they would be open for discussion.</P>
    <P>I may not be taking the sections of the Bill in strictly chronological order but there is another point about <Col N="1078" /> which I am not entirely happy, that is the section of the Bill which gives a returning officer the right to accept withdrawal of a candidate from a person other than the candidate even if it is not over the signature of the candidate.  That is a dangerous provision. If a person is nominated as a candidate in a Parliamentary election some elector in the constituency can come to the returning officer and say: &ldquo;I want to withdraw candidate A&rdquo; and in certain circumstances the returning officer may accept the withdrawal of that candidate nothwithstanding the fact that it is not even made in writing by the candidate himself.  I know that serious penalties are provided for the fraudulent withdrawal of a candidate or for the withdrawal of a candidate without his consent, but that is not enough.  In the rare case where this might happen the returning officer should visit the candidate and interview him in person or if that were not possible he could appoint a deputy to go and interview the candidate.  It is a very serious step to allow a candidate to be withdrawn, to provide the machinery for the withdrawal of a candidate, which might lead to a candidate's fraudulent withdrawal or to withdrawal without his consent.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister will make regulations on the compiling of the electors' lists and that they will provide for publicity to be given to the necessary steps which must be taken in order to become registered as a Parliamentary elector.  I thoroughly agree with the suggestion that it would be a great thing if this were done on a national scale.  At the present time, every returning officer is left to work out his own publicity and the result is that advertisements are small.  You could have one national advertisement in each provincial paper.  If that were done on a national basis, you could have more striking, more effective and a much larger advertisement.  I am sure the Minister will bear this in mind when he is making the regulations. I welcome the Bill by and large.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to detain the passage of the Bill but I should like to make a plea on behalf of commercial travellers for postal voting. It is rather a pity that they have not <Col N="1079" /> been included in view of the fact that at the time of an election they may be in various parts of the country.  With the development of industry and general economic development throughout the country the number of commercial travellers has increased and it has been mentioned time and time again to myself that they should have the right to postal voting in certain circumstances.  If they are not included or some provision is not made for them, with the increase in their numbers and the fact that most of them are married a cynical view will grow up in regard to Parliament, if it has not already reached that stage in some of their minds.  They feel that they have no voice in the election of a government or even of members of local authorities and their attitude is: &ldquo;Why should I worry or bother?&rdquo;  The Minister should seriously consider this question of having them included in a postal vote. They constitute a body that is not going to reduce but will increase with the years, and it is possible that if they had the right of a postal vote they would exercise it in the particular area they might be in on the day of an election.</P>
      <P>Another solution to the problem, I suppose, would be to have elections on a Sunday, but I would not like to advocate that system.  We have enough going on on Sundays already without elections.</P>
      <P>I would like to put before the Minister for consideration the question of the revision of the existing electoral areas in counties.  They are anything but realistic in view of recent trends&mdash; the drift from rural areas to towns and across the water.  We have the position in our county where it takes more votes in one particular electoral area to elect a man than it does in another.  For example, in the area I represent it takes 845 or 850 votes to be elected while in the northern portion of the county a man can be elected with 500 or so. Legislation should be brought in at some future date to remedy the position and make it more realistic.  I am sure this question applies to other counties as well as Leitrim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made, although <Col N="1080" /> perhaps it is outside the scope of this Bill, by Senator Professor Stanford, with a reply by Senator Mullins, to the issue of a citizenship book.  The point is that a spirit of citizenship should be inculcated in our young people.  I support the views expressed especially in regard to parliamentary institutions, but I am sure that both Senators are aware that a very fine booklet on citizenship has been issued recently by the Irish Christian Brothers.  It costs only a nominal sum, around 2/-, and it should be in the hands of every child in the country.  It tells them how they should conduct themselves in public, respect the flag and public property.  The only thing required to be done is to widen its scope by including the set-up of our parliamentary institutions and our local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not very much to say about this Bill except that I welcome it.  It is a really good one because a Committee from all sides of both Houses worked on it and really got down to getting something that was required.  As a member of a local authority, I am very glad that only 50 per cent of the expense will have to be borne by the county council.  We have found a jump of 1½d. or 2d. in the £ due to the fact that we were holding local elections, and I am glad that the jump will not be so great in the future.</P>
      <P>I am also glad that the political Parties to which candidates belong will now appear on the paper.  This is a very good idea and I have often thought that it should have happened long before this.</P>
      <P>As regards secrecy, I am glad that the Minister has taken note about that by reducing the type of the number on the back of the ballot paper.  It was extraordinary how many people were able to see the number and be quick enough at the opening of the ballot boxes to know how a person voted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the official mark is one that concerned us very much at the last election.  The counting of votes was held up for two days and it caused quite a lot of annoyance in the constituency.  I do not know if the <Col N="1081" /> Minister has even gone far enough in trying to see that the official mark will never be left off again.  We have a Senator in this House who could as easily have been in the other House if the official mark had been on the papers.  It must be heart-breaking for a candidate to find himself defeated just because of carelessness on the part of a presiding officer.  If a presiding officer ever makes a mistake like that, it should be seen to that under no circumstances would he be selected in the future.</P>
    <P>We heard a good deal today from Senator Ó Maoláin about children not knowing sufficient about citizenship.  I do not know what the Minister would think of a reduction in the age for voting.  A big proportion of children go to work now at the age of 16, 17 or 18 and they have to wait until they are 21 before they can vote.  I would like to hear the Minister's views as to what he would think of giving votes at 18.</P>
    <P>As regards the £10 deposit in local elections, I do not know whether it is a good or a bad idea.  I am not altogether in favour of it because I do not think it will cut out anyone.  It might cut out one or two undesirables, but I do not think that if an undesirable wants to go up for a bit of a laugh and get a few votes the £10 will deter those who put him up.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Fitzpatrick that the deposit should not be forfeited unless the candidate fails to get one quarter of the votes on elimination instead of one-third as at present.</P>
    <P>In general, I am in agreement with the Bill.  I should like to see a quarter for the forfeiture of the deposit, and I would like to see that it would be nearly impossible to leave the official mark off the paper.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the general reception of this Bill has been favourable.  Due, I suppose, to the manner of its preparation that is hardly to be wondered at.  A number of details have been raised by those who have spoken and I shall try to deal with them as briefly as possible while at the same time giving fair consideration to all those who have put forward particular views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> The first thing mentioned was the thought that one Bill should have been possible.  Not only was it not possible but the Committee which sat on these matters recognised, as I have said in my opening speech this evening, that this was unlikely to be so and looked forward to it being a long time before we could fully consolidate and modernise our entire electoral laws. If we were to do other than we have been doing, and that is doing it by instalments, we should not have any Bill before the House at the moment, and we have already dealt with some matters in earlier legislation.  I can say as well that following pretty quickly on the heels of this measure, and, I think, within the coming 12 months, there will be a further instalment of the codification and modernisation of these electoral laws.  By and large, it is true that what we have done and are doing in this Bill will be the greater and more important part of the consolidation and codification that we are aiming at.</P>
    <P>It was also mentioned that more work was being shoved over to the county councils.  The only thing I have to say about that is that when it suits that is said, and when it suits the reverse is said.  I will not comment further.  There is a lot to be said for both points of view.  As I say, circumstances dictate the point of view a person expresses at any given time.</P>

Those who have taken an interest in this matter will realise that we have made quite a number of innovations in our efforts to publicise the preparation of the register through radio, television, cancellation stamps, and periodic advertisements in the newspapers <Col N="1083" /> advocating that people should check the register to make sure they are on it.</P>
      <P>I think it is fair to say of people who have not a vote as a result of not being on the register, 99 per cent of the fault is their own.  I do not think we can go very much further to ensure with 100 per cent certainty that everyone who is entitled to have his name on the register, in fact has his name on the register, unless people give us a little help and consideration, and listen to the appeals we make.  However, at all times we have been conscious of the need for publicity, and we have expanded the scope of our publicity in recent years.  If any further innovation comes along that would seem to improve that publicity, we will certainly be only too happy to use it.</P>
      <P>Access to polling booths was mentioned as being something that is not quite so free as it might be.  One Senator mentioned keeping people back 50 yards.  That would be like &ldquo;taking a fifty&rdquo;, and we might not all be equally good kickers.  If people are pestered by the various advocates of the different candidates, those advocates will defeat their purpose.  If people are pestered sufficiently, and if they are not terribly strongly convinced politically, they will do the opposite to what they are asked to do.  Whether we make it 50 yards or 50 feet or five feet back from the entrance to the polling station, ultimately the free access of people to vote will depend to a very large degree on the approach of the various political parties, and the adherents of the various candidates whether or not they belong to a Party. If one person tries to beat the voters into voting for him, someone else will compete with him.  People should have a bit of sense and realise that is not the way to get votes.  I can hold out no hope that we can regulate that kind of thing by law.  What is needed is common sense and courtesy, and perhaps the few other things with which we need not concern ourselves at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cole took me to task for not getting rid of the oaths.  I am in <Col N="1084" /> entire agreement with him, despite the fact that I am proposing to the House that they should be retained.  I could elaborate on that statement and I have done so, but I shall not prolong the discussion here by repeating what I said.  I have already said that I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Cole.  I am convinced that what I am proposing to this House in regard to these oaths is wrong.  Fairer than that I cannot be.</P>
    <P>The reason I propose to the House that the oaths should be retained as part of the electoral code is that at all stages of this electoral law reform, as it were, I have acknowledged the fact that the law which would be most acceptable to the greatest number dealing with these matters would, to my mind, be the better law, even though it may have some flaws from my personal point of view.  It is on that basis that I have approached this Bill and bowed to the wishes of those who felt the oaths should be retained.  I agreed to let them have what they wish because I felt that agreement on these matters is more important than the actual detail of the matter itself.  I am glad that I have one out of both Houses who see it the same way as I do.  I must be right if two others see it my way, despite the fact that other people think differently.</P>
    <P>We had fairly wide discussions in the Dáil about describing a person as &ldquo;non-Party&rdquo; on the ballot paper, if he does not belong to a Party.  Senator Cole mentioned the case of two non-party candidates with similar names appearing on the same ballot paper.  I agree that can happen.  However, their address must also appear on the ballot paper, and their occupation.  I would lay fairly long odds against two candidates with the same names, the same addresses, and the same occupations, being on the same ballot paper.  That is the answer in part, at any rate, to Senator Cole's point that this sort of thing could be confusing.  Apart from all that, the two people would have to be non-Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not worry us.  It would not be lost in that event. <Col N="1085" /> Registration of parties is dealt with in Section 13 of the Bill.  The Clerk of the Dáil, for the time being, will keep the register.  Up to three days after the dissolution of the Dáil, or the moving of a writ for a by-election, a person or persons may apply to the Clerk of the Dáil, or the Registrar as we might call him, to become registered as a political party.  He will be guided by the terms of reference, as it were, contained in Section 13 of the Bill, as to whether or not such people really represent a party.</P>
      <P>I would particularly direct the attention of those who have raised this matter to Section 13, subsection (b) (i) and (ii) which in a very brief way indicates the general duties that the registrar may apply in his consideration of an application for registration of any person or persons presenting themselves up to three days after the dissolution of the Dáil or the moving of the writ in the case of a by-election.  If they are refused registration, then there is the right of appeal.  The Appeal Board will be composed of the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, a High Court judge who will then take up that appeal against the refusal to register and they will give their determination on it.</P>
      <P>The question of the nomination&mdash; and indeed the withdrawal which was mentioned later on&mdash;of a candidate who is going forward in any particular election calls for some comment here. The position of the candidate nominated by a person who might or might not have the consent of the person named to be the candidate would appear to be at first sight one of difficulty. However, we have extended our time, from the closing of the date for nomination, within which withdrawals may be made, up to 24 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the nomination of a candidate, if the candidate is not nominating himself personally he will be notified of his nomination and even if it is at the last minute of the last hour of the last day, 24 hours have been provided within which, by telegram, the prospective candidate is notified of his having been nominated. If his consent has not been got for his <Col N="1086" /> nomination he may give it within those 24 hours.  On the other hand, there is the possibility of somebody, validly nominated with his own consent, withdrawing at the last minute. We feel we have fairly well covered that.  The withdrawal will only be accepted if it is submitted to the returning officer that the person personally is unable to attend to make his own withdrawal and that he has signed a document to that effect.  The withdrawal must actually be signed by the person who is actually returning it to the returning officer.  Over and above that, there are now being imposed severe penalties for the abuse of this particular procedure.  While we do not know of the likelihood of withdrawals taking place in any of our areas, there is not likely to be an area in which the returning officer is not pretty well aware of what is going on and who is likely to be withdrawn. When speaking about withdrawals, we feel that something which we should take into consideration is that these happenings are not as liable to occur as the actual provisions in the Bill might lead one to believe.</P>
    <P>Withdrawals of candidates without their consent will be very few.  In those cases the returning officer in the particular area or constituency will have sufficient intimate knowledge to know really whether the withdrawal proposal is genuine or not.  As I say, that is something we can leave to the returning officer of the particular area or constituency having regard to his experience.  We realise that the likelihood of this ever happening is very remote.  If that should prove wrong, then very severe penalties may be visited upon those who do this.</P>

      <P>Some Senators raised the non-qualification of British citizens to vote in the Dáil elections.  It was <Col N="1087" /> also pointed out by another Senator that this would be quite a comprehensive job and quite a difficult one on account of the fact that we could scarcely consider extending to British citizens the right to vote in the Dáil elections without considering the right to vote of citizens of every other nationality.  With that I would be inclined to agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to the special terms but we will not discuss them.  I was going to finish up by saying that if we were to extend those facilities to other nationalities we would have to change the Constitution. This has been pointed out by Senator Ross.  Therefore, the consideration that might be given does not arise. I am merely dealing with what is already permissible under the Constitution and, therefore, any consideration which might be given to a proposed change does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been looked into. If a British subject wants to become an Irish citizen there is no difficulty.  But, if he wishes to be a British citizen and enjoy Irish citizenship rights, then the Constitution would have to be changed. That is a matter which we are not considering today.  I wonder if it will ever be considered at all.  British citizens who want to become Irish citizens can have their rights and one of the rights would be a vote in the Dáil elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Desmond, a Corkman by name and, by the implications of what he said, a Corkman also, is fearful of the mutilation he fears I may perpetrate on his beloved city of Cork if we should divide the city into electoral <Col N="1088" /> areas or whatever one might like to call it.</P>
    <P>I am glad he raised this specifically because at the end of my introductory speech, on re-reading what I said, I feel I may have given the impression that, while I am seeking and taking this power in this Bill, I am not going to use it.  I want to correct that.  I intend to use it and not necessarily await the effect the small deposits may have on reducing the number of candidates. The need for change in these cities is, I think, well known and the demand for this change has been really making itself felt for quite a number of years but nothing could be done about it.</P>
    <P>What I would say about the change and the giving of powers by order to the Minister to make the change is that we are not taking any additional power than that which the Minister for Local Government has in respect of all other local authority areas and entities throughout the country.  In county council, urban and borough areas, including Dublin, we have had this type of powers, and more, down the years. The dangers that may seem evident when we name three cities, which we did in this Bill, really, by experience, can be seen not to exist because of the fact that the same power is vested in the Minister for Local Government for many years in the country, and without complaint for which I am aware in regard to any alleged abuses of that power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Minister to say that the point I made concerned lack of consultation with the local authority? I did not dispute that this might be a good or a bad thing to do.  I think the Minister might remember that when first consulting the particular local authorities concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to that. The Senator forestalled me, but, perhaps, I am a little longwinded on the matter.  I am not debarred from consulting the local authorities, if it is a desirable thing to do.  In all cases where changes would be proposed there is every reason that the Minister for Local Government would, in fact, <Col N="1089" /> consult.  That is not saying that there would be cases where it might not be wise for him to consult them.  In a matter such as this it might be anything but a fair question to ask them&mdash;an elected body, who were elected without divisions in their city&mdash;how they felt about dividing the city and whether a division should be this, that or the other way.  They might have been elected in the open field.  They might, if asked by the Minister, injure their prospects of future election because they ordered by what they said the division of the city this way or that way.  Somebody who supported them in the past might be dissatisfied and might take a different view in the future.  There are those isolated views in the matter which can be appreciated without in any way elaborating on, or explaining, them.</P>
      <P>Let me again assure the House, and Deputy Desmond in particular, that because of the fact that the Minister is not obliged to consult the local authorities the view in this measure does not at all mean that the Minister will not consult them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should keep thinking about them.  We shall leave that to another day when any proposed change by way of Order will be laid before this House, and the Dáil, and if a case can be made and sustained <Col N="1090" /> as to why the Order should not come into effect, then this House and the other House will handle such Order and discuss all the pros and cons of gerrymander or gerry anything else.</P>
      <P>There was the suggestion made by an earlier speaker, taken up by Senator Ó Maoláin, that somebody might take on the responsibility of getting out a booklet which would educate the young generation of this country in their rights and responsibilities as citizens.  I do not think, though we are blamed for many things, this would be the responsibility of the Department of Local Government or the Minister. Senator Ó Maoláin said I might take up the suggestion and pass it on to whoever is responsible.  I shall gladly do that because I agree with those who have advocated the publication of such a booklet.  Indeed, there is need for some such publication.  I am not sure who should get it but I shall make inquiries and pass the suggestion on to where it belongs.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzpatrick, while commending the passage of this Bill in such a relatively short time, rather spoilt his commendation by saying that it would have been quicker, and no doubt a better Bill, if the Minister had not sought to depart from the proposals put forward by the Joint Committee. That, of course, is stretching Senator Fitzpatrick's imagination somewhat, in that, if this were so, then we take it that every time the Dáil as a body, I as a Minister, or the Government as a Government, disagreed with the views of the 21 people appointed as a Committee, we must be wrong.  I do not hold with that view and I do not think Senator Fitzpatrick, if he stopped to work it out to its logical conclusion, would agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did come back to the views of the Joint Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the fact that I am back.  Furthermore, I should say that we have not conformed in various little respects here and there.  We have not conformed with the agreement of the other House and that is no reflection on or fault of the Joint Committee <Col N="1091" /> of 21.  The membership of the Dáil is 144.  That of the Seanad is 60.  With all due respects&mdash;60 versus 144&mdash;I think it can be agreed that we are entitled, even on the basis of numerical strength in both Houses, to take a different view from 21 members drawn from either of those Houses.  We have departed in little ways.  We have cut out certain things and added on other things but the overall position is still a good one and does not take from the Bill in any way whatsoever.</P>
      <P>The suggestion of consolidation has been made as if it were merely a matter of pulling or pushing switches. I have already dealt to some degree with this.  While Senator Fitzpatrick says that consolidation and modernisation in one Bill would make for easier understanding of these laws by non-legal people, I am not quite sure that many non-legal people are acting as agents and I am not sure that is a good or logical argument.  Whether we have it in one or 21 Bills and whether we have legal people as our agents in all cases or even if we had it in one Bill and a legally trained man in every case as agent, there is no need to suppose that all these legal people will agree on what the interpretation of the law is going to be.  My own experience, little as it is, has been to bear out the belief that many non-legal agents who have by practice and tradition become accustomed to operating the electoral laws could teach the legal people because, having done the work, they know all the ins and outs of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fizpatrick Mr. Fizpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fizpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be, I suggest, much more convenient for agents, legal or lay, if the entire law on the subject were in one book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree provided the law in the one book was comprehensive and intelligible.  If we were to attempt to bring that type of measure before the House at this stage, at so early a date after the various reports of the Committee, I do not think it would be possible to have it either intelligible or comprehensible to either legal or non-legal people.  I hope, however, we shall get to the stage where we shall have fully consolidated <Col N="1092" /> law and will not have more reference back.</P>
      <P>Postal votes were mentioned by Senator Mooney.  A great case is made for commercial travellers and other groups of people who, due to their occupations, are invariably absent from their normal place of residence in the middle of the week which is when elections, Dáil, Presidential or county council, are invariably held. There are so many of these categories that it would be difficult to sort them out and say that one should have this facility and if you are to give one this facility it will be difficult to know where to stop.  The Joint Committee did not report in favour of this although they specifically considered the matter.  I myself feel sympathy towards this particular group but I also appreciate the difficulties which present themselves if one were to bring this group in while leaving certain other categories out and if we bring all in the rest of us who vote at home will begin to wonder why we should have to go out to a polling station at all and why we should not all have postal votes.  We may get to that stage yet but the time, I think, is not yet ripe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also mentioned by Senator Mooney was the urgent necessity for the revision of county electoral areas in his own county of Leitrim.  We have power to do it but, naturally, like the rest of the counties, there is nothing whatever to prevent that local authority from making a request to the Minister to make an order and no doubt also suggesting what they would wish as far as the new provisions were concerned.  A mere difference of numbers of electors in any one county electoral area as against another would not to my mind be in itself conclusive proof that a revision was called for.  If over 800 were required in one county area and 500 in another, again that would not be conclusive as far as making a case is concerned.  The territory covered and the valuation of property in the area for local election purposes is something we should give consideration to.  That is not to say if the Leitrim County Council wishes a revision that they should not make that request with any suggestions they <Col N="1093" /> have on how it should be done.  I would give them every consideration and very likely make an order to that effect.</P>
    <P>The number or percentage of votes required to save a deposit in an election was mentioned and it was urged that a quarter should be sufficient to save it.  In fact, we are not proposing to change the requirement of one-third but I would point out that the suggestion to reduce it from one-third to a quarter was never intended to apply to a general election but only to a by-election and, of course, there is a vast difference between the two sets of circumstances and the quotas to which the one-fourth or one-third would be referable.  We do not propose to depart from the required one-third of the quota at the time of departure from the scene and it is probably just as well that that should be so.  To make it too easy to save a deposit which at present day values is far too low in my opinion is something we should not hasten to do.  A hundred pounds has been the deposit for the past 40 years.  If I were dealing with this Bill on purely personal lines, I would make it at least £150 or a couple of hundred pounds.  At that stage I would be disposed to go along with those who feel that the percentage of the quota required to save the deposit could be lower but while you have such a low deposit there is no real reason for reducing any of the safeguards which the deposit may give by making it too easy to get it back.</P>
    <P>These are a number of the matters raised.  If I have left anything or anybody out I shall be only too happy to comment further.</P>

      <P>I just want to clarify my own point of view on a <Col N="1094" /> matter.  I think the British Government was generous in its terms to Irish citizens in 1948 and I would like our Government to be generous in return. It does not seem clear to me in the Constitution that there is anything to prevent it.  Senator Hayes agreed.  He had a look at the Constitution and he does not see a clear bar but if the Minister could point one out that would settle the matter.  On the other hand, Senator Ross pointed out that we could, if necessary, amend the Constitution.  It is a matter of generosity and to some extent of justice and I hope that the Minister will at least keep it at the back of his mind as a possibility in the future.</P>

On the Second Stage I made the point that it was dangerous to permit a candidate to be withdrawn by a registered elector in the constituency without the written consent of the candidate.  The Minister informed me in reply that a candidate could not be withdrawn without the written consent of the candidate.  I think that is not correct.  I would refer the Minister to Section 21, subsection (11) (2).  It reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) In a case in which the returning officer is satisfied that a candidate is unable to attend and wishes to withdraw his candidature, withdrawal may be effected by furnishing, before the said hour, a notice to that effect, signed by the candidate and the person presenting the notice, to the returning officer: provided that the returning officer may accept a <Col N="1096" /> withdrawal effected by a notice signed only by the person presenting it if that person is registered as a Dáil elector in the constituency for which the candidate was nominated and the returning officer is satisfied that it would not be reasonably possible for the candidate also to sign the withdrawal.</P>

      <P>I agree with the views expressed by Senator Cole.  I <Col N="1097" /> remember quoting in this House in regard to another matter a remark I heard that if we had fewer courts we might have less perjury.  The person who said that might have said the truth.  It appears to be part of our system that we want to continue to administer an oath, to put the Bible in the hands of people and ask them to swear oftentimes on matters that are not really fundamental.  I do not mind whether the Minister agrees or not.  I feel strongly on this matter that it is fundamentally and basically wrong to put the Bible in the hands of people and ask them to swear on trivial matters.  I am one of those who believe that an oath should only be taken when there is a grave issue involved and when it is fundamental that the oath should be administered. As a people we are inclined&mdash;this is not confined to any particular side of the House &mdash; through the medium of our courts and the methods found in the district court in which groups of people have oaths administered to them, to take away from the full meaning and profound understanding that should exist where an oath is concerned. Because I hold this view I could not but protest in the best way I can in regard to this question.</P>
      <P>Many people might not agree with me.  That does not matter.  But I do think that the Minister was wrong in accepting anybody's view that when changes were being made this was a matter that should not be changed.  It is a terrible business to ask people without full consideration, going into a polling station, if they are excited and there is any question of their identity, to take the Bible into their hands and to swear.  That is a shocking business.  While there are people who believe this should be done, I think there are people on both sides of the House who think it is wrong. Perhaps the Minister would have another look at it and examine it in the light in which I have approached it.  It is wrong that people should be sworn except on fundamental issues. After all, we have a duty, so far as we can, not to create a situation where there is any chance of perjury being committed, if we realise what perjury is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Reilly makes the case that the oath should not be administered on a frivolous matter.  Surely he is not making the case to this House that the excercise of the franchise is a frivolous matter, or not a fundamental matter, of the utmost importance.  I certainly treat it as such.  The sooner the people of this country are taught to believe they owe a duty to themselves and the country to exercise the franchise, go to the polls and cast their vote, the better.  It follows from that, that everyone should be taught that to exercise the franchise in an improper manner, or to rob someone else of his vote, is a very serious matter, and a matter which is worthy of being tested on oath, if necessary.</P>
      <P>In the original Bill, if I am correct, it was proposed to administer an oath to a blind person that he was so blind that he could not vote.  It was proposed to administer an oath to an illiterate person that he was so illiterate that he could not read the ballot paper. It was proposed not to administer an oath to a person who was suspected of coming into a polling station to rob another person of his vote.  I cannot understand the logic of that.  As originally introduced, the Bill proposed to swear a blind person or an unfortunate illiterate but not to swear a potential thief.  I disagree entirely with Senator O'Reilly when he seems to regard the exercise of the franchise as something frivolous and not worthy of being tested in the most solemn manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>The administration of the oath in many cases as well as in polling stations is in a frivolous manner.  It was that aspect to which I referred.  If Senator Fitzpatrick says I said &ldquo;a frivolous matter&rdquo; I shall not contradict him.  I think Senator Fitzpatrick appreciates the mental attitude behind my statement, and I think he will, to some degree, agree with me that there is something in what I said. I did not in any way imply that I <Col N="1099" /> regard the exercise of the franchise as a frivolous matter.  I do not.  I never tried to get people to regard the exercise of the franchise as a frivolous matter by way of public statement, or otherwise, in any statement I ever made.  I always advise people to vote for someone, even though they may not vote for the candidate I advocate. That is beside the point.</P>
      <P>I still think I am right, and I think the clause in regard to swearing blind people was also wrong.  My view is that to ask people to take an oath in a frivolous manner is wrong.  It creates a temptation for people who might not be fully conscious of what they are doing and which might be on the borderline of committing perjury. On that basis I object to this in principle. I am sure Senator Fitzpatrick has no desire to confuse me, or to try to confuse or misrepresent what I said.</P>

I cannot understand what he means when he says he is afraid of the oath being administered in a frivolous manner.  I honestly do not know what he means.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator O'Reilly.  I think he is quite correct.  The imposition of the oath has led to abuses in the past.  There is no doubt about that, and it may do so again in the future.  The main abuse is the frivolous element that comes into it.  The fact remains that an oath will be administered by the presiding officer at the request of the personating agent sitting at the table.  I have seen the oath being asked for by an agent for purely frivolous and non-existing reasons. I am sure many of us have seen that <Col N="1100" /> happen.  It is well known that it does happen.  It is quite wrong that old people should be terrorised from going into the polling station to vote because they have heard a rumour which was going around that a certain agent at a certain table is swearing everyone. That is entirely wrong, and it is a great pity that that type of abuse should continue because of the fact that the Minister put the oath into the Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not think the existence of the oath is any deterrent to personation.  It is an encouragement because, as we all know, when a person is going to personate, if he is suspected the oath is asked for, and he then leaves.  He will not be charged with an offence unless he votes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The oath gives him a chance.  He goes in hoping no one will suspect him, and that no one will notice him, that he will get away with it and vote.  If the agent at the table is on the <i>qui vive</i> and thinks the person is not who he says he is, he will ask him to swear, and the person will leave.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were no oath he would not know until he had voted whether he was going to be caught.  It would mean that he would think very carefully before deciding to personate. As it is, he can go into a polling station and take a chance.  It does not seem to be a defence from the point of view of avoiding personation.  It is an encouragement which leads to abuse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Senator will agree that it is a good thing in an election, when you have different candidates, to have an agent in polling stations to prevent persons personating people.  This leads to clean elections. It is only where there are not such agents&mdash;in other words, where there are personations in elections&mdash;that I could see a quite lot of abuse.  But, as things are at the moment in our polling stations, both urban and rural, we have agents for the different candidates. That is a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1101" /> If a person goes to a polling station in Cavan, Leitrim or Longford and proposes to vote for somebody else and to rob somebody of his vote, if an agent of a candidate challenges that person, and that person still persists in getting the vote, then that person can, and should be, prosecuted for personation. I think the public interest would be sufficiently safeguarded if our electoral law was drafted along that line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not quite clear as to what the Minister said in his general reply as to why he would not consult the various local authorities involved where he is now entitled to make an Order.  I still feel that it is only carrying out democratic procedure where there is a recognised and properly constituted local authority to consult them when something has changed.  I am not disputing at all that the change may be very advisable but, I am concerned with the other point, where there is a properly recognised local authority, that they might be consulted if they had any views in a matter of that kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator Desmond, the fact that the Order is being proposed in relation to these three cities, including Cork, is merely what is there at the moment in respect of other such places.  The question might very well be asked: if it has been good enough for so many other local authorities, why should special procedures be laid down for these three cities?  In fact, I think what might not be clear over all in this Bill is that in Section 87 we are, in fact, bringing into uniform line the approach to this type of problem in relation to our local authorities generally and we are not, as I say, introducing something new.  I would also again point our that we are not precluded from consulting these <Col N="1102" /> people, neither are we obliged to consult them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider laying a draft of the proposed Order before the Dáil and Seanad for approval as is provided for in Section 82?  In Section 82 of the Bill the Minister is enabled to make regulations governing the conduct of the local authorities but a draft of those regulations must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and must be passed by each House of the Oireachtas before the Minister can make the Order.  This is a very good idea.  In this section we are dealing with now, Section 87, the Minister merely makes the Order and unless it is revoked within 21 days by an Order to that effect it becomes law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The laying of draft regulations and the laying of proposals such as would be envisaged under this section, are entirely different matters, although they might appear at first sight to be one and the same thing. Regulations in an earlier section of the Bill would be something which would apply generally and probably for some time to come and the wisdom of the laying of a draft before the two Houses is more or less tantamount to considering the terms of the Bill as a whole by referring the whole matter to a Committee and then considering it entirely in all its forms in the two Houses.  The general acceptance of this formula in regard to Cork and other cities by the Dáil was that we were bringing the procedure into line, I think, even by amendment with the procedure as it exists in relation to Dublin city.  I should say it may be a little misleading as far as many of the cases are concerned.  In the case of ordinary local authorities, there is no such laying of an order before any of the Houses, either in draft form or as an order.  For the changing of the county council electoral area scheme the law is there.  The Minister for Local Government may change it and he does not have to have the terms of an order or the approval of either House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>No, not by obligation again, but very likely in practice.  In Dublin City there is that procedure whereby annulment must go before the two Houses.  I think in the Bill, as I put it first to the Dáil, I was bringing those cities into line with county council procedure, which did not have any Order coming before any of the Houses, and by way of amendment I brought it into line and on a par with Dublin city.  The Order now goes before the Houses and may be annulled by either House within a certain number of days.  That seemed to be accepted particularly well by all in the other House and I suggest it is a fair approach to the matter.</P>

      <P>Generally speaking, you have the surname and alongside it the name in capitals of the party.

      <P>The proposed form of <Col N="1104" /> ballot paper for the future does not differ really as defined by Senator Yeats.  In the past the surname only appeared in the large type and it is proposed that only the surname will appear in the large type in the future, except where there are two or more of the same surname, in which case it is quite logical to follow each of the surnames with the actual Christian name, or names, so as to differentiate them.</P>

In each case the name of the party is in capitals after the surname of the candidates. My complaint is that formerly the name of the candidate was set out by itself quite clearly and it is by no means as clear now as it has been in the past.</P>

      <P>I think the Senator has a point, but we must have regard to the fact that the names and descriptions are put there so that they can be read.  If we look at the two, first as it was and secondly as it would be, I agree that putting the party name in the same print as the name of the candidate would seem to reduce the manner in which the candidate's name stands out.  I think that when we have the name of the candidate and the party name in the same size type we should see and understand what each candidate represents much more readily than if we left the latter isolated.</P>

      <P>The Bill proposes to amend the Export Promotion Act, 1959 in two respects.  In the first place it would provide for further grants to Córas Tráchtála to enable them to continue their work in promoting exports.  The Export Promotion Act, 1959, which provided for the establishment <Col N="1106" /> of Córas Tráchtála, placed a limit of £1 million on the aggregate amount of grants which may be paid to the Board.  By the end of last year, grants amounting to almost £850,000 had been made, leaving a balance of approximately £150,000 which would not be sufficient for a further year at the present rate of expenditure.  The Bill proposes to raise the limit to £2½ million.  Córas Tráchtála has a very important role to fill in the economic life of the country by assisting exporters and by encouraging firms to engage in exports, and I am sure that the House will agree that the necessary funds should be provided to enable the Board to continue this work.</P>
      <P>The Bill also contains provisions to enable Córas Tráchtála, if they so decide, to acquire premises and sublet portion of these premises.  Because their present premises in London are inadequate to meet the growing needs of Irish export promotion, Córas Tráchtála are faced with the need to seek larger premises; and it is possible that other Irish State-sponsored bodies with offices in London might see advantage in having as many of these offices as possible grouped in one building as might also some of the Irish companies which require representation in London.  Córas Tráchtála are at present investigating the possibility of leasing premises in London which would be suitable for this purpose.  If it is decided to go ahead, Córas Tráchtála wish to be in a position to occupy part of the building themselves and sublet other parts on the basis I have indicated.  The Board's existing powers would not authorise them to lease premises when only a small part of the premises is required for their own purposes and the present Bill will give them the necessary powers.  Córas Tráchtála are entirely dependent for funds on an annual subvention from the Exchequer. In order to carry through such an arrangement Córas Tráchtála would require a guarantee by the Government against any loss which they might incur on the leasing and subletting of the premises.  The Bill will enable me to give such a guarantee.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>There are two parts to the Bill, one increasing the funds available to Córas Tráchtála from £1 million to £2,500,000.  The other a practical matter regarding accommodation for Córas Tráchtála giving them powers which they did not hitherto possess.  The second part of the Bill seems to be a matter of business, that Córas Tráchtála in places where they have offices should be able to take part of a premises and should be able to make arrangements for themselves.  With that there does not seem to be any difficulty.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other, I know good work is being done but when one speaks of a figure like £2,500,000 it is legitimate to wonder whether we could be told, whether the Minister could make an effort to express in figures, what precise increase in exports Córas Tráchtála has effected and what the relationship is between the £2,500,000 and the amount of improvement which would be expected.  I realise&mdash;we all realise&mdash;that in our position there is necessity for this kind of body but it would be desirable that we should be able to get something in figures to show us what kind of a return is expected from this £2,500,000.  I do not know if the Minister will be able to do anything precise in that matter, whether he will be able to make a reasonable estimate, but I think if he did it would be a great help to all of us.</P>

      <P>I shall not oppose this Bill but it struck me when the Minister was making his speech, as apparently it struck Senator Hayes, that the Minister might have told us what has been accomplished by the expenditure of practically £1 million and what can be expected from the further expenditure of another £1½ million.  I am all in favour of promoting and encouraging exports for the very simple reason that it provides useful employment for our own people at home.  I am, however, wondering whether we have to contemplate this as a permanent arrangement.  If so, is this the right way to go about it?  We set up Córas Tráchtála, the Oireachtas agreed to provide £1 million at the discretion of the Minister, and he is now asking us to agree to a further £1½ million.  What <Col N="1108" /> is to happen when this £2½ million is exhausted?  Are we to have an annual Bill?  Is that the best way of permanently encouraging exports?  Has the Minister given any consideration to the possibility of those firms who are assisted by the work of Córas Tráchtála in some way paying for the services being provided by Córas Tráchtála?</P>
      <P>Córas Tráchtála employs a staff, and it is obvious from their functions and the work which they perform that they are particularly good and enterprising people, but what sort of security faces those people?  Is it going to be a haphazard arrangement of a grant of £1 million as provided previously, another £1½ million provided under this Bill and a question mark thereafter when the £2½ million has been or has nearly been expended?  I am hoping that the Minister will give us his thoughts on the matter of whether there is any other method of doing this, and a more permanent method of encouraging the expansion of exports from this country.</P>

      <P>I should like to support this Bill very warmly.  I do this on general grounds, not from any specific knowledge of the arithmetic or the economics of this organisation.  I feel that it is most desirable that we should try by all means in our power and by any devices we can think of to improve our exports.  I had some small association with this organisation in an advisory capacity.  I have been struck by the amount of energy, initiative and ingenuity they displayed in tackling the various suggestions put forward. They seem to accept or to have a look at almost anything that would appear on the face of it to be reasonable. Some of these projects are esoteric in the extreme and can only be followed when expert and scientific advice is sought, and they do that very freely. They employ for fees scientific people in various departments to help them to evaluate these ideas, and this is a great stimulus to these departments as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was struck by the very high opinions expressed about this organisation in America, both on the east and west coasts.  They were well aware <Col N="1109" /> of the work being done by Córas Tráchtála and appreciated it and so far as I could see were co-operating very fully with it.  I would think that it has had a very pronounced effect on the export drive in the few years in which it has been in existence, and I would strongly support the Bill because it encourages the development of this organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not rise to oppose this Bill either, but I think that we are entitled to be critical of it and, as other Senators have said, we are entitled to have expected that the Minister would make a case for giving a further £1½ million to the board.  There is another Bill coming before us later which proposes to increase the non-repayable grants to the Tourist Board to £1½ million.  The promotion of the tourist business is very desirable.  The promotion of exports is most desirable.  I wonder, however, are we getting the full returns for this money that we might expect.  In the face of these two Bills and particularly the Bill with which we are now dealing we cannot overlook the fact that the adverse balance of payments has risen to £105 million, which is a record, this year.  It may be said to me that if we had not Bills like this the adverse balance of payments might be much worse.  Maybe so, but I think we are entitled to be told what returns has been received for the money already paid by way of non-repayable grants and what the board is doing and what we can expect from the further £1½ million which this Bill will provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Hayes has said, the second part of the Bill is to facilitate the board in acquiring office accommodation. It is most essential that the board should have adequate office accommodation, and apparently it is thought that it is not possible to obtain that accommodation by acquiring the exact amount of office space that is necessary.  This Bill empowers the board to acquire more office accommodation than it really wants, perhaps in the form of an entire house or a couple of houses, and then to shed the portion of that accommodation which it does not require.  It apparently is anticipated that in that operation the <Col N="1110" /> board may suffer a loss because the Bill authorises the Minister to indemnify the board against any such losses. I can only express the hope that this Bill will not encourage the board to acquire or seek to acquire palatial office accommodation and that it will not encourage the board and other boards like it to develop expensive or extravagant ideas.</P>
    <P>Some people think that our missions abroad and our buildings abroad are on too elaborate a scale.  If we believe that in order to compete with other nations of the world in searching for exports we must compete with them in the type of office accommodation that we provide, then we are doomed to failure, because, of course, we could not hope to compete with the more wealthy nations and it would be futile and foolish to try to do so. As I say, I can only hope that the Minister will exercise a watchful eye over the activities of this and other boards and see that the money made available to them by the Oireachtas is wisely spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing to say that has not been said by one of the previous speakers.  I should like to express my approval of the Bill in general.  The recently issued report of the Central Bank lays particular emphasis on the necessity for increased expansion of exports.  This particular measures is designed to increased our exports.  The Report of the Central Bank refers to the increase in Government expenditure of an unproductive kind, and emphasises very strongly that Government expenditure, whether current or capital, should aim at strengthening the balance of payments. This Bill is strictly productive inside the narrowest definition of that term and, therefore, I think it ought to have the unanimous approval of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, in view of the strictures of the Central Bank on the general increases in Government expenditure, I suggest that the utmost economy should be exercised even on expenditure of this type.  The Central Bank in their admirable Report referred to the increase in Government expenditure of all kinds, and the necessity <Col N="1111" /> for concentrating on productive expenditure but, strictly speaking, even productive expenditure can be extravagant. Therefore, while I entirely agree with the purposes of the Bill, I think the questions asked by Senator Hayes and Senator Fitzpatrick are strictly relevant to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The criticism that has been made here about Córas Tráchtála &mdash;or rather the questions that have been asked about whether we are getting value for the money that is now being voted for the purposes of Córas Tráchtála&mdash;is the first I have heard.  I am not objecting to it, because a little criticism does no harm on occasion, to the most successful bodies.  Senator Jessop has spoken about the opinion held by people in the United States whom he has met as to the high quality of the service, and the standard of work, given and performed by Córas Tráchtála and their officers.  I can assure the House that opinion is shared by the Irish firms who have had occasion to avail of the services of Córas Tráchtála.  With regard to ensuring that the annual expenditure is scrutinised I think the very manner in which this money is being given, and the fact that it is given annually, ensures effective scrutiny.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the £1 million that has already been passed by the Oireachtas as being available to this body has been spent in the ordinary way.  The money is voted annually.  Córas Tráchtála, like any Department or section of a Department, must submit their budget annually, first to my Department who, in turn, submit it to the accounting department, the Department of Finance.  I can assure the House that every item of expenditure, and every proposed item of expenditure, in that budget is scrutinised very closely, and full account of what the expenditure is intended to achieve is taken in advance. Criticism of the manner in which we provide the money, which was made by Senator Murphy, is possibly criticism of the stinginess, if one might use that word, of the State in dealing with this board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £1 million which was voted in <Col N="1112" /> the previous Act is almost entirely exhausted.  I mentioned in the Dáil how that money has been spent over the years in a broad way, starting with £97,000 in 1959/60, and in the three succeeding years averaging about £250,000.  In the current year the grant-in-aid is £310,000 which, as Senators will see, would exhaust the £1 million already voted, by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>One purpose of the Bill is to raise the limit from £1 million to £2½ million. I think the Seanad will not agree with the criticism offered by Senator Murphy because, when this £2½ million is exhausted, apart altogether from the annual scrutiny that is given to the budget of Córas Tráchtála, and the annual debate that is held on the Estimates for the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;of which Córas Tráchtála expenditure forms part&mdash;at the end of a period of possibly four or five years, the extra £1½ million will have been exhausted, and there will be an opportunity for both Houses of the Oireachtas, in debating a new Bill, if a new Bill is necessary as I expect it will be, to review the activities of that body, and to ensure that the moneys they are expending are well expended.  I think the result that have been achieved show that the moneys have, indeed, been well expended.</P>
    <P>I did not give any details of the increases in exports that have been achieved over the past ten years, because they have been fully set out in the annual report of Córas Tráchtála for 1962, which was recently published, and which, no doubt, is available to all members of the Oireachtas in the ordinary way.  If Senators will consult that report they will see that in the ten years from 1952 to the end of 1962 the value of our exports increased from £99 million to £168 million.  They will see, too, if they care to examine the particular items, that under almost every heading there has been an increase in the value of exports and, with very few exceptions, that increase has been maintained continuously over recent years.</P>
    <P>In regard to industrial exports, it is important to realise, as Senator <Col N="1113" /> O'Brien has mentioned, and as advised by the report of the Central Bank, that we must depend more and more on our exports in order to improve the standard of living of our people.  We know that for international economic reasons it is difficult to rely at the present juncture, at any rate, on agricultural exports, because of the support and subsidy systems operating abroad which limit the capacity of our agricultural producers to find markets for their surpluses.  Therefore, in the main, we have to depend on an increase in industrial exports to maintain and increase employment, and to improve the standard of living of our people. I think the expenditure here is modest, having regard to what we must achieve in that field and, indeed, having regard to what has already been achieved. With regard to the premises, at the moment, as Senators might know, Córas Tráchtála have a number of premises in different parts of the world, in London and New York, and one in Brussels.  London, of course, is the principal centre, Britain being the principal export market we have.  But the premises in London were never really adequate and have recently proved far from being adequate for the purposes of Córas Tráchtála.  They were inadequate from the start because they had no shop window there.  The premises were situated along Regent Street, and Córas Tráchtála were unable to display even a plate on the outside indicating that they were there, and one had to go through a narrow hallway to the premises where Irish goods were put on display from time to time.</P>
    <P>I think it is very obvious, in so far as the main function of Córas Tráchtála is the presentation of Irish export goods, that they should have, if they can acquire them at all, ground floor premises with adequate frontage.  It is felt that in order to have such premises they may have to acquire a whole house, or a whole building, most of which they would not need for their own purposes.  The existing Act did not, or it is thought that it did not, give them power to lease premises or portion of premises which they would not require and this Bill will do so.  I <Col N="1114" /> do not think there is any party objection against Irish exports, and, indeed, other Irish interests, having an adequate shop window in London, first of all, because of the size of London itself, being the centre, economic, financial and otherwise, of Great Britain, where our greatest market is, and also because of the millions of visitors who come from all over the world to London.  I think it is important for Ireland and what it has to sell and what it has to offer by way of tourism, if the Tourist Board decide to take a lease of part of these premises, that we should display those things adequately in a centre like London.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Murphy made a point about the possibility of making exporters who use the services of Córas Tráchtála pay for these services.  I think that that would in the first place be a tax on production.  In any event, it would be very difficult to apportion the cost among the different types of exporters that we have.  As the House knows, many small firms do quite a successful export business but they have not the resources to engage in the market research and to some extent the publicity required to maintain exports at an adequate level.  Córas Tráchtála provide such facilities for these and, indeed, for big exporters, too.  They carry out market research from their own resources, give grants to firms or groups of firms to engage in market research themselves and in many ways help in a positive way to promote exports.</P>
    <P>I would refer Senators to appendix 1 of the annual report.  Under the heading &ldquo;Services to Exporters&rdquo; they will find a pen picture of the various activities carried on by Córas Tráchtála to aid exporters: market exploration, marketing, buyers' services, advisory services, design, publicity, overseas offices and publications.  I can assure the House that their activities under all these headings have been of a very high standard.  Therefore, it is with confidence that I recommend the Bill to the House and I am glad to note that it has almost unanimous approval.</P>

      <P>I fully agree with the provision of adequate accommodation for this board, for the Tourist Board or for any other board operating on behalf of this country abroad, but I think that accommodation should be in keeping with the country's ability to pay for it and with the return which we shall get.  I wonder could the Minister give us any idea of the proposals that have come before them for the purchase of accommodation in London, even rough proposals, or an approximate idea of what it is proposed to expend on the purchase of such a building, whether he anticipates any loss in letting the portion not required by the board and if so how much?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals at this stage are too indefinite to enable me to give any information to the House. In any event, as the Seanad will appreciate, negotiations of this nature are often better pursued if that can be done without the glare of publicity. So far as the possibility of a loss being incurred is concerned I do not believe that will be the case.  If Córas Tráchtála succeed in acquiring adequate premises they should be sufficiently attractive to enable them to pay their way at least, so that outgoings would be offset by the return from lettings. <Col N="1116" /> At least that is my hope, but one cannot at this stage be assured that this can be achieved.</P>
      <P>While a loss is not envisaged, this is a body dependent on voted money having no funds of their own.  The purpose of Section 4 or a part of Section 4 is to enable the Minister for Industry and Commerce with the consent of the Minister for Finance to give them a guarantee to meet any possibility of loss being incurred in outgoings as against the income from the premises.  It is hoped that no such loss will occur but Córas Tráchtála will be able to negotiate more effectively once they have provision for such a guarantee behind them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very short Bill, the main purpose of which is to make provision for the continuation of the grant schemes operated by Bord Fáilte Éireann for the development of holiday accommodation.  This is being done by increasing from £500,000 to £1.5 million the special fund established for the purpose under Section 2 (1) (b) of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1959.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Bord Fáilte grant schemes, cash grants of 20 per cent are available towards the cost of providing additional hotel bedrooms, either in new hotels or in additions to existing hotels.  Grants of 20 per cent are also available for general improvement works in existing hotels such as the provision of central heating, the conversion of bedrooms into bed/bath units and other structural improvements. Two new grant schemes were added in July, 1962, under which 20 per cent grants are available for the construction or improvement of accommodation for staff and for the <Col N="1117" /> provision of entertainment facilities for guests, for example, recreation rooms, tennis courts, putting greens and so on.  Hoteliers also have the advantage of a State guaranteed loan scheme which assists them to raise capital on favourable terms, and Bord Fáilte pay grants from their general funds towards the interest charges on moneys borrowed, whether under guarantee or not, for construction or improvement works.  Hoteliers qualify for a remission for seven years of two-thirds of local rates on new buildings or improvements and there are also income tax allowances in respect of expenditure incurred on development works.</P>
    <P>As a result of the incentives available, the volume of accommodation&mdash; which a few years ago was a major bottleneck in the tourist industry&mdash;has increased substantially.  The total number of registered rooms in hotels and guest houses increased from 16,642 in 1958 to 19,630 at the beginning of this year, an increase of almost 3,000. Approximately 1,800 rooms were added in the top grades&mdash;A Star and A&mdash;and nearly 1,500 in grades B and B/C.  Accommodation in the lower two grades, C and D showed a fall of nearly 300 rooms but not all these rooms were lost to the tourist industry as they include establishments which improved their premises and were upgraded.</P>
    <P>The most publicised aspect of the hotel development programme has been the building of new top grade accommodation, especially the new Intercontinental Hotels in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  The opening of these hotels and the extension of existing first-class hotels are welcome developments because until now we have not been able to meet the demand for first-class accommodation.  Tour promoters and travel agents have been reluctant to promote certain categories of traffic to this country because of our inability to guarantee accommodation for the requisite standard and much business, especially from North America, has been lost as a result. We will now be in a position to cater adequately for this traffic.  The Intercontinental Hotels will form part of an international chain of hotels and <Col N="1118" /> will enjoy the active support of the sales and promotional effort of the Irish Air Companies, who are substantial shareholders, and of Pan American Airways who are associated with the project throught their subsidiary company, Intercontinental Hotels Incorporated.  I should like to make it clear that these hotels do not offer accommodation in the luxury category. They are classifiable by international standards, not as luxury hotels, but as topgrade hotels and they will fill a definite want in our new tourist structure. I have no doubt that considerable new business will accrue to this country through these hotels and that the benefits will be evident in our future tourist income.</P>
    <P>Targets in top grade accommodation are now assured and, for some time past, Bord Fáilte have not been prepared to encourage additional expansion of first class accommodation except where the promoter is in a position to generate additional business for the extra accommodation.</P>
    <P>The opening of the new hotels has received so much publicity that there appears to be an impression that the expansion of hotel accommodation has been confined to the top grade.  This, of course, is not the case.  The current Bord Fáilte Guide to hotels and guest houses has 1,226 more rooms in Grade B and 252 more in Grade B/C than in 1958.  There is, however, still a need for development of accommodation in these grades&mdash;in some cases for extension, in others for modernisation and improvement.  Existing hotels in the middle and lower grades tend to be on the small side.  Grades B/C, C and D account for 58 per cent of the total number of hotels but only 35 per cent of the total number of hotel rooms. The average size of hotels in these grades is 14 rooms and there are 80 hotels with less than ten rooms.  In addition, many hotels in these grades would benefit from modernisation work but only 8 per cent of them have utilised the Bord Fáilte improvement grant schemes.</P>
    <P>The fact that Bord Fáilte have succeeded in attracting investment by international first class hotel operators has led to a suggestion that the Board have concentrated on the top grade <Col N="1119" /> to the exclusion of the middle and lower grades.  I would like to make it clear, however, that the grants for the development of accommodation have since their inception been equally available in respect of all grades.  The fact that progress in the top grades has been more significant is not due to any lack of encouragement from Bord Fáilte for hoteliers in the lower grades contemplating extensions or improvements. Bord Fáilte must of course insist on certain minimum standards, and the Bord operate an advisory service for those who need it.  The fact that 1,500 extra rooms are now available in Grades B and B/C, in different parts of the country, is proof of a positive promotional policy on the part of Bord Fáilte towards the provision of middle-grade accommodation.  The number of applicants, however, has simply not been sufficient.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from all this that despite the progress made by the hotel industry in recent years we cannot claim that all problems have been solved or that nothing more remains to be done.  I, therefore, asked Bord Fáilte some time ago to undertake a complete examination of the whole position in regard to accommodation for visitors.  I am anxious to ensure that current needs and requirements are identified and that policies are directed towards meeting those requirements. Bord Fáilte have now carried out this review and have conveyed to me their views as to the manner in which the programme for accommodation development should be directed in the future.  There are many aspects of this question that must be given careful consideration and these are now receiving my attention.  The matter is complex because the problems and considerations arising are not identical for all categories and grades of accommodation or for all parts of the country.  Whatever the emphasis in future policies, it is clear that the grant schemes must be maintained for a further period.</P>
    <P>As the original fund of £500,000 has been exhausted new legislation is necessary to enable further moneys to be made available to Bord Fáilte.  Grant <Col N="1120" /> commitments in the present financial year will amount to over £300,000 and it is necessary to provide at least £350,000 for the continuation of the schemes after this year; that makes about £650,000.  Bord Fáilte hope to secure the provision of additional accommodation of the holiday camp or holiday village type and this could involve grants of a further £120,000. In addition, we may need additional grant moneys, amounting possibly to £200,000, to stimulate development of new middle-grade hotels in resort areas not already adequately served by medium-priced accommodation.  These figures are, of course, very tentative but they indicate the possible future requirements.  I am proposing, therefore, that a new limit of £1.5 million be placed on the holiday accommodation fund, enabling additional moneys not exceeding £1 million to be paid to Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>Payments from the fund will be by way of annual grant-in-aid to Bord Fáilte, and will be subject to approval of Dáil Éireann as part of the Vote for my Department.  Moneys paid to the Board from this fund are additional to their annual grant for publicity, promotion and other general activities and to the money voted annually from the special fund for the development of major tourist resorts.  These latter funds are voted under separate legislation and are not affected by the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart from hotel development, Bord Fáilte are also giving close attention to the position in regard to other forms of accommodation for visitors.  Guest houses can obtain assistance for development work under the guaranteed loan and interest grant schemes. In the last few years, Bord Fáilte have extended their activities to take in the inspection and listing of unregistered holiday accommodation and there are now available in respect of almost all the holiday and angling centres lists showing the boarding houses and private houses which offer accommodation for guests as well as houses available for renting by visitors.  These lists show a total of 3,370 bedrooms providing room for 5,240 people. Accommodation for visiting students <Col N="1121" /> is also being listed, and lists are now available with accommodation for 400 students.  The possibilities presented by colleges and other institutions which are vacant for a period during the summer are also being examined. Bord Fáilte now have a list of farmhouses which offer holiday facilities and they hope to develop this type of holiday attraction in future years. Particular attention is being given to the possibilities of enabling the small farm areas of the country to benefit to a greater extent from tourism, and I hope that these developments may also lead to further extensions of An Óige's chain of Youth Hostels.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the hotel industry which I would like to mention here even though it does not arise specifically from the present Bill, that is, the question of staff training.  With the expansion of accommodation the shortage of qualified staff has become a fairly serious problem and, in order to deal with it, Bord Fáilte, in conjunction with the hotel industry, the trade union concerned and vocational education interests, have established a new organisation to undertake responsibility for an expanded programme of staff recruitment and training.  This body is entitled the Council for Education Recruitment and Training in the Hotel and Catering Trade or, briefly, CERT.</P>
    <P>Initially, half the cost of this new arrangement will be borne by Bord Fáilte and the balance by the other interests concerned.  The substantial Bord Fáilte support will be necessary in the early stages to ensure that the expanded training programme gets under way but I would hope that in due course the hotel industry and those engaged in it will assume increasing responsibility for matters pertaining to staff training and that CERT will ultimately evolve into an organisation supported by the hotel industry itself. I would hope that an industry as large and as significant as the hotel and catering industry would aspire to an organisation of professional status concerning itself not only with practical questions of staff recruitment and training but also with the general question of raising professional standards in the industry.  I recognise, <Col N="1122" /> however, that the hotel industry is not yet sufficiently organised to undertake anything on this scale at the present time.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, therefore, that Bord Fáilte should not only give direct financial support in the early stages but should also assist in the collection of the hotel industry's contribution. This has been agreed with the Irish Hotels Federation.  I propose, therefore, to authorise Bord Fáilte to take account of the need to provide for the activities of CERT when prescribing registration fees.  This will, of course, entail increased fees but I am confident that proprietors of registered premises will recognise and appreciate that the money will be applied towards the provision of qualified personnel for the industry.  It must be remembered that the trade union and the vocational education authorities are also prepared to make their contribution.  The hotel industry has received, and under this Bill will continue to receive, very substantial State assistance and it is not unreasonable that it should make this contribution towards the solution of the staffing problem.</P>
    <P>The hotel industry is more active and enterprising to-day than at any time in the past.  The fact that the £500,000 grant fund provided in 1959 has been exhausted is an indication of the rise in the rate of investment of the industry because the Bord Fáilte grants, being limited to 20 per cent. of approved works, must be matched at least four-fold by hoteliers' own spending. In fact, total investment in hotel development has been running at more than £1 million each year.  There is, of course, a long way to go before the hotel industry can be regarded as fully equipped to meet the challenge of increasing competition and the other difficulties facing the tourist industry. There is a need to adopt up-to-date ideas in regard to lay-out, equipping and management of hotels including more modern methods of accounting and record keeping.  Some hotels have come together to engage in co-operative advertising and promotion but there is scope for much more activity of this kind.  Hoteliers must be prepared to study available markets and, where necessary, to go out after <Col N="1123" /> business, sharing the costs where advisable on a group basis.  I know that rising costs are a problem for hoteliers as for everybody else but this makes it all the more important that our hotels should offer comfort, efficiency, and above all good value.</P>
    <P>Figures now available relating to last year's tourist season show that the forebodings which were voiced in relation to a recession were not justified. The gross earnings from visitors, including the net visitor receipts of Irish transport companies, amount to £46.5 million, in 1961, and the 1962 figure, calculated on the same basis, came to £48.9 million, an increase of £2.4 million or 5 per cent.  Since 1957, when our visitor income was £32.4 million, the increase has been £16.5 million or 50 per cent and, even allowing for the change in money values since then, this represents a very real increase in the value of tourism in the economy.  It must be said, however, that the rate of growth in 1962 was lower than over the past five years generally.  Bord Fáilte believe that the slowing-down of the rate of growth in 1962 was caused by special conditions and they expect the upward trend in the number of visitors to continue.  If we are to reap the benefit of this increase it is essential that accommodation be available to meet the needs of all categories of visitors, that traffic should not be diverted from Ireland because accommodation of the requisite kind and at the right price level is not available. The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that the incentives for the provision of the necessary accommodation will continue to operate and I, therefore, confidently recommend the Bill for your approval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have just had a good example of how a Minister can come to the Seanad and look for authority&mdash;I suppose the Seanad has authority&mdash;to spend more money and make a case for that expenditure. In contrast to what we heard previously, the Minister has told us what has been accomplished by the money already expended, and what it is hoped to accomplish with the money he is seeking in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> I am concerned about two aspects of the tourist industry.  I suppose, being in the trade union business&mdash;and it is a business&mdash;I have some experience of travelling around and I know the type of service given, the accommodation provided, and the prices charged.  May I illustrate what I want to say by giving an example?  Last Monday I travelled to an important town down south.  I suppose the hotel in which I stayed was hardly above B or C class.  I had a meat tea for which I was charged 10/6d.  To test that charge I had exactly the same meal coming back in the train the following night.  The charge on the train was approximately two-thirds of what I was charged in the hotel.  The food, the service, and the whole presentation, were infinitely better on the train.  I imagine the charges which had to be met by the people supplying the service were different in the sense that the people employed on the train, cooking and serving the food, were employed at trade union wages.  I doubt very much if that was the position in the hotel.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned with the tendency of hoteliers around the country to increase their prices unjustifiably. I am very much afraid they will kill the goose that lays the golden egg.  I am struck on many occasions by the alarm that is expressed by tourists, and particularly English tourists, when they go into a hotel which they imagine will have reasonable prices&mdash;a hotel that is not a Grade A hotel&mdash;and are faced with charges like that.  From my experience, those charges have gone up about 50 per cent in the past two years.  I quite admit that the people operating the hotels have had to face increased charges, too, but I wonder whether an increase in the price of meals to that extent is fully justified.</P>
    <P>What I am concerned about is that by this too easy approach to increasing prices, they will frighten away tourists, and particularly tourists from Great Britain, who can be the best spenders when they come to this country.  They are quite prepared to spend, but when they get the impression that they are being overcharged, they will not come <Col N="1125" /> again, and their friends will be equally slow to come to Ireland.  All our promotion, and the advertising which is done admirably by Bord Fáilte, all the efforts to improve the standard of our hotels, all the money which is well expended and worthwhile, will be wasted, and thrown away, by the attitude of some hoteliers who are trying to get rich too quickly.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has any responsibility or function in this matter. I know he would be equally against overcharging.  It may be said that it is wrong to draw attention to this overcharging.  I do not think so.  My words will not carry any publicity.  I appeal to the Minister to use his influence, and the influence of Bord Fáilte, to discourage that too easy approach of people upping their charges, simply because enough visitors are not coming to the country, and they will not get rich quickly.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which was touched upon by the Minister in his speech is the desirability and necessity for providing proper accommodation for staff, and more especially, and equally essential, proper training for staff.  In the hotel industry we are fortunate in that we have union organised workers in the bigger centres.  This is a particularly progressive union, or a particularly progressive branch of the union.  It sticks out to anyone in the trade union movement that it is a particularly progressive branch which is concerned about the future of the industry in so far as they are organised and are improving the standard and the training of their people.  The Minister knows and appreciates that position.</P>
    <P>Outside the larger centres, however, the employees, the workers in the hotel industry are unorganised and are to a great extent seasonal employees.  It is not through any fault of theirs that they are not properly trained to cook the food or to serve the food at the table.  It is, unfortunately, true that you can go to many hotels in the country and find that the waiters have just been employed a few weeks before the summer influx of visitors arrive.  They are not properly trained and I doubt very much if they <Col N="1126" /> are paid very much, except what they might pick up in tips.  Again, they are let go immediately the summer season is over.</P>
    <P>I am glad that an effort is being made to lift the level of training in this very important arm of industry but I would also appeal to the Minister to use his influence to help in the creation of a joint labour committee, if that is the appropriate phrase, to lay down minimum rates of pay and minimum conditions in the hotel industry generally.  There is a great need for this where the staff are not fully organised.  It is essential that the people taken into those hotels should be paid reasonable wages and given reasonable conditions of employment. I think, in the present context, that can only be done by the establishment of a joint labour committee.  I shall not delay the Minister further.  I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very impressed by the Minister's statement because it seemed to me&mdash;just casually as a member of the public&mdash;that there were many things wrong with our tourist policy but it is clear, I think, that, as a member of the public, I was not as well informed as I ought to be.  I was extremely impressed by the Minister's general statement, his general review of the tourist position, but there are certain things which give me concern and I should like to echo&mdash;I am sure the Minister has heard this many times before&mdash;Senator Murphy on the question of over-charging.</P>
      <P>He has had his experiences.  I have had mine and I should like to tell the House for a moment of an experience I had last year when I took my wife and two of my children to stay in a hotel in the west of Ireland for a long week-end, three days and a bit more. Quite clear in the hall of the hotel was a Bord Fáilte statement that the charge per day for a stay of over three days was so much.  In fact, when I came to pay my bill at the end of my stay, I was charged for every single item we had had.  Breakfast was separate, lunch separate, dinner and tea separate and, as a matter of fact, I was charged for a number of drinks which I had not had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" /> I might remind the House that the story I have told was of my experience of overcharging in this hotel in the west of Ireland where I spent three days with my wife and children. I was charged item by item for every meal that my family had eaten.  When I came to pay the Bill and saw these items set out one by one I spoke to the cashier and said: &ldquo;You have got in the hall a notice which says that if there is a stay over three days the charge is per day and not per itimised meal&rdquo;.  I was told that this had been completely done away with and that you had to spend an entire week in the hotel before you got a reduction in charges, so I paid the bill.  I thought that seemed excessive but I did not know what the rules were at the time.</P>
    <P>However, as we were driving home my younger daughter said: &ldquo;That was a very nice manager in the hotel, daddy, but I could not make him understand that you were not English.&rdquo; I do not know why he should have thought that I was English, but for some reason he did.  I am afraid this started the penny dropping, and when I got home I started to look up the Bord Fáilte regulations and saw that there was in the list of charges an item for this particular hotel showing that it was per day over three days. I telephoned to Bord Fáilte and asked them whether there had been any change in that for this particular hotel and they said No.  I sat down after that and wrote to the manager&mdash;on the paper of Seanad Éireann, as a matter of fact&mdash;and pointed this out to him.  I got a most apologetic letter by return and a cheque which I think was for £7 or £8.</P>
    <P>The significant thing in that particular story, it seems to me, is that there was this overcharging which was raised, and was denied initially, and we were thought to be English.  I do not know whether that sort of thing was done in that hotel this year, because I have heard no instances of it, but I have heard that in a number of places all over the country people were being overcharged.  In the case of English people they would pay, think that they <Col N="1128" /> were paying too much but would not make a fuss as I did.</P>
    <P>I know that Bord Fáilte have certain powers in cases of overcharging brought to their notice.  Possibly they have power to strike hotels off the list or to issue some warning or something of that kind.  It is difficult to get people to report these things.  I should like the Minister, if he has the figures available, to tell us apart from the powers Bord Fáilte have in these cases how often these powers have been exercised, because it seems to me to be an extremely serious matter that hotels in different parts of the country are and have been overcharging, and that not merely should the most serious view be taken but the most serious action should be taken by Bord Fáilte in places in which this overcharging is drawn to their attention, because eventually, as Senator Murphy has rightly said, the result will be that people will go back to Britain and other places and say: &ldquo;Irish hotels are very nice.  They give you a céad míle fáilte; but they certainly take your money all right.&rdquo;  That is not going to do the tourist industry any good at all in the long run.</P>
    <P>On the question raised by Senator Murphy about food, I should like to see fewer menus in French, because there seems to be a general view in many hotels, particularly second class hotels, that if you put the menu into French you need not do anything about the food&mdash;as long as the menu is in French everyone will think that he is getting marvellous food.  But visitors to hotels soon get wise to that one.  It would be far better to have menus in English but the food better.</P>
    <P>I should like to see some system of linking the training which is being given to chefs and managers through the auspices of Bord Fáilte to the recommendations of hotels.  If it were practicable, I should like to see in the annual list of hotels some note, star or indication of some kind that the cook, chef, or manager as the case might be had gone through some course recognised by Bord Fáilte. There is certainly an idea prevalent that if you do a little bit of cleaning up of your hotel, put new wallpaper on the walls, repaint the woodwork <Col N="1129" /> and increase the number of basins and lavatories, you need not do very much about the food and service as long as you put the menu in French.  That is not going to do us any good at all.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy spoke about meals on trains.  I should like to make a plea to the Minister about this if it is within his power.  Any time I have gone on the Cork train and had a meal, particularly breakfast, I have noticed that I am given knife, fork and spoon&mdash;only one knife.  I would have thought that CIE could afford to give its travellers two knives with breakfast when it consists of bacon and eggs.  This, of course, is only a little thing, but, again, it creates a bad impression on a visitor if he has to take the knife he used with his bacon and eggs, wipe it on the bread, and then put butter or marmalade on top of what he has wiped the bacon and eggs with.</P>
    <P>In today's paper there was the very welcome news that a ferry service for motor cars coming here is coming at last and we should have it in three years' time.  In a peak period it will bring in something like 2,000 cars. On an estimate, that will mean 2,000 or 3,000 additional travellers in this country, perhaps 5,000 in a peak week during the summer.  In addition, the air service, and the sea service, will presumably be increasing as well, so, in three years' time, all being well, we will have an increased tourist population, certainly for certain periods.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested to hear from the Minister's speech that Bord Fáilte are satisfied that their policy of supporting luxury hotels is more or less at an end, and that they will pay attention to the ordinary Grade B and C type of hotel.  Here, the need is very great because I still feel that while it is very attractive to get people from North America, and send them around on package tours, to stay in first-class hotels, and to attract rich business men and rich Americans of all kinds to stay in the luxury hotels, our tourist trade should not depend primarily on those people.  That means greater attention will have to be given to the medium type hotel which will cater for the not so well off American, <Col N="1130" /> and the average tourist who comes here from the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that one of the great difficulties Bord Fáilte have is that the grants are available, as the Minister said, both for the bigger and the smaller type hotel, and that the bigger type hotel has made application, but so far it has been hard to get the smaller hotel and boarding house to apply.  If they will not apply, it seems to me that the logical conclusion must be that Ostlanna Iompair Éireann will have to go into the small hotel business themselves, and the development of the medium type hotel will have to be undertaken by a State organisation. If in three years' time we are to have this increased tourist population.  We must be able to cater for them.  It would do far more harm than good to land 8,000 or 10,000 people in this country if we had no place for them to go to.  They will want to travel all over the country.  They will have their cars with them, and they will not be content to stay in the same place in Cork, Limerick or Dublin.  The development must be that either the small hotels will have to wake themselves up, or the State will have to show them the way, because the type of hotel we need now is the motel type, or the ordinary popular family type hotel where charges are reasonable and to which a family of ordinary means from our own country or from overseas&mdash; and particularly from Britain&mdash;can go.</P>
    <P>There is one final point I should like to make.  I should like to see more co-operation with the Ulster Tourist Board.  I know there are considerable difficulties, and I know well that it is not the fault of the Minister that there is no apparent co-operation yet, but I should very much like to see an appeal to &ldquo;Come to Ireland&rdquo;.  The appeal in all our advertisements is to come to Ireland but, in fact, it means to come to the Republic.  I should like to see a joint appeal put out to people to come to the Republic and go to the North, and to go to the North and come to the Republic, and make a round tour, with the help and blessing of the Ulster Tourist Board and Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word of praise here for <i>Ireland of The Welcomes</i>.  It is <Col N="1131" /> an excellent magazine and probably does more good in a quiet, unassuming way for the tourist industry, than any magazine, or any article in any magazine I know.  I should like to see the appeal of <i>Ireland of The Welcomes</i> spread to the North of Ireland.  There are innumerable ways in which there could be co-operation between here and the North.  Only the other day I came across an example which seemed to me to be quite absurd.  A friend of mine who lives in England wanted to come here and hire a car and take it to the North.  He discovered that under some regulation which they have in Northern Ireland, as a resident of the United Kingdom he was not allowed to drive a car with a Republic registration in the North.  That seems to be completely silly.  The reverse is not true.  With a little co-operation between the two parts of the country, I am sure that sort of thing could be ironed out, and other little knots could also be ironed out which would be of great benefit to our tourist industry, and the tourist industry of Northern Ireland, in other words, of Ireland as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly I should like to join in the tribute which was paid to the Minister for the manner in which he asked the House for this further £1½ million.  I must say he made his case very fully, and he treated the House seriously.  He came in here convinced that this is one of the Houses of the Oireachtas, and that he should treat it as such, and make his case to it.  Certainly, with other Senators, I appreciate that very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are just two points I want to touch on.  One has already been dealt with by Senator Murphy, and, very effectively, by Senator Ross.  It is the fact that most of the hotels in this country seem to be determined to kill the goose that is laying the golden egg. Senator Ross apparently was mistaken for an English gentleman.  I think it is unlikely that I would be so mistaken by anybody but, as recently as yesterday afternoon, in this city of Dublin in quite an ordinary hotel, I was charged the sum of 19/- for some steak, vegetables, cheese and coffee.  I think I can say to the House that that <Col N="1132" /> is a charge which is beyond the average, or even above the average, income group.  If the Minister has any influence with these hotels I think he should try and encourage them to make more reasonable charges.  I might say, in that charge of 19/-, there was a 10 per cent service charge.  I just wonder whether a further 2½ per cent, which will now become operative as the result of one of the Minister's trips to the other House since he came in here, will be added on to hotel charges, and instead of 10 per cent added on to the hotel bill the hotel managers will add on 12½ per cent.  If they do, I think it will certainly increase the cost of eating out and it will damage the tourist industry.  I say that in all seriousness.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to deal with.  The Minister was kind enough to say it was outside the scope of the Bill when he informed me that he was providing money through Bord Fáilte to train hotel staff.  I think, speaking for myself, hotels give reasonably good employment to their employees.  I wonder if the Minister has received any serious complaints from the hotel staff.  I listened attentively to Senator Murphy and I gathered that he had not any real complaints to make against hotel managements for the way they treated their hotel staff.</P>
    <P>Vocational education committees, I think, do good work in providing scholarships to enable pupils leaving technical schools to take a course of training in hotel work of one type or another.  I know one vocational committee which finds it difficult to have those scholarships taken up and I feel that that is due in no small degree to the fact that some responsible members of these committees discourage and dissuade pupils from going in for hotel work on the grounds that they are badly treated, that it is blind alley employment and that they will get insufficient wages and bad conditions.</P>
    <P>I know at least one committee in this country where a responsible member of the Oireachtas has made those pronouncements on a number of occasions.  I know another vocational committee in a totally different <Col N="1133" /> part of the country where a somewhat similar campaign was carried out.  I know one swallow does not make a summer but I think, by and large, if there is reasonably good employment given for well-trained staff, then the Minister, either himself, or through his colleague, the Minister for Education, should instruct the CEO's in the various committees to bring before the pupils the advantages to be gained from accepting these scholarships. Either the Minister or his colleague, the Minister for Education, should encourage the vocational education committees to provide these scholarships and should give sufficient publicity, either through the schools, or otherwise, to ensure that the scholarships will be taken up and that the hotel business in general will not be misrepresented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House except to suggest to the Minister that in future legislation provision should be made, now that the top grade hotel industry has been catered for and that we are now to concentrate on the Grade B and C hotels, for financial support to those people who are catering in angling centres.  I was hoping that provision might be made in this Bill in this regard but I see there is no provision. In the counties of Leitrim, Longford, Monaghan, Cavan, all inland counties, the people are catering for the angling tourists in their own private houses and are providing the necessary accommodation&mdash;accommodation which has been scheduled by Bord Fáilte as suitable accommodation for these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have personal knowledge of cases where people actually increased their accommodation, and, unfortunately, when they applied to the Department of Local Government for grants they were turned down on the grounds that they were providing increased accommodation for their business.  It is rather unfortunate as some of them have spent a considerable sum of money in the hope that they would get a grant from the Department of Local Government.  But, the Department are keeping a cautious eye on the particular sums they pay and saying <Col N="1134" /> that these people do not qualify for a housing grant.  I would ask the Minister to consider this particular aspect of the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister, in the case of the development of the major resorts, that consideration should be given to the centres I have already mentioned in regard to the amenities for coarse fishing, anglers and other tourists.  I see, from my own personal experience, that people are coming inland more than heretofore. They are discovering the country and they are inclined to stay in those places.  I would suggest that those areas I have mentioned, while they have not got the attractions of some of the major resorts, should be given some provision for their development, and especially for the amenities which they have for coarse fishing, the angler, his wife and his family.</P>

      <P>Over and over again, I have referred to the evil smelling fumes from some of our industries which envelop this city with a deplorable stench.  I would ask the Minister if he could do anything to force the industrialists to control the menace, or could Bórd Fáilte use some of the money being voted to it to do something?  I have seen crowds of visitors, as well as ordinary citizens, mothers and children, being positively driven out of St. Stephen's Green because of this menace.  I wonder whether the Minister can do anything about this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief in my comments.  A good deal of criticism has been made in regard to the industry through what we might terms rural Ireland in regard to charges.  That evidently is true up to a certain point. <Col N="1135" /> There are, of course, outstanding hotels where there are fixed charges, as any of us know who travel through the country.  They have fixed charges summer and winter and they are quite above board in regard to what the costs are.  But, apparently, when the tourist season comes along, other people in the catering industry feel that that is the time to reap a harvest.  That, of course, is bound to injure the tourist industry, the success of which so interests everybody.  I think the Minister and Bord Fáilte might examine the possibility of implementing some type of new regulation, in view of the fact that the taxpayer, through the Government, is contributing towards the building up of the hotel industry.</P>
      <P>As far as I can understand from the Minister's statement, no distinction is made on the question of grants. Whether you live in the city, in the country, or in some remote district, a grant is provided, if the case made is just, under the conditions necessary for getting a grant.  Conditions are the same in regard to loans, provided the person concerned, or the particular proprietor, qualifies.  The question of the district in which he lives makes no difference, or at least it is not stated in the Minister's statement that there is any difference.  He will get the same concession as if he were resident in a big industrial area like Dublin, Cork, Limerick or Waterford or in any of the big towns.  They also get the same consideration in regard to interest charges on moneys borrowed whether under guarantee for construction or improvement works.  It does not matter what way they are situated when a grant, loan, or relief by way of interest charges is given.  That is very important because that relief is not given to industry in general, if I understand the position rightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the building industry, where houses are built for our people in big industrial centres, the interest charges go on to the costs&mdash;loan charges outside of the grants, of course.  They have to pay interest charges, whatever they may be&mdash;and they are pretty high.  It all goes on to the person who builds his own house in any of these places. <Col N="1136" /> If I understand the position rightly, there is no relief as regards interest charges.  I am not objecting to that.  I think it is a good thing to see that as far as any relief can be given in the tourist industry it is given.</P>
    <P>The returns from the industry in the different parts of the country should be about the same.  The charges should be equivalent whether the hotel is in rural Ireland or in Dublin, Cork, or anywhere else.  In that way, I think that people who come from England or America or anywhere else would have no grievance in travelling through the country.  Usually, they remain in a certain place for a short period and then move on.  If the charges are uniform, the tourists cannot grumble.  Even if the charges are high, if the tourist gets good service and good food he can have no grievance.  The grievance appears to be that the charges in a number of cases are not uniform, or as near as possible to being uniform. I think that is where the Minister and Bord Fáilte come in.  They should see that an organisation is set up to deal with that aspect of the matter and that as far as possible charges are reasonably uniform&mdash;not completely, perhaps, but reasonably so.  We cannot have a perfect system.  The charges should be cheaper in the country because it is possible that overhead charges are lower there.  On the other hand, of course, the turnover of business may be less.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether right through the country the charges stated on the menu cards are uniform.  We know that in industrial centres and in cities the charges are stated on the menu cards. People know what is on the menu card and they know what the price is, but I wonder is that general.  If it were general, I think we would not have heard grievances such as we had aired here a few moments ago by a Senator. I should like hear the Minister on those points regarding charges.  It is not easy to have a perfect system but I think it would be well if those points could be considered.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of staff and rates of wages.  In the main industrial centres, where there is organisation, everybody knows what the <Col N="1137" /> wage rates paid to the staff are.  It is important that, as far as possible, there should be minimum rates regardless of whether it is a hotel or guesthouse, or whatever it might be, which is employing labour.  Perhaps, the trade union concerned, which caters principally for the workers in the major centres, and Bord Fáilte might have that examined for the purpose of the setting up of minimum rates.  Though, in general, there are no complaints, I have got them from time to time to the effect that rates are far from uniform for some workers in the industry.  I should like to hear the Minister on this point.</P>

      <P>First of all, I should like to thank Senators for the very helpful, friendly and constructive debate.  Senators know that hotels that are registered with Bord Fáilte must publish their maximum prices including the arrangements for <i>pension</i> and there is a column in the Bord Fáilte guide which expresses the <i>pension</i> terms for three days or over and for weekly terms and if people find that they are not being charged according to the published statement which is supposed to be on view in the hotel they should, first of all, try to make a settlement with the hotel itself and if they are unable to do so they should complain to Bord Fáilte who will take up the matter.  Bord Fáilte have the right to remove from the register a hotel which breaks the rule regarding the establishment of charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hotel charges do vary from season to season and maximum hotel charges in the very high season or for special occasions such as some local festival are also indicated in the Bord Fáilte guide.  I should make it clear that the practice of making differential charges throughout the year is widespread <Col N="1138" /> throughout Europe and although one has a feeling that it would be a very good thing if hotels could maintain the same charges throughout the year, the practice is virtually universal and is found in the most respectable hotels outside Ireland so the fact that the charges go up steeply at a certain time of the year is not anything that is unusual.</P>
    <P>It would be very hard for me to say whether hotels as a whole are charging too much.  I very much doubt it.  I have made such examination as I can of the question.  Apart from the advice I have got from Bord Fáilte, I have, naturally having an inquisitive mind, looked at various guide books and lists of approved hotels in Great Britain and the Michelin guide in the case of France and I do not have any evidence that hotels wide and large are charging high prices by comparison with other countries.</P>
    <P>Obviously, there are exceptions. There may be hotels which are not giving good value for the prices they do charge but I could not possibly admit that, judged by foreign comparison, general price levels are excessive. I could not see that nor could I find evidence to point to this.  It is true that we could improve our standards in a number of respects.  The standard of food has improved a great deal and could improve still more.</P>
    <P>What we all deplore are the exceptions, gross overcharging such as is indicated by Senator Murphy.  I know that there are places of quite modest character where considerable sums are charged for meat teas, far beyond those that seem reasonable.  They are setting a bad example and they do harm to hotels that make reasonable charges for the same type of meal.  I myself have expressed publicly the hope that hotels will be careful to avoid overcharging.  Having increased their prices to cover the eighth round increases in wages, they should take a long-term view of their profit situation. Bord Fáilte also point out the necessity for being careful in this regard and I hope as a result that hotels generally, observing the situation and seeing that in 1962, because of bad weather and a slight financial recession, <Col N="1139" /> the increase in the number of people coming here failed to show the same rate of growth as in the previous year, they will all take a sensible and sane attitude towards the matter. There is no reason to suppose that they will not.</P>
    <P>I have been asked about the number of complaints Bord Fáilte received in a given year.  In the last year of which I have a record there were 548 complaints including such matters as poor accommodation, inefficient service and overcharging.  I am glad to say that in a number of cases overcharging was settled fairly quickly and in some cases the overcharging was a genuine mistake in the account which could have been settled at the time by the customer if he had approached the hotel manager and gone into the question with him or her.</P>
    <P>I cannot say what Bord Fáilte have done regarding the removal of hotels from the register for gross overcharging or malpractice.  I would say that very few have been removed and that warnings are generally effective, but I should not like anything I have said to give the impression to the House that the country is full of profiteering hotels. From all I know and from the letters I have got, not many complaints are received.  I have no evidence by way of letters or protests by responsible bodies of widespread overcharging or abuses in the hotel industry.  I should like to make it clear that it is all the more important to see that the minority of people who overcharge are constrained and encouraged to do so no more.</P>
    <P>On the observations by Senator Murphy regarding staff, I hope that hotelkeepers are coming to realise that it pays to look after staff well.  I know there have been a great deal of improvements in staff conditions in recent years.  More improvements can still come.  The fact that hotels are applying for staff accommodation grants indicates a progressive attitude, the right kind of attitude, that it is ethically right to treat staff well and that it also pays dividends in the long run because a contented staff is one of the most attractive features to visitors <Col N="1140" /> who come here as well as to our own people when they are on holidays.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have nothing to do with wages or staff conditions.  It would be impossible for Bord Fáilte to deal with that matter but it is open to a trade union to apply to the Labour Court for official recognition of a joint labour committee.  That could be done in connection with the hotel industry and in that case minimum wage conditions could be enforceable.</P>
    <P>As Senator Murphy knows, conditions regarding staff differ widely from area to area.  There are some hotels in the depths of the country with a very short season where income to staff on a temporary basis forms a part of the rural economy.  It would be very difficult to integrate wage conditions for that type of staff with those of staff operating in Dublin where it is absolutely true to say that wage conditions should be of the very best kind possible. All I can say, I think, is that as the hotel industry grows more prosperous and in view of the difficulty of procuring staff, wage conditions should improve.  I hope they will improve.  I am encouraging hotelkeepers to improve hotel conditions and the fact that staff is difficult to get will make necessary changes for the better in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross made various observation regarding food served in hotels. There has been a great improvement in food standards.  I have encouraged publicly the naming of dishes using Irish regional names.  The Great Southern Hotels have set an excellent example in giving dishes Irish regional names but Senator Ross must recognise that if food is cooked really well certain types of dishes are universally known and recognised by customers by their French names and we must think of a mixed practice of calling some dishes by Irish regional names, some by traditional French names and describing some in an absolutely simple way.  One cannot make a generalisation.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Ross, courses for chefs are provided in this country. Chefs can be trained and the school in Athenry, for example, is particularly commendable in that regard. <Col N="1141" /> May I again stress that there are no luxury hotels in this country.  Senator Ross, probably accidentally, referred to the ending of Bord Fáilte's campaign for luxury hotels and the extension of their activities now to building up more B and D class accommodation. I have already stated in my speech that a very considerable number of B and C class rooms have been built since 1958 under the Bord Fáilte scheme and I have also stated that no luxury hotels exist in this country according to international standards, only top grade hotels.  I would illustrate that by saying that about 50 per cent of the bed occupancy in a great number of the A class hotels around the country is by Irish people.  Some of this ill-considered talk suggesting that we are building hotels for enormously wealthy, cigar smoking millionaires from various countries who will come here and not be able to appreciate any of the scenery we offer to them, is just ridiculous propaganda.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made by Senator Ross that Ostlanna Iompair Éireann should consider providing accommodation for this need and that if private enterprise does not supply the necessary B and D class accommodation OIE should provide it where needed. We have examined the problem and are in touch with OIE and they are collaborating with Bord Fáilte in our examination of the whole hotel problem, whose solution will form part of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>
    <P>I should add that, as I said in my earlier speech, it is a complex problem. There are places where accommodation is not booked at the present time.  There are places where there would be heavier booking if the existing accommodation were improved. There are places where the season is too short, apparently through lack of original publicity and through the lack of a local development association assisting Bord Fáilte in promoting the June holiday plan for ensuring visitors in June at lower prices and for encouraging every form of amenity and sport and so on, which helps to extend the season.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1142" /> Senator Fitzpatrick spoke of the service charges.  Quite obviously we should not have excessive service charges in this country but in whole countries of Europe the minimum charge is 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators spoke generally on hotel prices.  They asked for uniform charges; they asked me to advert to the charges made by hotels and they spoke of charges during different seasons.  I suggest to them that they should look at the Bord Fáilte hotel guide.  They will see from the prices charged that each hotel exercises a restraining influence quite obviously on others of its class in the country as a whole and in its area.  If Senators would have a look at that guide they would get a better picture of what the position is.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick also spoke of the deprecatory remarks that have been made at meetings of vocational education committees in connection with scholarships offered for hotel training.  This scheme has only just started and Bord Fáilte will be watching the position carefully.  The vocational committees are represented on the central council of CERT, and if it is necessary to take action to give full information about the kinds of jobs available and the conditions attaching to those jobs, and to counteract exaggerated comment by various members of local authorities about the desirability of encouraging young people to go to work in the hotel industry, we can be certain that work will be done, and done adequately, and Bord Fáilte will make sure that the position is properly explained to the public.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney spoke of the need to provide further aid for the smaller type of guesthouse in the fishing areas. Registered guesthouses can get interest free loans and grants, and this is as far as we go at the moment.  In connection with the present plan submitted to me by Bord Fáilte, we are making an examination to see what more needs to be done in connection with that type of accommodation.  In some areas the unregistered accommodation listed by Bord Fáilte is not yet fully taken up, even accommodation where the conditions are satisfactory and where <Col N="1143" /> the houses are thoroughly satisfactory for taking in guests.  All that has to be looked into with great care but the matter is being examined.</P>
    <P>Minor resort development does not really arise on this Bill, but Bord Fáilte have given a certain amount of assistance in connection with minor resort development in the fishing areas. Amenity grants up to 50 per cent are available through the Minister for Local Government, to local authorities, to associations and to individuals for the improvement of just the kind of amenity so valuable for the tourist industry and particularly valuable for families of fishermen who come to the Midlands and central areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Miss Davidson spoke on the question of diesel fumes.  This is not my responsibility, but I am glad to tell the Senator that CIE have at least been able to play their part by renovating the exhaust system of all the Dublin buses.  She will have noticed that the emission of black smoke which was so very prevalent is rapidly diminishing in the bus system generally in Dublin.  The question of diesel fumes is, of course, a matter for the Minister for Health or the Minister for Local Government or both.</P>
    <P>I think that I have covered all the points made in the course of this debate and I once again thank Senators for their friendly attitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might explain to the Minister, I am afraid it is nothing so pleasant as diesel fumes that I am talking about.  I am talking about the fertiliser factories as far as I can make it out along the quays which eject their foul-smelling fumes into the air.  After all, air comes into tourist traffic.  I have raised this before and have even raised it with Bord Fáilte people to tell them they should look after it because it is a very serious thing.  It is just too bad to have foreign visitors think that we could have no better air than the air that comes over Dublin city weekly, and even drives mothers, children and visitors from Stephen's Green and that part of the city.  It has nothing to do with diesel fumes at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Sea Fisheries Act, 1952, which established An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, provided for the making of repayable advances from the Central Fund to the Board for the purpose of enabling them to exercise or perform their functions.  There is a limit on the aggregate amount that may be advanced but this limit has been increased to £3 million by amending Acts.  The advances so far made total £1,522,563 and are being repaid with interest by means of half-yearly instalments of annuities which have been regularly met by the Board.  The 1952 Act rigidly requires repayment of the advances regardless of any exceptional circumstances that may arise.  The purpose of the present Bill is to introduce a degree of flexibility by enabling repayments by the Board to be waived where both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Lands consider that course desirable.  Any amount repayment of which is waived under the Bill must, however, be made good out of voted moneys and thus be publicised in the Fisheries Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In explanation of the background to this measure I should say that, in the development of our sea fishing industry, it would be too much to hope that every item of expenditure would pay dividends; we must be, therefore, prepared to face some losses in the development of the industry.  The bulk of the repayable advances made has been for the provision of boats and gear.  It was important that as many boats as possible should be put into production and, in view of the very limited choice of competent fishing skippers, the element of risk involved in financing hire purchase transactions was inevitably high.  This problem <Col N="1145" /> existed, of course, in the time of the Board's predecessor, the Sea Fisheries Association, and it became necessary to write off some of the advances that had been made to the Association before its dissolution in 1952.  Provision for a deficit of £186,000 appeared in the Fisheries Vote for 1961-62.  On that occasion special legislation was not necessary because the advances had been made from the Fisheries Vote and, unlike the advances made to the Board, there was no Act providing specifically for their repayment.  The present Bill is necessary, however, before we can undertake a similar tidying up process in respect of the advances made to the Board in the past eleven years.</P>
    <P>The difficulties encountered by fishermen in meeting their hire purchase commitments have been recognised by the Government and the Programme of Sea Fisheries Development published as a White Paper last year provided a new deal for the hire purchasers.  Their repayment period was extended tby up to five years, the rate of interest payable by them was reduced to 4 per cent and they all started afresh on the basis of revised annuities from 1st April, 1962.  As an additional incentive a refund of up to 10 per cent of the initial cost of his boat may be granted to a hire purchaser who completes his repayments in less than the extended period allowed.  I may add that grants of 25 per cent of the cost of new boats and new engines are also available now and that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are operating a fleet maintenance scheme which includes free inspection and should greatly reduce loss of fishing time due to break-down of engines and other machinery; other services provided by the Board now will help to improve fishing techniques and develop markets at home and abroad for fish and fishery products.</P>
    <P>Before the introduction of the various incentives I have mentioned. the board had found it necessary to write off as irrecoverable over £100,000 due by hire purchasers and related to the advances made since 1952.  As required by the 1952 Act, however, the board have continued to repay in <Col N="1146" /> full the advances received by them from the Central Fund.  This Bill, which I recommend to the House, will enable us to allow appropriate relief to the board in respect of such advances.</P>

      <P>I have nothing to say on this except to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us how much will be written off under this Bill when it comes into operation.  According to the Parliamentary Secretary's speech here tonight, he will have to agree that there does not seem to be the same degree of prosperity in the fishing industry as the Parliamentary Secretary himself seems to indicate when he is speaking at other places.  Could he give us any reason for this?  I should like to know, if he could tell us, how much will be written off when this Bill becomes law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the Parliamentary Secretary too long.  Personally, I do not like the principle of this Bill at all.  The principle behind this Bill is to allow people who owe large sums of money to the State to go free and give no credit to those who have honoured their commitments and have paid them.  Plenty of people in the country who are fishermen have paid their way all along and these people get no credit for that.  There is no provision in the Bill to refund those people.  There is something wrong with the fishing industry generally.  It is almost an impossibility in the midlands to get what might be called fresh fish.  The fact of the matter is that last Friday week, when the Houses sat, at least 30 people looked for fish in the Dáil restaurant and they could not get it.  That is something which should not happen. If it happens in this House it will happen in Mullingar and in every town in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something should be done about marketing.  I may be a bit out of order here but it is because there has not been a good market for fish that this Bill is before us today.  Fish had to be destroyed and fishmeal made of it just because there was not a proper market. If that position is not improved, I think we will have other people in a few years' time wanting another Bill to relieve them of their responsibilities. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will not have to bring in another such Bill. If people have boats and will not pay for them, their default should not be allowed to continue over a long period. If whoever is responsible for giving money is not satisfied that they will get back that money, I think the <Col N="1148" /> period for which they are in a position to refuse to pay their instalments should be reduced.  When we see people not inclined to pay, the boats should be withdrawn from them and given to someone who will pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be some misconception about the purpose of this Bill on the part of Senator McAuliffe.  This Bill is not designed to relieve hire purchasers of liabilities which they may have to the Board. The purpose of the Bill is to relieve An Bord Iascaigh Mhara in respect of advances made to them by the Exchequer over the years where the particular assets to which the advances related have been disposed of by the Board at a loss.  It happened, not so much in recent times but over the period since the institution of the Board in 1952, that they had to engage in some unprofitable development activities in order to expand production.  In some of these cases the fishermen who got boats were not successful with them and the Board, as Senator McAuliffe suggested, had to resume ownership of these boats and allocate them to other fishermen. A loss was incurred in respect of these resumed boats&mdash;on their resale second-hand.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, heretofore, by reason of the 1952 Act, have been obliged to repay the full instalments on the advances given to them from the Exchequer in respect of such resumed boats.  The situation now is that well over £100,000 is due by the Board to the Exchequer in respect of assets which the Board no longer possess, that is, boats which have been resumed and resold at a loss and matters of that nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 envisages that in the future, where by reason of any development operation by the Board a similar loss occurs in the development of the industry, the Board may make, to the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Finance, the necessary request to be relieved of such liability.  That is the purpose of the Bill.  In other words, it is putting An Bord Iascaigh Mhara on a footing where they can request to be relieved of the financial obligation to the Exchequer in respect of <Col N="1149" /> assets they no longer have, and on a footing where they can better contribute to the development of the industry as envisaged in the <i>Programme of Sea Fisheries Development</i> published last year.  We want to relieve them of the dead weight of debt which is around their necks, as it were, and which has accumulated since 1952, and give them a fresh start like the fresh start we gave to the hire purchasers in the White Paper published last year.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of the <i>Programme of Sea Fisheries Development</i> was to provide additional incentives so that in future hire purchasers will be able to meet their obligations.  That is why we provided 25 per cent cash grants on the purchase of new boats. We extended the period of repayment to 15 years at a reduced rate of interest of 4 per cent, to facilitate prompt repayment. Where a fisherman pays for his boat in 10 years instead of the agreed 15 years we give a bonus of 10 per cent.  Those are among a number of other incentives which are set out in the Programme.  With the aid of those incentives and the new role of the Board as a development organisation, we hope to see the industry prosper in the future.  There are some welcome signs that that prosperity is already on the way.</P>
    <P>In the year to 31st March last landings of sea fish increased by 10 per cent on the previous year and exports of fish and fishery products reached a record level and increased by 36 per cent over the level of the previous year. One point I should like to emphasise is that there is no selling problem in regard to fish and fishery products at home or on the export market.  The problem is not a problem of selling. The problem is on the catching side. We have to encourage acquisition of better boats, as was mentioned by An Seabhac, and we have to educate and train our fishermen in the most modern techniques.  We have to ensure that there will be greater landings, and we have to increase the catching power of our fleet.  The real problem lies in that direction.  There is a growing home demand and world demand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole key to the problem lies in catching and landing enough fish for the market.  At the moment, the Board are initiating an advisory scheme whereby fishery officials are to be appointed and located around the coast.  They will be in a position to advise fishermen on up-to-date techniques and new methods of fishing.  They will have all the modern information that is needed in regard to improving techniques.  They will be located around the coast in the fishery ports, and they will be like the agricultural advisers who provide advisory services for farmers.</P>
      <P>We have initiated a fleet inspection scheme to ensure that the boats are regularly inspected, and where servicing or engineering work is needed it will be provided.  Where the boats are in need of repair they will be repaired by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  We intend to ensure that the boats are regularly inspected, repaired and serviced, so that they will be in a better condition, and effective from the point of view of production in order to achieve the objective of increasing our landings per boat and our total landings, because it is in that direction the real key to the problem lies, and not on the selling side.</P>
      <P>As I say, the Bill is intended to tidy up the financial situation of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara so that they will be in a better position to perform their role as a development organisation, to help the industry at all levels of production and to provide the necessary advisory services for fishermen and people in the trade who are selling, processing and exporting.  In that role the board can play a very useful part in the future in promoting the well-being of the industry as a whole.</P>

      <P>This Section provides that the Minister for Finance may, at any time, on the recommendation of the Minister for Lands, waive the repayment by the Board.  Will we have independent assessors who will make recommendations?  I should also like to know if a decree is got in court against an individual will, or can, the Minister waive it?  Will he finally dispose of all the deficiencies and defaulters under this Bill?</P>

      <P>I am afraid that the Senator, like Senator McAuliffe, has got the wrong end of it.  This Bill is not concerned with relieving the liability of hire purchasers.  That situation continues as it has been.  If there is considerable default in regard to repayments, the Board may proceed against a particular hire purchaser, resume his boat, and dispose of it to another fisherman who is considered more competent.  This Bill is concerned with moneys owing to the Exchequer in respect of advances made by the Exchequer to the Board.  Heretofore the difficulty of the Board has been that under Section 18 of the Principal Act, even if assets in respect of which advances were made were disposed of by the Board to someone else at a loss &mdash;such as in the case of the German trawlers which have been sold for some years now&mdash;the Board are still repaying to the Exchequer instalments on <Col N="1152" /> advances in respect of assets they no longer possess.</P>
