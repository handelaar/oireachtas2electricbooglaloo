    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide the legislative framework for the comprehensive, orderly and progressive planning and development of cities, towns and rural areas.  The Bill proposes to repeal the Town and Regional Planning Acts, 1934 and 1939, together with certain other statutory provisions which relate to the control of building and development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill recognises the need for a new and more radical approach to planning problems in this country.  The Acts of 1934 and 1939 were adoptive and the planning procedures provided for proved in practice to be so lengthy and cumbersome that local authorities were deterred from producing comprehensive planning schemes for their areas.  As a result, while most local authorities have been enforcing some <Col N="1689" /> measure of planning control, only one planning scheme&mdash;that for the capital, Dublin&mdash;has been prepared under the earlier legislation.  The Dublin scheme, which was made in 1957, has not come into force as examination showed that it contained defects which could not be overcome by amendment&mdash;defects which stemmed from inherent weaknesses in the enabling legislation.  Probably the greatest defect of the Acts was that they failed to stimulate a positive approach to planning.</P>
    <P>The Bill is intended to provide a more workable and flexible planning system to be operated by planning authorities.  The system will enable planning authorities to exercise comprehensive control on development in their areas and, what is more important, to engage in positive development and redevelopment work themselves. It will enable them to facilitate industrial and commercial development and to secure the redevelopment of those parts of built-up areas which have become outmoded, uneconomic or congested; it will also confer wide powers aimed at securing the preservation and improvement of amenities in town and countryside.</P>
    <P>Planning authorities will be required to make development plans for their areas within a period of three years. Each development plan will consist of a written statement of development objectives and a plan to illustrate these objectives.  Certain minima are prescribed.  In the case of cities and towns, these are: zoning of land uses for particular purposes, whether residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural or otherwise; securing the greater convenience and safety of road users and pedestrians by the provision of parking places or road improvements or otherwise; development and renewal of obsolete areas; and preserving and improving amenities.</P>
    <P>For rural areas, the plans must include objectives under the headings of: development and renewal of obsolete areas; preserving and improving amenities; provision of new water supplies and sewerage services; in addition to these minimum requirements, a development plan may indicate objectives for many other purposes <Col N="1690" /> related to the density and layout of developments and for the provision of schools, churches, recreational facilities and other aspects of community planning.</P>
    <P>Progressive expansion in the Irish economy in recent years has brought in its train a considerable increase in constructional activity and in demands on available resources of building land, skilled labour and capital which has served to underline the importance of planning in national physical development.  The associated rise in the standards of living has created new levels of expectation and demand.</P>
    <P>Our policy of aiming at a progressive improvement in the national economy cannot achieve maximum success unless all sectors of national activity are co-ordinated.  In this context a comprehensive system of physical planning is obviously necessary. The direct association between economic planning and physical planning is being increasingly recognised. In its first report the Committee on Housing, Building and Planning of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations have stated that &ldquo;the Committee was strongly of the opinion that the correct approach to the problems of urbanisation, population distribution and settlement due to social and economic development was by way of comprehensive economic and physical surveys leading to the establishment of economic and physical development plans.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The economic progress that has already been achieved in this country has high-lighted several developments that can only be assessed and catered for on the basis of proper research and planning.  As has been the pattern in most other countries, the adoption of more modern methods in agriculture has accelerated a decline in the rural population while the establishment of new industries and the expansion of existing industries has led to an overall growth in urban populations.  The growth in urban population has not, of course, been uniform; the population of some urban areas has increased while that of others has declined. With the projected growth in industrial development, however, it is clear <Col N="1691" /> that the future trend will be for urban populations to grow at the expense of the rural areas.  It is to be expected, however, that a substantial proportion of the population will continue to live in the rural areas and the implementation of the Government's settled policy to improve rural living conditions by the provision of better housing, water and sewerage facilities will be so planned as to achieve the maximum possible level of efficiency in the disposal of the capital expenditure involved.</P>
    <P>Planning must also be concerned with using to the best possible advantage the infrastructure of roads, railways, port facilities, hospitals, schools, housing, and water and sewerage services which have been provided by capital expenditure in previous years. Surveys may well show that in some centres the existing infrastructure has unused capacity and that industrial and commercial expansion could take place with little or no capital expenditure on environmental services and facilities.  The surveys which are a necessary prerequisite to proper planning will show that in every region and, indeed, in every county centres exist which hold promise of becoming poles of economic growth.  The identification and selection of these centres is part of the planning process.  The aim would be to encourage industrial and commercial development in those centres so that the expanding opportunities for employment would attract those who inevitably will leave agricultural employment in the surrounding rural areas.  According as development proceeds these centres should generate the demand and accumulate the resources necessary for improved amenities and facilities.  It is now generally accepted that a good environment materially assists economic expansion.</P>
    <P>It is my aim that, following on the passage of this Bill, regional studies should be made with strong support and guidance from my Department in order that the economic objectives of planning that I have outlined will be pressed forward vigorously.  Other countries in Europe are using physical planning to advance their economic <Col N="1692" /> development and we cannot afford to ignore their example.  Indeed, I regard this as probably the most important long-term task facing the local authorities in this country.  Planning for growth seeks to develop-dynamic centres which will have the economic strength to prosper and to support the public services, the entertainments, the amenities and the shops which people expect nowadays.</P>
    <P>In addition to the movement of population from rural areas to towns and cities, there has been a movement within the towns and cities themselves. Housing development at low densities has been in demand and people have tended to move from central urban and city areas with an attendant increase in urban sprawl and the depreciation of central town and city areas.  These are some of the problems with which this Bill is concerned.</P>
    <P>In Dublin and in other Irish cities, urban renewal has become necessary just as it has been found necessary in cities in the United States, in Britain and in other parts of Europe.  Central areas have become increasingly congested because of traffic and many parts have become outmoded in current conditions of economic growth and change.  At the same time, the associated suburban sprawl has aggravated the problems of the central areas.  What is needed is comprehensive planning together with adequate powers for the redevelopment and renewal of obsolete areas.</P>
    <P>Urban renewal is not possible under the existing law.  Hitherto the provision of factory sites and shops and certain other community facilities has been carried out as by-products of other activities such as local authority housing.  This position is entirely inadequate. Planning authorities must be given proper powers to cope with the pressing problems which exist in towns and cities.  City and town centres, in particular, must be adapted to the motor age.  Commercial buildings, such as shops and offices, are too often unsuited to the demands of modern business and it becomes an economic proposition to rebuild them even though the actual structures themselves may be physically sound.  A <Col N="1693" /> certain amount of redevelopment of individual buildings or small groups of buildings is a normal feature of urban renewal.  The results tend, however, to be piecemeal, freezing for, perhaps, generations ahead the existing street pattern which is becoming increasingly outmoded by the mounting volume of car traffic.  Where the redevelopment is sufficiently comprehensive the opportunity arises of providing adequately for the conflicting needs of pedestrians and vehicles.</P>
    <P>The difficulty hitherto has been that comprehensive redevelopment has been hampered by the fact that urban property is usually split up into a great many parcels in different ownerships. The remedy proposed in the Bill is to empower planning authorities to acquire areas of convenient shape and size where redevelopment is needed. Having assembled the ownerships, they may redevelop the land themselves or may sell or lease it to one or more commercial developers.  I think that this is a field which can most successfully be exploited if the planning authority and private developer collaborate. The planning authority will have to borrow to acquire the free-holds but the investment should prove sound.  If the planning authority sell central city sites with vacant possession, they should realise a profit.  If they decide to lease the sites, the rents should reflect the upward tendency of values in the central area property market.  When the area is redeveloped, the ratepayers get the benefit of the increased tax base created by the higher rateable values and there is also the less tangible but very real advantage of greater convenience and efficiency in the redeveloped area.</P>
    <P>The need for renewal and redevelopment in central areas is widespread and private investment will find in such renewal and redevelopment a valuable ground for their activity.  I feel sure that urban renewal will provide an important field of work for the building industry in the years ahead. In fact, I am aware that there is already, in anticipation of the passing of this Bill, very keen interest on the part of developers of considerable standing and resources in undertaking <Col N="1694" /> urban renewal particularly in Dublin. The prospects for Dublin and other cities including the prospects for the building industry in all its aspects are most promising and I intend to facilitate the planning authorities in getting ahead rapidly with the opening up and renewal of obsolete areas.  This task is urgent and I would expect that plans for renewal objectives will be prepared with a minimum of delay.  I am glad to say that the Dublin Corporation recognise this and that an expert in the field of urban renewal has already been engaged by them to advise on certain aspects of the problem.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the planning authority may provide buildings. It is not envisaged that planning authorities would engage in activities which are properly the sphere of private enterprise but in relation to urban renewal a wide diversity of circumstances may arise and it may well be found necessary in some cases for the planning authority to initiate the development by providing some buildings. However, as I have already said, the best results will be achieved if the planning authority use their land acquisition powers and bring private enterprise into collaboration in the redevelopment activities.  When the planning authority have acquired the lands they will of course normally advertise the lands inviting offers for the purchase or leasing for redevelopment in accordance with the objectives of the development plan.</P>
    <P>Road traffic is another aspect of economic change.  It is hardly necessary to dwell upon the impact of the motor car on living conditions in our cities and towns and on our road system generally.  It is estimated that the growth in road traffic during the period up to 1970 will be of the order of 7 per cent per annum and that the vehicle population could be expected to grow to a total of over 520,000.  The 1962 figure was about 355,000.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that with the continuing increase in the number of vehicles on our roads the demands on the road system will become increasingly more <Col N="1695" /> serious and the need for the implementation of a well-planned and phased programme of road improvement, particularly on the arterial routes, will become more pressing. There is a strong link between landuse planning and traffic planning.  The Bill recognises this and traffic problems including parking problems and the need for the removal of traffic congestion in the major centres of population must be dealt with in the development plans.</P>
    <P>Recent rapid developments in the tourist sector and activities in the purchase of land in areas of great scenic importance have in some instances led to undersirable forms of development which, if allowed to proliferate, would cause very serious damage to the character of coast and countryside. Planning must take full account of the value of tourism to the economy and of the importance of amenity preservation and improvement in development plans.  The Bill provides not only for defensive planning in this respect through the control over development but it provides also positive powers to enable the planning authorities to improve and develop amenities and create the type of good environment which helps to make for a fuller and better life.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill there will be 87 separate planning authorities.  The county planning authorities will be responsible for preparing the county development plans and also the development plans for the many towns listed in the First Schedule to the Bill. In so far as county planning is concerned, we have in this country special advantages deriving from the management system and the fact that not in-frequently the county engineer or members of his staff also act as town surveyors.  In the Dublin metropolitan region, it has been possible to arrange that a single planning officer will advise all the separate planning authorities. I think it is very important that development plans should be co-ordinated on a county basis and there is specific power in Section 22 of the Bill enabling the Minister to require co-ordination of development plans. <Col N="1696" /> While I see no reason why any undue difficulty should arise in planning authorities co-ordinating their proposals within the county framework, it would be my intention to make full use of the powers proposed in Section 22 should it be necessary to do so.</P>
    <P>I might mention at this point that the Bill seeks to ensure that local authorities will exercise their planning powers in full, and that they will not restrict themselves to the operation of controls as they have done in the past but that they will make a real effort at positive planning.</P>
    <P>When the Act comes into operation, each council will be faced with the very considerable task of working out a policy for the proper planning and development of their area and for the preservation and improvement of its amenities.  Within the relatively short space of three years, they must produce a plan which will embody and co-relate their proposals and they will then have to consider objections made by the public.  The making of development plans or any variation thereof is a reserved function.</P>
    <P>The better the council do their work the less need will there be for day to day supervision of planning control.  If any councillor is satisfied that some objective indicated in the plan or written statement has the effect of causing undue hardship or is preventing development which he considers desirable, he can take steps to have the plan amended.  In fact each planning authority is required to review its development plan from time to time and at least once every five years and to make in it whatever variations they consider proper.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that the early plans at least will be capable of improvement and will require a great deal of further consideration after they have been made.  This is the work which is appropriate to the elected representatives and the work which the Bill has properly allotted to them.  The ideal is that the council should lay down the principles and policies to be followed and concentrate on securing whatever clarification or improvement is required from time to time.  If at any time it should be necessary to review any particular decision of the manager, <Col N="1697" /> the elected representatives can do so and have adequate powers under the County Management Acts to secure the rectification of any decision which they are satisfied is illfounded.</P>
    <P>As regards national planning, I am fully in favour of the maximum possible degree of leadership, advice and assistance being given by the central authority.  It is my intention to have my Department make a much greater positive contribution to planning in this country than has been possible under the Act of 1934, in which the requirement that the Minister for Local Government must approve each planning scheme restricted the Department's participation in the preliminary work of local planning authorities even where interests of national planning were concerned.  This Bill does not provide for ministerial approval of development plans in the future.  My Department will make a more positive contribution to the efforts of local authorities in operating this Bill by making available to them advice and assistance in all aspects of physical planning.</P>
    <P>Research is essential into many aspects of physical planning and development.  These include urban renewal and the economics of urban land use; traffic and physical transportation problems in relation to the existing or proposed roads network; selection and development of centres of potential economic growth; general construction research into building and road development.</P>
    <P>I am examining this whole subject of training and research at the moment.  It is clear that expert advice must be obtained in these fields and we are seeking ways in which this advice can be secured.  The research which I have in mind will supplement the advisory work which my Department will undertake particularly in the sphere of regional and national planning. I have taken steps to have the Department's planning organisation considerably strengthened.  In order to augment the overall supply of qualified planners I have secured the cooperation of the Dublin Vocational Education Committee&mdash;for which I am most grateful&mdash;in providing a two-year <Col N="1698" /> post-graduate course in planning for suitably qualified architects, engineers and surveyors.  The first course is well under way and I understand that the demand is such that a second course will commence next year.  I should like to acknowledge the work which has been put into the organisation and running of these courses by the principal and staff of Bolton Street School of Technology and the honorary officers of the Irish Branch of the Town Planning Institute.</P>
    <P>The importance of planning in local government is such that I think we must look ahead to the time when local authorities or groupings of local authorities will employ qualified planning advisers or the chief professional officers will have planning qualifications. Indeed I envisage that in due course the possession of a qualification in planning will become at least a desirable qualification for the top technical posts.  In the meantime extensive use can clearly be made of the professional and administrative skills which are found in every local authority establishment.  The engineering and architectural organisations in the various local areas have done excellent work over the years in the planning and execution of various structural programmes as well as the work specifically referable to the provisions of the Planning Acts.  I have every confidence in their ability to respond to the demands which the new Bill will make on their experience and co-operation and I repeat my assurance of Departmental advice and assistance in these new tasks.</P>
    <P>Last year I arranged with the cooperation of the Town Planning Institute for a course of lectures by the President and other leading personalities of the Institute.  Public representatives as well as senior local government officials were invited to attend and I am happy to say that widespread appreciation was expressed of the value of these lectures.  As I announced at the time I intend to arrange for a further series of lectures.  These will be related more directly to the present Bill and to the tasks which will require to be undertaken as soon as the Bill becomes law.  I am hoping also that I <Col N="1699" /> will find it possible to establish a Summer School in Town Planning in order to provide a regular forum for discussions and lectures.</P>
    <P>I think last year's course of lectures and the discussions surrounding this Bill have helped considerably to broaden our appreciation of the contribution which planning can make to national well-being.  The imperative need for urban renewal, the rejection of unworthy development by means of development control, the idea of green belts, the preservation and conservation of the best features of town and countryside&mdash;all these now commend general acceptance.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the subject of training and research, I should like to draw attention to Section 15 of the Bill which enables local authorities to contribute to the funds of any body which provides for training and research in relation to town and regional planning. The making of a decision under this section will be a reserved function.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Senators will agree that small towns deserve the special recognition which is given to them in the Bill.  No country planning can ignore the role of its towns and villages and, indeed, it is a basic requirement of proper planning and development to survey and decide the particular function which each town has in the community structure of the county. Furthermore, small towns have their own problems including the ever growing problem of traffic and the need for redevelopment which, even though the scale is smaller, are important to these communities.  While the Bill does not make it compulsory to prepare plans for towns of less than 1,000 population, I expect that county councils will find it convenient and, in many cases, imperative to prepare separate plans for smaller towns and villages, particularly for centres that reveal growing development potential.</P>
    <P>The plans required for small towns may be relatively simple, containing few provisions other than those prescribed as appropriate, whereas the city authorities will require to state objectives for a greater variety of matters and will accordingly have more particularised and complicated plans.  In <Col N="1700" /> order to simplify the matter, provision is made for the preparation of plans in instalments; plans may be made for part of an area or to show particular objectives such as urban renewal or traffic planning.</P>
    <P>Planning and development is a continuous process and it is not possible, therefore, to predict with any degree of certainty the forces, changes, pressures and influences which will affect our towns and countryside in the relatively near future.  At the same time, it is not only prudent but essential that we make plans to guide development and to profit from past mistakes.  If, as an alternative to the static, rigid type of planning scheme envisaged by the Act of 1934, we are to have flexible planning which will take account of current trends and new developments, then we must provide for periodical review and variation of development plans.  Section 20 of the Bill makes periodical review of the plans obligatory.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the Minister's approval is not required to development plans: he will, however, be one of the prescribed authorities to whom copies of development plans must be sent.  The others whom it is intended to prescribe and who must then be furnished with prescribed documents include:</P>
    <P>(1)  An Chomhairle Ealaíon,</P>
    <P>(2)  An Taisce,</P>
    <P>(3)  Bord Fáilte Éireann,</P>
    <P>(4)  The National Monuments Advisory Council,</P>
    <P>(5)  The Minister for Lands,</P>
    <P>(6)  The Minister for Industry and Commerce,</P>
    <P>(7)  The Minister for Defence, and</P>
    <P>(8)  Any local authority affected.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this provision is to enable these bodies to scrutinise the proposals of planning authorities and to make representations for the consideration of the planning authority before the final plan is made.  Provision is made in section 21 for the hearing by the planning authority of representations from these authorities or from any member of the public.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill sets up the machinery for control of development <Col N="1701" /> and for the enforcement of such control. The control procedure is not substantially changed from that existing at present.  I would draw attention to the provision in Section 26 that in dealing with applications for permission the planning authority will be restricted to considering the proper planning and development of their area, including the preservation and improvement of its amenities, regard being had to the development plan and to any special amenity area order. Where permission is refused or conditions are imposed the reasons must be stated.  Appeals against orders and decisions may be made to the Minister by any person and the criteria governing the determination of application for permission will apply also to the determination of appeals.  Under Section 25, it is proposed that regulations shall be made enabling planning authorities to deal with outline applications for permission and when giving permission, to reserve the right of approval of the details until a further application is made.</P>
    <P>I would like in particular to draw attention to other matters for which provision is made under Section 25. Regulations may require applicants to publish notices with respect to their applications for planning permission. This could be done either by posting a notice on the site or otherwise.  Planning authorities may also be required to furnish to any specified persons information with respect to any applications and the manner in which the applications have been dealt with.  The regulations may also require planning authorities to publish any specified information with respect to any applications or decisions on applications. I might point out also that under the Bill every planning authority will be obliged to keep a register in which they will note applications for planning permission, planning decisions and particulars of compensation paid for planning restrictions.  These provisions are designed to remedy what I consider to be an unsatisfactory lack of public information in the present planning control system.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill also contains provisions for the enforcement of planning controls.  It may be noted that <Col N="1702" /> in Sections 31, 33 and 35 it is proposed to empower the Minister to require the planning authority to serve an enforcement notice, subject to the appropriate conditions in the Sections being satisfied.  One of the enforcement provisions, Section 35, is designed to deal with the problem of unfinished housing estates which has created a most unsatisfactory position in many suburban areas.  I intend to take every action open to me to ensure that this problem will not recur in the future and that purchasers of houses will have the assurance that estates will be properly completed by developers and duly taken in charge by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill recognises that the preservation and improvement of amenities must nowadays have a serious and special place amongst the responsibilities of local authorities.  The Bill includes positive provisions for the preservation of existing amenities and for the development of new amenity features.  Areas of special amenity are provided for in Section 42.  An area of special amenity by reason of its natural beauty or scenic or other amenities, including recreational utility, may be made the subject of an Order by the planning authority under this section.</P>
    <P>The making of an amenity order is a reserved function.  The order comes into operation on being confirmed and may be revoked or varied by a subsequent order.  The Bill requires the planning authority to review the matter from time to time and at least once in every period of five years for the purpose of deciding whether it is desirable to revoke or amend the order.</P>
    <P>The purpose of an order under Section 42 is to establish for the information of land owners, developers, and the public generally, that a particular area of land is under control of a specified nature.  The order may provide for no development or for specified development only being permitted under the Act or may restrict development to a limited part of the area.  Alternatively, the order may impose limitations on the number of structures of any specified class which may be erected in any part of the area.</P>
    <P>The order may be employed to preserve the areas of great natural beauty which are now threatened with development. <Col N="1703" /> Areas of this kind are national&mdash;indeed one might say international&mdash;assets and form part of the raw material of our tourist industry. Spoliation, whether by haphazard erection of insensitive developments such as buildings, filling stations, advertisement hoardings, or use for temporary huts or caravans, must be discouraged and, where necessary, prevented. An order under this section may also be utilised to establish the precise boundaries and nature of development control in a green belt area.  Amenity area orders must be reviewed at intervals in justice to the persons with land interests in the area, and also to allow of any expansion of built up areas that may be found to be essential.  It is also the case that the present concept of what is an amenity area may alter with the growth in motor traffic and the consequential greater mobility of people.</P>
    <P>The protection of good scenery is but one of the conservation problems with which this Bill is concerned.  The associated problem of protecting views and prospects of special amenity value or interest is also the subject of special provisions.  Other provisions in the Bill are designed to make possible a system of nature conservation, that is, the protection of rare botanical or zoological species including the preservation of restricted sites or habitats of such species.  Provision is also made for the preservation of natural communities of plant life such as primaeval woodlands and for the preservation of geological sites or features of special interest such as fossil sites and sites of rare rock structure.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that nature conservation is a rather specialist field and that planning authorities will need guidance and assistance, particularly in relation to flora and fauna which can be of such interest to our own people and to the many visiting botanists and ornithologists, etc.  The Bill provides, accordingly, that the making and administration of conservation orders will be subject to consultation with the prescribed authorities. I am happy to say that An Taisce <Col N="1704" /> have agreed to be one of the authorities for the purposes of this section and I should like to express my appreciation of their assistance in the drafting of this section.  A sub-committee of An Taisce have been appointed by that body to prepare material relating to specific conservation problems in this country and I look forward to fruitful collaboration with them in our efforts to establish a system of nature conservation which is a matter of increasing urgency in view of the extension of building developments and the greater mobility of people both here and in other parts of Western Europe.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill deals with compensation. Section 55 provides for compensation in respect of planning restrictions as they arise, that is, when the planning authority refuses permission or grants conditional permission for development, subject to the claim being made within six months of the relevant decision or within such longer period as the circuit court may in any particular case allow.  The Act of 1934 did not provide for compensation on foot of interim control directions; the Act of 1939 allowed some concession in cases of hardship but otherwise a planning scheme had to be in operation and claims had to be related to the restrictions imposed by such a scheme.  The basis of compensation was the reduction in the value of the claimant's estate or interest in the property and, in the case of an occupier of such property, the damage, if any, to his trade, business or profession, occasioned by such restrictions. This basis is preserved in Section 55.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) sets out generally accepted principles for the purpose of removing any doubt which might arise on these points.  The effect of a refusal of permission for a particular development project need not be to sterilise the site completely.  Accordingly, in determining reduction of value, regard must be had to any alternative development for which permission is available or which the planning authority undertake to permit.  Regard must also be had to the fact that exempted development may be carried out without permission. On the other hand, reasonable allowance must be made for the fact that <Col N="1705" /> certain minimum requirements and standards would have to be complied with if the development were permitted &mdash;these are covered by the references to Section 26 and Section 56.</P>
    <P>Where permission for development has been refused and no undertaking has been given that permission would be granted for alternative development, the reduction in value of the land will be determined on the assumption that no permission would be granted for any development on the land.  Provision is made to this effect in subsection (3). In other words, the compensation in such circumstances would be calculated on the basis that the land would be sterilised except in so far as exempted development could be carried out.</P>
    <P>Section 55 also provides that compensation shall not be payable in respect of any interest in land which it is the duty of the planning authority to acquire under Section 29.  This duty arises only if the owner claims that the land is incapable of reasonably beneficial use in its existing state and elects to serve a purchase notice; in other words, he has a choice of claiming for loss of value or, if the land is useless, of disposing of it to the planning authority.</P>
    <P>Section 56 sets out a number of matters in respect of which planning restrictions may be imposed without liability for compensation.  It has long been recognised that it is not in the public interest that property owners should have unrestricted rights to use, develop or exploit their property as they see fit.  Property carries obligations as well as rights and the Constitution, while recognising rights of private property, provides that such rights may be delimited by law.</P>
    <P>Section 57 further restricts the liability of a planning authority to pay compensation in respect of the refusal of permission for development, if, when a claim is made for compensation, the planning authority undertake to grant or have already granted permission for development of a residential, commercial or industrial character, or any combination thereof.  This is really an extension of the provisions in regard to zoning; for example, if an <Col N="1706" /> area is zoned for residential purposes, no compensation would be payable in respect of a refusal of permission for the erection of, say, a factory in such zone.  Residential development would of course be permitted.</P>
    <P>Section 58 provides for certain relaxations of the restrictions on payment of compensation contained in Sections 56 and 57.  The Minister may make an order declaring that he is satisfied that it would not be just and reasonable in the particular circumstances that payment of compensation should be prevented.  This provision brings the Bill close to the provisions in the present Acts which relate to compensation.</P>
    <P>If a permission is revoked or modified under Section 30 compensation may be claimed under Section 59. Compensation is payable on the same basis as if the permission were refused in the first instance or, where the permission is modified by the imposition of conditions, compensation is payable as if the conditions were imposed when the permission was granted originally. In either case if the revocation or modification renders abortive works already carried out in pursuance of the permission originally granted, this section requires that the planning authority shall pay compensation in respect of the expenditure incurred. The claim under this head may include expenditure reasonably incurred in the preparation of plans or upon other similar matters preparatory to the carrying out of the works.  As an alternative to a claim under this section, a purchase notice may be served under Section 29 and, if the notice is confirmed by the Minister or accepted by the planning authority, no compensation will be payable under the section.</P>
    <P>Section 60 deals with compensation for the removal or alteration of any structure under Section 36, that is, a structure other than an unauthorised structure, and Section 61 with compensation for damage suffered by the depreciation of any interest in land as a result of the discontinuance of any use of land consequent on a notice under Section 37.  Other compensation provisions are made in Section 62 which relates to the removal or alteration <Col N="1707" /> of hedges consequent upon a notice under Section 44, Section 63 which relates to the compulsory creation of a public right of way, Section 64 which relates to powers of entry on land and Section 65 which relates to cables, wires and pipe lines passing through or over land other than a public road.</P>
    <P>Section 66 provides for claims which may be made for compensation in respect of planning restrictions imposed under the present Acts.  The existing position is that no liability falls on the planning authority until they have brought a scheme into operation.  Affected property owners may then make their claim under Section 61 of the 1934 Act in respect of the covering provisions in the scheme.  If the scheme contains no covering provisions for the interim directions, compensation may be payable under Section 64 of the 1934 Act for unnecessary refusal of permission or making of a prohibition.  Compensation might also be claimed under Section 60 of the 1934 Act in respect of any reduction in the value of property arising out of compliance with any condition attached to an interim direction.  Section 66 of the Bill aims at preserving the rights which have accrued under the 1934 Act.</P>
    <P>Sections 68 and 69 provide that compensation for planning restrictions and for land acquisition shall, in default of agreement, be determined by arbitration under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, as amended by the Fourth Schedule to the Bill.  The basis of compensation in the 1919 Act is market value.  This basis is being preserved: the additional rules set out in the Fourth Schedule are simply a recognition that land-use planning has become one of the facts of life.</P>
    <P>The principal object of Part VII of the Bill is to give planning authorities positive powers to secure, facilitate and carry out development.  Hitherto, planning authorities have tended to concentrate on the restrictive aspect of their function.  This Bill envisages that in the future planning authorities will actively promote development.  I have already referred to urban renewal. <Col N="1708" /> This part of the Bill is designed to make urban renewal possible.</P>
    <P>Part VIII of the Bill contains a number of miscellaneous provisions including a provision relating to the oral hearings of appeals and a provision binding State authorities not to carry out the construction or extension of any building without consultation with the appropriate planning authority. Section 85 enables a planning authority to run cables, wires or pipelines over land and these powers may usefully be employed to facilitate such developments as relay television services and the transport of commodities by pipe-line.</P>
    <P>The new building regulations envisaged in Section 86 will provide in a more flexible, modern and comprehensive form, a uniform building code which will operate throughout the whole country.  The regulations will enable the control of building to be kept in harmony with developments in building techniques and the use of new materials.</P>
    <P>Senators will note from reading the Third Schedule that the purposes for which objectives may be indicated in the development plans give wide scope for comprehensive planning.  The first item in the Schedule represents the most pressing and unfortunately the most formidable of all the objectives &mdash;the objectives of securing the greater convenience and safety of road users and pedestrians.  This Bill gives strong powers to control development so that future unnecessary traffic hazards and certain obvious sources of serious traffic congestion can be prevented. The Bill also gives positive powers to secure or carry out developments which will afford an easement in present traffic congestion and help to adjust the urban environment, in particular, to the needs of the pedestrian and the motorist.  There is no simple solution. Every country in the world is in one degree or another grappling with this problem.  In new towns and in urban redevelopment schemes the general aim is to divorce pedestrians from moving vehicles as far as possible.  In many cities improved systems of mass transportation are being adopted or studied. New roads and large-scale parking provision in central areas involve the <Col N="1709" /> risk of the motor vehicle taking over. Los Angeles is noted for its system of motor freeways and its central carparking facilities.  I was told at a conference there that 68 per cent of the &ldquo;downtown&rdquo; area is now given over to roads and carparks.</P>
    <P>As I have said earlier this Bill will seek to secure comprehensive planning of land use.  The long-term prospective growth of our larger towns and of our cities will require careful planning on a national and regional basis as well as on a county basis.  The planning of Dublin in particular must be studied on a regional basis.  Urban growth in general is to be welcomed because therein lies our hope of an increasing population.  Our aim in operating the Bill must be to ensure that urban growth is not accompanied by loss of amenity, by inconvenience and by economic waste, but rather that our citizens should enjoy the benefits of well-planned environments.</P>

      <P>The main principles of this Bill can hardly be matters of contention in the Seanad. Nevertheless, the Bill is so important, the matters with which it deals so fundamental not only to local government but to the whole life of the people, and the possibilities under the Bill so limitless, that I think it deserves a thorough discussion by the House. Consequently, while there is very little on which I would differ from the Minister in what he has said in introducing the Bill, nevertheless, there are many points I should like to raise by way of comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In approaching this Bill, one might adopt any one of several different courses.  One could discuss the deficiencies of the present planning code as we have known it since 1934, and go on to discuss the best means of overcoming the deficiencies in the planning history during those 29 years. To go on that basis alone, however, might be harmful, because we would be subject to the temptation of trying to amend our planning code, and trying to put into force for the future, a code which would be suitable only for what has happened over the past 29 years.  While much of what happened during those years is relevant to <Col N="1710" /> what we can do now, it is by no means the complete story.  Indeed, what might well have worked during those years, might not work in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>One could perhaps look at the provisions of the Bill in detail, and compare them with the practice elsewhere and, as it were, attempt and essay in comparative planning legislation.  This, too, is something that should be part of our examination of the Minister's planning proposals, but, again, it would be very far from giving us the full story, because planning is so much of the essence of the life of the whole community.  It affects so much the government of the country at national, regional and local levels.  What is done elsewhere can only give us guides and pointers to what we might do.  To import into this country what has worked in detail in other countries might well be harmful rather than beneficial.</P>
    <P>Another approach would be to attempt to clarify what should be our planning objectives, to look at the national objectives, the regional objectives and the local objectives, and to discuss in a more or less academic way what are the best means of achieving those objectives, whether by setting up some sort of system of self-adjusting mechanisms or by setting up a system of controls of detail.</P>
    <P>This Bill could, of course, be viewed in a larger context because, while planning affects very many things, affects nearly all parts of our national life, it is not indeed the whole of the story.  The Minister's proposals could be viewed in the light of some things which are relevant to what is proposed in the Bill but have not been the subject of comment by him in his introductory speech here today or the subject of debate during the passage of the Bill in Dáil Éireann.  In the long discussion that has gone on over the past 12 months concerning this planning Bill, there have been some notable omissions from the discussion.</P>
    <P>There has been a very noticeable absence of a discussion, other than by brief reference, of regional planning and its objectives and of national planning and its objectives.  These proposals <Col N="1711" /> seem to have been taken as if they were something which could easily be co-ordinated, as if they merely needed somebody to come along and tie up a few loose strings here and there.  This has been a serious omission from the debate that has taken place on this measure.</P>
    <P>Just as public involvement is important at the local level&mdash;and I agree heartily with the Minister in what he has done in making the authorities under this Bill as local as possible&mdash; public involvement is equally necessary at the regional and national level. While there is provision for administrative action at regional and at national level, there seems to be hardly any provision at all for public involvement, for consultation, at these higher levels.</P>
    <P>A further omission one notices in the discussion on this Bill is that of any reference to the problems involved in local taxation and local finance, which are highly relevant to the problem of planning.  It is all right to say that these are matters that are at present under review, that the position in this regard will be taken into account and that no matter what decisions are taken, they can be woven into the planning fabric.  However, there are some matters in regard to local finance that are absolutely fundamental to planning.  In particular, there is the vexed question of the rating of site values which is highly relevant to the problem of urban development.</P>
    <P>It is also a matter of personal regret to me that the opportunity has not been taken on this Bill of making a thorough examination of the problem of administrative tribunals of which planning is only one instance.  Here in the case of the planning Bill, there might well have been a good opportunity for a general review of this question. As I say, there are many possible approaches to the Bill and it is well for us in this debate to combine these and look at the Bill from many points of view because the problem is so big that it can be viewed from many aspects with benefit to the debate.</P>
    <P>If we examine this Bill first from the point of view of looking back on what <Col N="1712" /> happened under the 1934 code, the question we must ask ourselves is: to the extent that it failed, why did the 1934 planning code fail?  The Minister has said&mdash;and I think practically everyone will agree with him&mdash;that the main reasons for the failure of this code were that the procedure was too complete, too rigid, that it was impossible to collect betterment, and that the planning was essentially negative in effect.  However, in addition to these aspects, there was a failure, which is a failure about which we can do nothing legislatively and which may recur under the new code, in regard to public opinion.</P>
    <P>This failure was fundamental to the operation of the planning code under the 1934 Act.  There was a lack of involvement and a lack of participation on the part of the public.  This attitude was broken for a very short period immediately after the war.  If we look back, we will remember that at this time there was a national planning exhibition held in the Mansion House here in Dublin.  There was a great amount of talk and debate about post-war planning but somehow such public enthusiasm as was generated then seemed to be let slip, seemed to pass into other channels and advantage was not taken of it.  Here lies one of the greatest dangers to any planning code and here lies what must be one of the great preoccupations of the Minister and his advisers in trying to bring this new code to fruition.</P>
    <P>All countries have had during times of their history periods during which the public attitude to planning, the public attitude to amenities, has left very much to be desired.  In this country, there is absolutely no doubt that there are reasons in the past for our neglect of the external appearances of the communities in which we live. There has been down through the years a concentration on verbal expression as the subject matter of aesthetic effort.  In recent years, there has been a recovery in this respect but this is something in regard to which we shall have to move far more quickly than we have been moving.  There must be found a way in which there will be a public sanction for planning.  Otherwise <Col N="1713" /> the Minister will find it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to carry through major projects of urban redevelopment.  Unless public sanction is available, unless the public really agree that compulsory powers should be used for this purpose, unless the public agree that the authority of the corporation of their city should be used in their approach to private property, then no amount of administrative expertise will make urban redevelopment work.</P>
    <P>In the provisions in the Bill as it stands, there are many new features. I do not intend to comment on them all.  However, there are a few which are so outstanding that I should like to make a few points in regard to them. First, there is the provision of a new and more flexible system of planning; secondly, we have improved control in regard to amenities; thirdly, we have revised compensation and betterment provisions; and, fourthly, the provision for urban redevelopment.</P>
    <P>In regard to the development plan, which is dealt with in Part III of the Bill, there are many very welcome features.  I think it is widely recognised that the Minister is wise in making the planning of every area in this country a matter not of choice but of obligation and that he is wise, too, in providing that planning should be something which can, where necessary, be done in stages rather than something to be done once for all.  But there are certain dangers in regard to this.  While we are all essentially in agreement that in the 1934 Act the plan upon which everything depended had to be a matter of such great detail that planning itself seemed to be stultified by the requirement that everything had to go into the plan, we must also recognise that in the code which the Minister now proposes to us there may be a danger of going too far in the opposite direction.  There may be a danger in putting too little in the plan.  Here one could refer to the list of minimum objectives given in Section 19 of the Bill.  I wonder if that list of minimum objectives should not be somewhat more extensive by the inclusion, as a matter of obligation rather than permission, of some of the objectives which are given in the <Col N="1714" /> Schedules to the Bill?  We must recognise that a tentative and timid plan might be as great a danger as a rigid plan under the 1934 code.</P>
    <P>Here I should like to raise a point which is not clear from reading the Bill, that is, as to the nature of what is to be included in the development plan.  The word &ldquo;objective&rdquo; is used in the Bill.  This is in contrast to the 1947 Act in Britain, from which, it will be recognised, many provisions of the present Bill are derived.  In Britain, the development plan consists not of objectives but of proposals.  I should like to ask the Minister is there significance in the changing of the wording in this respect.  Are the objectives which are to be in the development plan in our Bill to be really solid proposals for action, or would the planning authority meet their statutory objectives by putting in mere pious intentions in regard to what they hope to do?  On reading the Bill, I find it difficult to see where the duty is laid on the planning authority to do more than to state these objectives.</P>
    <P>As I see it, a development plan, whether drawn up under our code or under the British code, would contain a number of different things.  It would contain some forecasts of varying degrees of reliability.  It would contain certainly some intentions on the part of the local authority.  It would contain absolutely firm proposals on the part of the local authority.  I should be glad if the Minister could give us some information as to how firm the local authority will have to be in this particular respect.  I quite appreciate the Minister will, in the model clauses he will issue under this Bill, produce a development plan which will make solid propositions.  As the Minister said in his introductory statement, it is no longer his function to approve a plan and the local authority might well be able to get away with something less and something more tentative.</P>
    <P>The same point arises in regard to the review of the development plan. This, also, is a most excellent idea, but, again, we find a difference in wording between the British Act and our Bill, which is otherwise so similar <Col N="1715" /> in many respects.  The Minister lays the obligation on the local authority to review their development plan.  Again &ldquo;review&rdquo; is a somewhat vague word. A local authority might meet their obligation to &ldquo;review&rdquo; by skimping their business to a certain extent.  If we look at the similar section in the 1947 Act in Britain, we do not find the word &ldquo;review&rdquo;; we find an obligation on the local authority to make an new survey.  This is something more definite.  One could review a plan by looking at it and asking a few questions, but to survey means you go out and see how the plan has worked out in practice.  Here, again, the difference in wording is in the same direction&mdash;a tightness of wording in the British legislation which does not occur in ours.</P>
    <P>It is good there should be freedom and flexibility.  All I want to raise in regard to these two provisions is that this flexibility should not be used as a justification for a lack of diligence in carrying out the work.  I mentioned previously that the lack of specific consultative machinery at regional level is distinctly to be regretted.  This is something that could be set up on an informal basis following the passing of the Bill.  But I think consultative regional planning committees could better have been given statutory existence in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of the development plan and the various objectives which can be brought in, there is a further difference of wording as between the British Acts and our own on which I should like to comment.  I have not been able to find in the present Bill any reference to flooding in regard to planning, whereas flooding is specifically mentioned in the British 1954 Act.  Since the Minister has gone into so much detail in the Bill in laying out in the Schedules the various points which can be covered, this might well have been specifically covered.  Undoubtedly, flooding due to surface water is covered to a certain extent by the necessary provision of drains, but the provision of drains according to ordinary standards will not prevent all surface water flooding and it will not prevent flooding due <Col N="1716" /> to the overflow of a river.  I should be glad if the Minister could tell me where this particular matter is covered in the Bill in regard to the question of the refusal of permission and in regard to restrictions on compensation.</P>
    <P>In regard to Part IV&mdash;control of development&mdash;everyone will be in general agreement with the way in which this has been tackled.  There will be points of detail in regard to the operation of this Part, which is rather complicated, but I do not think there is any reason to delay on them on the Second Stage.  There is one point I should like to raise in regard to the development plan and it is cognate to something I mentioned already.  It would be deplorable if there were any element of uncertainty in the development plan.  It should be recognised that if there is any uncertainty at all in regard to the intention of the local authorities&mdash;and this uncertainty could arise due to planning in stages or to making a tentative plan first, to be followed up by a later review&mdash;such uncertainty nearly always involves an economic cost.  Although the amount will always be extremely difficult to compute, nevertheless the value of land could be depressed due to uncertainty in regard to the intention of the local authority.</P>
    <P>Part V which deals with control of amenity contains many excellent provisions. There were, of course, powers in regard to control of amenity under the 1934 Act and it is possible to make a special prohibition under the existing Acts on the ground of amenity but my impression is that these provisions in the existing code were not widely availed of.  Whether or not this impression is correct, I hope that a great deal more will be done under this Bill than was done in the past in this respect.  The execution of these amenity powers of course depends essentially on the attitude of the members of the local authority and it is sincerely to be hoped that they all recognise their very grave responsibility in this respect.  As an ex-member of a local authority I can say that it is never very easy for a person in that position, subject to election, to choose a <Col N="1717" /> long-term intangible provision over an immediate and obvious advantage but in this particular instance it is absolutely vital that it should be done.</P>
    <P>There is one point in regard to the making of an amenity order that rather worries me.  I take it that if an amenity order is made and becomes the subject of an inquiry, the only objection that could be taken would be to reduce the order and that nobody could make a case to extend it. I should like very much to be wrong on that point and I should like to ask the Minister if he could indicate what the position is, whether a case could be made at an inquiry to extend an amenity order or whether any body, such as An Taisce, would have any standing at such an inquiry.  The Minister has provided for consultative bodies but would they have any standing at an inquiry where an amenity was being opposed?</P>
    <P>The provisions in regard to conservation are very welcome.  Such conservation is not a matter merely of giving pleasure to people but it is also a question of real education, education of a particularly valuable form, and also at times a matter of scientific research.  In Britain, the National Conservancy employs over 100 full-time scientists on their work.  Here we will probably go slowly at first but I congratulate the Minister on taking the first step in this regard.</P>
    <P>In regard to Part VI, which deals with compensation and betterment, these are both somewhat less than they were under the existing code.  Indeed, betterment is now abolished except for the recovery of contributions from a developer under Section 26.  This change, of course, is in the direction of the main stream of development of local government finance, not only in regard to the question of betterment but in regard to local government charges also.  The whole idea of such charges, the whole idea of the beneficiary paying towards the cost is going; Bill by Bill, its scope becomes less. The Minister may find even this small provision so very difficult to operate in practice that it may well go in the next Planning Bill.  The explanatory memorandum tells us that there is no <Col N="1718" /> real extension of the restriction on compensation and this is probably only to be expected since there was a very general power in the 1934 Act to include restriction on compensation in the plan itself.  Under the present Bill, however, compensation takes effect only on refusal of an application.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill deals with the powers in regard to urban redevelopment and here indeed the Minister is to be congratulated on moving in this direction at the present time.  This is a problem in all countries and in all cities but it is a problem that has not yet become intensive in this country, outside Dublin.  Nevertheless, the Minister is to be congratulated on moving quickly in this regard.  Indeed, in many other countries they would have been very well advised to have moved earlier and moved at our stage of development.  The life cycle of cities seems to follow the same general course, although, of necessity, there are substantial individual deviations.  This problem of central blight has turned up in cities all over the world, cities in which the civic organisation, civic taxation and the whole manner of living is substantially different.  This natural process can be modified by human action and indeed it can be modified either for good or for bad.</P>
    <P>A recent debate in the British House of Commons dealt at length with the problem that came to light in certain boroughs of London whereby the change of use of property in a highly concentrated area was manipulated for individual profit.  Indeed, this particular type of manipulation will probably enter the literature as &ldquo;Rachmanism&rdquo;. It is also possible that this cycle, which, if left alone, might take many years to complete, can be modified and controlled in the public interest.  I think now is the time to act.  In the past few years, we have seen the tendency in Dublin towards a realisation of what site values in a city really mean.  We have seen in the past few years for the first time substantial buyings of buildings in Dublin city for their site value alone.  However, we still lag behind many other cities in this respect.</P>
    <P>I think, also, this is the time to act on central redevelopment because, as <Col N="1719" /> yet, we are not at the same straits of desperation in regard to city traffic as many other cities.  If urban redevelopment is to be carried out and if the benefits which are undoubted are to be retained, then I think it must be recognised that this requires a peculiar team effort, that this is something that calls for co-operation among many interests. It is not a matter for the experts in the local authority or in the Minister's Department.  They are one party only, one member of the team.  It is also a matter for the members of a local authority.  It is a matter&mdash;and, indeed, I hope it will increasingly be a matter, as the Minister indicated in his speech &mdash;for private investors.</P>
    <P>I would stress that the community must not be forgotten and that it will not be sufficient merely to get the assent of the elected members unless public opinion, as such, outside the council of the local authority can be generated in favour of a proposal. There is no doubt that all of those different parties will agree in principle that urban redevelopment is necessary but agreement in principle and the question of hammering out and getting final approval of a definite specific scheme are two quite different things.</P>
    <P>In regard to urban redevelopment, I should like to raise with the Minister the question of what is to be contained in the development plan.  It is not clear from the Bill, as I read it, whether any proposal for urban redevelopment must be spelled out in detail in the development plan.  The British 1947 Act is absolutely specific on this point.  The British 1947 Act says that all proposals for the compulsory acquisition of land must be part of the development plan.  I understand that it is all proposals up to a period of ten years but I am speaking from memory on this point.</P>
    <P>Failure automatically to follow the similar provision in the British Act raises this question in my mind.  The matter of urban redevelopment is so important and needs so much for its success to be sanctioned by the public that the actual proposal itself should be part of the development plan and should be a reserved function of the <Col N="1720" /> local authority rather than something which would be carried out under the control of development in accordance with an objective in the development plan.</P>
    <P>If there is not to be an absolute obligation for schemes of urban redevelopment of material size to be included, as such, in the development plan then there should be provision in the section in regard to urban redevelopment for the special consideration of these schemes.  There will be many difficulties in urban redevelopment. It will need careful, tedious work. Indeed, that alone will not suffice.  No amount of hard work and no amount of administrative ability will guarantee you good architecture and guarantee you a proper redevelopment&mdash;the three-dimensional development of a central city area of which the community and the local authority can be proud.  It is something that will involve very heavy capital expenditure on which there will be in many instances a relatively slow return.  It must compete with other capital requirements and must have, either directly or indirectly, the approval of the community.</P>
    <P>I say these things not because I am against urban redevelopment but because I am for it.  It would indeed be a tragedy if we were to underestimate the difficulties of urban redevelopment and to fail due to that underestimation. My attitude is that we should not underestimate either its difficulties or its importance.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to make a few further remarks about the relation of this Bill and planning under it to the larger context of our national life and to return to a point I made earlier that the national objectives of planning policy have been insufficiently defined.  Something the Minister said in his introductory speech gives me an example in this particular respect when he referred to the generation of a focus of industrial development within a town or within an area.</P>
    <P>This question of location of industry is one on which there is a great deal of doubt at present.  In recent years we have had a certain amount of change in regard to policy on this matter.  First of all, there was the policy of giving <Col N="1721" /> preference to undeveloped areas.  In the past 12 months, we have seen the advantages of the undeveloped areas reduced by the passage of legislation in regard to industrial grants.  Indeed, if we look at the Fourth Interim Report of the Committee on Industrial Organisation in regard to industrial grants there is a further point here which has not been debated in public to anything like the extent that its importance warrants and it is something that is absolutely essential from the point of view of planning.</P>
    <P>The location of industry is an absolute prerequisite to any planning policy.  In paragraph 43, page 16, of the fourth interim report of the Committee on Industrial Organisation which was presented in December, 1962, the main conclusions emerging from their general considerations of industrial grants policy are summarised, and the second point which they make is:</P>
    <P>...The policy of decentralisation should be continued but in such a way as to give the maximum help to the general policy of economic development under free trade conditions. We believe that this will be achieved if a small number of centres are selected for major industrial development and effort concentrated on these.  If the selected centres are to develop as rapidly as possible, then steps must be taken, in addition to the payment of grants, to encourage the growth in them of the basic industrial services and of a favourable economic and psychological climate.</P>
    <P>Here the Commission on Industrial Organisation have proposed as the best policy in regard to industrial grants with a view to free trade conditions the selection of a <i>small</i> number of areas for major industrial development.  Until there is a decision from the Government in regard to this point and, indeed, until these small number of areas for industrial development have been selected, planning in all areas may be inhibited and, of course, the position is that planning will have to commence in effect as soon as the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>In Britain, they have discussed <Col N="1722" /> repeatedly this question of the policy in regard to the location of industry and it is something about which in this country we must have the position made absolutely clear.  Otherwise, we shall find each individual planning authority going its own way, thinking that it is equal in its position in regard to grants, only to have the position suddenly changed, only to find that perhaps&mdash;this will apply to the majority&mdash;they are not on the select list of a small number of areas to be selected for major development.  This is an example of where objectives must be absolutely clear before any planning in the real sense can take place.</P>
    <P>Again, there is the difficulty of local government finance.  I think that is something on which planning requires an early decision if planning is not to be inhibited in its operation. In this respect, one of the primary points for discussion is the problem of the rating of site values as opposed to our present rating system.  It is generally accepted that rating of site values encourages the development of land which is not being used to its capacity.  In this way, it would be a powerful force for assisting urban redevelopment. Also, if we had some system akin to the rating of site values, we would have an alternative to the recovery of betterment from developers because once a local authority had by any action improved the capabilities of a site, the local authority would be recouped for what it had done by the fact that the tax basis of this particular property would thereby be raised.</P>
    <P>I am not putting this forward as something better than what is in the Bill but as something which must be taken into account and which should have been taken into account in the drafting of the Bill.  It must certainly be taken into account in the operation of the Bill from the very beginning.</P>
    <P>Another point I touched on briefly earlier is that opportunity had been lost of examining from top to bottom, in the context of this country, the problem of administrative tribunals, the problem of trying to get a compromise somewhere between a decision of one man in an office made on the basis of a paper file on the one hand and a full <Col N="1723" /> scale public inquiry for all cases with senior counsel for all interests on the other.  The importance of this problem arises from the fact, which I have repeatedly expressed in my comments in this Bill, that planning is something to do with the public and we must be very careful what the public think of it. I think the essence of planning decisions in this particular context must be, not so much that we should look to administrative convenience, not so much that we should be concerned only with the most rapid way of getting at the correct solution but that we should ensure at all times that the public are satisfied with the decision reached.  Not necessarily the individual person concerned but the general public as a whole, who may at any time themselves be concerned in such a process, should be absolutely satisfied in this respect.</P>
    <P>This is not a matter of constitutional rights but frankly one of good administration. On the point of constitutional rights, a standard work on the subject of modern constitutions has said that a classic example of giving a right with one hand and taking it back with the other is the right of private property as guaranteed in our Constitution.  I have no objection to this position because I believe it is the proper position&mdash;that individual property rights should not be allowed to stand up in the face of public interest, provided the balance between the two is determined in such a manner that the public interest is not indirectly damaged by public approval or satisfaction not being properly taken into account.  It is a matter of good administration in the sense that, without proper public relations, without a proper regard at all times for what the public are thinking in respect of it, no administrative machinery, however internally efficient, can be said to be good administration.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say that we have here a Bill with which we can do much.  I think what we need to do in operating this Bill is to look to the future in the sense that I think our planning must, in a way, itself be planned.  There has been some slowness in the recruitment of staff.  I <Col N="1724" /> appreciate the Minister's difficulties in this respect but I think there should be no further delay on the question, not so much of the recruitment as the training of staff, so that they can be properly recruited.  This is a problem that should be treated as a matter of great urgency.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the whole question of the education of the public and relations with the public should be as much the concern of the Minister as the drafting of regulations and the setting of the Bill into operation.  In the actual operation of the Bill, I think what we need, what is needed by local authorities from the Bill which the Oireachtas is to give them, is originality and imagination, always of course avoiding the error of novelty for novelty's sake. This Bill which the Minister has recommended to the House presents our local authorities with a very great opportunity and I think we all hope that they make the most of it.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to congratulate the Minister on this Bill, and secondly, to thank him for the very informative introduction which he gave us this afternoon.  My own hope is that this Bill may mark the end of an era in our country, the end of the era of building and living too much for the immediate present with carelessness for the natural and historic beauties of our country and recklessness towards what would happen in the future.  We are now trying to take a broader view, looking to what was good in the past, to what is good in the present, and to what will be needed in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I am optimistic both about the direct and indirect effects of the Bill.  Let me refer briefly first to the probable indirect effects.  I believe that, properly presented to the country as a whole, this Bill might bring about a resurgence of local patriotism, of pride in one's own locality, and affection for the part of the country in which one lives, affection for works of art or nature, for buildings and for landscape.  I would particularly commend the Minister for the efforts he has made to educate the public in matters of this kind.  Up to the moment, his efforts, as he described <Col N="1725" /> them earlier this afternoon, have been largely on the technical side.  He has instructed people in town planning and tried to interest them more.</P>
    <P>I would plead with him or else, through him, to the Minister for Education, to make this Bill one of general educational and patriotic value. Some weeks ago on the Electoral Bill, I suggested that a booklet might be produced for the schools explaining the rights and privileges of our electoral system.  The Minister in his reply was not very enthusiastic, for obvious reasons.  Here, however, I think we have a much greater opportunity.  I believe that a well-produced booklet from the Department of Education telling the children what to value in their own locality, what we want to preserve, what we want to improve and what we want to build for the future, would have a very fine effect on school children throughout the whole country. I hope that the Minister will consider asking the Department of Education to do something of that kind.</P>
    <P>I should like to add a word of congratulation to the Minister on his appearance as a film star in some films which he kindly showed to us in one of the Dublin cinemas a few months ago.  He appeared himself with great success.  I hope that none of the Hollywood spies were about at the time.  I should like to refer particularly to the fine film on providing a piped water supply to a lonely country house.  It was an excellently produced film, exciting and vivid, and at times moving, and I would congratulate him and those who were associated with making the film.  I hope we will have more and more of that kind of thing.</P>
    <P>To come to the Bill itself, I shall confine myself almost entirely to Part V dealing with &ldquo;amenities&rdquo; as we call them.  That is a fine word in origin.  The Latin word <i>amoenitas:</i>&ldquo;loveliness,&rdquo;&ldquo;the quality of delightfulness&rdquo; in scenery or in peoples&mdash;that is where we get the word &ldquo;amenity&rdquo; from.  It is a rather colourless word as we use it.  But it is charged with history and could mean a great deal at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Part concerning amenities implies <Col N="1726" /> two main principles.  The first is the right of citizens in general to enjoy certain amenities of our country.  In the past we have suffered from high walls and harsh landlords.  But we have come out of that era and are looking now to a time when the majority of our people can enjoy the best things of our country with reasonable freedom.  Section 48 deals with rights of way and this is a matter of importance, especially to country people.  I live myself almost in the country in Dalkey and we have had to fight hard by local effort in recent times to preserve our picturesque and charming rights of way there.  On one occasion, I personally instructed my children to remove barriers which had been put across a right of way. They showed more enthusiasm than I had intended and I had to apologise subsequently to one local landowner. Unless there is constant vigilance in preserving rights of way, one of the choicest features of rural Ireland may be lost.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of complaint lately about the &ldquo;German invasion&rdquo;, especially in Cork and Kerry. I am sure the Minister has read, with how much joy I cannot imagine, the articles which appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> on September 5th, 6th and 7th 1962, by Mr. Michael Viney.  I think that one case he quoted deserves to be heard in the House.  I quote the first article of September 5th, 1962:</P>
    <P>About 12 miles from Cork is the little cove of Ringabella.  It can only be reached by land through the 90 acre estate of Ringabella House. This has been private property for many years but access to the strand has always been taken for granted by the visitors from Cork, by tenants of holiday cottages at the edge of the estate and by the boys brought from Cork by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for a holiday in a chalet near the gates of the estate.</P>
    <P>The estate has now been bought by a German gentleman and his wife who purchased it in the belief that the estate and strand were totally private. Then they found to their surprise that certain people had rights of access and <Col N="1727" /> they took very stringent measures to keep those people out.  The result was very bad feeling in that part of the country.</P>
    <P>That is happening a good deal.  It would not be fair to say that this is simply a Germanic attitude.  In fact, the sea-coast of Wicklow has for many years now been inaccessible in large tracts of country.  Some landlords refuse to let anyone in.  Some are more tolerant and allow people to go through.  Others make a charge for access to the sea.  Rights of private property are involved here.  I know, as well as the Minister knows it, that it is a very difficult problem to keep the balance between the two.  One solution which might help, I suggest, is that this country needs a greater number of scenic coast roads.  When I go to Greece, as I hope to do in three or four weeks' time, one of the greatest delights in visiting that country will be the new scenic roads, one in particular from Athens to Sunium, quite new, crossing private land no doubt, which has been acquired.  It is an immense acquisition to the country as a whole. If, with care for private rights, we can do something of that kind along the coast of Wicklow and around the coast of Kerry and Cork, it would not merely solve the particular problem of access to the sea but would also add to our tourist possibilities.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the second principle which is involved, I think, in this question of amenities.  It is an aesthetic principle, the principle of good taste. Here, of course, there is room for endless controversy, too.  To take the terms of Section 42:</P>
    <P>Where it appears to the planning authority that an area is an area of special amenity by reason of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  its natural beauty, or</P>
    <P>(b)  its scenic or other amenities...</P>
    <P>and so on, certain things can be done. Who is to judge natural beauty, scenic amenities?  Here, I suggest a practical measure, too.  I hope the local governmental bodies will appoint local committees of good taste and judgment in these matters, selecting them widely <Col N="1728" /> and well, to advise them on these aesthetic matters which the ordinary county council member has not very much time to go into in detail.  I say this for two reasons: first of all, matters of good taste need a certain detachment from the ordinary rough and tumble of politics; secondly, the appointment of committees of this kind might encourage what I have suggested, a resurgence of interest in the beauties of one's own locality.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to some of the other sections.  Section 45, tree preservation orders: nothing could be more desirable.  Near my own part of the country, Glenageary, there has been a most deplorable despoliation of the landscape by cutting down magnificent trees there.  It leaves a wound that cannot be healed for 50 years.</P>
    <P>Under Section 46, it is the intention to make conservation orders to protect flowers or animals.  I have in mind in particular the matter I raised here some time ago: in the Burren in County Clare, there are some particularly rare plants, almost unique in Europe.  A year or so ago, these were being dug out on a considerable scale and taken away.  That, I understand, has been stopped.  This section will give powers to prevent similar despoliation throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Section 52 I refer to with some sadness. This is designed to prevent litter.  If anyone had walked down Grafton Street and across College Green on Monday morning last, he would have been disgusted at the appearance of our capital city at about 12 o'clock in the day.  Really it is deplorable.  No sign of sweeping of any kind of the footpaths or streets at 12 o'clock on a Monday morning. I do hope that the intention in the phrasing of this section will be burnt into the hearts of the Dublin Corporation, and similar local authorities, very soon.</P>
    <P>The kind of thing we have to guard against is, I think, in the minds of all of us.  We know what happened to one of the lakes of Killarney.  I have seen this for myself.  The lake is partly spoiled.  I do not say it is ruined.  I do not want to exaggerate, but it is partly spoiled by this ugly <Col N="1729" /> modern building and this ugly collection of huts, or cottages, on the shores. It is a pity.  There is no doubt about it.  Again, in Westport, we had an example of what we might call deplanning or anti-planning.  Westport Estate, the estate of the Marquis of Sligo, was very carefully planned by a landscape gardener and an architect roughly two hundred years ago. What happens?  That plan is broken into, de-planned.  A factory is built. Residential houses are built, spoiling a plan by one of the great architects of the 18th century.  That kind of de-planning or anti-planning is the enemy.</P>
    <P>There is another example&mdash;the Minister will perhaps recall it&mdash;on the Vico Road.  A few years ago, a house was run up with the most amazing speed.  Outside the <i>Arabian Nights</i> when Aladdin could rub a lamp to call up a genius to build a house in a couple of seconds, I have never seen anything like the speed.  That house was run up on a spot from which there was a very fine view. That view has now gone because we could not stop the building in time. As a matter of fact, between ourselves &mdash;I suppose, though, in this House things are hardly between ourselves&mdash; if we had adopted certain measures, which the Minister, I think, proposed with regard to a flat roof, the view would not be nearly so badly impaired as it is.  But it is yet another example of a magnificent scenic view being spoilt.</P>
    <P>Another small example&mdash;I deplore it&mdash;occurs on the coast road out to Dún Laoghaire.  I drive home along the Rock Road.  Just past Booterstown, there is that abominable beer bottle, ten feet high, at a picturesque spot on the road where there is a charming station and a water meadow in which wild fowl collect in the winter.  The firm is not Guinness, as a letter in the <i>Irish Times</i> alleged.  It belongs to a firm that ought to know better, a firm I admire greatly.  They are spoiling my drive home every evening.  The thing is an eyesore.  It is an abomination.  If it is any comfort, there is a similar bottle on the road from Corinth to Mycenae in <Col N="1730" /> Greece.  I have no power, of course, to have that removed.  I only wish I had the power.  The Greeks sometimes have lapses of taste, too.</P>
    <P>One other matter is the threat to one of our finest vistas in this city by the Electricity Supply Board.  Does the Electricity Supply Board desire to have a monument of ignominy and shame and tastelessness more lasting than bronze?  Do they desire a monument to which I and other citizens will point, which every visitor to Dublin will be shown as he goes past, that black spot, that black patch on one of the most noble vistas in the city, put up because of the tastelessness of the Electricity Supply Board. That is what will happen.  It will become a notorious eyesore.  I cannot understand how a public body, an intelligent, competent, and efficient body, could make a decision of the kind.  The only analogy I can imagine would be blistering the front of Leinster House, by order of the Seanad and the Dáil, with a great black spot, saying we will do it no matter what anyone says.</P>
    <P>I hope this is not the midnight hour. I hope it is only the eleventh hour.  I simply warn the ESB that public opinion is completely against them. If they go ahead, this will become a kind of tourist anti-attraction.  As one is driving down Fitzwilliam street in the bus, all heads will turn to this black patch, and the letters &ldquo;ESB&rdquo; will become a kind of national curse. I am serious, though I am, I admit, exaggerating a little.  That is the kind of thing we want to avoid, and the sooner we prevent it the better.  I am optimistic about the Bill if it brings about a change of heart.</P>
    <P>National monuments are included in the Bill.  Last week I asked the Minister for Finance whether there are any developments in the proposal to set up a kind of sub-department to look after our national monuments, which would be separated from the Board of Works.  I hope something of that kind will be done, and I should be very much interested if the Minister could tell us of any developments in that affair.</P>
    <P>In the amenities sections of the <Col N="1731" /> Bill, we are dealing with offences to the eye.  What about offences to the ear?  They do not come under the Bill, but I will not take more than two minutes to mention them.  Surely they are just as objectionable as ugly buildings or advertisements?  Surely blaring loudspeakers, raucous transistors and radios, roaring cars and motor cycles, are just as much an injury to the amenities of our cities and our country as are ugly buildings.  I urge the Minister, if he can, to take steps to cope with that kind of defilement of our country as well as the visual one.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge has said there are dangers in the strong powers of acquisition in this Bill.  Those dangers must be faced.  One can only have confidence in the justice and vigilance of the bodies who make the decisions.  The principle involved is simply the greater good of the greater number, and I believe the Bill is justified on that ground.</P>
    <P>Finally: as I say, the Bill will have two general effects throughout the country.  First, it will be a test.  It will be a test of the talent, vision and energy of our local bodies.  If they manifest a genuinely co-operative spirit, the result will be a fine justification of their sometimes questioned value.  They have a magnificent chance here, and I hope they will take it.  I hope they will take it with wisdom, justice and vision.  I also hope they will see to it that good taste is also catered for.  Above all, I believe there is the sign of a new era in this Bill.  If it is presented properly throughout the country, we may get some resurgence of interest in local beauty and local history which, to my mind, was much stronger 60 or 70 years ago than it has been in the past 20 or 30 years.  I may be wrong about that.  Perhaps I am more out of touch now, but whether I am right or wrong, I hope this opportunity will be seized to interest children in the beauty and history of our countryside.  With considerable confidence, I wish the Minister and the Department every possible success in the fulfilment of their proposals and plans.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Stanford, I see this Bill as a sign of a new era.  I see it in the context of the national expansion plan.  I was glad that, in his opening remarks, the Minister referred to the direct association between economic planning and physical planning being increasingly recognised by the people.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>Our policy of aiming at a progressive improvement in the national economy cannot achieve maximum success unless all sectors of national activity are co-ordinated.  In this context a comprehensive system of physical planning is obviously necessary.</P>
      <P>That about sums up the need for this new Bill.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to compliment the Minister, his officials, and the members of the Dáil who debated it arduously during the past eight or nine months, on the excellent job they have done, and on the splendid piece of legislation which is now before us. I should also like to avail of the opportunity to compliment the Minister on having arranged the circulation of the excellent memorandum which all Senators received, and which made the very technical provisions clear to all who studied it.</P>
      <P>I regard this Bill as important from the point of view that the teeth which were lacking in the Town and Regional Planning Acts, 1934 and 1935, are contained in this Bill.  Those teeth can bite and I hope they will bite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill, as in the Acts it repeals, county boroughs, borough corporations, county and urban councils, continue to be the planning authorities. Unlike other Acts, however, this Bill makes it obligatory on those authorities to make plans for the future development of their areas, specifying the objectives they intend to attain.  I hope that having made plans and specified objectives, they will see to it that everything possible is done to attain them.  Generally speaking, plans must be made within three years, and the makers will be the elected representatives on the corporations and <Col N="1733" /> councils.  I agree with Senator Stanford that it will be a test of the vision of the local representatives, and with him, I hope, they will have the good sense to make certain that good taste is the yardstick which will be applied to the execution of any proposals with regard to scenic amenities.</P>
    <P>It would be impossible to refer in detail to all the provisions in the Bill, but there are a few to which I should like to make passing reference.  The erection of new buildings and other structures, and the extension of existing buildings, will require the prior permission of the planning authority, and it will be an offence to proceed without such permission.  This is a very necessary clause which will obviate quite an amount of the inconvenience, disgust and horror that arose in parts of the country in recent years when people, as was described by Senator Stanford, were able to erect with amazing speed structures which conformed to no plan and which had no permission from anyone.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, the planning authorities will have power to preserve the beauty spots in their areas, and deal with the problem of ugly structures and hoardings which disfigure the countryside.  They will have power also to control advertising displays.  This is a most important provision which I hope will be used to the full, because anyone who has given any thought to the subject, or has seen, as instanced by Senator Stanford, that amazing sight on the road to Dún Laoghaire, will agree that someone, somewhere, somehow, should have power to take steps to ensure that the beauties of our avenues, roads and countryside are preserved and protected against vandalism, which is about the only way one can describe some of the advertising displays to be seen along our public roads.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, the local planning authorities will have power to protect and maintain public rights of way to the seaside and to the mountains and to create, where necessary, new rights of way.  I agree heartily with Senator Stanford again as to the need for constant vigilance in preserving existing rights and also the need for local planning <Col N="1734" /> authorities to investigate the complaints we have heard from many different parts of the country about denial of access to woodland, mountain and seashore by new owners, with a view to using the power they will have under this Bill to remedy that deplorable position.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes it possible to preserve buildings of historic or artistic interest.  I hope, however, the planning authorities will not be unduly influenced by pressure groups in their interpretation of this matter.  We have had some experience of this in recent times and we do not want organised attempts to block progress.  I find myself in total disagreement with Senator Stanford in his remarks on the ESB plans for the Fitzwilliam Street buildings.  I do not think&mdash;and I have not yet met anybody amongst the public who thinks&mdash;that they will be the abomination and desolation which he describes.  I do not believe the public are concerned to the extent which the society organising the protest against the new buildings would lead us to believe.  In fact, I do not believe there is any public objection so far to the progressive plans of the ESB for modern buildings in which their staffs will have comfort and hygienic conditions and a guarantee at least that they will not find themselves like the people of Skopje or Agadir after going to work.</P>
    <P>There are other commendable features in this Bill and I shall just refer to them briefly.  They are the power to acquire land, if necessary compulsorily, to give financial aid for training and research in relation to planning&mdash;the Minister referred to this and I regard it as a most important facility which could be provided by the planning authority&mdash;to deal with noise. In this regard I am afraid Senator Stanford forgot to read Section 51 of the Bill when he complained of the undue noise in our cities and towns and the atrocities committed every day by transistors in buses, trains and on the beaches.  Section 51 provides that planning authorities may deal with this menace of noise and also with the litter and billposting menace which exists to a great extent in our cities and large towns.  Under the Bill also, planning <Col N="1735" /> authorities will have power to preserve trees and woodlands and to prescribe building standards, which is a most important provision.</P>
    <P>Most important of all, however, in the Bill is Section 22 which requires the planning authority to put its development plan into operation.  There is very little use in having a Bill of this type and of this value if its provisions are to lie there without any action being taken on them.  It is good to know that this is not an adoptive measure on the part of local authorities but an obligatory one, to make a plan and then put it into operation.</P>
    <P>I agree that this Bill may bring a resurgence of local patriotism.  If local planning authorities use it in the way in which it is hoped they will use it, there is no doubt that local pride will be stimulated in the beauty spots and amenities of every area covered by the plan.</P>
    <P>I find myself also in disagreement with Senator Stanford regarding developments in Killarney.  I, too, have seen the structures down there and the proposed new structures in an adjoining area, and I cannot see how anybody can feel that they spoil the scenery or are in any way harmful to the beauties of Killarney.</P>
    <P>This is an excellent Bill and I feel sure the Seanad will want to expedite its passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is so comprehensive and so detailed that it is really impracticable to discuss it in detail and, therefore, one is thrown back on just dealing with a few general principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has already been done, I wish, first of all, to pay a tribute to the Minister and to the other people who co-operated in the preparation and presentation of this Bill.  The Minister gave us a very full and comprehensive statement in his introductory remarks.  In fact, everything one would want to say about the Bill was in the introductory statement.  We all agree and must agree with the whole idea behind this measure of dealing with the rural and urban planning of our country and I must say I was very much struck by the <Col N="1736" /> wide field that was covered, even finer aesthetics.  I agree with Senator Dooge's contribution and he said many of the things I would wish to say myself.  We must all welcome this Bill in that it replaces the old haphazard and piecemeal development of the countryside and of the cities, and replaces it with a co-ordinated and comprehensive form of planning, a positive rather than a negative form of planning.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that hitherto the planning authorities have tended to concentrate on the restrictive aspect of their function.  As he says, the Bill does not envisage that in future but that planning authorities will actively promote development.  While we agree with this and agree with the wider powers that are being given in order to carry out this proposal, it must be seen that this imposes a very great responsibility on the planning authorities.  While they had a responsibility in a negative way previously, they will now propose activities and see that they are carried out.</P>
    <P>In the carrying out of development plans the provisions of this Bill give great powers to the local authorities over the rights of citizens' lives and property and it is only to be hoped that these powers will be used with fairness and discretion.  I cannot help agreeing with Senator Stanford about the proper juxtaposition of buildings and kinds of buildings, about proper kinds of development, putting like with like, seeing that buildings harmonise with one another both in regard to type and having a suitable mixture of older buildings with new ones, and the proper juxtaposition of shopping centres and factory buildings in relation to buildings of artistic importance.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned all these matters and I am glad to see they will be dealt with but this does call for a high degree of sensitivity on the part of the planners.  It is very often taken for granted that the mere setting up of a planning authority with planners will bring ideal results.  The question is often asked: Why is this not being planned?  The giving of planning powers and the setting up of planning authorities will not, of themselves, ensure <Col N="1737" /> a well-planned ideal State.  The quality of the results of this Bill will only be in direct relation to the quality and competence of the persons composing planning authorities.</P>
    <P>On the aesthetic side, we have had a case here where Senator Stanford thinks, as I think, it is a pity that the Georgian houses in Fitzwilliam Street should be interfered with&mdash;that the facade from Holles Street Hospital right up to the Dublin mountains should be broken.  Even if these houses are not living-worthy, here is a case where they should be rebuilt in reproductive style.  The facade should be kept.  Dublin may be compared with many of our 18th century houses, which like trees have rotted away and have had to be replaced.  I am glad to see the development of skyscrapers and other modern buildings on the north side of the city.  But there are pockets such as Fitzwilliam Street, where the buildings should be preserved. In Greece, the old buildings have been restored.  There is nothing wrong about a reproduction, provided it is being utilised in the right place for the right purpose.  As good as the design submitted for the modern building in Fitzwilliam Street is, it is a tragedy to interpose a new building alongside these old ones.  We have the example of Senator Ó Maoláin commending the new building, whereas Senator Stanford does not like it.  This is a case in which there is a conflict on aesthetics.  That will be one of the difficulties in carrying out the intentions of this Bill in certain areas.</P>
    <P>There are 87 planning authorities, and it will be very difficult to get 87 good results.  I was struck by the idea that there is to be a central authority, but only on a county basis.  I do not remember in the Minister's statement whether there was any provision for a central authority.  It would be better to have one central authority under the Minister, where there would be some form of co-ordination between all these different bodies.  It is not sufficient to have a central authority merely on a county basis.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us if he envisages some form of central authority, perhaps in his Department?  That is where real <Col N="1738" /> authority could be established, not in a dictatorial way but in an advisory manner.  There was an idea that the Arts Council might be used for such purposes.  Perhaps it could still be used on the aesthetic side; and on the technical and engineering side, there might be a central authority to act in an advisory capacity.  With these few remarks, I welcome this Bill and I hope it will achieve the results we all desire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>
      <P>Originally, I intended to protest against this Bill being rushed through the House, but, in view of the fact that the point must be decided on Committee Stage, I shall reserve my remarks until then.</P>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the Bill as a whole.  I agree with all Senator Dooge has said.  He has covered the field so well that I shall deal with the Bill only so far as it interlocks with building development. To introduce any instrument which attempts to consolidate under a minimum of headings in the field of town planning is something that is good and welcome.  One must remember that town planning is a most inexact science.  It has to cater for the future in addition to the present.  Those of us who have had practical experience of town planning over the years find we are always trying to get out of obsolescence, but no matter how we try to prepare for the future, it always lets us down and we find we had not really prepared for the future at all. Some instrument to clarify the national position regarding town planning is long overdue.  For the first time, the interdependence of planning and building is recognised and we have a commonsense approach to town planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Heretofore, those of us who have had experience in this field have been frustrated by the interlocking of building bye-laws, town planning and the various committees of the local authorities. Everybody associated with these committees found they were getting nowhere fast.  This Bill is an attempt to channel thoughts along a particular town planning line.  There is always the danger that, despite the Minister's efforts, everything will end up by the town planning committees of the <Col N="1739" /> county councils having the will of the town planning officers imposed on everything they do.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford made a general recommendation that these committees should be selected from councillors with an aesthetic feeling, who would understand beauty and amenity as interpreted for us by the Senator. Unfortunately, it does not happen that way.  The various local authority committees are appointed, and, in some cases, when they come to the town planning committee, there is nobody left but those who were not elected to the other committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ó Maoláin appealed for co-operation with various people down the country in the implementation of this Bill.  To prove the inexactness of this science, Senator Stanford and the Leader of the House were absolutely opposed to each other on one little issue&mdash;the ESB monstrosity that is to be created.  They disagree with that entirely.  That in itself illustrates to a degree how people can differ in that field.  You can only achieve effective contemporary planning with satisfactory results, if sufficient emphasis is laid on estate design. By that, I mean the preservation of the existing landscape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year we had Scandinavian people here to tell us that we had no ideas about design.  Perhaps they were right&mdash;I do not know.  I believe we have a wonderful opportunity to demonstrate to them in this Bill that we can give a lesson in design.  We also had an architect, who came to a firm of developers, telling us that we <Col N="1740" /> had no ideas in regard to house or estate development.  It might be information to these people that in this country we have the highest building standards in Europe.  I am sure the Minister is aware of that; certainly his Department are.  For many years also, we have been approaching a high standard in design but unfortunately economics curb our activities in that field and we are not able to express ourselves on the grand scales we would wish.  However, arrangements have been made in this Bill by which that can now be done.</P>
    <P>I will confine myself to a few observations on buildings as affecting town planning, which ought to have been considered by the Minister in his compilation of this Bill.  I am surprised to note the omission of a section to ensure the co-operation of ancillary services.  By that, I mean building an estate in accordance with your town plan.  The ESB come along and lay down cable after opening up a cutting. Then they backfill and concrete.  The developer carries on with his work. Three weeks later, the gas company rip up the same place; then backfill and concrete.  We still have the sewerage and other services to be catered for, in addition to the telephone services.  All this means ripping up, re-ripping up, and so on.  If we want to preserve the amenities of a district, that sort of activity within an estate only tends to despoil an area.</P>
    <P>Another feature is the unending and serried ranks of poles carrying wires for the ESB and the old fashioned tungsten lamps.  They can all be buried.  Nothing can eliminate or despoil views as much as those poles do.  On one occasion I took some photographs&mdash;which, by appointment, I hope sometime to show to the Minister&mdash;which show a well finished estate in Walkinstown.  Without any gimmick or trick of the lens, you can completely obliterate the view of the mountains by a complete wall of poles.  In the earlier decades in this State, it was vital to carry these wires over the countryside and along the streets, because it was economical, but in 1963, in the economic revival through which we are supposed to be passing, we ought to abolish these poles and these wires. <Col N="1741" /> Somebody in the other House referred to them as street furniture.  It is a fair description of them.  The building fraternity have other names for them.</P>
    <P>In regard to the provisions generally in this Bill, I regret to note the absence of provision for, or appreciation of the importance of co-relating the housing development with contemporary trends in perspective and design. I am disappointed that no adequate provision has been made to ensure the drawing up of specific-plans relating to the matter of architectural or engineering design, with particular reference to local authority housing policy, both for themselves and for private enterprise.  A private developer, when he comes to develop a piece of countryside, will, if he possibly can, preserve the amenities of that district because it is economic for him to do so.  If he wants to sell his houses, it is up to him to produce something that is attractive.  People are going to live in them all their lives and it is his job to make an article that is marketable.</P>
    <P>The local authorities are not involved in markets like that so they just run up two or three miles of concrete wall, a piece of ground back and front, which they call a garden, and then produce a lot of cell-like blocks and call them houses.  Only in recent years have the local authorities moved into a little touch of design, but only in so far as they will change the colour of the dashing on one terrace as against the colour on another terrace. Basically, that has nothing to do with town planning, but strangely enough, it is accepted as being a move towards better planning.</P>
    <P>I should like to go back a little now in regard to the ancillary services.  I have had experience of machines taking out a cutting for a quarter of a mile of road and then the various services were laid.  There was difficulty in getting co-operation but I must say that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs co-operated one hundred per cent from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; and eventually we achieved co-ordination. The result is there, at Mount Merrion, for anybody to see.  It is an ordinary estate and I challenge anybody, including <Col N="1742" /> the architect who came to tell us about design, to go anywhere on the continent or in England to see anything better.  These are Irish designs. The provision of good house design is related also to the following factors: site layout, which should provide as an important principle, the preservation of the natural amenities.</P>
    <P>A second provision of good housing design is related also to house design compatible with the foregoing but incorporating a degree of artistic and technical freedom which is at present denied under both the existing and proposed legislation.  In such connection, there is absolutely no freedom or flexibility in view of the restriction on floor areas in those houses which at present qualify for grants to within a maximum of 1,400 square feet.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Minister for this: it is the existing law.  If you are building a house to fit in with the design in any estate and if you exceed 1,400 square feet by one foot, you will be denied the housing grant of £275.  You cannot exceed 1,400 square feet by one foot.  But if you build your house with 1,399 square feet, that is, only one square foot less than the 1,400 square feet, you will get your grant.  Then you can come along at a subsequent date and put two rooms upstairs and you will be given a grant for doing that.</P>
    <P>We will not give a man a grant for exceeding 1,400 square feet when he could build a lovely house but if he builds a house not exceeding 1,400 square feet and sticks an abutment on to the end of it, destroying the amenities of the whole area, the Minister will subsequently give a grant of £280 for it.  Surely, that ought to be changed.  I know he cannot do it now but the Minister should consider raising that 1,400 square feet proviso in relation to the ordinary grant-sized house to 1,600 or 1,800 square feet. That was all right immediately after the war when we had to conserve materials and to use Irish materials, as we still do.  However, there was a shortage of them and the amount of cement and materials available had to be spread over a greater area and used to house as many people as possible. <Col N="1743" /> That situation does not obtain now. If the Minister increases the size of the house for a grant, it will help town planning and estate design.</P>
    <P>In passing, I might say, apart from the Bill, that it is good to note that various local authorities are at last leaving the old 1908 types of lamps and are moving on towards mercury fluorescent lighting.  That is an intelligent step even if the new light, which is a better light, is not as flattering to the delicate colouring and features of the ladies as the old light.</P>
    <P>A local authority can claim against a developer under Section 26 (2) (g). If the local authority do any work in connection with the land on which he proposes to build, they can recoup their expenditure and make the developer pay.  However, the Bill does not permit a developer to claim from another developer, if he provides the various services.  Nobody knows this position better than the Minister and his officials.  People with land to be developed have waited for years for a developer to move in, knowing that the cost of running drains and services along a main road might be in the region of £15,000 to £20,000.  Then, when these services have been provided, they apply to the planning authority for permission to build.  Is it not possible that the person who provided the services can be compensated?</P>
    <P>Section 26 (4) (b) deals with the two month period of application.  If it is made over two months, and you receive no communication, then you can build by default.  However, the section now says that the town planning people can send out to the developer&mdash;the applicant&mdash;a letter requiring some further information.  If I read the section correctly, the new two month period dates from the reply to that letter to the town planning authority.  Let me put it like this.  I make submissions to the local authority. After a month, they send me a letter asking some questions.  I send a reply to that letter.  Now, the two month period starts from the reply to that letter.  I agree that it is a little advance on what used to occur.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1744" /> Hitherto, when you made application to develop a site and the statutory period of reply was two months, if at the end of two months, you did not get a reply one way or the other, you could build by default.  I used to wait for the second last day of the statutory period because I knew the post would convey a refusal.  However, if I read this section correctly, there is to be greater procrastination still. They have not even to refuse you. They have only to send you a letter asking the colour of your eyes.</P>
    <P>Of all the attempts to consolidate planning over the years, I never dreamed it could be done as well as the Minister has succeeded in doing it. Deputy Jones took the major lead, on the Opposition, on the Bill and on the construction of certain sections of it. One feels a great satisfaction that this Bill went so ruggedly through the other House before it reached us.  I feel particularly bad about our being rushed in our debate here and in being asked to let the Bill through this House without delay.  Nevertheless, I am satisfied that very little further, if anything, could be accomplished, apart from brushing up one or two points in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I may have occasion to speak on some of the sections but I shall have only one or two points to make.  I should like to record my complete satisfaction that an instrument of this nature has reached this stage in this House and I wish it <i>bon voyage</i> when this House passes it.  I sincerely hope its implementation will not be disappointing to the Minister.  If the town planning authorities dwell unduly on aesthetics and all this business of town planning, then I fear all the trouble in the preparation of this Bill will go for naught.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is within the power of the Minister, apart from the Bill, at any time, to create some form of consultative service, apart from regional or national planning.  I know quite well that the Minister has advisers who are quite capable in the field of town planning and local government.  I know most of them and I know their ability, but town planning is a most inexact <Col N="1745" /> science and everybody can contribute to the development of an area.  I am thinking of Bobbie Burns, when people were wondering why he did not line up with Bonny Mary of Argyle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree in principle with the Bill.  I think the idea behind it is very sound and that a form of rational planning and development, both for town and country, is long overdue.  A town planning Bill was enacted in 1934 and amended by another in 1939 but it is true to say that neither of these Acts ever worked. It was optional for local authorities to adopt the 1934 Act or not.  Many of them in fact adopted it and when they had done so, they were obliged to prepare a town plan, but notwithstanding the fact that a goodly number of local authorities adopted the 1934 Act, very few of them&mdash;in fact, none of them&mdash;prepared a town plan.  The outstanding example was Dublin Corporation who, 15 years after the passing <Col N="1746" /> of the 1934 Act, were sued in the High Court in respect of an order to compel them to prepare a town plan so that the citizens of Dublin might know where they stood.  Despite the fact that the High Court, and later the Supreme Court, ordered the Dublin Corporation to prepare and perfect a plan, I do not think they ever did so.</P>
      <P>The reason was that the Acts of 1934 and 1939 were not workable. They attempted too much and attempted to plan on a very long-term basis.  I think that a number of local authorities were advised by experts on the form of town plan which they should prepare and pass and a lot of those plans were farcical in the extreme.  However, the Minister and the Government have decided that the Acts of 1934 and 1939 should be replaced and the present Bill is a serious effort to provide the country with a rational planning system.  I should like to congratulate the Minister and his advisers on bringing it in. I will, of course, have some criticisms later of the details of its provisions, but by and large, it is a good measure which deserves congratulation.  I should also like to congratulate the Minister on the manner in which he dealt with the Bill in the Dáil and met the constructive opposition presented in the Dáil by the Opposition Parties.</P>
      <P>I will be pardoned for saying that the Bill took four days on the Second Stage in the Dáil and 11 days in Committee, while the remaining Stages, I think, took three or four days.  I am saying that because I understand we are expected to deal with this Bill in a very short time here.  That is a mistake because despite the amount of good work which has been done in the Dáil, a lot more could be done here.  There are a number of Senators on both sides of the House who have specialised knowledge, both architectural and legal, which could usefully be applied to the Bill but I understand that due to the time of the year at which it has been introduced, the Minister may make demands to have it dealt with very quickly.  That is a mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill was introduced in the Dáil away back on 12th September, 1962, <Col N="1747" /> and the Second Stage was not taken until 22nd November.  This Bill could with considerable profit have been introduced in this House and the Second Stage and Committee Stage dealt with here with much advantage to the Bill.  It is non-contentious and we had considerable time on our hands which could have been devoted to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Bill in principle. Town and regional planning is absolutely essential and the rights of the individual must give way, where necessary, to the rights of the community as a whole.  It seems to me, however, that we should be very careful in a measure of this sort to ensure that rights of individual ownership and rights of property are not infringed unless such infringement is absolutely necessary in the public interest.  That is one of the complaints I have against this measure. All through, with very few exceptions, the only remedy an individual has against attack, if I may use so strong a word, is to appeal to the Minister.  I do not think that is a sufficient safeguard. Under some provisions in the Bill, a planning authority may do certain things but shall do certain things if called upon by the Minister to do so.  Yet the only action an individual has against action taken against him by the planning authority, at the express request of the Minister, is to appeal to the Minister.  That is, I think, asking too much of the Minister. It is asking too much of human nature to ask the Minister to overrule himself or reverse himself on appeal.</P>
    <P>In my experience, appeal to the Minister is never satisfactory because it is not an appeal in open court.  At best, the evidence is given to an inspector appointed by the Minister. He does not give a decision at the conclusion of the evidence.  He goes back to Dublin and several months later, a written decision is sent down from the Custom House.  From the point of view of the layman, from the point of view of a litigant, that is not satisfactory.  I know the Minister's answer is that, if he is to preserve uniformity, he must keep control. There is something in what the Minister says, but I think he could restore, <Col N="1748" /> or preserve, public confidence by appointing an arbitrator to deal with this sort of thing.</P>
    <P>In the past, we have had circuit court judges appointed as arbitrators for a special type of appeal, such as Army pension appeals, and so on. Under this Bill, there will be 87 planning authorities and we can be quite certain that in the early stages, at any rate, there will be a considerable number of appeals from their decisions.  It would be well worthwhile to appoint an individual&mdash;let him be a circuit court judge, a senior counsel, an engineer, or some other person&mdash;to hear these appeals and give decisions there and then, instead of sending an inspector down to report in secret to the Minister, and the Minister then giving his decision.  The Minister cannot but be influenced by the fact that he may have already directed a planning authority to do that against which appeal is taken. That is my strongest complaint against this Bill.  It is, I think, fundamental.</P>
    <P>The next point is, perhaps, more appropriate to Committee Stage, but I shall raise it now.  I am not too happy about it.  Section 19 obliges a planning authority to make a plan. Section 20 obliges the planning authority to review that plan now and again, and certainly once every five years.  Section 21 says:</P>
    <P>Where a planning authority have prepared a draft of a proposed development plan or of proposed variations of a development plan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>they shall do certain things.  Those are outlined at pages 16 and 17.  They are all very important steps.  They shall send copies of the prescribed documents to the prescribed authorities; they shall publish a notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in a paper circulating in the area; where the draft includes a provision relating to structures proposed to be preserved, they shall do certain things.  Several other things are outlined, all of which are very important. They are obliged to do these things only if they prepare a draft of the plan.</P>
    <P>Is there any obligation on the planning authority to prepare a draft? <Col N="1749" /> Would it not be open to the planning authority, if they were clever enough, to go ahead and put the plan into force, without preparing any draft?  If they do that none of these safeguards in Section 21 will be effective.  I hope the Minister has some explanation for this.  There must be an explanation, but it is significant that, even in the index to the Bill, there is Section 19, &ldquo;Obligation to make development plan and contents of plan&rdquo;; Section 20 &ldquo;Obligation to review development plan and variations of plan&rdquo;; Section 21 &ldquo;Publication of notices with respect to plans, etc.&rdquo;, but it does not say there is an obligation to publish notice.  Section 33 (9) says:</P>
    <P>Where any such direction as is referred to in subsection (1) of this section is proposed to be given by the Minister, a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the direction shall not be given until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.</P>
    <P>There you have a positive direction that a draft shall be prepared.  There must, I feel, be an answer to my query.  I hope the Minister will give it to me when he comes to reply.</P>
    <P>The other criticisms I have are mainly on the grounds that the Bill does not provide a suitable form of appeal to an independent tribunal.  I shall elaborate on that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Senators in welcoming this Bill.  To anybody remotely concerned with the development of urban and rural areas it is quite obvious this Bill is urgently necessary.  I am appreciative of the value of artistic features and amenities in town and country planning.  I would not go so far as the late Henry Ford when he said: &ldquo;You can have your motor car any colour you like, so long as it is black.&rdquo;  From the artistic point of view, that is not a very commendable attitude, but Henry Ford did build something like 15 million motor cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many things pending in urban and rural areas in relation to which this Bill is urgently necessary. I should like to see it passed and <Col N="1750" /> implemented as quickly as possible.  In Dublin, the district I know best in this connection, the planning of schools and hospitals is being&mdash;I shall not go so far as to say held up&mdash;seriously inconvenienced by the lack of an official, authoritative plan.</P>
    <P>There is, for instance, the project to replace seven of our small hospitals here by a much smaller number of modern hospitals as soon as we can get the money to do it.  We do not know when that will be but we hope it will not be too far ahead.  Before that day comes when we are told we can have some money, we should like to have planned the location and size of the new hospitals that will take the place of the large number of small old hospitals but we cannot do that unless we know where the concentration of population in the city will be, not now or tomorrow or ten years' time but 20 years' time from now.  We know where the hospitals that are being planned are likely to be but there may well be concentrations of population for 20 years ahead of which we have no knowledge at present.  I have personal knowledge of the way in which our efforts are continuously held up in that regard and I am quite certain that in other things as well there is a similar situation.  Therefore, I welcome this Bill and I hope that it may be passed and put into operation as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>As one who has been many years a representative on a local authority, I wish to add my voice to those of Senators who welcomed the Bill to commend the Minister and his officials for making what I think is the greatest step forward in local government legislation since the foundation of the State.  There is no doubt that it has come only in the nick of time, if at all in time, because it has been a great source of embarrassment and frustration to members of local authorities to prohibit an activity in building or any other activity under town planning and to find there was no power in law to implement that decision, so that a person could ignore an order or request and continue to build undesirable features.  There is also the position at the moment in <Col N="1751" /> some seaside resorts where one may observe the completely crazy and inadequate habitations going up, presumably for a few months of the summer, but which are deteriorating every year and which certainly do not add to the beauty of the locality but militate against it.</P>
      <P>In the cities particularly we are all aware of the increasing chaos in traffic regulation.  In Cork City bridges are needed and the increasing traffic on our roads is a growing problem and something must be done immediately to solve it.  Then leading out of the city to a certain seaside resort about 30 miles away there are at least 20 petrol stations, again very indiscriminate planning.  I urge the Minister or his successor when the time comes to give the local authorities as much autonomy as possible to plan in their own areas and not to insist that every little detail should be sent to Dublin for sanction.  I presume that is the intention under the Bill and in that sense I welcome it because it is obvious that those who are interested in the locality are the best judges of the background of any scheme they want to advance in that locality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope you will allow me a little indulgence if I commend the Minister on his recent and not so recent exhortations to local authorities about the necessity of providing swimming baths. I would advocate the provision of swimming baths for towns and villages with a population of, say, 3,000 or 4,000.  There is tremendous State aid there for the local authorities but I am afraid that many people outside the local authority members altogether do not appreciate the health-giving services rendered to the community by the provision of swimming pools. There are many children who are not fitted physically for outdoor, field past-times. If they are trained as swimmers and life savers from the age of 10 or 11 years they would be capable at 16 or 17 years of taking part in practically any game.  If it is desired to reduce the number of hospitals and the expenditure on health services much more attention should be paid by the local authorities to the provision of swimming <Col N="1752" /> baths.  The Minister has come out and identified himself with that over the last number of years and I commend him for it.  I hope that in the near future his words will have effect.</P>
    <P>We appreciate how busy the Minister and his officials have been in the past 12 months with important legislation but we can truthfully say this legislation is as important as any that has been passed not alone by his Department but by any other Department, and I congratulate him and his officials on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish also to welcome the Bill.  This measure had a very good reception in Dáil Éireann and a very good reception in the Labour Party.  I read with interest the debate mostly between Deputy Jones and the Minister and I congratulate Deputy Jones for the study he gave the Bill and his reasons for not agreeing with some of the amendments by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Everything the Minister has in this Bill is reasonable and I believe it will do a lot of good.  The only regret I have is that he was not Minister in 1939 because there is no doubt that a great deal of damage has been done since 1939 and millions of pounds have been spent on grants and everything else, and it will take millions of pounds to undo some of the harm that has been done.</P>
      <P>When the 1939 Act became law, people had a sort of horror of that Act.  They were afraid to do anything without asking permission but as they grew older they found out they could do quite a lot without asking permission from anyone.  That is what has been happening lately and perhaps that is why we have the situation of which we have heard today.  The fact is that in some counties the Town and Regional Planning Act was not adopted.  Take Offaly, for example.  There has been jerry-building in that county.  A person could build a shed on the side of the main road or put trees at a corner obstructing the view.  That has gone on all down the years since 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Meath where I was a member of the local authority they are more careful. Application had to be made <Col N="1753" /> under the Town and Regional Planning Act to do the work.  Site plans and specifications had to be supplied and there was quite an amount of good work done through that.  In Westmeath, when it came to building new houses, permission had to be obtained under the Town and Regional Planning Act; otherwise, grants would not be made available. When it came to reconstruction grants and grants for work done under the farm improvements scheme, a person had not to go to the bother of looking for permission at all under the Town and Regional Planning Act.  For that reason, sheds were built in places where they should not have been built, and work was carried out which disfigured houses, such as the addition of flat roofs or even in roofs.  Some of them have not stood the test of time. Lean-to sheds which were added four or five years ago now have to be taken down.  I hope that when this Bill becomes an Act some consideration will be given to the specification of work to be done.</P>
    <P>Something in this Bill which affects us very much in Westmeath where we have some of the most beautiful lakes in the country is the question of access. Very few of our lakes have proper means of access to them and the position has worsened in recent years because some of the estates surrounding the lakes have been purchased by foreigners who have closed the entrances to the lakes.  Recently a foreigner who had bought land at a place called Lilliput closed the gate leading to the lake.  Fortunately the county manager took drastic action and in a registered letter to the owner informed him that if he did not do something within a short time he would take action.  The landowner gave in under that pressure but in many of the other places they have not given in and if there is provision in this Bill for proper access to lakes it will be a good day's work.</P>
    <P>The question of hoardings also arises. People apply to the county manager for permission to put up hoardings and he refuses, but yet the next day they are put up.  In Mullingar, a friend of mine built a beautiful bungalow.  A <Col N="1754" /> petrol station was put up beside it and then, without permission, a hoarding which completely obliterated the house from the road.  Under the existing legislation, nothing could be done about that.  Now if you erect something without permission and it has to be removed afterwards for any reason, the council is under no obligation to give compensation for its removal.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of dance-halls. In Mullingar, the foundations of a dancehall were being laid, although no permission had been granted, but eventually the county manager gave permission, subject to the consent of the Minister.  There was a local hall in Mullingar and 55 organisations including the Red Cross and political Parties got funds from the use of this hall.  These organisations signed a petition seeking permission for the erection of the hall.  The hall was built and the people were dancing in it and we never received any word as to what the decision was.  That gives you an idea of what we had to cope with under the Town and Regional Planning Act.</P>
    <P>The erection of petrol pumps has also been mentioned.  The country has been disfigured by these pumps.  I do not know what the idea is or why the companies are so keen to erect them. If they concentrated on giving cheaper petrol, it would be much better than erecting pumps every hundred yards. Recently, the county manager refused permission for the erection of a petrol pump in the market square.  There were two pumps within 100 yards of it, and he said it would cause an obstruction but a politician came down and said it would be built and within 24 hours they were digging and the pump went up.  When the local authority makes a decision, that type of thing should not be done.  That should not be done by the Minister without an inquiry and giving good reasons why it should be done.</P>
    <P>Rights of way are also dealt with in this Bill.  In rural areas, rights of way are usually located at the bottom of an old gripe.  That came down from the landlord system.  Nowadays, these rights of way are too narrow for the passage of modern machinery and I knew of one man who lost his crop <Col N="1755" /> last year because he could not get a combine through.  A man should not be prevented from getting into his land because the landowner between him and his land does not want him to go there.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of public lighting.  When a housing scheme is being prepared, one of the features should be proper lighting arrangements. Five years ago, we had a beautiful housing scheme built in Rochfortbridge. There were 100 houses in it but if you pass through it in winter, it is a dungeon.  Apparently you must take over the roads, declare them public roads and provide money for the lighting.  There should not be all that red tape involved where 100 houses and probably 500 people are involved.</P>
    <P>Senator Carton dealt very ably with the question of ESB cables and I agree with him entirely.  I believe if we are to make this Act a success&mdash;and it is one of the finest that has been produced because the Minister has seen all the flaws and has tried to curb any abuses that existed and anybody who tries to break the law in future will find himself in difficulty&mdash; every local authority should employ a design engineer.  A design engineer is wanted badly in every county.  He could help in disputes regarding compensation. On several occasions in recent months, I have been called in to make agreements arising from the widening of main roads from Dublin to Galway and so on.  Fortunately, agreement has been reached in cases where people had been in dispute for five years.  There should be a small committee in every county and a design engineer who could try to settle as many disputes at home instead of sending everything to the Minister. Nearly all matters of appeal must go to the Minister and he would want to work 24 hours of the day to cope with the appeals that will arise from the implementation of this measure.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about arbitrators.  I believe a panel of arbitrators should be appointed.  At present we have only one and we come in contact with him in connection with <Col N="1756" /> compulsory purchase orders for the erection of working class houses. There has been great delay because the arbitrator could not come when he was required.  We should have a panel of arbitrators.  I see no trouble whatsoever in having such a panel of five or six.  They would speed up things for the local authorities.  We are severely criticised every day of the week because of the time it takes to get a job going.  For example, we started to reconstruct our dancehall in Mullingar months before the new man came in and built the hall; yet he had the hall built in four months while we had not got the initial plans through the Department.</P>
    <P>Delays in the Department are bad and there will be great delays about compensation and appeals.  I would urge the Minister to try to prevent long delays.  I welcome the Bill as a good measure.  I can assure the Minister that there will be quite a lot of discontent. People will say that there will be more red tape as a result of this Bill but it must come if we are to have proper development and proper planning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to welcome this Bill because it is an excellent idea to have long-term planning.  I want to refer to the danger, in long-term planning, of planners searching for an easy way round a large problem, as, for example, bypassing some of our larger provincial towns.  That should definitely be the last resort as a solution of any problem which planners may come up against.  It is most unfair to endeavour to take away the business from any of our traders or business people throughout the country.  In many of our towns there are traffic problems and that suggestion has been made as a possible solution.  The Minister should always think twice when such a proposal is made to him and endeavour to preserve the trading and business of these towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to see, in all new plans for urban areas, adequate provision for car parks.  The parking of cars in some of our provincial towns is a major problem.  Heretofore, there <Col N="1757" /> had been no great plans for its solution. The problem should be tackled without delay.  As far as possible, the intention should be to preserve the residential areas as such and to prevent the indiscriminate erection of garages and filling stations and, as mentioned by Senator McAuliffe, ballrooms.  The last mentioned can be quite a nuisance in residential areas.  They attract many people quite a number of whom are very inconsiderate patrons who hoot car horns, shout and roar and laugh and bang car doors at all hours of the morning, thus preventing citizens nearby from having a peaceful night's rest.  I hope the Bill will strength the powers of the Garda in dealing with that problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the future largescale planning offering the least inconvenience possible to all sections of the community.  I have in mind farmers whose land is acquired for the erection of houses or for road-widening purposes. Local authorities should make prompt payment for land acquired.  I have known cases where the sale of land to local authorities took three and four years to complete.  Surely that must be unnecessary?  I should like to see these sales hurried up.</P>
    <P>Take the village of Rathcoole in County Dublin where half the street has been ripped up since last November. It is a downright disgrace that inconvenience should be caused to the general public where this road, one of the busiest thoroughfares in the country, is concerned for the past nine or ten months.  The job has not been completed as yet.  Could the Minister request local authorities to put larger gangs at work on our busier thoroughfares, such as this thoroughfare, and so expedite work?</P>
    <P>As far as Section 52 is concerned, we should acknowledge the tremendous work Bord Fáilte have done for the country with their Tidy Towns competition.  One cannot but notice the great transformation which has taken place in so many of our towns. I live in Abbeyleix which was always a picturesque place but since that competition started, the appearance <Col N="1758" /> of the town has been enhanced considerably.</P>
    <P>Local authorities should be asked to provide more litter baskets, especially in the vicinity of schools.  Senator Ó Maoláin mentioned the playing of transistor sets and other antics of the younger generation and described them as atrocious.  I think it is morally wrong for the older generation constantly to be badgering the teenagers and telling them to stop doing this or that, to turn off this or that and saying they are a disgrace to society when that is not a fact.  I believe the coming generation and the teenagers in this country will prove themselves to be the best generation we have known.  All that is necessary is that elementary civics should be taught in our schools.  This is very relevant because the vast majority of public property is under the jurisdiction of the Department of Local Government. Children, especially those in our national schools, should be taught to use litter baskets, to have consideration, especially for the older people, to have pride in their country and to give a hand in keeping it tidy as well as leaving it a better place for future generations to live in.</P>
    <P>There is a problem where the local authority acquires large tracts of land in eliminating dangerous bends.  More often than not, these corners are left as convenient places for itinerants to park.  In County Laois, where practically every dangerous bend has been eliminated, the council on more than one occasion have sold corners that were old roads to individuals to build houses on and convenient to the town of Portlaoise a wonderful bungalow has been built on what was a waste corner.  Right through the country, this procedure could be followed with great effect.</P>
    <P>Another problem arises where local authorities build lay-bys for the convenience of truck drivers and other people who want to rest off the main thoroughfare.  In many cases the new mobile tinkers pull in there and leave the place in a shambles.  Some steps should be taken to put these people off the major roads because these lay-bys <Col N="1759" /> were not intended for the convenience of these lazy people.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see this Bill and I hope it will be a success when implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would wish to express my appreciation of the manner in which this Bill was received in the Seanad and to say that the approach of those who have spoken was in keeping with the manner in which the Bill was dealt with in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooge mentioned that regional and national planning as such were not mentioned in the discussions in the Dáil.  In fact, I think he is rather misinformed there.  There was reference to this aspect&mdash;which is a very important aspect&mdash;of the matter. Certainly as far as I was concerned, it was mentioned in both my opening and closing Second Reading speeches in the Dáil and, indeed, today I have drawn particular attention to the need for correlation of plans and collaboration, not only within a county or region but from a national point of view.</P>
      <P>He also mentioned what he felt was wrong with the 1934 Act and on this point I can say that I fully agree with him.  If we are to improve on the 1934 Act, the first thing we really need is public support.  He elaborated saying that without public support urban renewal and re-development which can and undoubtedly will be a touchy matter will not be possible.  At an early stage I realised this and on several occasions I appealed to public people, members of the Oireachtas and of councils throughout the country, for this particular public support.  It is mainly through members of the Oireachtas and of local councils that we must seek guidance for the public so that they will realise what planning can mean to them.  I join fully and wholeheartedly in the view that we do need public opinion behind us if we are to benefit by the proposals in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same speaker expressed fear that urban renewal proposals would not be required to be shown on development plans.  In fact, urban renewal of obsolete areas must under Section 19 be shown on development <Col N="1760" /> plans and the Senator can rest easy about that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>The same speaker also mentioned that there was no reference to flooding in the Bill.  In fact, flooding is covered in line 54, page 45, of the Bill dealing with development prejudicial to public health.  That, we are advised, brings any flooding that may occur fully and adequately under the Bill.</P>
    <P>The question has been asked&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;who is likely to be called upon to decide what are the scenic amenities or natural beauties of a particular place.  I hope the matter may be approached on the lines suggested by, I think, Senator Stanford that a planning authority might establish certain specialised groups, drawn no doubt from the general area, to determine matters such as these.  Taisce, Bord Fáilte, an Chomhairle Ealaíon and other similar bodies might, indeed, be consulted in addition to any local persons who might be felt to have particular knowledge and appreciation of the natural beauties of the countryside or any specialised knowledge which would be of use to a planning authority.  That is not to say that I agree with the sentiment expressed by other speakers that we could not get enough enlightenment and appreciation of all these things within our authorities. No matter how strange a collection they sometimes may appear to be, I believe that sounder common sense often emanates from the discussions of local authorities than from specialists in many fields to whom they have recourse.  If they can get local specialists, so much the better, but I do not go along with the belief that you can call on new people and let the local authority bow out and hand over to a group of persons, even though they may be better qualified to judge these things.  You should get the sound common sense of the local body supplemented by local specialised knowledge or the advice of some of the bodies I have mentioned.  That is what I would like to see.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that noise does not come within this Bill but that is being put right and the 1957 Act adequately covers the matter.</P>
    <P>Rights of way have been mentioned <Col N="1761" /> by several people.  Straight away, let me say that I am very conscious of this matter and had been so before we formulated the proposals in the Bill.  I am conscious of how zealously we regard our rights of way, particularly in the rural parts of Ireland. The idea that anyone, whether native, returned native, or complete stranger, should be allowed to close off perfectly good and safe beaches which our people have been using for generations, or close off access to mountains frequented by our people from time immemorial, or close off riverside walks, is completely abhorrent to me.  Not only do I believe that we have power in this measure to ensure that that will not be done but it is my wish, and I shall be most disappointed if our local planning authorities do not ensure by exercising their rights that such does not happen, that every care will be taken to preserve these amenities for our people, or to create them, where necessary, so that our people may enjoy amenities unmolested.  That is the power in this section.  I am, of course, conscious at the same time that owners must not be trampled upon or their rights abused.  Looking at the matter fairly and squarely, the greater likelihood is that it is the rights of the public that will be trampled upon.  That is the way I see it.  I may be prejudiced but, if I am, I have had some experience that causes me to be so.</P>
    <P>Some Senators, particularly Senators Stanford and Senator Dooge, referred to the education of our public.  One Senator suggested that there should be education in matters of appreciation of planning and suggested that the responsibility was that of the Minister concerned, presumably the Minister for Local Government.  It was later suggested that the Minister for Education might prepare a booklet setting out in general terms what young people should appreciate and the manner in which they should appreciate it.  That is something which commends itself to me.  In fact, we shall be taking every opportunity to get across to the public as full an understanding as possible of what planning really means.  I have already mentioned what we hope to do <Col N="1762" /> in the line of courses and discussion groups.  We have in mind the issue of a comprehensive booklet in very plain, non-technical language.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any chance of one of the Minister's good films on these lines, including shots of ancient Greek town planning and development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a possibility. All we have decided on at the moment is the booklet to which I have referred. Any other means at our disposal, not excluding films, TV, and so on, we will certainly avail of.  I do not need any persuasion that an informed public is absolutely vital to the working of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Carton raised the problem of the developer who is called upon to pay betterment charges for services laid down by the local authority at public expense which, in turn, facilitate the development of that particular property.  He pointed to the apparent anomaly of a developer laying down services which, in fact, become public because they facilitate other landowners by enabling them to connect up with the services available.  That is an erroneous interpretation of the situation.  Where a developer is required, possibly as a condition of his planning permission, to lay down services in excess of his own requirements, the local planning authority will be required to pay the additional cost of that excess and take over and maintain as a public service that which the private developer laid down.  That should allay the Senator's fears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VictorCarton" hpid="Mr. Carton Mr. Carton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One suggestion I should like to lay low is the suggestion that the elected members of local authorities and planning bodies will be overshadowed by their technical advisers and experts and really will not count. I disagree with that suggestion entirely. No matter how eminent advisers may be, I should hate to see the day arriving when elected representatives would be overshadowed to the degree suggested.  I advise those who feel that way to have a change of heart and ensure that no advisers will be allowed to supersede the powers vested in local <Col N="1763" /> bodies.  They represent the people. They have the powers.  Their voice is the voice of the people.  It would be a bad thing if experts and advisers became dictators.  If elected representatives allowed themselves to be pushed to that point, I should no longer regard them as representative because they would have lost not alone their own convictions but their powers.  I do not believe that will be the evolution.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have a great deal to offer from the point of view of town and regional planning.  I have tried, and shall continue to try, with all the devices at my disposal, to make our local elected representatives aware of the role they can play.  They are representative of the various strata in our society and of the various groupings of our people.  They have a far better collective knowledge of what is good for and proper in their localities than would the stranger with his purely technical approach.</P>
      <P>The local elected representatives will determine finally what the plan is to be.  They will agree to the broad general pattern for their particular areas.  The general day-to-day administrative detail and decisions on applications for permission will be dealt with, I think rightly, by the executive in the person of the county manager.  If there are aggrieved parties as a result of those decisions, those decisions may be appealed to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Therefore, in the first instance, there is the broad backcloth of the plan being agreed to and put together by the local representatives with all the advice they can garner from their advisers.  Then there are the day-to-day decisions on applications which will be matters for the executive, the county manager or somebody deputed by him.  Finally, if there is a dispute the Minister of the day will determine whether or not the appeal is to be upheld or rejected.  Again, he is bound by the Bill we have here to decide the appeals, having regard to the general backcloth that has been predetermined by the local representatives.  He must have regard to planning criteria. That is a safeguard and a very necessary one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1764" /> It can be seen, therefore, that these matters are decided on three levels of local government administration.  We may be wrong in these things&mdash;that may happen&mdash;but we shall be much more often right than wrong and I believe the people will be satisfied in a general way with the manner of administration they will find in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick doubted whether a draft plan was required at all; in other words, whether there had to be a draft plan and if you did not have the draft plan, then the safeguards he read out in Sections 19, 20 and 21 went out the window.  That matter has been fully discussed already and the parliamentary draftsman, on whom we must rely in these matters, is absolutely satisfied that this procedure will require a plan to be drafted for approval by the local authorities. Senator Fitzpatrick shakes his head.  I just shake mine back at him and merely refer to what has been my advice on this matter, not just now but some time previously when we had to go into the matter thoroughly, and I am satisfied that the safeguards in the three sections will in fact be there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

      <P>I am sorry we cannot agree with that because, as I announced on 17th July, it is desirable that we should have this Bill through as quickly as possible.  While we do not want to rush any discussion on Committee Stage, I understood this evening from representatives here that since there is general agreement on the principles of the Bill, they would <Col N="1766" /> like to finish it.

      <P>As I understand it, Senator Dooge's position is that in order to deal with this Bill adequately or fully it would be necessary to have a long interval before the next Stage. There was an adjournment in the Dáil from 6th February to 23rd April and I think Senator Dooge is of the opinion that it would be futile to attempt to tackle the Committee Stage of this Bill tomorrow or next week. He feels that it is necessary to have an adjournment to, say, 2nd of October in order to deal with the Bill and do justice to it.  He feels that if the Minister and the Leader of the House cannot accept that proposition, then it is immaterial to him, or to us, when the Committee Stage is taken.</P>

      <P>This section provides for the service of notices required to be served by the Bill or by regulation. Then subsection (6) gives the Minister power to dispense with the service of notices in certain instances. I think the Bill is intended to deal with cases where somebody is missing and it is difficult to serve notice.  In that case, an injustice could be done by the Minister under this subsection.  Instead of this power to dispense with the service of notice, a subsection should have been inserted making it obligatory to serve notice by advertisement in a newspaper.  If there is a subsection in the Bill&mdash;as there probably is&mdash; authorising the service of notice by advertisement in a newspaper, then I say with the greatest respect there is no necessity for subsection (6) and it should be deleted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides for the making of an agreement between one planning authority and another.  The making of an agreement of that sort is a reserved function and I entirely agree with that.  I intended to make that point in my Second Reading speech.  The Bill tends to restore some of their functions to local authorities and that is a good idea and a healthy sign, but the point I really want to make is this.  Section 16, subsection (1) says:</P>
      <P>Two or more planning authorities may make and carry out an agreement for sharing the cost of performing all or any of their functions under this Act and, where an agreement has been made under this subsection, the planning authorities concerned may terminate it at any time if they so agree.</P>
      <P>What is to happen if one planning authority wants to terminate an agreement and the other does not?  Will we have the two of them tied together, one against its will?  I cannot see any provision in the subsection whereby one planning authority which is not satisfied can by serving notice on the other terminate the agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time the agreement was made, the legal advisers would undoubtedly cover what would happen in different eventualities, <Col N="1776" /> among them the very obvious one of disagreement.  Provision for certain steps after so many months or a year would undoubtedly be inserted, if not by one authority's legal adviser, certainly by the other's.  I could not see such an agreement which would not include the line to be followed in the event of a collapse on one side.  What would happen if one became dissatisfied after a certain time would be part of the agreement.</P>

If two local authorities enter into an agreement, their officers&mdash;and it is on them that responsibility for carrying out the agreement ultimately falls&mdash;are bound by Section 7 of the 1955 Act to carry out the agreement.  That refers to an agreement between local authorities but this refers to development authorities.  If Section 7 of the 1955 Act does not apply, then it would be impossible to give it effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">

    <P>That presupposes that in the case of adjoining counties one authority do work for the other and they share the cost.  It would mean that the officers of one would help the other.

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Stage, I raised the question whether planning for urban redevelopment would be part of a development plan. The Minister said he was happy to put my mind at rest but my mind is rarely at rest and I wish to raise the matter now in a more specific form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does Section 19, subsection (2) (a) (iii) really mean that no urban redevelopment can be done, no acquisition in connection with urban redevelopment can be done, unless it is shown on the map in the development plan?  This is in connection with the general point I raised earlier. Section 19 refers to objectives.  Would it not be possible for the planning authority to state, for example, that its objective was to prepare a scheme for the urban redevelopment of such and such a central city area?  Would it not be possible for them merely to do <Col N="1778" /> that and leave out of the development plan an absolutely specific mark for every parcel of land and every structure to be compulsorily acquired?  Is the Minister perfectly satisfied that under this Section 74 cannot be operated regarding an acre of land not designated for compulsory purchase under a development plan?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation as we see it is that before the development plan is made, the local authority would be entitled to acquire land for urban renewal.  With regard to acquisitions and developments in relation to urban renewal, after the plan is made and adopted, we believe these would be expected to be shown in the plan.  Whereas before the plan they might acquire for urban renewal, once the plan is made they will be expected to show that in the agreed plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, if they suddenly decided they need another city block for their urban redevelopment, the position would be that they would not have to have a variation of the development plan in order to acquire it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>My point on the Second Stage was that this is such a vital matter it would be better if it were a reserved function.  Under Section 74, I think the indications are that, before the adoption of the development plan, and any variations afterwards, there would be the question <Col N="1779" /> that the manager could proceed without getting this consent, except consent, of course, in regard to expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>By regulation, by instruction and by model proposals after the enactment of this measure to planning authorities we will point out that any such development, as outlined, will require the concurrence of the local elected representative.  It will be only in relation to little bits and pieces, supplementary or complementary to a broader and wider urban renewal project, already included in the plan, that I would express expectation rather than obligation.  While it is possible legally and theoretically, perhaps, to do what is suggested here, it will be brought to notice very specifically that, in fact, that is not what they are to do.  That should cover the point.</P>

      <P>I am a little worried that we may be making the part equal to the whole here.  I have no doubt the ingenuity of the Parliamentary Draftsman may have avoided any trouble, but is there any reason why it should be a development plan &ldquo;shall consist of a written statement&rdquo; without maps and drawings?

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to press the point I made on the Second Stage.  Subsection (1) of Section 21 reads:</P>
      <P>(1) Where a planning authority have prepared a draft of a proposed development plan or of proposed variations of a development plan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>They shall do certain things.  My point is that there is no obligation on a planning authority to prepare a draft of a plan.  Everybody knows it is possible to prepare a plan and put it through without a draft.  Everybody knows that, although it is customary to prepare a draft of a deed, it is not necessary to do so.  One can have the finished article in one act.  There are numbers of sections in Acts of Parliament which lend support to my argument.  A court would hold, I think, that if an Act intended to make it obligatory on a planning authority to prepare a draft before preparing the plan, it would say so.  In Section 33 (9) it is specifically stated:</P>
      <P>Where any such direction as is referred to in subsection (1) of this section is proposed to be given by the Minister, a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the direction shall not be given until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In several Acts of Parliament it is laid down that before the Minister makes regulations he shall prepare a draft thereof and lay them before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It might be inconvenient for an authority to put through a plan without first preparing a draft, but that could be done and it could be done, in my opinion, without <Col N="1781" /> in any way infringing Section 21 of this Bill.  Apparently this was raised before and apparently the Minister has considered it, but, if there is room for doubt, should it not be put right now instead of leaving it there and inviting a decision of the court on it at some future date?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the prerequisites to the adoption or the making of a plan is paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of Section 21 which reads:</P>
      <P>(b) they shall cause notice of the preparation of the draft to be published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in at least one newspaper circulating in their area.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are to have a plan they must go through the paraphernalia one part of which is that they shall cause notice of the publication of the draft to be published.  The local planning authority on whom we are relying will not be seeking loopholes to get out of having to tell the public what they are doing.  I have been assured by the draftsman that it is a prerequisite of a plan coming into operation that all these things must be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I differ from the Minister.  Paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of Section 21 comes into effect only after a plan has been prepared and, unless a planning authority have prepared a plan, they need not do any of the things mentioned.  It may be that it is unlikely this will happen, but it is possible it will happen, and the safeguards outlined in subsection (1) of Section 21 are not really safeguards at all.  There is no doubt that the things that are to be done under (a), (b), (c), and (d) need only be done if the draft is prepared.  If what the Minister says is right, why does the section not say: &ldquo;Before a planning authority prepare a development, they shall prepare a draft thereof&rdquo;<Col N="1782" /> as is done in regard to all the things outlined in Page 16?</P>

      <P>they shall cause notice of the preparation of the draft to be published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in at least one newspaper circulating in their area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision should be made in the section <Col N="1783" /> and in all other relevant sections in the Bill for the insertion of this notice in a local paper.  It is all right to say the local authority will invariably publish the notice in the paper circulating in the locality.  That does not always happen and widely read local papers have complained from time to time that these advertisements are put in the national papers and not in the local papers.  I know they are not precluded from putting it in the local paper but they are not obliged to put it in the local paper.  Even in 1963 there is a great number of people in each county who do not read the daily newspapers but who read the local papers.</P>

However, there are some other places where there would be no local paper and if such a provision were put in the Bill, it would cause confusion.

      <P>This is a tremendously dangerous provision in subsection (2) from the point of view of the developer.  The situation could arise in which the planning authority has given permission to a person to develop a sector of land.  The statutory period during which somebody could object passes and he starts operations on the 32nd day.  He probably will spend £10,000 or £12,000 on the development of that site.  This section gives the planning authority the right to have second thoughts on this business.  The Bill says they must explain why they are having second thoughts and that might be very helpful but in the last line of the subsection, it says, in addition to every other consideration, &ldquo;or any other material consideration&rdquo;.  That is a highly dangerous term, that if any planning authority, or, let us say, the manager, in interpreting the planning authority feels&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 33 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a point which arises on this and on other sections, that is, that an appeal lies to the Minister and not to an independant tribunal or arbitrator. Subsection (1) deals with the enforcement of planning control in relation to the structure which is unauthorised on the commencement of the appointed day and the subsection says that the planning authority, if they decide it is expedient to do so, and subject to subsection (9) of this section, &ldquo;shall, if they are directed by the Minister so to do, serve a notice under this section on the owner and on the occupier of the structure.&rdquo;  Subsection (4) provides that where the enforcement notice is served, any person may at any time before the day specified in that behalf in the notice, appeal to the Minister against the notice.</P>
      <P>There you have a case where the Minister directs a planning authority to do a certain thing which affects the private individual and the only appeal the individual has against the action of the planning authority is to appeal to the very man who in the first instance may have directed that this particular step be taken.  That is unreasonable.  As I said earlier, I cannot see why the Minister has not provided for the appointment of an arbitrator.  The money would be well spent and he would be fully occupied.  A circuit court judge, or somebody of a similar standing, could be appointed to deal with these appeals.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister has a point when he says that if you have 30 or 40 judges all over the country dealing with these appeals you may have different interpretations of the same sections and you will not have uniformity in planning throughout the State.  However, I think that if somebody of the standing of a circuit court judge or some other professional arbitrator were appointed and who would himself be fully conversant with the provisions of this Bill when enacted, he would be in a position to give decisions which would be favourable to everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1789" /> A right of appeal to the Minister in a matter of this sort is not acceptable to the people of the country.  They are not satisfied that they get an impartial hearing.  I do not mean to suggest they get a biased hearing or that the Minister would act from any ulterior motives but the people concerned simply have their cases tried by correspondence, at worst, or by an individual who is an inspector and who comes down from Dublin, at best. They do not get a decision there and then.  The inspector goes back to Dublin.  He reports to the Minister.  It may be months afterwards before they get a reply from the Minister, in the form of a letter, saying that such and such has been decided.  That never gives satisfaction and it could not be expected to do so.  There is the position that you have a person appealing to the Minister against a decision taken on the direction of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with what Senator Fitzpatrick has said but his statement about a judge who would be able to give a decision pleasing to everybody seems a little over-optimistic.  Even Solomon could not do that.  I would have more sympathy with Senator Fitzpatrick if it were not for subsection (9) which appears to provide the greatest possible safeguard against misuse of any Ministerial power.  It is not just a question of an order having to be made and coming into force after a certain number of days.  In this case, a specific resolution must be passed by both Houses.  I cannot imagine anything more designed to produce the white light of publicity and to ensure that no executive action would be taken to infringe on what it is proper to be done. It is a tremendous safeguard and much better than merely providing for appeal to some judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some sympathy with the idea that one judge should deal with all the types of things that appear in this Bill but I think he would be fairly overloaded with work and would not have much time to practise as a judge.  In regard to this section, however, I doubt if he would ever have very much to <Col N="1790" /> do.  I am not referring to the present Minister now but Minister for Local Government in general would hardly envisage I think, a great many executive actions under this section where each one has to be passed by a resolution of both Houses.  I should not imagine this would be anything except a very occasional provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I was fully conscious at all times of subsection (9): I referred to it.  I merely raise this point on this section.  I am making the case for the appointment of an arbitrator to deal with appeals in general and I am availing of this section to do it.</P>
      <P>I want to make the point that you can have the case here where the Minister directs a planning authority to do something.  If he does so, we may assume that the planning authority in their wisdom thought it should not be done.  It was necessary for the Minister to come down on them and to say: &ldquo;Serve this notice: I think you should serve it.&rdquo;  If the Minister comes into the Houses of the Oireachtas, on a local point like that, with a resolution, it is very likely that he will get it passed.  However, we have not got subsection (9) in all the other sections of this Bill which deals with appeals.</P>
      <P>I made it clear in my opening statement that I was making my case for the appointment of an arbitrator to deal with appeals in general throughout the Bill when enacted and that I was using this section to do it.  I take it that Senator Sheldon would, in the absence of subsection (9), agree with me.  If he goes through the further sections of this Bill, he will find a great number of cases where the only appeal a ratepayer or property-owner has is an appeal to the Minister without the protection of subsection (9).</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides for the creation of public rights of way.  I entirely agree with what the Minister says that these rights of way could be created where they are absolutely necessary or reasonably necessary: I will go even that far. However, they should not be created lightly.  The only provision in Section 48 against the creation of a public right of way is an appeal to the Minister, as far as I can see.  I know there is also provision for payment of compensation in, I think, Section 63.  It would appear that I am wrong in that and, if so, I shall hear what the Minister has to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the deterrents and one of the matters which will ensure that the town planning authority will be very honest and scrupulous in their approach is that they would have a duty to maintain this right of way and that would mean spending money on it if, in fact, they created it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is quite possible they would act high-handedly and the owner of property should be afforded some protection other than what is afforded in this section by appeal to the Minister.  A right of way <Col N="1793" /> might be necessary to a lake or some other amenity but there might be several sites for the right of way and the owner might say: &ldquo;I will offer you a right of way which will not cause me injury.&rdquo;  A high and mighty local authority might say: &ldquo;We want that particular one and we shall insist on having it.&rdquo;  What puzzles me is that this subsection, which provides for the creation of a new right of way, gives only the right of appeal to the Minister while Section 21 which deals, not with the creation of a right of way but confirmation of an existing public right of way provides for an appeal to the circuit court.  The Minister thinks it is of sufficient importance to give an appeal to the circuit court in Section 21 (i) (d) which includes the case of the preservation of a public right of way. In that case, a notice must be served on all concerned and the person on whose land that public right of way is to be confirmed&mdash;it is only confirmed; it is not the creation of a new right of way; it seems to be a right of way about which there is some doubt&mdash;is given the right to appeal to the circuit court.  That is very satisfactory.  But where the planning authority or the Minister, under Section 48, create a brand new right of way no such appeal is given.  What is the cause for the differentiation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the appeal to the Minister is concerned and protection from the high-handed council, the first great deterrent is that it would cost the council money and I do not think that in our time we shall see local authorities spending money where they might save it, by putting the right of way where the owner did not want it.  That might be a good case for putting it there, but not merely doing it for the sake of annoying the person who owned the land.</P>
      <P>The creation of a new right of way is being dealt with in the same way as the acquisition of land.  A compulsory purchase order for the purchase of land for certain purposes such as housing is dealt with in the same way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a way of giving way.  I would not have much faith in what the Minister apparently considers a deterrent, that is the expenditure the local authority would be called on to bear in maintaining the right of way.  In the case of such public rights of way as do exist, I am not aware that the local authority spend money on them: certainly a great many have no money spent on them. I think the planning authority might insist for their own convenience in going a particular way which might be a great inconvenience for the land owner.  The Minister's view is that it would be a good reason, if they would save money.  I would not be prepared to accept that.  A right of way can be a great nuisance.  It is not a matter of what is trampled on but all sorts of side nuisances arise.  Fences get broken because somebody is in too much of a hurry to open a gate.  Rights of way create more trouble, practically, than anything else.  I think Senator Fitzpatrick is right and that there should be a better right of appeal in this case.</P>

I think Senator Sheldon has taken me up incorrectly in my reply to Senator Fitzpatrick.  When the latter made the point that a local authority might act high-handedly and at the same time save themselves money by going the most inconvenient but the shortest way through a man's property I said that might be a very good reason why they would so so.  I did not mean it would be a good reason for upholding the council on appeal.  If, on appeal, it was shown that it was unreasonable to interfere in this way with a man's property, that it would upset him or cause him <Col N="1795" /> undue hardship and if he came along and said that the council could go another way to which he would be quite agreeable, even if it were three times as long and as costly I think it would be a most unreasonable council that would propose to do this and it would be a more unreasonable Minister who would condone their proposal to spoil a man's land and break it up unreasonably while he was ready to offer an alternative site.</P>

      <P>Section 48 says:</P>
      <P>Where it appears to the planning authority that there is need for a public right of way...</P>
      <P>That is a very strong word, &ldquo;need&rdquo;. I have heard of so many people especially cranks, who, if they can avoid allowing scenic walks through their land, or access to the seashore, will do it unless the right of way can be proved by prescription or otherwise. This presupposes it cannot be proved by prescription.  Does the Minister consider &ldquo;need&rdquo; is too strong?  &ldquo;Need&rdquo; means that it is necessary but necessary for what? Necessary for a scenic walk?  Yes. Necessary to get to the seashore?  Yes. But it is &ldquo;need&rdquo; unqualified.  Does the Minister think the word is too strong?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that I would read it from the beginning: &ldquo;Where it appears there is a need...&rdquo; That is not quite as strong as if we take the word &ldquo;need&rdquo; in isolation, as was put to me just now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>What that means is that the planning authority have considered it.  They have come to a conclusion. It appears to them that there is a need.  &ldquo;Need&rdquo; is a very strong word and it might possibly negative the whole section.  That is what is bothering me.  This is one of the most important sections of the Bill&mdash;I cannot say it is the most important, but it is a very important section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is to avoid any necessity for interfering with a person's private property and the fear has been <Col N="1796" /> expressed that that might arise.  That is the idea of obliging a local planning authority to be convinced, to be persuaded, that there is a need, and that is fair enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be fair enough if they are to be persuaded that there is to be a need, but need for what purpose? You have to prove need in the abstract, prove that it is necessary that they get this.  In many cases despite inconvenience, a local authority cannot do certain things.  They must do something costing £500 where they could do it simply by entering on a man's land. If they take a hump off the road, for instance, they cannot dump the rubble on a man's land.  Do they need the land for amenities, a scenic walk or a visit to the seashore?  However, I was just pointing this out but if the Minister and his officials are satisfied, I am happy. I think, however, there is a grave risk.</P>

      <P>In respect of the refusal of permission for any development that consists of or includes the making of any material change in the use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can appreciate that where the development consists entirely of a material change in use, compensation should not be paid.  Indeed, that is largely in line with what the existing code provides, but it is provided here where a proposal includes making any material change.  It is possible that this change of use might be a small portion of the total proposal but it appears from my first reading of the section that the prohibition is absolute and that no <Col N="1797" /> proportional payment of compensation can be made.  One way out of it would be&mdash;I do not know if it would be possible under the Bill&mdash;that two separate applications could be made for development.  Where the development consisted of an addition to a structure, plus a change of use, could it be the subject of two applications, one of which was excluded for compensation by the section and the other possibly included?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 63, subsection (2) says:</P>
      <P>A claim under this section shall be made within (but not after)&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) six months after the time when the order creating the public right of way commences to have effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this is a right of way through a farm <Col N="1798" /> to a beach or river and the order is made, say, in September, I submit that more than six months would have elapsed between then and the following summer so that the amount of inconvenience or of compensation based on the inconvenience caused by the public would not be known for at least a year.  To protect the rights of the individual farmer, the period should be at least 18 months so as to give the new situation time to be fully tested. Would the Minister be kind enough to have a look at that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, discretion is given to the circuit court to allow a longer period than six months with that very possibility in mind, where six months would not be sufficiently long to show what the real damage was and where compensation based on the six months as laid down in the first part would not be real compensation because it would not be known what the compensation should be.  Therefore the circuit court is empowered to extend the time within which such a claim can be made, if it thinks fit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all; that has nothing to do with it.  The Senator, with the happy knack he has, makes it appear that this is one and the same thing.  The circuit court is not dealing with planning policy.  It is deciding only whether or not the time which should be allowed an appellant should be extended in order better to make his case. No planning policy is concerned so it is quite easy.</P>

      <P>The public do not always appreciate a right of way.  In a place where they get access to a river, they may leave gates open and give cattle access to crops so that considerable damage is done.  When the farmer gives the right of way, he has not time to try out the arrangement. He will not know until after the first summer season whether the public are causing damage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>He would not know for 20 years if somebody unreasonable came along then and caused damage and you would not expect an extension for 21 years.  One is as sensible as the other although that is an extreme case. When a right of way is created or is allowed to develop without any rights under the Bill at all, you may find trouble and damage years later which you could not possibly foresee, damage caused by virtue of your approach to the matter many years before.  Had he known that would be the situation, he probably never would have allowed a right of way to develop, but we cannot just wait around to see if people will change in their attitude or the users of the right of way become a menace.  We cannot just wait for that development.  If there is any point in this suggestion that he may be satisfied within the six months but grow dissatisfied within 12 months, then he should give notice to the court that he may suffer a change of mind in 12 months, and let the court decide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wondering rather about the machinery of it. Does the Minister envisage that anyone making, or proposing to make, a claim will have to decide on the damage?  Does the Minister think six months will be a long enough period in which to determine the damage or should the person concerned immediately make some sort of claim to the court?  I am not a lawyer, but what will happen is that anyone who is the owner of land over which a right of way is sought will probably claim to the circuit court. This could lead to the circuit court being overloaded because of the shortness of the period.  I think a full year is a reasonable period in which to expect anyone could reasonably know what his claim would be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would also be to the advantage of people to go before the six months are up.  If they go during that period, they are likely to have more effect, whereas, if they allowed the situation to go on developing, they would probably get next to nothing.</P>

That would be very desirable. It is the practice in Britain that there is complete separation of staff between those who act as planning advisers to the Minister and, on the Ministerial inspectors for the purpose ties and the housing and planning inspectors.  From the point of view of public relations, I urge on the Minister that as soon as the staff is large enough to divide, that division should be made. <Col N="1804" /> said something.
