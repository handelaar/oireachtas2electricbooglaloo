      <P>Since our last meeting, Senators will have learned with deep regret of the unexpected death of Senator John D. Sheridan. His sudden passing came as a shock to those of us who saw him in the House two days earlier when he appeared to be in his usual good health.  I bhFlaitheas Dé go raibh a anam.</P>
      <P>The late Senator was first elected in 1954 from the Nominating Bodies Sub-Panel of the Agricultural Panel and continued to be a member of the House to the time of his death.  He was a man of outstanding personality and firm convictions which, when occasion demanded, he had no hesitation in expressing.  His courteous and humorous disposition endeared him to all those who had the privilege of knowing him.  His passing will be sadly felt by all sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sheridan's interests were chiefly agricultural.  His main concern, however, was the cattle industry whose interests he represented in this House. Being a noted pedigree breeder and judge and also a prominent exporter of cattle, his contributions to debates relating to the industry were always listened to with respect.  During his long connection with the cattle trade he helped to a great degree in bringing the name of Irish cattle to the forefront. Appreciation of his great work, knowledge and experience is shown by the fact that he was made President of the British Cattle Traders' Association and also Chairman of the Irish Livestock Exporters' and Cattle Traders' Association.  He was also Vice-President of the Pedigree Cattle Breeders' <Col N="800" /> Society of Ireland and was a prominent exhibitor at shows all over the country.</P>
    <P>To the relatives of the late Senator, I shall convey on your behalf and on my own our sympathy and appreciation.</P>

      <P>This is a minor drafting amendment, which follows the proposed amendment of Section 2.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 1, as amended, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3) to add the following paragraphs:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  Where&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  the council of a county have considered a report submitted under subsection (2) of <Col N="801" /> this section and have decided not to make a declaration under this subsection, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the proposals are for coast protection works wholly within an urban district,</P>
    <P>the council shall send the report to the council of the urban district.</P>
    <P>(c)  Where a report is sent under paragraph (b) of this subsection to the council of an urban district, the council, if satisfied that land within the urban district is being progressively damaged by the continuing encroachment of the sea, as distinct from occasional or abnormal storms, and that the encroachment is liable to endanger the safety of a harbour, the buildings or amenities of a residential area or other valuable property, may, with the consent of the Minister for Local Government and subject to the council of a county having undertaken to make such contribution to the balance referred to in paragraph (b) of section 16 of this Act as that Minister has approved of, declare that the promotion of a coast protection scheme is expedient and that the Commissioners should be asked to carry out a preliminary examination.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The section as passed by Dáil Éireann enables a county council or the corporation of a county borough to investigate and to have a report prepared on any proposals for coast protection works.  If they are satisfied that land within their area is being progressively damaged by the continuing encroachment of the sea as distinct from an occasional storm and that valuable property is being threatened, they can declare that the promotion of a coast protection scheme is expedient, and ask the Commissioners of Public Works to carry out a preliminary examination.  Where the encroachment affects land in two or more counties, a single report will be prepared and one council will be named as the promoting authority. <Col N="802" /> The necessary powers for entry on lands, <i>et cetera,</i> are provided for the purposes of the preparation of a report. The consideration of a report and the making of a declaration shall be reserved functions.</P>
      <P>It would be impracticable for the Commissioners to deal initially with all applications for coast protection work from private persons, commercial concerns or others.  The onus of initiating action for protection schemes is, therefore, placed on local authorities who, with their local knowledge, should be in a position to assess the merits of applications.  They would be expected to reject applications that are unworthy of serious consideration.</P>
      <P>In the course of the debates in the Dáil Deputies were concerned that a county council might be unwilling to promote a coast protection scheme for lands within an urban district.  We hope that there will be co-operation between local authorities in the promotion of schemes but if the circumstances envisaged by the Deputies should arise, it would be reasonable that the urban district council should have some authority to initiate action. The amendment, therefore, provides that, if a county council decide not to promote a scheme for the benefit of lands wholly within an urban district, the urban district council may, with the consent of the Minister for Local Government and subject to an undertaking by the county council to make a contribution which the Minister approves, declare that the promotion of a protection scheme is expedient and ask the Commissioners to carry out a preliminary examination.  It is felt that even though a county council may be unwilling to promote a scheme for an urban area, they should make some contribution towards the cost of the works.  I recommend the amendment to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like some clarification on the position as changed by this amendment and the reason why the amendment is being brought in this particular form.  As I understand it, the position under the Bill as it was was that the county council were the promoting authority but the urban <Col N="803" /> authority within the area could, where appropriate, agree to contribute under Section 17.  The position now is that in default of action by a county council, the urban authority within whose area the problem of the danger to the land lies, can promote a scheme and the county council may then agree to contribute.</P>
      <P>Now, there are two points I think here which I should like to bring forward.  The first one is that the amendment, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, is brought forward to meet the case where a county council refuse to act in a case of coast erosion within an urban district.  He then went on to say that, of course, the county council could still contribute. But, is it likely that a county council, having refused initially to act, even when the urban authority had been prepared to contribute part of the cost, would now be willing to contribute in return part of the cost when the urban authority promote it?  Was the alternative considered whereby in the event of an urban authority being prepared to guarantee a high percentage of the cost, something like 80 per cent. or over, that it would then become mandatory on the county council to proceed?  It seems to me that there is some merit in this alternative procedure and I think the merit is this, that while the area of damage due to coast erosion may be highly localised, the whole phenomenon of coast erosion is very far from localised and that the conditions which are producing damage at one concentrated point may be arising quite some distance away.  I think in phenomena of this sort, where the cause of what has occurred occurs over a wide area, that it would be preferable in general that it would be the larger local authority which should be considered in the initiating of the scheme, the survey and the report of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one separate and final point I should like to mention on this. The amendment provides for the position that where the county council decide not to proceed under Section 2, the urban authority can then come in.  What is the position when the county council decide not to proceed <Col N="804" /> at Section 5 stage?  Is the position then that the urban authority will have to go right back to the beginning or would it not be preferable that there should be a similar provision in Section 5 that the urban authority can take up the running at this particular point?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>My mind is running on very much the same lines as Senator Dooge.  What I want to know is this.  What precise difference does this amendment make?  I understand it is to meet the occasion where a county council veto a project, probably because of the cost.  What precise difference does it make?  It appears to be precisely the same veto as they have to agree in paragraph (c) to make a contribution.  If it were for financial reasons that the original decision not to proceed on it was taken and the urban council now act under the amendment, the county council appear still to have the same veto exactly by saying: &ldquo;We shall not contribute&rdquo;, so I do not know what material difference the amendment makes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was inclined to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that it might be wise to reconsider the position in this way.  The urban council act under certain eventualities and it might be quite practicable in certain cases for the urban authority to carry the liability for the maintenance which would be required of the county authority if they acted.  In that case, it should certainly be included if, as Professor Dooge says, the origin of the trouble lies probably in part of the county area.  Then if the urban authority were carrying a substantial part of the maintenance liability, I think there should be an obligation on the county to chime in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall answer as best I can Senator Dooge's query with regard to the reason for this amendment.  In the first place it was felt by members in the Dáil, on both sides, that relations between an urban district council and the county council proper might be strained and it was also the opinion of the Deputies in <Col N="805" /> question that were the power given to the urban council to initiate a scheme and if in due course an independent comprehensive report were received by them it might be a means of encouraging the county council as a whole. They might appreciate, as Senator Dooge pointed out, that the proposed measure might not only appear to benefit the urban district council but, in fact, could benefit a great part of the county at large.</P>
      <P>I do not anticipate that there will be many requests under this section. It is most unlikely that relations would be so strained between an urban council and a county council that they would not proceed for the common good.  Then again if the county council have the merits of the case brought home to them or, indeed, if the urban council, the initiators of the scheme, have the demerits brought home to them, either might think twice of proceeding further.  In the case of the urban district council, certain information might come to light which might convince them that the scheme was not worth proceeding with.  I do not think that will arise.  I do not think that there will be any difficulty.  I think that the urban councils in the main and the county authorities will co-operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary in answering the points which were raised suggested that the position under the Bill as amended would have the advantage that the county council would be able to receive a report which they otherwise might not receive.  My reading of the section plus the amendment&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;is that this is not the case at all, that the urban council are powerless to act until the county council have refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, it is only when the county council have refused that the urban district council are then empowered to act.  If the Parliamentary Secretary had brought in an amendment allowing the urban council themselves to act <i>ab initio,</i> without the matter ever having been brought forward <Col N="806" /> on a report of the county council, I think his argument would then be relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Senator will agree with me that the reason for this amendment is sound?  A county council have a proposition from certain members; they throw out that proposition for various reasons; then the urban council have to initiate the measure.  The reason why the county council are allowed to initiate it or otherwise is this.  It would be most unfair to ask a small urban district to borrow, in the first place, the 20 per cent statutory contribution cost from the Local Loans Fund.  It would be ridiculous for us to put in a section whereby the maintenance cost could be levied on a small urban district.  In other words&mdash;let me come straight out and say this&mdash;if a county council throw out the suggestions, if the urban district council then get a report from the Commissioners of Public Works and follow the procedure laid down here, and the county council will say: &ldquo;We will have no truck with the proposal notwithstanding the favourable report&rdquo;, that is the end of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not clear, from the wording of the amendment, that the urban council may not proceed to promote the coast protection scheme unless and until the county council have agreed to make a contribution?</P>
      <P>I do not understand coast protection, but so far as I read this amendment the position is that the county council will have refused to do anything about this particular matter.  The urban council can only proceed to the promotion of a coast protection scheme when they first get the consent of the Minister for Local Government and when, secondly, the council of a county have undertaken to make a contribution. Is that so?  If they, say, refuse the contribution in the first instance, by what process are they to make it in the second?  Nothing will have been done in the interval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is as the Senator says: the county council throw it out.  The urban council put up a scheme, get a favourable report <Col N="807" /> back, and still the county council could&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the urban council put up a scheme without the consent of the county council?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What the urban council can do is this.  They can request a report from the Commissioners of Public Works, if the county council have refused to initiate a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely they cannot ask the Board of Works to make a preliminary examination unless the county council say: &ldquo;We shall&mdash;be it what it may&mdash;contribute ½ per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the county council will contribute portion of the cost of the report. Certain facts would, of course, arise from this report, as Senator Dooge has pointed out, which would show, for instance, that a scheme which would benefit small areas of the urban district could be of benefit to the county at large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite understand this.  As I see it the veto of the county council still applies at precisely the same point in relation to what is to happen because the end of paragraph (c) of the amendment makes it clear that you cannot ask the Commissioners to carry out a preliminary examination unless the county council have already agreed.  If the county council are adamant in the first case, what new situation has arisen which one can hope will make them change their mind?  I cannot see anything new developing in the situation, except that the urban council may decide to proceed, and hope, therefore, to embarrass the county council into doing something, but county councils are not as easily embarrassed as all that.</P>

      <P>The Dáil.  Evidently, in placating them, I am confusing the issue further here today.  This is an extreme case.  I do not think it will ever arise.  In fact, the position is a bit ridiculous, if you like, in which a county council, having refused to initiate a scheme, have to sanction a contribution towards the cost of obtaining a report for the urban council.  If they are to be consistent and throw it out, they may also say that they will not contribute.  As against that I can envisage a deputation from the urban council going to the county council and saying: &ldquo;Gentlemen, you have turned down this scheme.  Would you contribute something&mdash;it will not be very much&mdash; so that we can come back to you with an impartial report from the Office of Public Works, and then would you reconsider the matter?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 2, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I want to raise on the section and I shall raise them separately to facilitate discussion.  The first refers to the inclusion in the last line on page 2&mdash;that is in subsection (2) (a) of Section 2&mdash;of the words, &ldquo;on the nature and probable causes of the relevant encroachment of the sea&rdquo;. This subsection asks that in the very first report made to the county council or the urban district council&mdash;the promoting authority&mdash;by its engineers, they should report on the nature and probable causes of whatever encroachment is taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> I take it that the intention here is that the report which is made to the county council should carefully distinguish between loss of land which is due to coast erosion and progressive encroachment, and that which is due to storm damage.  I think the wording in this subsection is most unfortunate because it is very unfair to ask anyone at the preliminary stage of work such as this to produce a professional report on the nature and probable causes of all the phenomena with which engineers have to deal.  The problem of coast erosion is most complex.  I think it is unfair to ask the engineers to report on what is the nature of what is going on in a particular stretch of coast or the probable causes of the damage.</P>
    <P>Even with the distinction between storm damage and erosion damage I do not think this is the best wording. The nature and the probable causes of any encroachment on land cannot be stated by the county engineers.  The experts of the Office of Public Works are not asked in any subsequent section to say anything about the nature and probable causes and, indeed, I might comment that at no time so far in the discussions on this Bill, has the Parliamentary Secretary, with the expert advice available to him, been able to clarify for us the precise distinction between coast erosion and other types of coast damage.  It might be much better if, instead of using the words, &ldquo;the nature and probable causes&rdquo;, we used the words which are used later in the Bill, and refer to continuing and progressive encroachment.  If this Bill ever came into the courts for determining of the precise meaning of those words, they might give rise to a great deal of difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I do not fully appreciate the point made by the Senator.  Surely the word &ldquo;probable&rdquo; in the subsection is a type of let-out clause for a consulting engineer. Surely the Senator will agree that it would not be reasonable to expect a preliminary report to be fully comprehensive. At the end of subsection (2) (a) we mention works &ldquo;which may <Col N="810" /> be practicable and desirable to prevent the continuance of the encroachment and the estimated cost of the works&rdquo;. It would be difficult to differentiate in a report between actual erosion and what might happen in a storm due to an act of God.  I think commonsense will prevail in these instances.  If the Senator presses the matter, and if I am within the rules of the House, I am certainly prepared to consider an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>There is a further point on Section 2, and, again, I think that the Parliamentary Secretary and I are in substantial agreement on what we would wish to see done under the section&mdash;that it should be in the nature of a preliminary report and that no undue amount of time should be spent on it.</P>

      <P>To get away from the word, we have an obligation here in this report to give an estimate of the type of work and the probable cost.  While it is always desirable to have some indication of the work proposed to be done and the estimated cost, I wonder is it realistic to ask for these at this very early preliminary stage.  I take it that the main purpose of looking for this preliminary report is to relieve pressure on the Office of Public Works and to ensure that requests for examination of possible coast erosion schemes do not come to the Office of Public Works merely by simple resolution of a local authority. If you ask that the report should indicate the work to be done and the estimated cost, it would be very difficult for the county engineer who would have to prepare such a report to make it without having some informal conference with the engineers in the Office <Col N="812" /> of Public Works who have been dealing with this job.  Therefore, I think that there should not be in the Bill an onus on the local authority to produce something which they may not have the skill or experience to produce at this early stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to give the Seanad what I think the approach of a county engineer to a matter of this kind would be.  In the first place, he might consider whether it would be better to substitute the word &ldquo;extent&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;nature&rdquo;, to give the extent of the probable cost. Otherwise you might relate the word &ldquo;nature&rdquo; to the further description of the encroachment or damage liable to be done, that is, whether it would be in the nature of damage to buildings, harbour or amenities.  You may simply confine your remarks to whether the damage was damage likely to occur to a harbour or to any other type of those buildings or structures set out later on in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the question of providing a preliminary estimate would be unreasonable, for this reason, that before the county council or any other council involved would consider a matter of this kind they would want to have a very rough idea as to whether the work came within their scope at all or not.  In other words, if I were asked to prepare a report on something like this I would go out, examine the job, and report back that a particular building, harbour or other work in which the council were interested or another work of value was being damaged or liable to be damaged as a result of the action of the sea encroachment and erosion.  I would give an account of the item likely to be damaged and just a rough estimate of the cost.  It might be a matter of whether it could be corrected in my opinion by putting in groynes, in which case it would be something in the order of hundreds of pounds, or whether it would be necessary to put up a retaining wall, when it would be in the order of thousands of pounds.  I would say to the county council that I had examined the place, that buildings, or harbours or something <Col N="813" /> else in which they were interested were being damaged or endangered and give my opinion as to whether it would cost one, two, three, four or five thousand pounds.  That would give the council immediately an idea as to whether they should proceed further with the investigation of this scheme. That is all that is intended in this section.  I do not think that there is anything forbidding in the section but I suggest that the word &ldquo;extent&rdquo; should be substituted for the word &ldquo;nature&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that the reason we have decided to put the responsibility of obtaining a report on the local authority is this &mdash;that the members of local authorities in the main are men with commonsense. Not only do they possess commonsense but they also have what the Commissioners of Public Works and their staff do not have, and that is local knowledge.  It is very easy for a county manager, a county engineer and the elected representatives&mdash; for this is a reserved function&mdash;to decide whether damage to a harbour or to cliffs or to local amenities generally is storm damage or an act of God as opposed to continuous encroachment by the sea.  That is why, in fact, we in the Office of Public Works would deem it a tremendous benefit to have this initial report locally.  Perhaps I could repeat what I mentioned in the Dáil on this.  I pointed out that the representations received to date by the Department of Local Government and the Office of Public Works all referred to storm damage, and I reminded the Deputies that the provisions of Section 2 enabled a county council to investigate and have a report prepared on any proposals for coast protection work.  I mentioned that it was a good thing to determine the scope of the bill for the work that would be required by coast erosion, and also that we had devoted a good deal of thought to this and that we came to the conclusion that we could not improve on what was in the text already of subsection (3) of Section 2 which enables the county council to initate a scheme.  I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;if satisfied that land within the <Col N="814" /> county is being progressively damaged by the continuing encroachment of the sea as distinct from occasional or abnormal storms, and that the encroachment is liable to endanger the safety of harbours, buildings, amenities in a residential area or other valuable property&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I trust this covers the points raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one further point I should like clarification on.  Again I am in some difficulty as to the precise meaning of the words the Parliamentary Secretary has just quoted and that is that the encroachment is not to be encroachment which is due to an occasional storm or abnormal storm.  These things I think are important because if the matters laid down in Section 2 are not met, the Office of Public Works will reject the scheme under Section 4. This would be one of the reasons they would have for rejecting the scheme.</P>
      <P>I think we are in difficulty here in regard to the separation of &ldquo;continuing encroachment&rdquo; and &ldquo;storm damage&rdquo; and the use of the phrase &ldquo;abnormal storms&rdquo;.  Does the use of the word &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo; indicate that some storm damage would be allowed for and that loss of land or damage to property arising from normal storms could be allowed for as part of the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this point.  The fact is that a good deal of the erosion is the result of a succession of occasional storms. I live in an area where we more or less overlook a district where erosion is going on, the Killiney area.  I live in Dalkey overlooking it.  The erosion there is the result of a series of occasional or abnormal storms.  I do think Senator Dooge is quite right that, perhaps, we should have closer definition of where the line lies between present erosion and those occasional abnormal storms because the two are not completely distinct. They are not distinct in the section as drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are not distinct I would be prepared to consider on Report Stage clarifying amendments. <Col N="815" /> On the points raised by the Senators, a succession of occasional storms, continuing occasional storms, could, of course, be considered as coast erosion.  That is so.  As a result of one appalling storm a position could be created in a county whereby the county engineer or the consultant employed by the council could state categorically that that storm gave rise to a situation whereby if certain measures were not adopted as soon as possible a serious costly problem of coastal erosion would ensue.  It would be common sense to consider that as a case of unqualified coastal erosion.  In other words, there does not have to be, as Senator Stanford remarked on his experience in Killiney, a succession of continuous isolated storms.  One storm alone would be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take the opportunity under this section to refer briefly to another point mentioned by Senator Dooge.  We agreed that it would be difficult for a county engineer to assess the cost&mdash;let us suppose that a county council decided that such and such an area merited a report from the county engineer&mdash;in reporting back.  If it is difficult for a county engineer to assess the cost, surely the ordinary laymen on the county council are entitled to ask a professional man to give a reasonable shot at what the cost would be?  Then, again, how can they be expected to make up their mind to commit their local authority to quite a substantial contribution, bearing in mind that the local authority, the initiating body, put up 20 per cent of the capital cost of the scheme?  It is not all levied on the rates in one year.  It is borrowed from the Local Loans Fund and the repayment charges might not be considered high.  I can speak myself from personal experience in the south.  There are some schemes which could run into hundreds of thousands of pounds and the 20 per cent loan charge repayment on these schemes and the subsequent maintenance charges could be very serious impositions on a local authority.  The elected members are entitled, in my opinion, to get some indication of cost.  On a big scheme involving <Col N="816" /> three or four hundred thousand pounds, you are not going to fall out with your county engineer if he is out £50,000 in his estimate.  Again, he may well advise the county manager and the elected representatives that the job in question is beyond his scope and one for a specialist and a consultant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say that there will not be a prohibition on schemes in which there is an element of storm damage.  I think that is all Senator Stanford and I were seeking clarification on.  It is quite true that one big storm might create conditions in which there would be subsequent erosion.  Similarly, you could get a condition also whereby there could be a weakening due to coastal action which would then result, when a storm came, in damage which would be very much more severe owing to the previous weakening due to coastal action.  In both these cases things are not automatically to be considered on their merits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>All I am concerned with here is the question of the scope of the preliminary examination. In the preparation of works at this time we are required to draw the borderline between the preliminary examination and the preparation of the scheme from a technical point of view.  It is necessary to draw this line in the drawing up of coast protection schemes under this particular Bill, because a complicated process is involved.  Is there any intention to limit the extent of the preliminary examination in regard to its scope, the time spent on it and the money spent on it?  Might I take the analogy from work that might be done by a consulting engineer or architect?  He is asked to prepare a scheme.  He prepares <Col N="817" /> it and the report and the cost of that is limited due to the fact that he gets a fixed percentage for this work&mdash; something in the region of 1½ per cent. I think it is only fair to the promoting authority that there should be some limitation on the amount of work the Board of Works do because the promoting authority have already agreed to bear half the cost.  In practice there should be, in effect, a limitation of the cost of preliminary examination to something like 3 per cent of the estimated cost of the whole scheme.  Unless there was a guiding rule of this nature some of the promoting authorities could easily be let in for quite a substantial charge if the preliminary examination were carried on too far.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Senator that is most unlikely.  We suffer from a lack of engineers.  I hope the Schools of Engineering will turn out more graduates but it is unlikely that we will allow any of our technical staff to go into any costly detail at the preliminary stage.  The intention of the preliminary examination is to eliminate, at an early stage, all feckless cases which would have no prospect of being dealt with at a reasonable cost, and which are not, in fact, true cases of coast erosion at all, and to report accordingly to the local authority.  Our technical advisers and the councils are reasonable men and they all appreciate that 50 per cent of the cost of the preliminary examination will have to be met by the promoting authority.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooge will agree that a well-qualified consultant would not have the slightest difficulty, when he casts his eye over a specific problem, in reporting to the county engineer whether or not a scheme was worthy of detailed investigation.</P>

      <P>There is one point I should like clarification on in regard to subsection (2).  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give us some idea of what would be the reasons for which the Office of Public Works would reject a scheme.  One which comes to mind straight away is a case where the cost is completely exorbitant and the Office of Public Works do not consider that the Central Fund should be asked to promote such a scheme, and the second is where it is not a true case of coast erosion.  Are those the only two grounds?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>That would be more or less the interpretation of the section. Let us take an exaggerated example.  Suppose a man had two acres of land and only those two acres would benefit from a scheme costing, say, £1/4 million.  We could put up magnificent embankments and protective cliffs.  It would obviously be completely uneconomic.  It would never be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance. The interpretation of the Senator is the correct one.</P>

If a promoting authority who are a county council withdraw at the Section 5 stage in regard to a scheme which lies within an urban authority what would be the position of the urban authority?

      <P>Might I clarify the matter?  Under Section 2 where a county council refuse to proceed the urban authority can make themselves the promoting authority.  Under Section 5 on receipt of the report from the Board of Works a county council could decide not to proceed.  If at that stage the scheme were referred to an urban authority and the county council were unwilling to proceed but the urban authority wished to proceed and were willing to bear the cost, what would be the procedure?</P>

The Board of Works say it is worthwhile and then the urban district council say: &ldquo;We would like to go ahead on it.&rdquo; Remember they cannot imperil themselves financially without the consent of the Minister for Local Government so there is a safeguard in their financial impetuosity in this particular direction.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If, as the Senator says, the report is sound and the urban district council still want to go on, why would the county council refuse?  We have to be logical and assume that a reasonable position will obtain.  Why would the county council, if a report came back to an urban authority, still refuse?  They are neither infallible nor inflammable. Before it has reached the Office of Public Works, possibly under protest or otherwise, the county council have agreed to a contribution to the cost of the report of the examination.  Then, if a favourable report comes back to the urban council and is submitted to the county council, why would they then refuse, if it is a good thing for the people within their area, within their county, or within a section of their county?  Surely, there could be only one reason why the county council would refuse and that would be one of financial consideration.  Therefore, the corollary is: if the county council jibbed at the cost it would be a complete millstone around the neck of the urban council.  That is logic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that that is logical at all.  First of all, the urban council are not going to do it for the fun of the thing.  The fact that the council refuse in the first instance does not necessarily mean that that would be the correct decision.  The Parliamentary Secretary poses a question. There could be several answers as to why the county council refuse.  They might not like the urban council.  They might be keener on getting some of these schemes going in other areas where they would regard them as being more beneficial.  But, what I cannot understand is where the county council are not prepared to come in and where the urban council feel confident and entitled to come in, that they should not be allowed to go in as a promoting authority both for the initial expenses, if necessary, and more particularly for the final stages.  There <Col N="821" /> are very few urban councils that would be likely to take advantage of this scheme under the Bill at all.  I can conceive of certain eventualities arising where it might pay an urban council to seek assistance under the provisions of the Bill, with the county council dissenting.  I am still open to conviction from the Parliamentary Secretary, if he can show me some good reason why the urban council should not be allowed go ahead.  I would then accept that there is a point in controlling the issue at that stage.  At the moment I cannot see any point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not reasonable to anticipate that a county council would feel there was no urgency in this matter?  For financial reasons they had other burdens which took priority. At the same time the urban council might feel that it was a matter of great urgency to them and to their prosperity and, therefore, they were prepared to pay the cost.  I do not think they should be debarred from doing that.  Some way should be allowed to the urban council.  I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that it is an eventuality which we will not meet often.  I belong to a county council.  I could quite visualise it happening in the course of a number of years.</P>

      <P>I could see considerable difficulty about the proposal that urban councils should be allowed to proceed themselves and to pay.  It seems to me, while there are some counties that could, perhaps, afford to do this, the great majority of urban councils could not.  I would be afraid that once all urban councils were given the power to promote and pay for the schemes themselves, then it would be for the county councils to say: &ldquo;All right, you pay for the scheme, it has nothing to do with us.&rdquo; The result would be that in a great many cases you would have a number that could not possibly afford to promote schemes themselves.  Then once they had the power at all they would be told by the county council: &ldquo;You go ahead with the scheme; we will have nothing to do with it.&rdquo;  I <Col N="822" /> think it would be a very dangerous provision.</P>

      <P>In regard to the matter to be shown in the scheme I am concerned with the question of the estimated cost, which is Section E of the things which are to be shown in the scheme.  Has the promoting authority any protection against the final cost being well in excess of the estimate under Section 7?  The position is that, following the receipt of the scheme made under Section 7, the promoting authority must bind themselves to provide 20 per cent of the cost.  After this, the carrying out of the works is a matter for the Office of Public Works.  As I read the Bill, there is no protection against a large excess of final cost over the estimate. I might, perhaps, put forward a point here for consideration, that it might be reasonable that the promoting authority should only have to bind themselves to pay the proper proportion of the estimate plus any agreed variation in works plus an adjustment for the cost of materials and labour during the carrying out of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The State will contribute towards the capital cost up to a sum not exceeding 80 per cent.  If it is 80 per cent the promoting authority will contribute 20 per cent.  For the sake of argument, say the scheme was estimated to cost a quarter of a million pounds and the final cost turned out to be £350,000, an increase of £100,000, does the Senator then suggest that the promoting authority should not have to contribute so much of the extra&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor has the State. An estimate of the cost is worked out. At that stage it will be reasonably accurate and, I presume, quantities will be taken out, though I doubt if they could be taken out on such type of work.  It would be difficult.  Surely, if there is an increase in wages and or materials, then the proportion will still be 80 to 20 per cent.  If the original contract were for £250,000 and the final cost was £350,000, the State will still pay 80 per cent of the final cost.  The local authority will pay 20 cent, borrowed from the Local Loans Fund.  I can assure the House that it will be the anxiety of the Office of Public Works, their engineers or consultants to ensure that the best possible value for money is got.</P>

      <P>In other words, the Office of Public Works will carry out the physical work which, in some other circumstances, might be done by a contractor.  If the work were done by a contractor, there would be a contract price and that contract price would be adjusted for agreed variation in works, in the cost of materials and labour.  What it would not be adjusted for is any mistake of the contractor in the making up of his contract price or any inefficiency which crept into the working of the contractor on the site compared to his anticipated efficiency.  Since the central authority are laying down that this work is to be done by the Office of Public Works it is reasonable that they should carry a major portion of any consequences which arise from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You are asking the local authority to bind themselves to 20 per cent of a particular cost, and they have no control then over the subsequent expenditure of the money, whereas the Central <Col N="824" /> Government have.  The Minister for Finance himself is in charge of the Office which will be actually carrying out this particular work.  I think it is perfectly reasonable, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, that adjustments in costs of materials and labour should be allowed for if, in the course of the work, particularly work of this type, it appears that the work should be varied.  Then if there is an agreement between the local authority and the Office of Public Works that a certain variation would improve the scheme, I believe also the estimate should be adjusted.  Apart from that, I think it is a little unfair that the local authority should have to pledge itself as to 20 per cent of the estimated cost when the estimate is not confirmed by any guarantee.</P>

      <P>I shall point out to the Senator that the bulk of the increase is still being borne by the State and the taxpayer as to 80:20.  I should like to see this work carried out for the most part by contractors.  The fact that the Office of Public Works would carry out the work does not mean that we could not put it up for tender.  We employ consultant engineers, for instance.  The contract would be between whomever it was, the Cementation Company Ltd., for example, and the Office of Public Works.  We would be the people who would do the job, but there is nothing to prevent us from having it done by contract.  I myself would be in favour of such work being done by contract. There will be other work of such a complicated nature that I doubt if any contractor or, indeed, our technical advisers, could give a completely accurate statement to the Minister.  In such instances the most reasonable method would be a type of tied-to-time and material contract and a schedule of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To a certain extent I appreciate the point made by the Senator.  I can assure him that our experience in drainage has been that our estimates have not been exceeded in very many cases.  What would be the Senator's approach if a scheme estimated at £250,000 cost £150,000?  Would he pass the benefit on to the taxpayers if <Col N="825" /> we saved so many thousands of pounds on a job?</P>

I hope, as I have said, that in the main, the work will be done by contract.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been talking up to the present about the people who sanction the work, the people who do the work and the engineers who plan the work.  I think that now we should turn our attention for a moment to the people who may suffer a little under this Bill, that is, the people whose land will be taken over compulsorily.  There is one way in which we can ease the blow for them under this section.  Subsection (4) provides for the serving of notice on a householder by post.  This matter has been raised in the Seanad before and I think it should be raised again. That should be &ldquo;by registered post&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is not quite good enough in a matter of this kind, which may involve the obliteration of someone's ancestral home, or considerable interference with his property, that a post man should simply walk up to the door and drop a letter into the letterbox, and it should be considered sufficient service of notice.  The man may be abroad with his family, and he may not return for a month or two, or perhaps a servant or a child may take the letter and carelessly mislay it. There is no evidence that the letter was delivered.</P>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House, but in a story by de Maupassant, a parish priest in France, who had served faithfully in a certain parish, was waiting for promotion from his Bishop.  Everyone gave him to understand that he would receive promotion in a certain year.  Just about Easter time a robin started to build a nest in his letterbox.  He was a kind-hearted priest and he let the robin build the nest, lay her eggs and hatch out the chickens.  Later he removed the nest and found underneath a letter asking him would he accept promotion, but it was then too late for him to accept it. Perhaps that is irrelevant in a sense, but I do not think it is entirely so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mere casual dropping of a letter in a letterbox by a postman is not good enough in a serious matter of this kind.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, even if it is an innovation in Bills of this kind, to introduce the word &ldquo;registered&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;post&rdquo;.  That is the least we can ask in a section which affects <Col N="827" /> the houses, homes and lands of our citizens.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider accepting on Report Stage an amendment introducing the word &ldquo;registered&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;post&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have no objection to accepting that.  It appears to be reasonable that the notice should be served by registered letter.  The Senator might also consider that instead of saying &ldquo;registered post&rdquo; we might say that a statutory notice should be published in a paper circulated in the area, or in a national paper, or some such clause.</P>
      <P>It just occurs to me that if notice is served by registered letter it is served only on the people who are deemed to be the owners.  There might be, from time to time in rural Ireland, some individual or individuals who might claim to be the owners in question. Suppose there was a case, not of a gentleman going to the south of France with his wife and family, but of a man who went away to Australia and the title to his land was the subject of argument in the courts, to establish rightful ownership.  Supposing that matter was <i>sub judice</i> and the man was in Australia when the letter was delivered by registered post.  He could not possibly make his comments in time.  The important point is that the rightful owners as decided by the court might not know what was happening at all.  I agree to consider the matter on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>While I have sympathy with Senator Stanford's point of view, I think that there is a greater difficulty about registered post.  A registered letter is not delivered unless there is somebody to receive it. Assuming that the owner or occupier is in England or Australia or some place else the registered letter will not be delivered but will be returned.  The same objection holds good in case of the ordinary post.  It may never be received.  I think the suggestion of the Parliamentary Secretary that notice should be served by giving rather lengthy notice in a newspaper circulating in the district is the proper solution to the problem.</P>

The subsection also covers publication in a newspaper circulating in &ldquo;any other county the council of which named the promoting authority pursuant to this Act&rdquo;.  It says that the notice shall state &ldquo;that the coast protection scheme has been prepared and also stating the place or places at which and the period, not being less than one month, during which a copy of the scheme will be available for inspection in pursuance of this section&rdquo;.

      <P>In subsection 5 (b) of this section there is a provision which allows the Minister for Finance to confirm the scheme, or to vary it without reference back to the parties concerned with its preparation including the local authority who have undertaken to meet a certain proportion of the cost.  I wonder is it really necessary to have this provision in this form.  No doubt it is administratively convenient that the scheme could be amended at this stage, but should it be possible for it to be amended by the <Col N="829" /> Minister for Finance without reference back to the authority?  Would it not be preferable if he wishes to vary a scheme and in particular to make additions to it that he should return it to the Commissioners of Public Works and the promoting authority for their final confirmation?</P>

After all, if the Minister for Finance does make an alteration or addition to a scheme it is only reasonable to refer back to the promoting authority, who have local knowledge, an intimation of what he proposes to do.  It might not appear to the Minister and his advisers here in Dublin that there was any impediment to what they proposed as a good measure, but if they referred the matter back it might come to light that the proposal was stupid or illogical or likely to cause great damage to some other part of the coast.  This reference back would not unduly delay things, because the local elected representatives would be very resentful if the Minister made alterations.

      <P>The position is that there might be some confusion with regard to the Minister and the Commissioners of Public Works.  In fact, you could call the Commissioners the Minister for Finance for all intents and purposes.  The section provides that the promoting authority shall consider observations received and submit a report to the Commissioners.  If the <Col N="830" /> authority want the scheme altered they will say so in the report.  The Commissioners will examine the report and determine what alterations, if any, should be made.  They will give notice of their determination to the promoting authority, who will make a further declaration that the scheme is or is not to be proceeded with.  If the promoting authority decide to go ahead with the scheme the Commissioners will then submit it to the Minister for Finance, and the Minister after any necessary consultations with other Ministers may make an Order refusing to confirm it or confirming it with or without alteration.</P>

      <P>Yes, of course, they can.  This is a matter in which the Minister for Finance will have no vested interest, or will have no interest except on advice tendered to him. He may put in some proviso after consultation with his colleagues.  For instance the Minister for Local Government might bring it to his attention that such and such a road might be cited for a road widening scheme at some future date and might ask if the line could be brought back an extra ten feet or something like that.  I can assure the Seanad that it will be purely minor, and I can guarantee that it will not affect in any way the scheme whereby a local authority representative would say &ldquo;we would never have proceeded with this if it were to be changed by the Minister&rdquo;. It will not be a change of any substantial nature.</P>

We have had this problem of people from the Continent coming here and buying land in recent years.  I do not want to be critical of them and their approach to the interpretation of private property.  We cannot do anything about that general question under this Bill but certainly where we proceed to spend public money on a coast protection scheme I should like to be reassured that the Minister has power and would take power to see to it that as a result of the spending of State money the coast so protected would be open to the ordinary Irish public.  I think the Minister had some sympathy with the point when I raised it on the Second Stage and he promised to look into it.</P>

Local authorities are already enabled under the Local Government (No. 2) Act, 1960, to borrow.  Under the section as it stands the county council would have no power to contribute to the costings being promoted by an urban council under the amendment of Section 2.

      <P>I am concerned with the question of the contributions by certain authorities to the promoting authority.  If these various authorities, which are listed in the section, agree to contribute certain amounts of money based on the estimate which is produced by the Office of Public Works, the position would then be, if the final cost of the scheme exceeded that particular estimate, that the amount of the excess of cost over estimate which would proportionately fall on the contributing authority would have to be borne by the promoting authority themselves.

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 18 deals with the question of the certificate of completion of the works.  The nature of the work of coast erosion is such that it is extremely difficult to distinguish between works and maintenance unless one is called on to do so by legal provisions such as occur in the Bill before us at the moment.  Indeed, many of the most successful schemes of coast erosion have been schemes in which trial works were carried out, left for a few years to see how they go and then further works done, so that in many successful coast erosion schemes there can be works and maintenance going on at the same time.  There can be maintenance of stage one of a coast erosion scheme going on before stage two is actually carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this would lead to some difficulty over a certificate of completion. It might, indeed, be better if it were made quite clear that there could be certificates of partial completion in regard to certain parts of the work.  I think this is a vitally important point. From a technical point of view it is <Col N="835" /> extremely difficult to distinguish in many of these schemes between maintenance trial works and substantial works.  We are in the difficulty here that there is a great financial difference between the two, because works are being subsidised to the extent of 80 per cent by the central authority and maintenance is not being subsidised at all.  Were the financial provisions for works and for maintenance the same, there would be absolutely no difficulty. I think there is a real difficulty on this particular point.  I think that it might be well that the certificate of completion should be capable of being given in stages.  That may be possible under the section.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to enlighten me on that.  Quite apart from the giving of the certificate in stages, I think it might be as well that the certificate of completion should not be an arbitrary decision only of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>It should also be something that would be agreed upon by the local authority who from that moment on bear 100 per cent of the cost of the works.  I would suggest the amendment of this particular section so that there would be agreement between the Office of Public Works and the local authority as to the point of completion of the works and in the event of disagreement that the matter should be submitted to an arbitrator nominated by the Institute of Civil Engineers of Ireland or some such person.  The real difficulty here, which is not the case in building or arterial drainage schemes, is that the borderline between works and maintenance is very shadowy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the suggestions made by Senator Dooge in this connection. I am quite well aware that in all the dealings under this Bill the local authority are called upon at various stages to agree: they must agree to promote the scheme, agree to having a final scheme prepared and agree to pay 20 per cent of the cost of the work when it is completed, but at no stage from the time of the Office of Public Works commence to carry out the <Col N="836" /> operation is any provision made in the Bill or implied in it to enable the local authority's engineer to carry out an inspection to see that the works are in accordance with the plans and specifications. When the Commissioners of Public Works say that the scheme is completed the local authorities have to accept that whether or not they are satisfied at that stage that the works have been completed to the satisfaction of their engineer.  This is a matter which causes a considerable amount of difficulty between local authorities and the Commissioners of Public Works and it goes a bit further because later Section 20, subsection (2), states:</P>
      <P>In addition and without prejudice to the general powers conferred on the Commissioners by subsection (1) of this section, it shall be lawful for the Commissioners, for the purposes of maintenance referred to in that subsection, to execute such improvements to works as appear to them to be minor matters properly capable of being regarded as maintenance.</P>
      <P>In other words, the Commissioners of Public Works complete the job and the local authority are responsible up to that stage for 20 per cent of the total cost.  Now the Commissioners of Public Works in the course of a month or two, gaining in knowledge and experience of the behaviour of tides and currents, may decide that something further is necessary but they can regard that further scheme as maintenance for which the local authority have to pay the full cost.</P>
      <P>Finally, the matter assumes another and a greater importance when we read Section 23 which provides that at any stage the Commissioners of Public Works may decide that the works have to be abandoned.  They decide that works have ceased to be of real importance or a real protection to the coast and they abandon them.  They abandon them without the concurrence of the local authority or consultation with them although up to one stage the local authority have contributed 20 per cent of the cost and 50 per cent up to the point at which the Commissioners decide to abandon the scheme as no longer being suitable or effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> I think it should be written in, as Senator Dooge suggested, that there should be closer liaison between the authority promoting the scheme and the Commissioners of Public Works on the progress of the works, the certificate of completion and the maintenance work subsequently to be carried out by the Commissioners of Public Works entirely at the responsibility and cost of the local authority.</P>

      <P>On Section 18 I should like to say in reply to Senators that the points mentioned by them have a certain amount of merit. Their argument is: why should the Office of Public Works be judge and jury in the interpretation of the words &ldquo;date of completion&rdquo;?  Take, however, the actual position.  If the promoting authority are contributing 20 per cent of the cost it is only logical and natural to assume that the county engineer or his assistant will hold a watching brief, and a very close watching brief, on behalf of the promoting authority.  Therefore, it should not present much difficulty to him in co-operation with my officials to decide if, in fact, the works can be certified as having been completed.  All the points raised by the Senators seem to be based on the assumpion that no one talks to anyone else and that relations are not happy between the Office of Public Works and county engineers. In actual fact, on arterial drainage and so on there is great co-operation and if a county engineer or his assistant said: &ldquo;We do not think the works are completed and we feel that you should not give a certificate of completion due to X, Y and Z reasons&rdquo; I am sure that we would comply with their suggestions.</P>
      <P>If Senators wish to improve the phraseology I am quite willing to consider changes.  I appreciate the points mentioned by them but how they will improve the phraseology I do not know, whether by inserting instead of &ldquo;arriving at a date for completion&rdquo; the words &ldquo;three months&rdquo; or &ldquo;when a certain period elapses from the anticipated date of completion&rdquo;.  It is difficult to know what should be done but I am quite willing to consider the matter further.</P>

      <P>I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for that.  I should like to emphasise the point that this particular type of scheme gives the greatest difficulty.  In arterial drainage there is some difficulty but it is not really as bad as schemes of this type.</P>
      <P>There is a point I should have raised and perhaps I may be allowed now to mention it briefly.  In coast protection there could be two schemes of equal merit, one heavy on works and light on maintenance, the other light on works and heavy on maintenance.  The position under the financial provisions of the Bill is that the one that is heavy on maintenance and light on works imposes a greater financial burden on the promoting authority but under the Bill as it stands the Board of Works prepare the scheme and it might perhaps be preferable if the Board of Works prepared in outline two or three schemes and then discussed them with the promoting authority because there is no one best way for curing the particular problem.  We can arrive at the most economic scheme but the most economic scheme from the point of view of central funds is not necessarily the most economic scheme from the point of view of local funds and there could be a real conflict of interest on this point.  What is needed is something to eliminate that conflict of interest.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that it is not for the Commissioners of Public Works under this section to interpret whether works should be abandoned or not.  We take our riding instructions from the Minister for Finance.  He instructs us.  We do not do anything.  In other words, I envisage a situation arising whereby a deputation of the county council or the local Deputies or Senators of all Parties might seek an interview with the Minister for Finance and point out that such and such works were a hazard, a danger to children and to the amenities of a resort generally, and the Minister might first call for a report from us, so it will be seen we do not of our own volition come along and abandon something.  In actual fact, to reinforce my argument further, may I point out that the interested party in abandoning a scheme would be the local authority because they would be paying for the maintenance costs?</P>

      <P>I know there is great reluctance at all times towards making grants from the Central Fund for continuing maintenance but I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider carefully that coast erosion maintenance is not maintenance in the sense that it is in regard to public buildings and public works generally. A coast protection scheme is not something that is done within a small unit of time and maintained thereafter.  It is a continuing process.  Maintenance of works of this type is not pure maintenance. <Col N="840" /> There is always an element of works, an element of design, an element of trial in it, and I think if there were to be a contribution from the Central Fund for works of maintenance many of the difficulties we have been talking about on earlier sections would be greatly alleviated.  I am not saying that we should carry on what has been done on works, that 80 per cent. should be from Central Fund but I do not think any real principle would be abandoned if the Central Fund made a 20 per cent. contribution, that is, if the charges were reversed for maintenance because this is a type of scheme which need not be used as a precedent for the granting of maintenance costs on other types of work because of the very nature of the work involved.  I would earnestly suggest that if we had a slight contribution from the Central Fund for maintenance a great deal of discussion and what might at times be bitterness in regard to completion and other matters would be greatly alleviated and might well vanish.</P>

      <P>In the first place, I would not have any authority to commit the Minister for Finance to such a consideration.  The Senator is aware of the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  Rosslare is a unique case.  Started in 1957, it will not be finished until 1964.  We have learned a lot from our experience there.  Let us leave out Rosslare entirely for the moment and not look on it as creating a precedent, but let us take a case such as Kilkee in County Clare where the late Nicholas O'Dwyer did a great job on the vertical face of the cliff which was undermining the roadway.  Not a shilling had to be spent on that job since. Were the cases in general of such a type as the Kilkee case, of the vertical cliff without any further maintenance being required, a problem would not arise.  The other extreme is the Rosslare case.  The only let out I see would be, should a problem arise involving work of a costly nature after the certificate of completion is given then there is absolutely no reason whatsoever why such a new problem and such a costly problem could not <Col N="841" /> be considered as a new coast protection scheme, probably of a minor nature.  We arrive at the point that the Senator seems to be worried about. In other words there would be a possibility, if the Commissioners of Public Works gave such a certificate of completion and three years afterwards another problem arose which was a coast erosion problem, it would be reasonable to initiate another scheme on those lines.  It should not take long, all the relevant information obtained for the purposes of the first scheme being available.  Then what might have been classified as maintenance, and chargeable to the local authority as to 100 per cent, could be classified as a coastal erosion scheme to be paid for on the 80 to 20 per cent basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purposes of this Bill are to extend the existing statutory powers of Córas Iompair Éireann in relation to</P>
      <P>(i)  the construction of railways;</P>
      <P>&nbsp;(ii)  temporary borrowings;</P>
      <P>(iii)  long-term borrowing for capital purposes;</P>
      <P>(iv)  the abandonment of railway lines;</P>
      <P>&nbsp;(v)  the payment of redundancy compensation</P>
      <P>and also to provide sundry statutory safeguards for members of CIE staff transferred to the new Hotels Subsidiary Company known as Ostlanna Iompair Éireann Teo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessity to extend CIE's statutory powers in relation to the construction <Col N="842" /> of railways arises from the fact that the Board proposes to extend the railway line at Wicklow so as to provide a rail connection to the factory of Shamrock Fertilisers Ltd., Wicklow.  At present traffic between the factory and the railway station has to be hauled by road and the proposed rail extension would allow of traffic from the factory being loaded directly on to railway wagons.  The present arrangement involves double handling of fertilisers consigned for onward delivery by rail from Wicklow with a resultant increase in costs.</P>
    <P>The extension is a relatively small job involving only about 700 yds. of new line at a cost estimated not to exceed £8,000.  The extension line will, however, run partly over the public roadway and partly through private property.  It would seem at first sight that CIE could be given the necessary powers to construct this railway extension by the making of an Order for the purpose by me under Section 14 of the Transport Act, 1960.  I have, however, been advised by the Attorney General that in the laying-down of new lines other than lines on its own property or on another person's property with that person's consent the Board might successfully be restrained if some part of the construction works, for example, the breaking-up of the public roadway, were held to be in conflict with Statute or Common Law.</P>
    <P>Since the proposed railway would run for some hundreds of yards through the town of Wicklow along a route adjacent to the sea front, it will be necessary having regard to the Attorney General's advice in the matter to extend the existing statutory powers of CIE in relation to the construction of railways. This I propose to do in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>The proposed statutory powers are in Sections 2 to 10 of the Bill.  There is nothing novel in these proposed powers; they are, with a few minor exceptions, identical with the corresponding powers conferred on Bord na Móna by the Turf Development Act, 1946.</P>
    <P>As CIE have already constructed <Col N="843" /> minor railways under powers conferred by two separate Ministerial Orders made under Section 14 of the Transport Act, 1950, it is proposed for the avoidance of doubt to provide as at Section 11 of the Bill that the two Orders which are specified in that Section shall be treated as if they had been made under this Bill when enacted.</P>
    <P>CIE are empowered under Section 28 of the Transport Act, 1950 (as amended) to borrow temporarily from their bankers for general financing purposes. They may borrow at their own discretion up to £½ million and to the extent that these borrowings exceed £½ million my prior approval, given with the consent of the Minister for Finance, is required.  The Minister for Finance is empowered to guarantee these borrowings to the extent of £1½ million. CIE normally exercise these powers to secure short-term accommodation during periods when revenue drops seasonally. There has, however, been a rather serious deterioration in the Board's revenue position during the past financial year and it is clear that the Board will be obliged to have recourse to temporary borrowings to a greater extent and for a longer period than in preceding years.  It is proposed accordingly to take powers in the present Bill to enable the Exchequer, in the person of the Minister for Finance, to lend direct to CIE within the existing £2 million statutory limit of such borrowings by CIE.  As a complementary measure, the Bill proposes to empower CIE to borrow temporarily from sources other than bankers.  I think that the House will wish to have some explanation as to the reasons for deterioration in CIE's revenue position.  It will be recalled that in the period following the enactment of the Transport Act, 1958, CIE made substantial progress towards achieving the objectives of that legislation.  The Board's operating losses, which amounted to £1,950,000 in 1958/59, fell to £709,000 in 1959/60 and to £246,000 in 1960/61.  This progress suffered a sharp setback during the year ended 31st March, 1962, due mainly to the eighth round of wage and salary increases and associated improvements <Col N="844" /> in conditions of employment, which in that year together amounted to an increase of £1,024,000 in the Board's wage and salary bill.  In a full year the cost to the Board of these increases amounts to £2.35 million.  Other factors also contributed to worsen the Board's financial position; these included heavy additional maintenance costs of a periodic nature, increased depreciation charges, and the cost of additional road staff recruited to handle increased business. To these factors there was added a continuing decline in railway business and the fact that the increased rates and charges only came into operation in the last few months of the year. There were on the other hand offsets resulting from increased road freight and passenger business and from economies introduced.  The net result, however, was that the board's operating loss for the year 1961/62 rose to £1,696,000 as against £246,000 in the preceding year.  During the financial year ended on the 31st March last, the course of events I have outlined continued without significant change and the operating loss is, I understand, even greater than for the preceding year.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that the position now is that the Board seems to be without prospect of overtaking the effects of the eighth round.  It now appears clear that the increased fares, rates and charges which the Board introduced to counter the effects of the eighth round cannot be expected to bring in more than £1.13 million in a full year.  The cost of the eighth round has worked out at £2.35 million a year and there is, therefore, a gap of £1.22 million. This corresponds roughly with the Board's forecast deficit on operating account in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>A reasonable comment on this situation is that if the eighth round increase for CIE, including the cost of associated improvements in employment conditions, had been at the National level of 12 per cent, as recorded in September, 1962, instead of the actual increase of 20 per cent, then the deficit for 1962/63 would, on the provisional results, have been reduced by about £900,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="845" /> CIE are empowered under Section 28 of the Transport Act, 1950, as amended, to raise funds by stock issues to meet their capital requirements. The Act sets a limit of £12 millions to the amount which may be so raised and this limit was reached by the last stock issue for £2 million which took place in May, 1962.</P>
    <P>The Board have estimated that its expenditure on capital account, including renewals, replacements and additions, in the two years ending 31st March, 1964, will amount to £6.13 million.  Initially the programme amounted to £9.7 million but, having regard to the desirability of curtailing the rate of new capital expenditure, the Board, at my request, revised the programme so as to defer until after 31st March, 1964, substantial blocks of capital expenditure.  These deferments, together with an arrangement for obtaining the 37 new diesel locomotives purchased in 1962 on an extended credit instead of a cash basis, have made it possible to reduce total capital expenditure for the two years 1962/63 and 1963/64 to £6.13 million.  This revised estimate represents maximum practicable deferments of capital projects and takes account of planned rail and station closures.  Included in this programme are such essential items as payment of the instalments totalling £883,590 on the new diesel locomotives, the construction of new railway coaches of an advanced design, the continuation of the railway wagon construction project, the cost of new and more up-to-date buses for the Board's touring services and the provision of additional road freight vehicles including vehicles required to replace branch line services which have been closed down.</P>
    <P>Of the total estimated capital expenditure of £6.13 million, a sum of £3.261 million will be provided by the Board's depreciation provisions leaving £2.869 million to be financed from new capital funds.  The Board must also, at this stage, take account of capital requirements arising in the earlier part of the financial year 1964/65, which amount to £734,000, approximately.  In addition, provision must be made for contingencies and <Col N="846" /> for the expenses of Stock issues, together estimated at £250,000.  The estimated total capital requirement for which provision must be made is, therefore, £3.853 million.  The capital funds remaining available to the Board since the last stock issue of £2 million in May, 1962, will not suffice to meet this essential expenditure.  It will, therefore, be necessary to empower the Board to raise further capital funds and it is accordingly proposed in the present Bill to increase the existing limit of £12 million, to which I have referred, by £3 million to £15 million.</P>
    <P>I would like to reassure the House that the capital expenditure proposed by the Board in the two years I have mentioned, 1962/63 and 1963/64, would all be necessary even if a firm decision were taken to reduce the milage of the CIE railway system to that envisaged in the Beddy Committee Report.  The present milage is 1,459 miles compared with 2,168 miles in October, 1958, and the 850 miles envisaged in the Beddy Report, to which must be added 63 miles of the former GNR line from Dublin to Belfast.  Much of the proposed expenditure is, in fact, being incurred on equipment for road passenger and road freight services, both of which activities give a satisfactory return on the capital invested in them as may be seen from the Board's accounts.</P>
    <P>The entire operation of CIE in all their sections and departments is being steadily reorganised.  Very detailed information has already been given on this inevitably lengthy process of modernisation.  Suffice to say that by April, 1964, the annual loss and consequent burden upon the taxpayer could well have been as much as £3 million or £4 million save for the measures taken by the Chairman and the Board.</P>
    <P>The whole question of future transport policy, with particular reference to the position of CIE after 31st March, 1964, is at present under review.  CIE themselves have embarked on a comprehensive analysis of the operation of the whole undertaking with a view to providing a fully documented factual basis for the formulation by the Government of new policies on the future of the railways, for the purpose of new <Col N="847" /> long-term transport legislation which will be necessary after 31st March, 1964.  That legislation must take account of, among other things, the long-term capital requirements of CIE.</P>
    <P>I myself have spoken in very great detail on this problem and have made it clear that the taxpayer will not be asked to pay subsidies in order to maintain any type of public transport if another less costly and more efficient type, either publicly or privately owned, can be provided.  I have also analysed the position in regard to the additional cost of maintaining roads where branch lines have been closed and have made it clear that there is a considerable nett saving to the collective body of taxpayers and ratepayers.</P>
    <P>Criticism of this policy, I am glad to say, has come largely from a minority of public representatives and the overwhelming defeat in the Dáil of the Private Members Bill, whose object was to relieve CIE of the obligation to pay its way, was significant.  Senators have been fully briefed in this matter over the past four years and I do not need, at this stage, to say any more on this subject.</P>
    <P>In December, 1961, a subsidiary company Ostlanna Iompair Éireann Teo., was incorporated to acquire the Board's hotels and to administer its catering services.  In order to facilitate consultations between CIE and the trade unions on matters arising out of the establishment of the proposed subsidiary, I undertook at the time to introduce certain measures relating to redundancy compensation and pension rights.  Provision is now being made in this Bill whereby staff transferred by CIE to Ostlanna Iompair Éireann Teo. will retain their existing rights as CIE employees to redundancy compensation under transport legislation as though they were still in the employment of CIE.  Provision is also being made whereby staff transferred to Ostlanna Iompair Éireann Teo., who are already members of CIE superannuation schemes, may continue in membership of such schemes.</P>
    <P>The Memorandum and Articles of <Col N="848" /> Association of Ostlanna Iompair Éireann Teo. provide for a degree of official control of the company comparable with that exercised over CIE under the Transport Acts.  Provision is made in this Bill for certain additional controls complementary to those in the company's Memorandum and Articles.</P>
    <P>Experience has shown that it would be desirable to provide for two minor amendments in the law relating to the abandonment of railway lines.  The existing legislation does not permit of the abandonment by CIE of a railway line on which all train services had been terminated prior to the transfer of the railway line&mdash;for example from the GNR&mdash;to CIE.  Secondly, the existing legislation does not permit of the disposal of tenanted premises on abandoned lines to the tenants thereof by private treaty.  These matters are covered in the Bill now before you.</P>
    <P>The Transport Act, 1958, and the Great Northern Railway Act, 1958, provide for payment by CIE of compensation to employees whose services are dispensed with within five years of the passing of the Acts, that is, up to and including 15th July, 1963, and the recoupment of the cost to CIE by the Exchequer.  Section 19 of the present Bill proposes to extend this provision up to 31st March, 1964.  The extension has been found to be necessary because the schemes of reorganisation which CIE are introducing under the Transport Act, 1958, will not be fully completed until some time between 15th July, 1963, and 31st March, 1964. It is, therefore, necessary to safeguard the position of staff who may become redundant between the two dates I have mentioned and for that purpose the Bill proposes to extend the provisions for redundancy compensation from the present termination date, which is 15th July, 1963, to 31st March, 1964, which is the date of expiry of the reorganisation period envisaged in the Transport Act, 1958.</P>
    <P>I think that, at this stage, I should give you some figures of the number of CIE employees declared redundant by the Board since 1st October, 1958. Up to 31st March, 1963, a total of <Col N="849" /> 1,247 CIE employees had been retired with compensation and some 50 other employees are expected to be retired with compensation between 1st April, 1963, and 15th July, 1963.</P>
    <P>CIE estimate that 300 employees will be retired on redundancy during the period 16th July, 1963, to 31st March, 1964, and that the ultimate cost to the Exchequer of the compensation payable in relation thereto will amount to £900,000.  The provision in the Vote for my Department for recoupment of redundancy compensation in the current financial year is £400,000.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is now being taken to deal, also, with two small defects in the Great Northern Railway Act, 1958. It was the intention that ex-GNR employees transferred or seconded to CIE as a result of the transfer to CIE of that part of the GNR undertaking in the State would have the same rights to redundancy compensation as CIE employees.  I have been advised, however, that while the provisions of Section 17 (1) (c) of the Great Northern Railway Act, 1958, cover redundancy arising from such causes as the reduction of rail services or the substitution of diesel for steam traction, the subsection does not extend to redundancy arising under reorganisation schemes covered by Orders made by me under Section 14 (6) of the Transport Act, 1958.  It is accordingly proposed to remedy this defect by amending subsection 17 (1) (c) of the Great Northern Railway Act, 1958, so as to bring its provisions into line with those of Section 14 of the Transport Act, 1958, in accordance with the original intention.</P>
    <P>A further drafting amendment to Section 17 of the Great Northern Railway Act, 1958, has also been found to be necessary.  Subsection (3) of that section deals with, <i>inter alia</i>, the grant by CIE for the purpose of determining entitlement to redundancy compensation, of an increase in pensionable service of a person taken into the employment of the Board at a late age.  It now appears, however, that the application of this provision does not extend to employees who become redundant <Col N="850" /> under the provisions of Section 14 of the Transport Act, 1958.  As it was not the intention that this provision should be so restricted it is proposed to take the opportunity of extending it to cater for redundancy arising under the Transport Act, 1958.</P>
    <P>Finally, I come to Section 21 of the Bill.  This section is designed to remedy a defect in paragraph 5 of the Second Schedule to the Transport Act, 1958. That paragraph relates to the abatement of redundancy compensation where the recipient is employed by a State-sponsored company or a local authority.  The paragraph as at present drafted does not embrace subsidiary companies of such boards or bodies. This defect is now being remedied in so far as future redundancies are concerned.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill to the House for acceptance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as far as it goes.  Maybe this is not an occasion for a major debate or review of transport policy, but in so far as it is an amendment of the 1958 legislation and an extension of an important provision of that Act, we are entitled to ask what progress has been made under the 1958 Act.  I think the Minister made the point rather strongly in the Dáil recently that the 1958 legislation was agreed legislation.  There was no vote against it in the Dáil or Seanad, and it was the culmination of a good deal of consultation with the trade unions whose members were affected by the legislation.  It was agreed and accepted, and it would be fair to say that it was the enactment of an understanding between the then Minister and the trade unions involved in CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's policy in regard to the railways was made clear by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, now the Taoiseach, in the Dáil on 27th November, 1957.  He was introducing a Supplementary Estimate for his Department but he was, in fact, announcing the Government's policy after consideration of the Beddy Committee Report.  It would be no harm for all of us to refresh our memories on the then stated Government policy <Col N="851" /> which, as I say, formed the basis of the 1958 legislation.  The Minister's statement dealt largely with the problems of the railways at that time.  I quote from Col. 1049 of Vol. 164 of the Official Debates of 27th November, 1957.  Here is what Deputy Lemass then said:</P>
    <P>For these reasons the Government have reached the decision that we must try to preserve railways as an integral part of the national transport system.  The aim of the policy measures upon which we have now decided, or other measures which may be approved in the future, will be to make effective that decision to maintain railways as an integral part of the national transport system by reducing the gap between the revenue and the cost of railway operation and thereby to make the whole of the national transport undertaking capable of paying its way.</P>
    <P>Later on in the same speech the Minister made an appeal to the trade unions, and he made it even clearer when introducing the Second Reading of the Transport Bill early in 1958. The sense of that appeal was that the unions should face up to the position, accept that there would be reduction in the overall employment on the railways, and that reduction would make more certain and more secure the employment of the remainder.  It is fair to say that the unions concerned, particularly the unions dealing with the railway workers of CIE, have carried out their part of the bargain.  There has been as far as I am aware no opposition to re-organisation schemes designed to improve the efficiency of the railways, and to reduce the cost, even though that involved redundancy and considerable hardship in the transfer of staff affected.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the attitude of the Minister now dealing with it subsequent to the passage of the 1958 legislation has created the impression that he regards the CIE employees as parasites, people who have had to be supported out of public funds, who <Col N="852" /> are a continuous charge on the taxpayer. In his speech this afternoon there was another reference to the charge on the taxpapers.  I think that that is unfair to the people concerned and, in fact, produces no good results whatever.  Also we got the impression that the people who managed the railways and ran them prior to the enactment of the 1958 legislation were in some way failing, that they did not know their jobs, and that that was the reason why CIE were in a financial mess.  We were told&mdash;and the Minister was very good at telling the general public this&mdash;that there was the need for the application of modern management techniques, to use the modern phrase, to CIE.</P>
    <P>My experience of this is that the application of modern management techniques has meant in a large measure the importation into CIE of people with no previous experience or knowledge of public transport or of the problems involved.  Some of them are very capable and very good and have been very useful acquisitions.  On the other hand, I do not think that I can let the occasion pass without saying that as far as I can see the only qualification of others was their connection with Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>CIE have been controlled by the Government since 1944.  They were nationalised and brought under more direct control in 1950.  It would be too much to expect that Government political influence in the making of appointments could be completely excluded. I do not expect that, but it is fair to say that under this Minister's administration there is more evidence of political influence in making appointments and promotions within the organisation of CIE.  I am not saying this because I am opposed to Fianna Fáil or to the Minister's policies.  I hope that I would be equally critical if the Labour Party were in control and behaved similarly.  My criticism is not against these people.  My criticism is because of the damage which is done to an organisation and a service which must be as efficient as possible, and which depends so much on the morale of the staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE have in recent years been the happy hunting ground for industrial consultants.  I do not mean that in any derogatory sense. Personally, I very much favour the application of new minds, examination by people who come in fresh without prejudice or any previous experience but who look at an organisation and see its function and advise as to how that organisation could be improved. I am very strong on one point about it and that is that with any industrial consultants the ultimate responsibility, the ultimate decision, must rest with the people who know and who have to work the organisation.  I feel that in many cases in recent years in CIE new ideas have been taken because they were recommended by industrial consultants and, in fact, they had not worked out.  The economies supposed to result have never seen the light of day.</P>
      <P>In connection with that, as the Minister knows, the whole management organisation within CIE has been changed since 1958.  It was formerly a very highly centralised management organisation.  It was found to be understaffed. Under-managed would be the right term.  Dr. Beeching had a similar experience when he looked at British railways.  He found that, because of financial pressure over the years, in fact, the number of executives, the number of management, was unreasonably low in relation to the size of the organisation.  That has been changed in CIE.  From being a highly centralised organisation the management has been largely decentralised.  I am not criticising that.  I should like to make the point that that necessarily is a more expensive system of management than the highly centralised system.  I hope, and I have figures to show this, that it is a more efficient way of running the organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I want to make, arising out of this, is that the changing of the system or personnel of management of CIE is not a solution to the problems of public transport.  It would be quite wrong and unfair that the idea should be let go abroad that the then financial position of CIE was due to <Col N="857" /> the people who formerly ran the undertaking, and I cannot pretend to speak for them.  We have seen different personnel and a completely different system of management and still we have the problem of the CIE's finances. I think, therefore, that it would be helpful if once and for all we recognised that the problem of trying to make a nationalised public transport system pay in this country is not a management problem.  It is a problem which exists in practically every Western European country that railways as such, a public transport system as such, cannot in this day and age be made economically viable.</P>
    <P>In recent years the Minister has underlined this by quoting for us the number of people made redundant. There has been a great deal of re-organisation in CIE and the bulk of the people made redundant were made redundant because of re-organisation rather than by any closure of branch lines.  I should like to stress again that the ability to make this re-organisation has depended on the existence of adequate compensation provisions embodied in the 1958 legislation.  The level of compensation as seen by the previous Minister, has enabled trade unions to co-operate in such re-organisation and has avoided putting trade unions into the position of opposing the re-organisations considered necessary by CIE.</P>
    <P>We are now, however, within sight of the end of that cover provided by the 1958 legislation.  It has been extended by this Bill to the 31st March 1964 but that is something within sight.  I referred earlier to management organisation, the setting up of a decentralised organisation instead of the previously highly centralised organisation, but so far as I know not all the staff affected by that decentralisation have yet been completely dealt with.  In other words, staff are employed whose work and whose responsibility have been taken from them by reason of the new management organisation.  They are still employed and no steps have yet been taken to make them redundant.  It is most humiliating for any individual whose <Col N="858" /> work has disappeared, whose responsibility has disappeared, to be kept on, coming in day after day not knowing what is going to happen to him, with no work, no real responsibility, to carry out.  As well, it is bad for the morale of the rest of the staff.</P>
    <P>I do not know the reason for this. Various reasons have been advanced. One is that in the interval of setting up this new organisation there is possibly reluctance to dispense with older staff who managed previously and that it is a form of insurance to keep them on to see how things will pan out, but surely that day should have passed. Another explanation I have heard is in fact that the Minister was opposing further redundancies in CIE at least for a period, that he thought the rate of redundancy too heavy a charge on the Exchequer and that CIE should carry on for a while without making more people redundant.  I do not know. The only point I am making is that when people have been made a surplus by reason of a change in the organisation those people should be dealt with as quickly as possible and not left stringing along with no work and no responsibility, wondering what is going to happen.  Either they should be given new jobs and new responsibility or they should be put out under the compensation arrangements provided in the 1958 legislation.</P>
    <P>As I said, we are within sight of the end of the cover period of the 1958 legislation.  That is a matter of some concern for the trade unions because I am sure the Minister will appreciate that an examination of a department or a system of working started now may not bring forth its eventual redundancy, its saving of staff, until well after the 31st March, 1964.  The unions have been in a position to co-operate&mdash;or actually of being able to avoid opposition&mdash;by reason of the compensation provisions in the 1958 legislation but very soon there must come a time when any prudent trade union must say: &ldquo;A halt now.  If you are proceeding to do this we do not want to find a situation where our members will be made redundant after the 31st March, 1964, with no cover <Col N="859" /> whatever with regard to compensation.&rdquo; That effective date of decision by the trade unions must arise much earlier than 31st March, 1964.  I think the Minister understands the problem here and that he will appreciate the desirability of clarifying the position much earlier than next spring or indeed the autumn of this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister is very fond of lecturing all and sundry on the need to face up to modern developments and to learn from other progressive countries, particularly countries of the Common Market.  I do not know whether he has seen the article in the most recent issue of the <i>Sunday Times</i>, a very interesting article comparing the developments in industrial relations in west European countries with those in Britain and very strongly making the point that Britain will have to do something about it quickly.  I think in this context we could read &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; as well as Britain.  The particular paragraph to which I want to draw the Minister's attention is this:</P>
    <P>If the countries of the Common Market had ceased to flourish we could ignore their experience, but both they and their northern neighbours are still expanding economically faster and more steadily than we are.  The lesson they teach is that until joint consultation has become a firmly rooted habit it is impossible to create a climate in industrial relations which allows a modern mixed economy to grow.  It is a lesson which it ought not to be impossible for us to learn in Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before business was suspended, I was quoting from an article in a recent issue of the <i>Sunday Times</i> which made a point that until joint consultation has become a permanently rooted habit it is impossible to create a climate in industrial relations which will allow a modern mixed economy to grow.  I must confess that when the 1958 legislation was enacted I had hopes that we would develop in CIE a more modern and a more <Col N="860" /> efficient method of staff relations and that we could have progress and at the same time peace within the industry. Now, it is true that joint consultative machinery has been established in CIE but there is a rub in it all.  It is not joint consultation in the commonly understood terms sensibly worked.</P>
      <P>I think I can best illustrate what joint consultation should be by quoting from a document dealing with the system in Sweden.  It says: &ldquo;It is in the nature of joint consultation that it precedes the making of decisions and the emerging of change.&rdquo;  The system in force in CIE does not provide for joint consultation before the taking of decisions or the initiating of changes, the provision for the giving of information to the trade unions of the staff of changes already decided upon.  Now, this, certainly to me, is disappointing because I thought that in CIE we could lead the way and establish procedures and methods which not alone would be of service to CIE but be an example to other services and industries in this country.  However, that is not a matter on which I want to go into any detail at the present time but I think it is appropriate to remind the Minister, who has so frequently reminded us, of the lessons we can learn from other countries.  Here in an organisation under his control we have very little progress towards the modern and successful method we can see on the Continent of Co-operation between management and staff for improvement in staff relations.

      <P>I want now to refer to Section 13 of the Bill which provides for advances from time to time <Col N="861" /> by the Minister for Finance to CIE of up to £2 million.  Now, it seems to me from the reading of that section that what is envisaged is a return to the former system of borrowing to meet losses as compared with the present arrangement of a fixed annual subsidy.  I was going to remind the Minister of what he said in Dáil Éireann some few months ago, the certainly that in spite of the loss made by CIE in the year ending 31st March, 1962, and the expected loss for the year ending March just ended, nevertheless, CIE would find it possible to break even in the time limit provided for in the 1958 legislation.  But the Minister in his speech here today has apparently abandoned that and he now admits that that is impossible of achievement.  That is so, but I think it would be very wrong if we blamed anybody or blamed one another for that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1958 legislation was, as I said, agreed legislation.  I think the principle of laying down a target and attempting to work towards that target is very good.  It is much better than the system of leaving losses accrue and eventually having to do something about it which is demoralising for everybody concerned.  The five-year period has proved to be too short to enable CIE to make the necessary reorganisation in order to break even. Now, I personally feel that it will be impossible for public transport in this country and in most modern countries to break even.  Certainly a five-year period has proved too short and I hope the Minister will make an early announcement as to the policy and as to the legislation which will be introduced to take care of the position when that five-year period elapses, in favour of a continuation of the subsidy related to the current situation, but still with an obligation on CIE&mdash;I include the staff as well as the management in this&mdash;to aim at improving efficiency progressively and continuously and trying to make the organisation as economical and as efficient as possible. We have heard a lot recently about the situation of British railways&mdash;the famous Beeching Plan.  It might be no harm to remind ourselves that what <Col N="862" /> Dr. Beeching is aiming at is not to make British Railways pay their way: he admits that he cannot hope to achieve that.  All he is hoping to do is to reduce the annual loss to within a more manageable figure.</P>
    <P>We have a position, in Britain, a highly industrialised country, of big movements of goods and passengers. After an examination of the position they accept that it would be impossible, in spite of modernisation and very severe curtailment of railway services, to make British Railways pay their way.  The same applies in most western European countries.  Offhand, the only example I can think of, where the railway pays its way, is Switzerland&mdash;and possibly the Netherlands. Recently I had an opportunity of looking at the position of the railways in Sweden.  There they have a very modern progressive economy and the railways are something like CIE, an integrated nationalised undertaking losing between £6 million and £7 million per annum.  I think about a quarter of its railway lines have been assessed by the railway company as being uneconomic, but the Government have refused to allow any Swedish railway to close.  They say: &ldquo;In the national interest this must be kept going and we shall pay you for the losses involved&rdquo;.  That is not an explanation, I say, for the £6 million or £7 million annual deficit.  The great road undertaking loses a considerable amount of money and that is not having regard even to the city transport and Stockholm which again loses very heavily.</P>
    <P>Sweden, as I said, is a very progressive country.  They do not seem to be bothered about any local opposition to the closing of railway lines; they do not seem to have any attachment to railway lines as such.  But, as I said, they lose money in spite of their continuing efforts to improve the efficiency of the railways.</P>
    <P>I do not think that we should be ashamed or in any way feel that we are deficient because we cannot make CIE pay their way.  I quite agree with the Minister that there should be a continuing pressure towards making them pay.  But let us at the same time realise <Col N="863" /> that it is not because of any fault of the organisation or management.  I have shown that change of personnel, change of organisation, have not affected the position appreciably.  It is not due to any deficiency of staff. The reason, I suppose, is common to all countries, with the very existence of the internal combustion engine.  It is part of the modern economy that public transport, unfortunately, finds it very difficult, if not impossible, to pay its way.</P>
    <P>I want to urge on the Minister the desirability from everybody's point of view, including the trade unions, that an early decision and announcement should be made as soon as possible to let us know where we are going and what we should hope to achieve, what we should plan for.  I referred to joint consultation and I think I might underline that somewhat by reminding the Minister that Parliament has attached an obligation on CIE to regulate the rates of pay and conditions of service of their employees, including road employees, in agreements made from time to time with the trade unions representing those employees.  That is a legal obligation put upon the railways by the Oireachtas in 1924 and extended to road employees in 1933&mdash;I think.  It has been continued in legislation since then.  I think that shows the thinking and the will of Parliament on the management of public transport to regulate, consult and fix the conditions in accordance with agreements with the trade unions.  I do not know if the Minister has studied that aspect of it.  I do not want to deal with current defects, current disputes.  That might not be particularly helpful.  The obligation exists and is put upon CIE by Parliament and I think there is a lot to be learned from the wish and the will of Parliament in that direction.</P>
    <P>There is another section of the Bill to which I wish to refer before concluding and that is Section 21, which appears to me to be retrospective legislation and very undesirable altogether. From my reading of the section&mdash;the amendment of the Act which it proposes to amend&mdash;it would seem to have the effect of taking from certain <Col N="864" /> people compensation which they had already been awarded.  In the case of compensation awarded to certain people in Dundalk for loss of employment with the Great Northern Railway, and who have been paid this compensation since then, it seems to me that this section, as it is drawn up, will now have the effect of depriving them of the compensation they are at present being paid.  I am referring of course, to continuing long term compensation of annual figures rather than a lump sum.  My reading of the section is that it would take from those people the compensation already awarded to them.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, the Minister would be kind enough in his reply to clear my mind about this.  I very much hope I am wrong.  Might I in conclusion say, as I have said at the start, that I welcome the Bill so far as it goes.  The Minister has been co-operative with the trade unions concerned in bringing forward this Bill to take care of the position of the difficulty which might arise between July and 31st March, 1964. He has also met fully our point of view in regard to correcting a flaw which has appeared in a section of the 1958 Act.</P>

I think it was a mistake on the Minister's part not to circulate an explanatory memorandum with the Bill.  It is the type of Bill which would be greatly helped by an explanatory memorandum.  I understand it is not the practice of the Department to send out explanatory memoranda with Bills, but I respectfully suggest to the Minister that he might revise that practice and do so in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first 11 sections of the Bill&mdash;or approximately half the Bill&mdash;deal with the construction of railways and the making of orders entitling CIE to construct new railways.  When that is all boiled down it really means that <Col N="865" /> CIE propose to lay about 700 yards of line outside Wicklow town.  I am sure if the present policy is pursued, it will be many a long day before any further railway line is laid.  That is the type of thing I have in mind when I say an explanatory memorandum would have been very helpful and might have saved much time.  There are a few points in the first 11 sections with which I should like to deal, but they are matters of detail which can be more appropriately dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The next part of the Bill deals with the powers of borrowing at present enjoyed by CIE, and proposes to confer further powers on the board to borrow from the banks, and otherwise. It is a pretty alarming state of affairs to be told by the Minister in introducing this Bill that in 1961-62 the operating loss of the board jumped from, I think, £240,000 to £1,696,000. So far as the Minister can ascertain the loss was even greater in 1962-63.</P>
    <P>As I see it, that means that CIE are, apparently, to continue to be a substantial drain on public funds.  When it was decided to nationalise transport we were led to believe that the public would receive a cheaper and a better service.  We were also led to believe that transport employees would be happier under a national transport system than they had been.  I do not think either of those objectives has been achieved.  I do not think that in many parts of the country, at any rate, we have a better service, and we certainly have not got a cheaper service.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that management and employees have failed to regulate their business and their relations in such a way as to avoid disruption of public transport.  Before the board were formed there were some transport systems in the country which were giving complete satisfaction and paying their way.  I refer to the Dublin United Tramways and the Grand Canal Company.  If CIE are to continue to be heavily subsidised at public expense, there is a serious obligation on the Minister and the board on the one hand and on the employees on the other hand, to get together and agree <Col N="866" /> on some satisfactory machinery under which differences and disputes can be solved without causing untold hardship to the very people who are called upon to subsidise the undertaking, and pay the piper.</P>
    <P>The next matter dealt with in the Bill is redundancy and compensation for redundancy, and the time within which claims can be made or paid is being extended.  That is desirable, but something else strikes me about the question of redundancy.  Some serious effort should be made by the State to absorb redundant CIE employees in other State or semi-State employment. It is a fact that State and semi-State bodies are by far the greatest employers of labour in this country.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us when he is replying, if he can, how many redundant CIE men, aged about 40 years or thereabouts, we shall say, have been absorbed by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the ESB, and other such institutions.  I am afraid there is not much co-operation between the various Departments with a view to providing redundant employees with alternative employment.</P>
    <P>Perhaps if I gave the Minister a case without mentioning any names it might illustrate my point.  I know a man aged between 40 and 45 years who was employed by CIE for 16 years.  Before the little station at which he was employed was closed down this employee bought a small farm of land, about eight acres.  He bought it through a loan in the bank and improved the house but had not paid off the loan by the time that CIE closed down the station where he was employed.  His wife was rather delicate and he had a couple of children.  That man was offered alternative employment over 100 miles away, but were he to accept it he would have had to take digs 100 miles away and try to run his home where he had established it. He was reluctantly compelled to take the serious decision of resigning his post with CIE.  He had to do so without any compensation because he was offered alternative employment and all he got was a refund of his superannuation contributions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" /> Within a matter of months there was a vacancy in the very same little village for an auxiliary postman and this man applied for it.  It would have suited him down to the ground because the £5 or £6 he would have got for it per week, coupled with his little farm, would have enabled him to live on where he had made his home.  I know that the Minister for Transport and Power was written to with a view to making representations to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and he replied stating that this was something which constituted the day to day running of CIE and he had nothing to do with it.  Then the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was written to and the position pointed out to him and he was asked to do something about it.  I think he replied saying that he could not interfere in another Deputy's constituency. The long and the short of it was that this man who was rendered redundant in one type of semi-State employment by Government policy did not secure a suitable job in his immediate area in another State-sponsored undertaking.</P>
    <P>That is a deplorable state of affairs, and there should be co-operation between the Ministers.  The Government as a matter of policy should lay it down that if and when such a man became redundant due to Government policy he would be put first in the line for other Government employment. I do not want to introduce a controversial note, but this particular man had a wife and two children and the person who was given the position had not any family.  The reason was obvious.  Political influence was stronger in the case of the man who got the position than the unfortunate man who had been rendered redundant in CIE and left to fend for himself. That is bad.  It is something that the House should take note of and the country should know about.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make a speech at any length, but there is one little matter I should like the Minister to deal with in his reply.  The Minister states that one section of this Bill is necessary to amend the law because existing <Col N="868" /> legislation does not permit the disposal of tenanted premises on abandoned lines to tenants thereof by private treaty.  Surely that is not so?  If it is so, CIE must be acting <i>ultra vires</i> their powers.</P>

      <P>I would not have intervened in this debate were it not for the remarks made by Senator Murphy and a passing remark made by Senator Fitzpatrick.  Senator Murphy in the course of a mean and low attack, a left-handed attack be it said, repeated the canards and shibboleths and the things that have done duty for mean-minded people in this country for many years.  Senator Fitzpatrick also referred to political influence being stronger than the claims of the man with a wife and family.  It is time for public men to get away from that sort of thing.  It is time that public men should stop trying to do what the Communists do in every country where they seek to undermine the public administration&mdash;that is, to denigrate the Government and to bring the institutions of public utility into disrepute and break them up.</P>

      <P>It is time that that was stopped.  We have been listening to it since I came into the Seanad, time after time, about this alleged political influence exercised in every job and this alleged membership of Fianna Fáil which qualifies you for a job.  I am General Secretary of the Fianna Fáil Party and I should like very much to know where are these people in all those public bodies who would give anybody a job because he is a member of Fianna Fáil.  I have failed in my efforts in recommending people time after time.  I have failed to even get them called for interview. If anybody can tell me how that can be done because of the fact that he is a member of Fianna Fáil I will be very grateful.  These public boards which appoints appointments selection committees, these institutions like Aer Lingus, CIE and Bord na Móna, have got a selection machinery of their own. They take no notice whatever so far <Col N="869" /> as I can see of representations by public men.  They take no notice whatever of any letters.  Senator Murphy referred to letters sent by TDs and Senators apparently as if it were a crime that TDs and Senators should make representations about the character and ability of someone they know and can stand over.  There is no reason in the world why they, any more than any other citizen, should not give a reference just because they are public representatives.  It should not be made out here by Senator Murphy or anybody else that that is a crime to be ashamed of.  As I say, these public bodies have a system of selection of staffs of their own.  I have no knowledge whatever that anybody by using influence can get anybody into one of these institutions on a preferential basis.</P>
      <P>There is this to be said&mdash;if it happens that a member of a political party who has more brains than the other applicants, or more qualifications than them, is successful in securing a position it does not mean that because of the fact that he is a member of a political party or his father and mother were supporters of that party he should thereby be debarred from securing employment in his own country.  That is the meaning of what Senator Murphy in his mean attack here tonight intended to achieve.</P>

      <P>Senator Murphy also said that some of the management changes in CIE brought no solution to CIE's problems.  Let me bring him back to a few figures given by the Minister to us as to what the change of management did mean in regard to the operating losses of CIE.  The loss fell from £1,950,000 in 1958/59 to £709,000 in 1959/60 and £246,000 in 1960/61.  Senator Murphy is well aware of the reasons why there has been a hold-up in that progress in the past couple of years.  In 1961/62 the operating loss rose again to £1,696,000 and the 1962/63 loss, according to the Minister, is likely to be even greater. Senator Murphy again knows why.  He also sneered at what had been done <Col N="870" /> by the management in regard to industrial consultants and the fact that none of their so-called economies ever saw the light.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy surely must be in closer touch with what has happened in CIE than anybody else.  In my opinion he must have a secret service and I think it is a matter which should receive the attention of the Board of CIE.  If Senator Murphy is in a position by reason of the information received from his studies within the company and within Aer Lingus, and even in other bodies, to be able to come here and say that certain people got jobs, then Senator Murphy must be able to prove it, that he is not drawing on his imagination for political purposes.  I should like it to be noted that Senator Murphy must have an intelligence service that supplies him with this information. Otherwise, he would not make the sort of statements he made here tonight.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy in his back-handed attack on Dr. Andrews, has admitted that on Dr. Andrews taking over the Chairmanship of CIE the concern became a vital and a significant factor in Irish affairs.  Dr. Andrews, it should be remembered, is the man who was sent down to a virgin bogland many years ago, and through his efforts and through his genius and self-sacrificing ability, made that bogland into one of the most powerful and profitable industries we have today.  It was so developed under his able leadership and Bord na Móna was so developed that experts even from Eastern countries, where peat is highly developed, have come to Ireland to learn and the machinery developed by Bord na Móna has been copied by many countries which are far ahead of us in industrial technique.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every person of goodwill, who has no bias, will admit that when Dr. Andrews took over he made a revolutionary change in the concern immediately. I do not think it was fair or proper for Senator Murphy to make the insinuations he made or the attack he made on Dr. Andrews.  He spoke of Dr. Beeching.  It is interesting to know that years before him Dr. <Col N="871" /> Andrews was on the job and quite a number of machines and plant may be said to have been copied from that which Dr. Andrews has used in this country.</P>
    <P>It is all right now to think of the things which Senator Murphy said, but I would remind him that entrance to CIE for young people is by competitive examination and how can one use any political influence in competitive examinations?  I should like Senator Murphy, if he makes any further reference of that nature, to give us a little more information in regard to whom these people were, how they got the jobs, and what type and variety of influence was used.</P>
    <P>It is nice to know that, in spite of Senator Murphy's sneers, a new line will be laid to the Shamrock fertiliser factory.  CIE are experienced people to lay that line and just as the lines which they laid for Bord na Móna brought such tremendous prosperity to the bogland communities, so we hope that this line will bring equal prosperity and good luck to Wicklow and surrounding districts.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Minister's speech he says that the whole question of public transport is under review in preparation for the 31st March next when the provisions of the present Act come to an end.  There is one thing I hope the Minister and the Government will not consider and that is this foolish clamour which has arisen, not alone in Dublin but throughout the country, as a result of recent events, that the Government should do something to hand the Dublin transport back to private enterprise.  I hope no heed will be given to any suggestion of that nature no matter from what quarter it may come.  We notice also there is provision for the transfer of employees to Ostlanna Iompair Éireann.  In that connection I should like to pay tribute to Dr. Andrews for the way he revitalised the Great Southern Hotels which were taken over by CIE.  Anyone who had the opportunity of visiting these hotels, even before the establishment of this subsidiary, knows this, and foreign visitors to this country have testified that they are the finest <Col N="872" /> and most comfortable hotels in this or in any other country.  Due to the interest, ability and knowledge which Dr. Andrews brought to these hotels and the improvement of them, CIE have as fine a chain of hotels now as any country in the world.  I think this is a good Bill; it is a useful Bill and I hope the Seanad will not make undue delay in bringing it to a conclusion.</P>

      <P>I am sure Senator Ó Maoláin would be rightly indignant if his remarks were taken as meaning that he was implying that the previous Chairman of CIE was utterly incompetent and a failure.  I am sure nobody who knew the late Mr. T.C. Courtney would for one moment subscribe to that, and I do not think that Senator Ó Maoláin would wish to imply that.  Yet it is just as wrong to distort what Senator Murphy said into an attack on Dr. Andrews as it would be to distort what Senator Ó Maoláin has said into a disparagement of the late Mr. T.C. Courtney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come on to this Bill, I think those of us who have travelled with CIE for the past few years can certainly pay tribute to the efforts made.  We do notice the efforts made to brighten up, and superficially we see that an advance has been made.  It is the type of advance that railways are trying to make everywhere in competition with road transport in other countries, and with air transport as well.  The same problems face railways everywhere and, unfortunately, our problem here is complicated by the fact, as the Minister put it in a previous debate, that we have too many thousand miles of line per million inhabitants.  That is the wrong way to look at this.  What we should say is that we have far too few inhabitants per thousand miles of line. In other words, the real difficulty is the <Col N="873" /> sparseness of our population, which as we know is unique in Europe today. We should look at the railway transport in Holland.  In a country little over the size of Ireland they have 12 million people to draw on.  Their output is almost double ours.  Certainly if by any magic we could overnight increase our output by 50 per cent, that of itself would completely solve the difficulties of CIE.</P>
    <P>CIE need a great deal of sympathy and understanding in the problem they have on hands and if we wish to have a transport system available to all sections in the country and especially to those who have not got the luxury of motor cars, we must face up to the fact that CIE have to be maintained. Undoubtedly every effort must be made to get it as efficient as possible, but having reached that stage I do not see what is so immoral about an element of subsidy in running such a concern which is as much a national service as the Army or the Garda Síochána.  The magnitude of the subsidy&mdash;even if we take it on the Minister's figure that last year's loss on working account was nearly £2 million&mdash;is not too great.  It looks a big sum but in relation to the population it is 13/4d. per head.  We have trains and buses running far below capacity and one other short journey by each citizen in the country would last year have sufficed to right the balance. Looked at in that way, it is nothing to get alarmed about.</P>
    <P>We must, however, look at all these things realistically and we must beware of all the showmanship and flamboyancy surrounding the recent reorganisation of CIE.  By all means praise what has been done and give credit to the workers and management who are doing it, but let us recognise even at this late stage the disgusting flamboyancy of the past two or three years in trying to create the illusion that one single man has been able almost overnight to produce a million in CIE.  We read in the Minister's report today that the board's operating losses which were nearly £2 million in 1958-59 were £709,000 in 1959-60 and £246,000 in 1960-61.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of nonsense&mdash;I am <Col N="874" /> sorry to use the word but it has to be used&mdash;to which we are treated by the Minister and the public Press regarding CIE.  I have here a quotation I have kept since June, 1961.  It is by the political correspondent of the <i>Irish Times</i> and is headed: &ldquo;CIE Turning the Tables.&rdquo;  The miracle had happened: there was a credit balance of £1,576,000.  It goes on with the usual: &ldquo;The Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Childers, and the Minister for Finance must be wondering if the two Transport Acts of 1958 overestimated the requirements of CIE or underestimated the prowess of Dr. C.S. Andrews, the chairman of the Board.&rdquo;  It painted a picture of millions suddenly brought out of nothing.</P>
    <P>The real figures are available to anyone who would dig for the facts, to anyone who could adopt an intelligent approach to a balance sheet.  They could be dug out of a glossy report that conveyed the misleading picture in 1961 that there had been an improvement from a loss of £709,000 to £246,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disparaging the accounts but their misinterpretation to the general public. I am not impugning the auditors.  What has been done is perfectly legitimate but a saving of £463,000 is held up as a marvellous achievement by CIE when in fact it was not a saving in any real sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you look at the account you find that, due to the generosity of the Government, in the 1958 Act it provided £1,175,000 yearly to build up CIE so that it would be in a healthy position at the end of the five-year period and able to meet its capital requirements at the end of that period. This succeeded in changing the interest position for the board.  In 1960/61 the board collected an additional £80,000 in interest by investing the surplus they had from the Government. As well as that, by the Traffic Act itself they were relieved of the contribution <Col N="875" /> to the County Donegal Railway Association of £14,000 and the closing of the canal, a direct consequence of the Act, relieved them of £28,000 loss. Their fuel bill went down by £105,000 because the diesels were coming in. The taxpayer had subscribed very generously to provide them as being necessary for efficient and low-cost transport for the future and they showed up by reducing the fuel bill by £105,000.  As well as that, a new industry was developed&mdash;again a perfectly legitimate industry&mdash;of taking up tracks and the proceeds from taking up tracks were used to meet expenses that would have had to be met out of the current budget if these were not available.  As is shown in this Bill, out of a surplus on taking up tracks of £173,000 they spent £128,000 in special expenditure on the modernisation of works, rolling stock, stations, building and office equipment.  In other words, it was spent on work which CIE should do in any case and would have had to be footed out of the ordinary bill for the year if the other were not available. Then old rolling stock and engines were sold.</P>
    <P>On page 26 of the account under the heading &ldquo;Movement on Capital Reserve&rdquo; we find that they succeeded in making £232,000 on the disposal of surplus land and buildings and that £50,000 of that was taken over into capital expenditure on railway lines and works during the year, again a task that should not have been done if it were not necessary and if it were necessary would have had to be footed, if the other sum were not there, from actual current account.</P>
    <P>When these figures are added, a total of £393,000 is accounted for out of the £463,000 and that leaves us with just £70,000 for which I have not accounted so far, but if you go back you will find that in that year, 1960/61, CIE&mdash;again perfectly legitimately &mdash; changed the basis of their depreciation calculation. They decided that buses should be depreciated over 16 years instead of 15 and the life of a railway wagon was increased from 40 to 50 years.  The result of this perfectly legitimate decision of the board was that less money <Col N="876" /> was set aside for depreciation so some of that £70,000 would have been taken up in depreciation charges if depreciation charges in 1961 had been the same as they were in 1960.  My guess is that most of that £70,000 would have gone on that.</P>
    <P>We have also, of course, this problem of redundancy because, as well as saving on the roads, CIE were empowered to lay off any men they declared redundant.  Today the Minister gave some figures on that.  I think 1,500 more have so far been laid off and the cost this year will be a mere £400,000 to the taxpayer to meet redundancy claims.  Where, then, is the vaunted improvement hailed in the Press between the years 1960 and 1961? If you refer to the previous year when the really spectacular improvement was lauded&mdash;the drop was from £1,900,000 to £700,000&mdash;again, you will find that all the items were a direct consequence of the 1958 Transport Act or else of management decisions by CIE, perfectly legitimate in themselves, but it meant that less was set aside in one year than the other.  For instance, a number of lines were closed in 1960 compared with 1959 and the amount set aside for the maintenance of the lines was promptly reduced by that figure.  I think one-seventh of the railroad mileage was closed and the amount set aside was reduced by one-seventh.</P>
    <P>These are perfectly legitimate and there is nothing whatsoever against the auditor or anybody else for making those decisions.  They are perfectly legitimate but they are only juggling with book-keeping figures as far as providing any basis for substantiating the claims that CIE had worked wonders.  They had improved their position by one million one year and a half million the next year.  Now CIE begin to moan and groan because the workers read what was written in the papers and they believe that CIE were really making money fast.  Therefore, who would blame the workers demanding their increase?  The size of the increase and even a good deal of the eighth round increase due to that was directly caused by the unfounded claims about the improvement in the <Col N="877" /> position of CIE.  In fact, if the Minister had only in the 1958 Traffic Act given them another half million a year the interest on that would have meant they might have broken even in 1961.  It is just as simple as that to do it.</P>
    <P>I am emphasising that CIE did make a real contribution in holding the line firm and in holding their position in the competitive transport position in the country.  That was a big thing to do.  Let us give the management credit for it, but let us, please, divorce the management from the ballyhoo that went with it.  I am also glad to see that the ballyhoo of the 1961 report with its pictures, glossy covers and all the rest of it, was not repeated in the 1962 report which was a more modest production and less costly, though, in point of fact, neither of the reports carry as much information as the much despised little green book issued by CIE prior to 1958.  You will find in this book, on ordinary paper, in the first 15 pages of it, a full explanation of the various movements and the various figures contained in it.  I am sorry to say that most of that information is not available in the subsequent books.  In the subsequent books not even the number of employees in CIE is available.  In other words, the books do not give the picture showing the numbers that have been let go through redundancy in the year in question.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is seeking economies he should suggest to CIE that they get back to the little green book with the ordinary paper; give us the facts in that and save the cost between that and the art covered model that they and all other semi-State companies are producing for our enlightenment, or is it bafflement, at present.  The only real figure you can come up with, looking at the position of CIE, is, after all, the total number of people carried or the number of passenger miles and the total amount of freight carried on the roads.  That is the hard reality.  You will find there that, while there was a certain improvement in freight between 1960 and 1961, the overall freight carried increased by about 14 per cent. But then in that year there was at <Col N="878" /> least 14 per cent or slightly more freight available because our exports had gone up, I think, that year by almost 20 per cent, so that was the measure of the freight available.  The proper interpretation of the increase shown by CIE is simply that they got their own share of the increase that was going around&mdash;no more, no less. Again, I say that may be something to congratulate them on but yet it just meant they were holding their position.</P>
    <P>There has been this transfer which is becoming slightly marked from road to rail freight.  In the figures on this we should realise that at present the railroads carry something like 2,000,000 tons as against something like only about one-twelfth of that carried on the roads.  In other words, the bulk of our freight is still carried very much on the railroad and long may that last.  I had an experience coming up today&mdash;probably many of you encounter it driving up with all the big lorries on the road, a menace to themselves and to everybody else: I was between two big lorries&mdash;I would estimate they were 20 ton lorries&mdash;and I found we were actually doing 70 on the road leading into Portlaoise. Surely it should not be beyond the power of modern transport authorities to get those lorries back on the railroads? I cannot see why heavily laden lorries must go all the way from Cork to Dublin or even further when there is a perfectly good railroad available. The difficulty is that we have not a quick enough change-about, something like the American piggyback system by which you can almost drive the lorry on to the railroad wagon and let it go on from that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, it is.  In any case, that is the position.  I came across one really amazing statistic and one that speaks very highly, indeed, for management.  Between 1959 and 1961 there was a considerable amount of traffic diverted from the railroad to the roads, as we all know.  You had the branch lines closed in West Cork and <Col N="879" /> elsewhere and CIE in that year increased their road fleet by 20 per cent as shown in their report.  The amount of tax paid&mdash;the total tax and the licences for the upkeep of the roads&mdash; in 1959 was £263,000 and in 1962 it was £273,000.  The contribution to the upkeep of the roads increased only 3 per cent as against an increase in vehicles of 20 per cent.  That is very good business, undoubtedly, for CIE but it is not so good for the nation. Somebody had to pay for the cost of these roads.  I think the dearest economy that was ever made in CIE was the closing down of the whole 70 miles of the West Cork railroad.  It was supposed, at that stage, to be losing £70,000 a year.  I wonder how much had to be spent on the road since then due to the traffic diverted on to it?  Certainly, the extra £10,000 a year paid by CIE between 1959 and 1962 to the Road Fund will not go far in repairing the damage done to the roads by those heavy trucks, especially the beet lorries that have, during the past winter, proved a menace in Cork City. The traffic in the next couple of years will be in a chaotic condition due to the presence of those lorries tying up the traffic of the city.  There is no reason whatsoever why that traffic could not have been on the railroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we should look to the future. We should get away from this nonsense that a body can be made to pay its way simply by an Act of Parliament.  If that were the case we would be living in Paradise altogether. Why not, if it worked for CIE, legislate for every other body in the country that has got any kind of subsidy? On every occasion on which I have spoken on this subject I have condemned it as being mere nonsense. I have hope for this country as I trust we all have and I look forward to a great expansion not alone in output but in population in the near future.  In fact, because of the way Europe is coming together, we cannot stay in possession of what is regarded as a luxury in Europe&mdash;unpopulated space.  Whether we like it or not, within the next 20 or 30 years we are bound to have a big influx of population, and <Col N="880" /> then we shall need the railroads we are scrapping today.</P>
    <P>It is a very shortsighted policy, too, if, in the future, as has been proposed, we will have the scrapping of so many other stations and branch lines.  That is a defeatist policy; it is only a scapegoat policy.  We are made to feel, and the taxpayer is led to believe, that because stations are being closed down &mdash;all in the name of efficiency&mdash;something will happen.  In point of fact, if we are losing £2 million a year, how can you possibly segregate the line that is economic and the line that is not? All lines are uneconomic by that yardstick.</P>
    <P>Some rather weird notions of distribution exist.  For instance, you have a spur of 10 miles of railroad and on that spur, say, £100,000 worth of traffic originates in a year.  That is being carried to Mallow and elsewhere.  Suppose the average haul for the products originating on that line is 50 miles, then the mathematics of the thing state. All those goods are going 50 miles. Therefore, you cannot credit the whole £100,000 to this spur, you can only credit in the proportion of 10 miles to 50.  In other words, you reduce the £100,000 by the factor 5 and you say that effectively only £20,000 worth of traffic is originating on that spur.  You can prove anything with figures.  I think the vital thing for us is, even if it may be unprofitable in certain cases, to have a continuous service on some lines.  In fact, it may even be desirable to shut them down for a certain time.</P>
    <P>Surely, to go to the other extreme of making it impossible to re-open them should happier times and greater production prevail is really wrong, especially having regard to the amount that can be gained by the sale of rails and all the rest.  Why not leave them there either for seasonal traffic or for happier times in the future and for the time when some real railroad genius will arrive who will be able to shuttle lorries or their contents on and off the railroad economically even over distances as short as 30 or 40 miles? When that day comes we shall look forward to getting those hideous monsters of lorries off the roads and thereby contribute both to the enjoyment of <Col N="881" /> driving on the roads and cutting down the upkeep costs, I would appeal to the Minister not for one moment to entertain the idea of any further truncation of the railroads.</P>
    <P>Finally, it seems to me that the amount involved, as I have said, is relatively small, provided we feel that there is efficient operation.  At most it is £2 million.  What is it?  Twopence on the packet of cigarettes.  Let us look at it in another way.  It is just one additional journey of about 25 miles by every citizen in the country. If the citizens of the country choose to use their private transport it is not asking very much to have them contribute another 13/4 to the railroad, or the £2 million could be raised by putting a long overdue tax on the dancehalls of this country.  When you read of the poverty and then read of the 300 dancehalls in County Mayo, you wonder what kind of a world we are living in at all.  You see the Minister for Finance, for the second year running, closing his eyes completely to the position of these dancehalls and the money floating round them just for the taking.  That money should be used for CIE as well as for any other laudable interest in this country.  It is something that everybody would welcome.</P>
    <P>I must say in conclusion that I was as baffled as some of the other Senators by the Bill as it stood.  I regret very much that there was not a White Paper to accompany it.  For the life of me I could not see why the first half of the Bill was devoted to extending railroads. A few short memoranda would have made the position quite clear&mdash;that it just referred to this one position.  We are asked to subscribe to an increase in capital for CIE.  If adequate or modern standards for depreciation had been set aside in previous years that should have met the capitalisation job.  In fact, the capital we are asked for is largely a measure of the failure of the company&mdash;through economic necessity, no doubt&mdash;to set aside money for depreciation and for renewal.  What has been set aside has not been adequate in the modern sense.  Therefore, we should not indulge in any more day dreaming. We should try to look at the accounts <Col N="882" /> critically.  It is not possible for a single man in any one industry to do a conjuring trick and produce millions.  CIE are to be congratulated on holding the line steady.</P>
    <P>I endorse Senator Murphy's view about joint consultations.  We pride ourselves on our Christian principles and surely a sharing and pooling of ideas in joint consultation for the welfare of all is at the root of Christian principles?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>The implications of Section 13 have been touched on by several Senators already, and what Senator Murphy said was very much to the point.  I know the Minister said in his opening remarks that if possible he would never go to the taxpayers for a subsidy for CIE if a competent service could be maintained in any other way. Like Senator Murphy, I think the time has come for a re-examination of the position as to whether we can run an adequate transport system without some sort of subsidy.  To my mind Section 13 is the first step in that direction. Whether we like to accept it or not, I think that is so.</P>
      <P>Practically everyone in the country was very anxious to support the idea put forward in 1958 that CIE should be able to break even and be an economic concern in a certain number of years.  Almost everyone hoped they would not need much assistance by way of revenue from the State.  Perhaps adequate time was not given for a real examination and a complete reorganisation. A great deal of thought was needed in regard to closing lines and reorganising the services.  Perhaps five years was not adequate, when we consider that possibly the roads are not sufficiently good to take the traffic that has been put on them, and that might mean a greater deterioration in vehicles.  That would be important to a company like CIE with a vast number of vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way the company can pay their way and increase their revenue is by increasing the fares and increasing the cost of transport.  As regards passenger fares, I think we have probably gone to the limit if not beyond it.  I would like to think that over a <Col N="883" /> long-term period they would be reduced. If they are increased it is the poorer sections of the people who have to pay them, and that is my whole objection to the idea of an increase in fares.  Usually the poorer sections have no private transport of their own.  I know an instance of a line that was closed and when a bus took its place the fares were doubled within a month, and they have been increased since. I agree that wages have also increased. Usually the people who have to pay these fares are the people who have to get some assistance from the State.</P>
    <P>I agree that the idea of CIE being able to break even by next year was good.  Perhaps another five-year plan or something like that should be introduced. I for one am prepared to admit&mdash;perhaps the Minister is not, but the vast majority of the people are&mdash;that we cannot hope to have a reasonably cheap transport service here because if it gets completely beyond the capacity of the businessman to use it for his goods, the alternative is that he must buy his own lorry.</P>
    <P>I am rather worried about subsection (5) of Section 13 which reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance may, for the purpose of providing for the advance of sums out of the Central Fund under this section, borrow on the security of the Central Fund...</P>
    <P>I feel that this should not be a question of borrowing.  Sooner or later we must realise that it will have to come out of revenue, and accept it as a substantial capital investment.  I am not satisfied that the Minister for Finance should consider it as a capital sum if it is to be repeated in a year or two.  We will have to subsidise our transport system and, as Senator Murphy said, we need not be ashamed of that.  That is a problem in most countries in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for congratulation that in a country which was criticised on a number of occasions for having aped other countries in the methods which we adopted, the work that has been carried <Col N="884" /> out quite recently by CIE, under the chairmanship of Dr. Andrews, is now to be the pattern of future railway systems in Great Britain.  We have not made enough capital out of that matter.  If the thing were reversed we would have heard a lot about it. It is a grand thing in this day and age to say that we lead and others follow.</P>
      <P>CIE have been the butt of criticism over a long number of years, and the people who have been most critical of them, as in so many other matters, are the people who have made very little use of it.  We must face the position that if railway lines have closed it has not been entirely the fault of either the Government or CIE.  It must be the fault primarily of the people themselves because they have failed to use the railways either for passenger traffic or for the transport of goods.  We had a railway system in my area and fought very hard to retain it, but when we did so the arguments were all against us.  Figures were produced showing the amount of transport of passengers and goods by private hauliers and other means.  The same thing might arise in the future in regard to our road transport.  Each of us is fully aware of the fact that people are more anxious to obtain free transport than to pay for it.  We have discovered that even where buses are operating on the roads they usually wait until the bus has gone and then stand on the corner to get a lift.  That is the experience of the majority of us in this House.  If that position continues to exist, CIE will find it impossible, even in the case of road transport, to maintain the buses on these scheduled routes that they have at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the opposite view to Senator Cole in relation to affairs, especially in regard to road traffic.  If the same dynamic approach were adopted in the case of the road passenger service as in the railways and we had reduced fares on buses and return fares on our long distance buses, especially to seaside resorts in the summer, many more people would avail of them.  In my own area three services are operating to the seaside.  Of the three, CIE are public and the others are private.  CIE <Col N="885" /> are the dearest of the three.  Naturally, people wait for the other buses on the particular Sunday they are travelling to get the cheaper fare and return fares to the seaside.  When they weigh up the charges for a group of people travelling they often discover that they would be just as well to employ a car and have a full day as to travel by CIE and pay the fare down and back.</P>
    <P>I should like to take the opportunity of paying tribute to the staff of CIE locally and at headquarters for their courtesy and efficiency.  They are doing a very good job of work and have been most helpful and approachable.  Very often people should get credit for what they do but sometimes do not get it. We in public life know ourselves that we are always reminded of the things we do not do but we are seldom reminded of the things we have done. The same thing applies to CIE.</P>
    <P>I do not see any mention of this matter in the Bill, but I should like to make an appeal to the Minister in relation to the inland waterways.  CIE had certain responsibilities in regard to the waterways.  They have abandoned that right.  In view of the tourist potential that is now in the Shannon and the waters connected with it, I would appeal to the Minister that at some future date, possibly in the very near future, he would relieve CIE of the responsibility for the waterways and give them to some other body such as the voluntary body, the Inland Waterway Association, solely or in conjunction with Bord Fáilte in view of the fact that there is a big potential in the matter.</P>
    <P>Having thrown some bouquets, I have one criticism, probably on the lines of Senator Quinlan, in relation to the accounts.  I had to make an application to CIE last year to give me some information on the cost of maintenance and the revenues they had on some of their waters.  The reply I received was as follows: &ldquo;I am directed to say that your request for information regarding the matters set out in your letter has been considered. The Board feels it cannot hold itself open to furnish information of the nature you have requested.  You will <Col N="886" /> appreciate that to do so would create a precedent and expose the Board to unlimited demands for information concerning the compilation of the accounts published in its annual reports.  I am further to say that the Board asks you to accept that it does not wish to be discourteous in withholding the information.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I feel as a public representative that as they are being paid out of funds which had been provided by the public I was entitled to the information I sought.  I believe that in a future Transport Bill provision should be made whereby if information is sought about the accounts of the company it should be made available at least to the elected representatives of the people.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House, but I would appeal very earnestly to the Minister in relation to the inland waterways.  I understand that it is his intention, I hope in the very near future, to receive members of the Council of the Inland Waterways Association with a view to discussing the whole future of inland waterways in relation to tourism in particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not keep the House very long but there are a few observations that I should like to make. I think that the Government have a duty to ascertain by every means in their power what is the most efficient and effective public transport system that can be maintained in the country. In the light of experience we may have been over optimistic in 1958 when we set a target of five or six years within which CIE should break even.  I have a great deal of sympathy with that even though I feel that eventually that aim will not be possible and we will not be able to realise it.  At the same time, I do not think that that should prevent us from doing everything possible to see if it is attainable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not quite follow the arguments of Senator Quinlan when he suggests that a greater population would help to solve the problem.  They seem to have a similar problem across the water, where the population is not the cause of the problem and it has <Col N="887" /> not done anything to ease the situation over there.</P>
    <P>There is a natural resentment, which I can quite understand as I travel a lot myself, against the heavy lorries and trailers on the road.  Even though I swear under my breath at times, I cannot help reminding myself that it is quite possible that the drivers of those heavy trailers have reason to swear at the private motorist too.  I wonder which of us has more right to use the roads.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should leave ourselves under the impression that the sooner the goods traffic is driven back to the railway the better, because modern conditions in many countries have turned heavy traffic on to the roads and it may be that that will have to be the solution of our problem.</P>
    <P>One remark was made which struck me very forcibly about the number of dancehalls in County Mayo.  The figure of 300 dancehalls was given. When I read that first, having been in the Dáil for a certain period of probation and listened to members saying that there was no population left in that part of the country, I could not understand the influx of dancers into the county or whether they did not take in their own dancehalls with them. It is a most amazing figure if it is true. I am sure that the Leas-Chathaoirleach could enlighten us about that better than the newspapers.</P>
    <P>There is another point upon which I should like the Minister to reply.  We hear many criticisms about CIE, as we do about all such bodies, and I suppose it is quite natural.  I should like to know have the employees of CIE any advantages now <i>vis-à-vis</i> their position before the 1958 Act in the way of security or better employment or anything of that kind.  If they have, these things should be made known to us so that if there were better employment and a better opening for young people they should think of it in making up their minds for the future. I should like the Minister to answer that question if he can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear for some time that the decision that CIE <Col N="888" /> should more or less break even in 1964 was not correct.  That appeared to be the view some years ago, that, by 1964, CIE should break even.  It is obvious to anybody who has studied transport, not alone in this country, but in most continental countries, that transport, and particularly railway transport, is not breaking even.  There is today a definite tendency to transfer to road transport, the volume of which is growing each year.  The number of vehicles on the road is increasing and that is bound to lead to less traffic on the rails.  That is the tendency in different countries&mdash;and it is the position in this country, with its small population&mdash;and it is bound to affect, as it is affecting, rail transport.  Then we say to CIE, as against any other industry: &ldquo;You are expected to break even in or about the spring of 1964,&rdquo; which of course just cannot happen. We were told last year that the 1961 figures appeared to suggest an improvement to such an extent that it was more than likely that position would be reached and then reasons were given to explain why the next report was not just so good&mdash;costings were increased and so on.  That happened in all industries and there are other industries in this country which are vital to our economy and it is considered good policy to subsidise them.  Generally the volume of employment in CIE is big and any money we devote by way of subsidisation is kept within the country.  That is good policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point is that today when there are problems to be examined, the workers in an industry are regarded as a very important unit and are taken into consultation.  I should like the Minister to tell us to what extent that is practised in CIE.  I do not think we have works councils where the workers in the particular departments of CIE are taken into consultation and their advice on problems sought, on the basis of their knowledge of how the different departments function.  Rather does it appear to be the policy that it is a matter for the board's decision. Undoubtedly we must have management at a particular level and somebody has to make decisions, but it is <Col N="889" /> accepted, and not alone accepted but advocated by all responsible organisations from the Government down, that it is important to have consultations so that difficulties may be got over.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to hear the Minister on the continual closing down of railways, first of all, and then the gradual taking up of the rails.  I think that should be examined with care because railways are a very important element in the economy.  No doubt road transport is very efficient, very quick and very convenient, but railways are capable of handling traffic of all kinds and the Minister should be slow to agree that if eventually a branch or part of a branch line has to be closed, the next action should be to remove the rails.  Why not try to maintain the rails even if it costs the taxpayers more?  After all, if the taxpayer decides to use road transport as against the railways, how far does he object to taxes for maintaining the railways?  We should be slow to dispose of the railways.  No matter how heavy the traffic, they can take it.  Our roads are probably already finding it difficult to take a good deal of the heavy traffic being thrown on them, even though it is perhaps a more convenient form of transport.  We probably pay indirect taxes towards the maintenance of the roads by way of the taxes on vehicles.  Nobody appears to mind that, but if you pay it into a fund from which a subsidy is paid to maintain the railways everybody appears to become worried.</P>
    <P>That is worthy of some examination. I do not agree that we should just close down the railways because there is no traffic for them.  If we have come to the point of having to close them then we should see to what extent we can preserve them even when closed down, lest we should require them in future.  It can be argued that the maintenance of a railway with no traffic on it is a costly business, but we might be glad, as we were before, to have them.  I should like to hear the Minister on those points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank <Col N="890" /> a number of the members of the House for their constructive criticism of the Bill.  I think, first of all, I had better begin by pointing out simply in connection with the operation of CIE in all their phases that consultation between the management and trade unions has been perpetual.  I mean that&mdash;perpetual and never ending.  I do not think I need say anything more about that at the present time.  It is all that needs to be said.</P>
      <P>I think Senator Ó Maoláin has dealt very well with the remarks of Senator Murphy, the suggestion that in a competitive system of appointment in CIE, there has been the implication of a great deal of Fianna Fáil patronage. I should just like to say again what I said before, that that is absolute and clotted nonsense.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy suggested that I talked of the staff as though they were parasites.  I cannot see what he meant by that.  The staff who became eventually redundant in CIE gave very loyal and long service to CIE.  I do not know how they could be called parasites.  They worked in an organisation which was the victim of an outmoded concept of transport.  They worked long and faithfully for an organisation that were in a legal straitjacket and where all the laws governing their operation presumed that the only competitor of the railway was the horse and the feet of human beings. That is not the fault of the staff and managements varied from time to time in their competence and excellence.</P>
      <P>I do not believe in holding inquests on the past performance of the various staffs that conducted the affairs of the Great Southern Railways and then CIE.  I have never thought of the staff as parasites.  As I have said, they were living in a world in which CIE were supposed to avail of regulations relating to the 19th century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were also various observations on the possible viability of the railway in all the circumstances relating to its profits and losses in various services. Its viability depends on the comparative costs of transport by CIE and private transport; that depends on the efficiency and productivity of the <Col N="891" /> whole concern and on the volume of business that can be done per vehicle and the consequent economic character of the service.  In addition to doing business on an organised basis in package deals or on contracts established with various concerns, they have also to supply a fairly widespread regular service by rail and road where perhaps traffic may be very thin.  This is part of their obligation as a public carrier and that adds naturally to the cost.  Part of the trouble is that the labour cost on the railway service per ton-mile in the case of goods or per passenger-mile in the case of passenger services is two or three times higher than in any other country in Europe. The population of this country is very light per acre.  The people live in a more scattered manner than in any other country in Europe, except Sweden.  The proportion of people who live in hamlets, villages or towns compares very unfavourably with proportions in other countries such as France where the population concentrates at least in hamlets and villages. All that adds to the cost of public transport and makes it more uneconomic.</P>
    <P>I still hold to my opinion that the future of the railways lies in becoming one fast conveyor belt for passengers and goods.  I agree with Dr. Beeching on that subject and with all the other experts who have deliberated upon it. At conferences which have taken place of the International Railway Association&mdash;the conference was held in Munich last year&mdash;it is granted by the international experts of the world who dedicate themselves to the existence of railways, who have vested interests in the preservation of railways, that more and more it must be realised that railways in the modern world are unlikely to pay or give a real service to the community unless they become a vast conveyor belt carrying goods and passengers at high speed and at highly frequent intervals.  That is the general understanding of what the function of a railway should be&mdash; of course with some exceptions like main lines where it is necessary on certain occasions to continue a main <Col N="892" /> line at least to one focal point in a widely scattered area.  You may make exceptions to this statement and it still holds good.</P>
    <P>In this country, the rate at which private cars are growing in number means that unless the railway can speed up its services&mdash;as it has been doing by the closing of services&mdash;it will be extremely hard to compete with private transport in any distance under 100 or 120 miles.  Senators may note the gradual construction of magnificent arterial roads from all centres to Dublin and they may note the competition this will bring with the railway services.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy referred to matters of importance to the staff of CIE.  I want to deal with these matters so that there will be no misunderstanding. Compensation for redundancy occurring only after the 31st March, 1964, will have to be dealt with in new legislation covering public transport policy generally after that date.  The date of the introduction of new legislation cannot yet be given, but, as Senator Murphy knows, we have now extended&mdash;or rather, when this Bill passes the Oireachtas, we will extend &mdash;the period for the payment of redundancy compensation and I do not think the trade unions representing the men in CIE need have any doubt about the position, any fear that during this transitional period, CIE might suddenly engage in a new productivity measure whereby the men themselves might suffer any uncertainty as to their future position.  All that will be regulated in such a way that there will be no uncertainty as far as the men are concerned until the final step is taken; the men, therefore, will either receive compensation as a result of the passing of this Bill or new legislation will be passed so that they will be certain of the results of any change.</P>

That there should be uncertainty that people might be removed from offices in which they had served for years is inconceivable.</P>

      <P>It is very necessary. If the Minister will pardon my interrupting him, the trade unions may behave this way: &ldquo;Right.  We finish. No more co-operation in any increased productivity because we do not know what the position is going to be after 31st March, 1964.&rdquo;  They might be able to bring pressure on CIE and pressure on the Minister that way, but surely in this day and age, it would be more logical that the Minister should tell us as soon as possible what the position is.</P>

      <P>Senator Murphy spoke of redundant men who are still employed.  I do not know of any such men.  I know of certain people for whom a very high level of compensation would be necessary, who would like to retire on compensation rates but who, in fact, I understand, will continue until the pensionable age.  But, I have not been told, nor have I knowledge of any noticeable number of people who have not yet been informed of what the ultimate decision is to be or who have not yet been asked to leave and be put on compensation rates.</P>

      <P>Of course, it is very difficult to give those figures because there are a very large number of temporary people employed from one period to another.  I have one figure here.  The staff employed on 31st March, 1959 was 21,600.  It is estimated that by 1964 the staff employed will be 20,459.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the figure now.  On 3rd March, 1963 it was 20,759.</P>
      <P>Again, Senator Cole and other Senators referred to that part of the Bill which deals with temporary loans secured by the Minister for Finance. I should make it clear that this is a purely temporary measure for borrowing and I agree with the Senators who said it should set no precedent in regard to dealing with deficits.  In other words, it would be frightful to contemplate a position wherein this particular section of the Bill set a precedent for a new system of assisting CIE in which we would give loans to be vaguely paid back or not paid back each year in order to help them along.  I agree with the Senators in regard to that and this does not set any precedent in that regard.  It is not intended to have any relationship at all to any future decisions to be made in regard to the financing of CIE and to how it should progress.</P>
      <P>I should say in regard to the new legislation to be devised after March, 1964, whatever form it will take, I am perfectly certain it will be legislation which will stimulate and induce efficiency in CIE.  It would never go back to a system by which deficits were made good by advances of one kind or another or in a manner which would encourage a carelessness of attitude towards the receipts that could be obtained from the public purse. Some Senators referred to the fact that railways abroad lose money.  It is true a good number of them do lose money but there are quite a number in Europe where, if you subtract the exceptional losses in pensions provided as a result of not only one but two world wars, they would actually be paying their way and there are at least two European railroads which fully pay their way and in some cases have not got the assistance of a road service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Murphy referred to the Swedish railways.  They actually paid their way until 1958 and then their <Col N="896" /> costs increased and with private motor traffic increasing, they began to lose money and they have been closing a considerable number of lines, even though they are keeping others open. In the case of the Netherlands railways, they closed after the war one-third of the system and 67 per cent of the stations.  That is an illustration of the drastic change that can be undertaken in order to make a railway pay its way and work economically and efficiently.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy referred to Section 21.  This will apply only to men who become redundant after the passing of this Act and it is not retrospective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what it means anyway.  If the Senator has any doubts, he can deal with it on Committee Stage.  I am completely baffled by Senator Quinlan.  I do not know how to answer him.  He loves to pick and choose statistics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say one thing, arising out of what the Senator said.  I will tell the House that the sale of rails by CIE is not taken into account in declaring the profit for the year.  I did not understand that particular argument he made.  He does give the general impression&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is it is not taken into account in the figure arrived at but it was taken into account in paying for certain modernisations of track and of others.  My contention was that these things should not have been done, unless they were necessary, and if they were necessary, then they would have to be done and would have to be paid for out of the regular budget if this windfall of the rails were not there to meet it.</P>

      <P>In reply to the Senator, this was in connection with the capital account, not the current account of CIE.  You cannot transfer one item from one account to another and juggle them around.  Senator Quinlan's speech was a little bit different from the one he made on the last occasion.  On the last occasion, he did seem to me to question the honesty of the auditors of CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>On this occasion, he did not; he said they were perfectly all right.  At the same time, he gave the impression that you could prove anything with figures in a set of accounts of a State company such as CIE.  I cannot follow him down that track at all but I will say this, that I cannot understand what he said when he tried to disparage the work of the Board of CIE in reducing the losses of CIE.  If they had not taken all the decisions they took, if they had not been aided by a Government subsidy, if they had not been provided with Government capital, if they had not been enabled to dispense with staff who had become redundant, they could not have done the work they undertook. But, nevertheless, the fact remains that their managerial decisions have been significant and important in the progress of CIE.</P>
      <P>There has been a very considerable increase in the volume of road freight carried by CIE, a small increase in the volume of rail freight, a certain extra number of road passengers have been carried, more coach tours have been inaugurated and then there has been a whole series of changes in relation to the movement of goods through the provision of containers and a reorganisation of that movement of goods, a reduction in the cost of handling of goods, the mechanisation of track maintenance and a whole collection of other matters in relation to the productivity, all of which have been significant in reducing the loss of CIE.  The decisions to close the branch lines were based on the most elaborate calculations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say to Senator Quinlan that <Col N="898" /> it is possible under modern conditions to work out the receipts and the expenditure applying to a spur line and in the case of CIE, they could very well ascertain on a proper basis the receipts, about 98 per cent of the receipts, when they only attempted to allocate about 74 or 75 per cent of the expenses because of the difficulty in distributing certain overhead charges, for which the whole of CIE is responsible, to a particular spur line.  The whole work they have undertaken in order to make quite sure that they were not closing a line that could become economic was the result of the most careful study and co-operation with consultants and again resulted in a number of branch lines being closed and considerable financial betterment being secured as a result.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether at this stage I need to go over all the arguments in relation to the closing of branch lines.  Not many Senators mentioned this subject but I think I may say this: when Senator Quinlan gaily talks about subsidising transport through charging pennies on cigarettes, there is a distinction between subsidies for such things as milk and bacon, where the farmers' profits are permanently constricted by trade relationships which have some dependence on another country's trade policy, and a subsidy for transport.  When the amplitude of private transport becomes ever and ever greater every year in this and, indeed, in every other country, and when, therefore, subsidies become all the less necessary, we ought to try to avoid them if we possibly can and have them reduced to the lowest possible level, consistent with being able to have a good service.</P>
    <P>About 1970, at the 1951-1961 rate of increase in the number of private cars, there will be one private car to every ten of the population in the country and one to every four in Dublin.  There is nothing we can do about it.  I can assure the House that the maintenance of a branch line will not prevent a decision by the people of this country that private transport is one of the most important factors in their lives.  One of the most significant <Col N="899" /> facts is that for a number of years the number of private cars, in relation to the national income of this country, has been the highest in Europe with France.  In other words, although our national income per head is, as I might say, at a medium level in Europe &mdash;about tenth out of the total number of countries in Europe&mdash;the decision made by the people of this country to have private cars indicates that it is very much a first charge on their income.  That is caused by the scattered nature of the countryside and the fact that the vast majority of the people live in scattered areas and not in villages or small towns.  Then, again, may I assure the House that CIE are not going to clutter up the roads by closing a few private lines.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan gave the figures for the increase in the number of lorries operated by CIE and quoted from a certain year.  He did suggest, I thought &mdash;I may have misunderstood him&mdash; that the considerable increase in the number of new lorries bought by CIE &mdash;vehicles of various kinds&mdash;had some relation to the closing of branch lines whereas, of course, they had relation to the fact that new traffic was being secured by CIE, not only because branch lines were closing but because of the package deal business.</P>
    <P>In order to allay the fears of Senators, CIE are placing a huge amount of transport on roads which were already supposed to be overburdened with heavy lorries.  I thought I would mention this.  On the 12th April, CIE published notices intimating the withdrawal of railway services from 56 stations in the Midlands and West of Ireland.  To provide the substitute service CIE will require two lorries with their appropriate containers and trailers for full-time use and upwards of eight extra lorries to cope with seasonal traffic, for example, beet.  Nobody is going to suggest that that brings a tremendous burden of transport to bear on the roads either to the disadvantage of the ratepayers or to the discomfiture of the motorists.</P>
    <P>We shall deal next with the buses. The total number of buses required for the closings which commenced in <Col N="900" /> autumn 1962 and for which the statutory notices have been published, is ten single-deck buses and two double-deck buses, that is to say, for the Wexford area, the Midland areas, the Cobh-Youghal area and all the Midland stations.  That is being found in the case of nearly all these closings of stations or railway lines.  The Senators who have fears on this subject can be assured that there is not an exact comparison with Great Britain, where the British people seem to be reluctant to use railway trains, even in some quite congested areas&mdash;congested by our standards.  These closings have been taking place in areas where, even if the population increased by 50 per cent in the next twenty years, there could be no real congestion through the closing of the lines, which were really in the nature of a road over which a few bus loads of passengers were taken in the day.  That is not my definition or anybody's definition of what a rail service should be.</P>
    <P>In connection with the stations, the closing of which has been announced, the number of people joining the train per day at these various stations and the number alighting per day varies between three and five.  It is impossible to maintain a railway service on a reasonably economic basis when you have that kind of usage of the service. It is far more suitable to have the bus services in these circumstances, in my view.</P>
    <P>Senators referred to the fact that every effort should be made to make use of the railways and to keep fares down.  CIE have a number of cheap fare arrangements.  I hope they will experiment with others in order to ensure that as much use is made of the railway services as possible.  When it comes to the movement of goods, as the House already knows, there are a great many classifications of goods which, in the quantities they are sent normally, simply cannot bear any longer two handlings.  That is one of the difficulties faced by all the railroads everywhere no matter what decision can be made.  Only at the expense of an enormous subsidy by the taxpayer for railway services can rates be such that the goods will bear the double <Col N="901" /> handling involved.  That has been found to be the case everywhere.  I see no reason to believe there could be any change here in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney asked for information about the canals.  The canals which are now used for navigation cannot be closed until three years after their navigation has ceased unless by a special Act of the Dáil.  All that matter will be examined in connection with the new legislation and every effort will be made to examine what is the tourist potential for traffic along the canal and the matter will be fully dealt with, I think, in an intelligent way. We shall have the help of Bord Fáilte to advise us in regard to the tourist potential both for our own people and for tourists coming from abroad.</P>
    <P>Senator Cole referred to the increases that have taken place in freight rates and in fares.  I did indicate that CIE were only able to cover half the recent wage increases by the increase in rates.  They have not passed the whole of their increased charges on to the public.  I think they have done everything they can to keep down freight rates by making package deals. They have undertaken various experiments in cheaper rail fares.  I certainly encourage them myself to make experiments with cheap fares as far as possible.  This is also operated with regard to school children on the buses and it has been very much appreciated.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney asked a question about the refusal of CIE to present him with some sectional accounts. That is a difficult question.  It is quite impossible to imagine that any person in the House, a member of the Dáil or Seanad, or members of local authorities, could ask any State company to break up its accounts into sections and provide information in regard to some particular phase of its activities.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for allowing State companies to undertake their day-to-day activities free from either my interference or interference by the Dáil, is that once it became possible to ask for detailed information in regard to particular sections of activity, speaking either of functional <Col N="902" /> or geographical sections, a tremendous amount of pressure would be exercised by the public who, using the information, would say to the State company: &ldquo;Why not give a better service here or a better service there? Why should it cost more to provide a service in area A than in area B?&rdquo; It would create absolute chaos and prevent the efficient operation of the company.</P>
    <P>I think that both capitalists&mdash;if there are any true capitalists left in the world&mdash;and socialists agree that when State companies operate in that way, it is impossible for the public to be given that kind of detailed information, as it would simply result in pressure lobbying.  If there were no pressure lobbying, there would be no harm, but if there is pressure lobbying, it simply reduces efficiency, and every time one group in the community got a better service, a more elaborate service, or a cheaper service, they would almost certainly be getting it at the expense of another group.  It would become a matter of competition.</P>
    <P>Senator Healy asked me whether I thought there was the same opportunity for a young man joining CIE now as there was in 1958, or whether there was hope for the younger staff joining CIE.  I think that if all the staff of CIE work with heart and hand, we should provide the very best possible service, and if reorganisation continues, perhaps of a different kind but with the same enthusiasm that has prevailed in the past five years, there should be very good opportunities for younger people who join CIE now and who are properly trained and qualified.</P>
    <P>A great deal depends on what the cost is to CIE.  If labour charges rise very rapidly over a short period, CIE can get into the same difficulties as they got into recently, whereas, as I indicated, if wages had gone up either on the basis suggested by the Taoiseach in proportion to the growth of the national economy, or on the basis of what the average rate increase was in 1962, the financial position of CIE would be far better, and they would be better able to compete with private transport.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="903" /> Assuming that we can now expect good industrial relations nationally, and a greater understanding of the meaning of national productivity in relation to the growth of either profits or wages, I think there is hope that CIE will gradually become more efficient as the years go by.  It is not possible for me to make a prediction about the future until I see the report of CIE and the report of the committee studying the position, and until I can see what we can envisage in the future.</P>
    <P>Members of the House have already said CIE have not succeeded in reducing their loss.  They would not have reduced it to nothing even if wages had gone up only by the amount of growth of productivity, and making certain other assumptions, they would not have completed their job, but I believe they are on the right track and have the right ideas.  I believe that given reasonable conditions, and given another measure of legislation which will face realities and, at the same time, ensure that there is a sound public transport system, they can make progress.</P>

      <P>May I ask a question?  I understood the Minister to say that the sale of the tracks was only included in the capital account. If the Minister turns to page 23 of the Report of CIE for the year ending <Col N="904" /> 31st March, 1962, he will see the figure given there:</P>
