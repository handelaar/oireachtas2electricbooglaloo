    <Title>Death of His Holiness Pope John XXIII.</Title>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, as a tribute of respect to the memory of His Holiness Pope John XXIII, Seanad Éireann do now adjourn, and that an expression of its profound sorrow on the death of The Holy Father be sent to His Eminence the Chamberlain of the Holy Roman Church.</P>
      <P>His Holiness, John XXIII, the Pope of Peace and Unity, has gone to his eternal reward and the world mourns the passing of a great and good man who was loved and respected by people of every race and creed.</P>
      <P>In an address on his appointment as Cardinal Patriarch of Venice, in 1953, he said of himself:&mdash;</P>
      <P>By disposition I tend to love my fellow men and this helps me to be faithful to the law of the Gospel. I respect the rights of others and this prevents me from doing wrong and encourages me to do good to all men.</P>
      <P>His whole life, but particularly the four and a half years of his pontificate, gave eloquent testimony of the truth of his words.</P>
      <P>Only one other Pope in the last 200 years had such a humble background as Pope John.  He was born of the people and he understood the people. No other Pope had the breadth of his experience with men in all stations and conditions.  He was twice called to military duty, the first time as a private &mdash;later promoted to sergeant&mdash;in 1901; the second as a sergeant in the Medical Corps during the first World War.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He had a brilliant diplomatic career during which he served 20 years in the <Col N="930" /> Balkans, Turkey, and Greece where he gained an insight into the mind of the Orthodox and Moslem worlds and worked to heal the breach between the Catholic and Orthodox Churches.  In 1944 when he was 63, he was appointed Nuncio to Paris.  He ended the quarrel between the resistance movement and the Bishops and restored cordial relations with the French.  After eight years he became a Cardinal and at the age of 77, Pope John XXIII.</P>
    <P>Pope John enlarged the College of Cardinals and appointed its first African member.  He reshaped Vatican policy to meet the challenge of the Atomic Age.  He made full use of all the 20th century media of communication to reach the people with his message of peace and unity.</P>
    <P>Protocol meant little to him and convention nothing.  A few days after he was called to the Chair of St. Peter, Pope John called on the convicts in the Regina Coeli Prison in Rome. Others, he said, could come to see the Pope if they so desired, but the prisoners and the sick could see the Pope only if he visited them.  He visited hospitals, schools, churches, orphanages, asylums, and homes for the aged in the years that followed.</P>
    <P>In countless gestures of kindliness and understanding, he captured the imagination of the world.  He removed from the liturgy words offensive to the Jews.  He abated some of the breathless ceremony that surrounds a Pope.  He raised the salaries of the Vatican staff from Cardinals down to cleaners.  He received a bewildering variety of religious leaders and set up a new Vatican Department, the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity, to maintain and extend the interchurch contacts thus established.</P>
    <P>Pope John's decision to call a General Council of the Church&mdash;the second in 400 years&mdash;and his two major Encyclicals, <i>Mater et Magistra</i> and <i>Pacem in Terris,</i> were the historic events of his reign.  The first Encyclical, a blueprint for social justice, and the second, a supreme call to the nations to avoid the folly of a third World War, were acclaimed by East and West alike.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="931" /> Pope John had a deep affection for Ireland and showed our nation many favours.  He created a second Irish Cardinal and spoke often of his appreciation of Ireland's work for the Holy See.</P>
    <P>By the death of this gentle Pontiff, the Catholic Church has lost a loving shepherd, the world an outstanding leader, and mankind an unceasing champion of peace and justice and brotherly love.</P>

      <P>It is for me a great honour to second this motion expressing the sympathy of Seanad Éireann on the death of Pope John XXIII to His Eminence the Cardinal Chamberlain.  The death of His Holiness is a loss not only to his own Church&mdash;the Church of a great majority of our people&mdash;but also to lovers of peace and harmony of all religions and, indeed, of none.</P>
      <P>It is given only to very great men to conceive and propound a new idea and to be able immediately to set to work successfully to put that idea into practice.  That was the accomplishment of John XXIII.  He will surely rank as a very great man and his work is still another revelation of a Divine plan.</P>
      <P>At 76 years of age, he proved that he had a fresh original mind as well as the mental and physical vigour to set on foot a great movement towards unity among Christians.</P>
      <P>He was a man of great piety, of deep and wide learning and of varied experience. Basing himself firmly on tradition and upon the scriptures, he proved himself to be an innovator.  He overcame prejudices and barriers which, before his time, had seemed insurmountable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like many distinguished men of our own people, he came from farming stock.  From these origins and from his rearing he derived his strength of body, his shrewdness and suppleness of mind, his understanding of ordinary people and his dislike of pedantry.  He filled the highest Office on earth; yet he retained the common touch and <Col N="932" /> the instinct for the kind and timely act.  He was as distinguished in small things as in great.</P>
    <P>The late Pope's sincerity and single-mindedness gave strength and momentum to the movement towards Christian unity&mdash;his learning and his common sense prevented him from wanting to do too much too rapidly.  While he hoped and prayed for great things his feet were firmly set upon the ground. But surely he planted securely the idea of unity.  His work for better personal relations between Christians has already borne fruit and much more will yet be accomplished.</P>
    <P>He worked ceaselessly for peace among nations but he was alive also to the social problems which beset nations internally and spoke wisely about their solution.  His words carried conviction, not only to his own flock, but to many others outside that fold.</P>
    <P>The reign of John XXIII was a short reign but it will rank as one of the most fruitful and active periods in the history of the Papacy.</P>
    <P>Is áthas linn-ne Éireannaigh go raibh baint agus caidreamh ag cuid mhaith dár muintir leis&mdash;go rabhadar indon omós a thabhairt dó sa Róim, gur thuig sé a dhaingne is a dhílse atáimid ceangailte anois agus riamh dona prionsaí a chuaidh roimhe, is dó féin is gur mar sin a bheidh dóibh siúd a thiocfaidh na dhiaidh.  Is deimhin linn gur sa Pharthas atá a chathaoir ghlórmhar aige inniu&mdash;is go gcabhróidh sé go neartmhar ós na Feaithis leis an obair mhóir a mhúscail sé ar an talamh seo.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour group in the Seanad, and on my own behalf, I wish to be associated with the expression of sympathy on the death of the Holy Father, Pope John XXIII.  During the past centuries the Church has been ruled by a succession of great Popes&mdash;Pius IX, Leo XIII, St. Pius X, Benedict XV, Pius XI and Pius XII.  All of them were outstanding for their holiness and wise and courageous leadership and the depth and extent of their learning.  Pope John XXIII was, perhaps, more widely loved than any of his illustrious predecessors. <Col N="933" /> His work for peace and for the reuniting of Christians was outstanding.  He was the head of the Catholic Church but the warm humanity with which he showed his love and sincerity for all mankind won a response in all hearts. Never has a Pope been so universally mourned and whilst grieving the end of his short reign, we are gratified that he has shown us an outstanding example of true Christian unity.  May his soul rest in peace.</P>

      <P>As a representative of Dublin University and as a member of the religious minority in the Republic, I should like to join in this tribute to the memory of His Holiness Pope John XXIII.  By his supreme gift of charity, by his determination to break down the barriers of the traditional suspicion and prejudice and misunderstanding that have divided Christians for so long, by his transcendental vision of Christendom reunited in brotherhood and friendship, and further, by his readiness to recognise the best qualities in all men of goodwill, whether Christians or not, Pope John won the affection as well as the respect of multitudes outside his own fold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He had no use for any kind of apartheid or segregation among men or <Col N="934" /> women on the basis of class, creed or race.  Indeed, it would hardly be an exaggeration to say that, in a pontificate of less than five years, he achieved more for the reconciliation of men than any other single person in the past four centuries.  So, while we members of the religious minority offer our deepest sympathy to our fellow-countrymen in this sorrowful bereavement which has deprived them of a great and beloved Supreme Pontiff, we ourselves, to an extent quite unparalleled before, personally mourn the loss of one whose Christlike spirit of charity had begun to heal many wounds.  We share, then, all of us, in this universal grief but we also share a common hope that the great ecumenical task of reconciliation which Pope John XXIII has so powerfully begun may soon be fulfilled.  And surely the best practical tribute of respect that we can offer to his memory will be to do all we can to advance its fulfilment by our personal efforts at home and abroad.</P>
