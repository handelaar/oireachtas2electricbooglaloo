      <P>I propose the following amendment to the Order of Business:</P>
      <P>That the Order of Business be Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 6.</P>
      <P>Once again I must bring up the matter of the Bill which is constantly being skipped on the Order Paper by the Leader of the House, namely No. 2, the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, 1971, which is being tabled by Senators Horgan, West and myself.  The last time this was a matter for discussion in the House was when we divided on the Order of Business on 12th May.  On that occasion I argued that a Standing Order of the House, Standing Order No. 72, does not allow the Government to stifle the Bill, to postpone it in the way that this Bill has been postponed. I quote from the Order:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="706" /> 72.  (1)  Any matter for decision by the Seanad shall be brought before it by motion for a Resolution or Order, or by the introduction of a Bill.</P>
    <P>(2) ... and any other matter which, by law, the Seanad may decide...</P>
    <P>It is the Seanad itself decides this matter.  There is no clause or phrase in the Standing Order which allows the constant postponement of a Bill.</P>
    <P>On 12th May another Bill came for its First Reading, the Enforcement of Court Orders Bill, 1971, proposed by Senator Kelly.  This was allowed its reading because it was to be opposed. I was appalled on that occasion, and still am, as I read on the record the reply of the Leader of the House on that occasion.  He said:</P>
    <P>I am opposing the First Stage because the Government will be introducing a Bill which covers the points raised.</P>
    <P>Professor Kelly rightly asked: if the Government were going to introduce a Bill, why they would not take the Bill drafted by the Opposition.  Where is the promised Government Bill?</P>
    <P>I bring this matter up not because it is strictly relevant to our Bill but because it indicates the attitude of the Government and how important this matter, which we are now debating, is.  We are talking about parliamentary privilege, about Parliament itself. I say with diffidence, as a fairly junior Member of this House, as somebody who is not yet two years elected, that I am appalled at how cynically we override the reality of Parliament in this country.</P>
    <P>A Parliament is a curiously personal body.  It must create its own authority. It must arrogate to itself its own powers.  The Parliamentary tradition of Britain was that Parliament gradually took powers from the monarchy and reduced it to a constituent monarchy. In Ireland, if we are to have a true democracy, we must assert our powers.  We must have those powers.</P>
    <P>It is a great defect of this Parliament if the Government arrogate to themselves total monopoly of introducing <Col N="707" /> legislation.  The Government say to a Member of the leading Opposition party: &ldquo;We refuse to consider your Bill because we will be introducing a similar Bill in due course&rdquo;&mdash;if that happened in the House of Commons in England would there be the list of Private Bills before the Parliament that there is at the moment?  There is a substantial list of private legislation introduced by Opposition Members or by Private Members of the Government Party.  We have no such tradition.</P>
    <P>Secondly, in so far as I have been able to do a research on this, it is unheard of in England that a public Bill brought in by a Private Members does not get a First Reading.  It may be opposed or it may be allowed to be published and circulated, but to keep it in limbo in this way is totally a new departure from parliamentary tradition and I think a very bad one about which the country ought to be made aware.</P>
    <P>A Parliament is a personal body, which must create its own traditions. Another tradition which I deplore in this House, and which I think is relevant at the moment, is the vice-hold of the party whip.  I think it is sad in this day and age that the party whip operates so mindlessly, so automatically and so completely on every issue.  I would ask now&mdash;I do so with very little hope that this will happen&mdash;that the party whip be raised on this issue.  I am speaking on an issue of parliamentary privilege.  I am speaking about the Seanad determining its own Standing Orders and determining its own procedures.  I think this ought to be a matter of a free vote.  It ought not to be a matter of the whip being enforced.</P>
    <P>Again, looking to the Westminster model, we have no real backbencher tradition here where the Government are criticised from their own back benches, where there may be a substantial group who will dissent, especially on a matter of conscience, and I would say that a matter of parliamentary privilege or a matter of conscience is one where there ought to be a free vote.  I say as a younger Member of <Col N="708" /> the Parliament that it is relevant at the moment in Ireland and other countries that Parliament is on trial. It is on trial with the younger generation.</P>

      <P>I think that Senator Robinson is going rather far outside the terms of her motion which is to amend the Order of Business to add No. 2.  The general question of comparative parliamentary procedures in different countries really does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wanted to say that, in order to gain popularity, to gain authority in the State, Parliament must be more responsive to public opinion.  It is relevant that public opinion has been discussing the subject matter of the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, namely the limited availability of contraceptives in the country and the repeal of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935, and, by the repeal of censorship provisions, the availability of literature relating to contraceptives.  This has been debated extensively around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently there was a very responsible poll in <i>This Week</i> on the matter.  On the last occasion, on 12th May, the Leader of the House said that the Government were to consider this matter in due time and make up their minds about it.  I cannot believe that the Government can be so much slower than the average person if there is goodwill.  I am now beginning to believe that there is not this goodwill, that there is a great deal of political cynicism, that there is the desire not to take the Bill this session, to leave it until October, November or December&mdash;when we will meet again.  By that time it will be a very stale issue, it is hoped.  I would remind the Leader of the House, and this is my final point on this occasion, that tomorrow we are into July; that we are coming into what is known in parliamentary language as &ldquo;the July gallop&rdquo;; that there will be a great deal of legislation during the month of July, as there always is; that he will seek and will want the co-operation of the House; that this co-operation will only be forthcoming if Parliament itself is seen <Col N="709" /> to be moving independently and giving to itself and taking this authority.  Only if Private Members have confidence that, if they put down Bills they will be taken and that they will not be opposed merely on the grounds that the Government may at some indefinite time in the future introduce legislation, or, worse still, that they will not be kept in limbo and be stifled by the Government, will the Leader of the House get the co-operation necessary for the vital legislation which will be coming before us during this month.  If not, we will be forced to reply in kind to the methods of the Leader of the House.  I think that would be very regrettable for our parliamentary tradition and very regrettable for the good of the country which requires this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Robinson's motion and I will say a few words in support of it.  I should like specificatlly to refer to a point made by Senator Dooge on another occasion when he argued very tellingly that the onus is less on the proposer of a motion such as Senator Robinson to show why such a Bill or projected piece of legislation should be included as it is on the Government to show why it should be excluded.  We have heard from the Leader of the House, and indeed from the Leader of his party, the Taoiseach, a number of excuses recently, all aimed at reassuring us that this matter was being given mature consideration and that the Government would not be bullied by any pressure group from left or from right.  I submit that there is another interpretation to be put on the facts and that the Government's action in refusing to take this Bill at its First Stage can be ascribed to an incredible mixture of intellectual confusion, mental paralysis and moral cowardice.  I do not think that any of us agreed with the fate that was meted out last week to Senator Kelly's draft Bill, but at least in that case the Government had the guts to oppose it and in opposing it showed the tawdriness of their reasons for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation we have about this Bill at the moment is that the Government apparently neither have the <Col N="710" /> guts to accept nor to reject it.  I will not abuse the intelligence of the House by repeating further the arguments why I believe it is necessary for us to take this Bill.  I believe that they are self-evident and I defy the Government to prove otherwise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like briefly to support Senators Robinson and Horgan on this issue.  I feel that far from being irresponsible, as some people have levelled at us, we are being responsible on a deeply personal issue by putting forward this Bill.  I think it is high time it was considered.  Because it is such a personal issue, it is one into which the party whip should not apply, and I think that the sooner we face up to the necessity for a change in the legislation and consider this issue the better.  I would feel quite happy myself if the Government gave us a firm guarantee as to when they would be prepared to do something about this, but seeing that they are not going to do this, we have got to press them on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be associated with this, particularly with Senator West's last remark.  I should be happy if we were to have a definite date in the not too distant future for the acceptance of the First Stage of this Bill.  This Bill is of enormous interest to the community and of enormous importance to quite a considerable section of that community and to have it hanging fire like this for a protracted and indeed an indefinite time is not consonant with either the dignity of this House or the interests of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the third occasion on which an amendment has been proposed to the Order of Business for the purpose of having a discussion on the First Reading of this Bill.  I want to say at the outset that we must clearly distinguish here between two things.  One is the question of parliamentary procedure which has been raised by Senator Robinson and other speakers, and the other is the question of the Bill itself.  I make no secret that so far as the Bill is concerned I am opposed to it and I <Col N="711" /> am prepared to opposed it if a First Reading is ordered and later if a First Reading is accepted.</P>
      <P>The question of whether the Bill should be ordered is a separate matter on which different Senators will have different views.  I should like to make clear also, at the outset, that the members of the Fine Gael Party in the Seanad are absolutely free without any dictation or whip whatsoever to vote as they wish and as they think right on the amendment which has been proposed.</P>
      <P>Expressing a personal view, I may say that I think the request made by Senator West is not an unreasonable one.  I think it is reasonable that when a Bill has been on the Order Paper of the Seanad for a considerable time the sponsors of that Bill, if the amendment is not being accepted by the Government, should receive some kind of firm indication from the Leader of the House as to when it is proposed to order the First Stage.</P>
      <P>This is the third occasion on which this proposal has been made.  On the first occasion the matter was not pressed to a vote.  On the last occasion there was a vote.  I voted against taking the First Stage.  My vote on that occasion seemed to give rise to some criticism and some speculation as to the political motivation for it.  There was also a suggestion in some of the written comment that because I voted against the taking of the First Stage on the last occasion, I was in some way less of a parliamentarian.  I should like to take the opportunity now of making my views quite clear.  I support of parliamentary democracy 100 per cent.  I acknowledge and support the right of Members of either House of the Oireachtas to initiate legislation, but I also acknowledge and support the right of each of our Houses of Parliament, subject to whatever constitutional requirements there may be, to decide for themselves and without outside interference any questions concerning the ordering of their own business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard it as the absolute essence of parliamentary democracy that any questions coming before either House <Col N="712" /> of the Oireachtas should be decided by majority vote.  I am not suggesting that any person in public life should be regarded in any way as being immune to criticism or from ever being called to account or taken to task for his actions.  I would regard it as the very antithesis of parliamentary democracy that any member of Parliament should vote otherwise than he thinks right for fear of harassment or bullying either inside or outside the House.  So far as I am concerned, I am not prepared to trade my vote on this or on any other matter coming before us for favourable publicity or comment.</P>
    <P>On the question of political motivation, so far as I am concerned there is none whatever.  I approach the matter of the Bill, the matter of this amendment, without any reckoning of political consequences.  I will use my own judgment on the merits of the proposal before us.  I took the view before that the time of this House should not then have been occupied by a discussion of this Bill.  The only merit I see in the amendment before us is that it would enable the House to get rid of this Bill.  I do not wish to see the working of the Seanad interfered with or held up indefinitely by discussions such as we are necessarily undertaking at the moment.  I feel that it is a reasonable request from the point of view of parliamentary procedure and parliamentary democracy that if a Private Member of either House of the Oireachtas puts down a Bill she or he should have some reasonable indication from the Leader of the House so far as this House is concerned, and the head of the Government so far as the other House is concerned, as to when it is proposed to order that business for discussion.</P>
    <P>I am no more in favour of this Bill now than I was previously, but my decision with regard to this amendment will be governed by whatever contribution may be made by the Leader of the House.  I regard it as eminently reasonable that he should give an indication to the sponsors of the Bill as to when he proposes to order this business.  If he feels that he is not in a position to give that indication and if he gives the House reasonable grounds <Col N="713" /> as to why he cannot give this indication, then one set of circumstances will exist.  If, on the other hand, he simply refuses to give an indication as to when the Government will be prepared to order discussion of the Bill, having regard to the fact that it has been on the Order Paper for a considerable time, then another set of circumstances will exist.  I will make up my mind, on this basis, what I will do with regard to this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the two previous occasions on which Senator Robinson has pressed for the discussion on her Bill I have taken the view that the complex and delicate matter to which the Bill adverts is one which should be dealt with by the Government.  I have waited patiently, like many other Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, to see if the Government would act on the undertaking given by the Taoiseach many months ago, that the question adverted to in this Bill would be dealt with by the Government. The time has long passed for the Government to make good the Taoiseach's undertaking.  The Leader of this House should give a clear undertaking that the matter will be dealt with soon by the Government or else he should allow us to vote on this Bill.  I will reserve my right to vote whichever way I think fit when the Bill is published, but I do not think that the Leader of the House can justifiably repeat his assertion that there is no hurry in regard to this business.  There is no question of pressure being put on the Leader of the House in any way. Unless this Bill is to become a complete public farce, he should agree to the introduction of the Bill and let us vote on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I am not a bit impressed by the excitement which Senator Robinson tried to generate in her opening remarks nor am I impressed by Senator Horgan's statements on this Bill.  They completely misunderstand the situation with regard to legislation.  Perhaps I had better throw some light on it.  In their minds the question of contraception appears to be all important and of great national urgency, but in the minds of most people in this country <Col N="714" /> it does not hold that position at all. The Government have quite a considerable amount of more important and necessary legislation to get through before they can reach all the matters which many people would like them to deal with.</P>
      <P>When this Bill was introduced I said that in due course the Government would give it consideration, that the party would give it consideration and that the result would be announced to the Seanad.  It is not our intention to take it out of its place and to give it consideration before much more urgent problems which occupy the minds of the Government and the people generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not our intention either to regard seriously the threatened non-co-operation campaign of Senator Mary Robinson.  If anything would make me determined to be pigheaded it is a threat from Senator Robinson, or from anyone else in the Seanad, if we did not do so-and-so and if we did not give a First Reading to this Bill, they would do so-and-so and they would make legislation impossible in the Seanad.  All I can say is: just try it.  They will find that it is not a workable proposition.</P>
      <P>We do not intend to be forced to do something which we must do without mature consideration.  That consideration will be given in due course.  It is most improbable that the Government would adopt Senator Robinson's Bill.  In my opinion, it is not at all a suitable Bill.  It does not meet the desires&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I just wanted to say that in my opinion it is most improbable <Col N="715" /> that the Government would accept Senator Robinson's Bill.  If Senator Dooge does not want to hear any more on that score, and if this &ldquo;whip free&rdquo; party are so hidebound that they cannot listen to any more on it, that is all right with me&mdash;I shall not say any more on the subject.</P>
      <P>I should remind Senators&mdash;and particularly Senator Horgan, who made some semi-fascist utterances a few moments ago&mdash;that a couple of weeks ago Senator Kelly introduced a Bill here which was denied a First Reading. He fulminated loudly and for a long time about the failure of the Government to tackle the problem which he had in mind: he complained about the long delays and that it was to be put on a still longer finger.  I am sure that Senator Kelly will be pleased to see that item No. 1 on the Order Paper today is a Bill which embodies the very points in which he was interested. I am sure that that example will not be lost on Senator Horgan, if the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not want in any circumstances to address such <Col N="716" /> remarks in your direction: they were intended over there.  If Senator Robinson is not satisfied with the position which I have explained, and if she thinks that immediate attention must be given to this and that we must throw everything aside in order to deal with the matters in this Bill, she is making a great mistake.  Even assuming that the Bill were introduced, discussed, and so on, it would be a very long time before we could reach the Second Stage because there is a programme of legislation ahead that will keep this Seanad going until, possibly, the middle of August, and may be later.  If we adjourn for any reasonable time, it will mean that it will be late autumn before we resume any consideration.  Therefore, with the best will in the world, Senator Robinson's proposition falls by the wayside.  I am afraid I cannot accept Senator Robinson's proposition.  If she insists on wanting to introduce this Bill, then I cannot do anything to dissuade her, I suppose, except in the only way that is permitted to the Seanad to do so.</P>

    <Title>Higher Education Authority Bill, 1970: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed : &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I explained to the House what my system in dealing with this Bill would be.  I proposed to go through the Bill indicating the sections that seemed to me to be weak, thus giving the Minister an opportunity, in advance, of foreseeing the shape which our amendments might take.</P>
      <P>The last topic with which I dealt last week was that of section 4.  I said then that section 4, being taken almost word for word from the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, tended to impose on the Authority a duty which might leave the Authority in the same condition of difficulty and conflict which the corresponding section of the Broadcasting Authority Act left Radio Telefís Éireann in.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to go over the ground I have already covered, and I know it would not be in order for me to do so, but before I leave section 4 I want to make it clear, beyond any possibility of misunderstanding, what I mean by that.  I do not think it is impossible for higher education to be carried out through the medium of the Irish language and I am not saying it is so.  All I wish to say is that the resources at our disposal in regard to trained staff are very, very limited and we find it difficult, in all the institutions of higher education in Ireland, to recruit staff of any kind from anywhere.  We have a Greek on the staff of the law faculty in UCD at present.  Quite naturally, we would sooner have an Irishman but the reality of the matter is that we have not got a sufficient number of people, because of our small population, trained to teach at advanced level and we will have to rely, for a long time to come, on people from outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I advanced, last week, as an example of the difficulty in which Irish institutions find themselves, the case of the new University of Ulster at Coleraine <Col N="719" /> in which the proportion of Irish staff is extremely small.  I hope that will not be interpreted by the Minister, or by his side of the House, as throwing cold water on the idea that the aim imposed on the Authority by section 4 is an unworthy one.  My view is exactly the opposite to that.  I think the Authority ought to bear this aim in mind but I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the fact&mdash;it probably has been done before&mdash;that it would be unreal, and may be damaging to the Authority, if they are expected, in providing for higher education, to give this objective precedence over the ordinary imparting of higher knowledge.  There are large areas of higher knowledge which are worth imparting irrespective of the medium through which they are imparted.  That is the matter of which must get priority, and the national cultural aim of restoring the Irish language ought not be confused with it.  It is a completely separate matter, and I hope the Authority, will not find themselves placed, by section 4, in an impossible position. I have not yet decided whether to put down an amendment to section 4: I am not inclined so to do because I do not wish to disagree with the spirit behind it.  However, I do wish to draw the attention of the House, as forcibly as I can, to the fact that it may involve the Authority in the same kind of difficulties which the Broadcasting Authority now find themselves in.</P>
    <P>In section 5 it is proposed to lay the duty on An tÚdarás of advising the Minister on the need, or otherwise, for the establishment of new institutions of higher education, on the nature and form of those institutions and on the legislative measures required in relation to their establishment or in relation to any existing institution of higher education.  What I welcome in this section is that somebody, with evident authority and knowledge, will be there to advise the Minister on those questions.  Hitherto that has not been evident.  I do not want my remarks to be taken as casting any aspertions, individual or general, on the staff of the Minister's Department when I say that the history surrounding the <Col N="720" /> merger showed that the then Minister for Education was not in receipt of any advice at all in regard to his merger proposal or if he was in receipt of such advice it was so lacking in authority that he was able to ignore it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not seek it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the long and the short of it.  He made a point of pride of not having consulted anybody but it might have been not unfitting if he, at least, found advice available to him in his own Department. If there was advice available there, it was bad advice, but my feeling is that he got no advice in his own Department and there was no one there able to give him advice at the time. Whether the situation in the Department has changed since I cannot say. If we are now going to have an Authority which is in a position to advise, with knowledge and authority, we will be making some progress.  Certainly, the record of the Department of Education and of the two predecessors of the present Minister in this regard is not at all encouraging.  I shall return to the question of consultation with the universities later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The weak spot in section 5 seems to be that no rule is contained in the section which requires the assent of the Authority before the an institution of higher education is created.  I am prepared to assume, in favour of the present Minister, that he does not intend to set up bogus institutions.  I am willing to assume that in the Minister's favour but, as I said last week, it is not enough to legislate on the basis that the goodwill that one may impute to, or assume to exist in, the present Minister will be there always. Ministers come and go and Governments come and go.  It may easily happen that we will have a Minister or a Government in the future&mdash;I am not necessarily saying that it will be a Fianna Fáil Government that will do this evil deed&mdash;but we may have a Minister in the future who for some political reason, to satisfy local political pressure, to save a quota or a second quota, may give people, in response to academically and socially unjustified pressures, a so-called institution <Col N="721" /> of higher education which cannot be objectively justified.  I believe that section 5 is weak and that it should require the assent of the Authority before an institution of this kind is set up.  I know this point was put to the Minister in the Dáil in a slightly different way and I realise that the Minister has had his attention directed to it but I hope to return to it, in the form of an amendment, at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to put down an amendment to section 7 but I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that this section, which requires institutions of higher education to submit financial statements to the Authority, is as section to which no sanction is attached.  I do not think any existing institution would fail to carry out its duty under this section. However, I wish to draw the Minister's attention, in the interest of himself and of the Authority which he is proposing to set up, to the fact that the section contains no sanction in a case where a higher institution may fail to deliver a statement of their financial position.  The section merely says:</P>
    <P>...it shall be the duty of every institution of higher education to comply with any requirements which are imposed on it under this section.</P>
    <P>It does not say what will happen if that duty is breached.  It does not say what will happen if an institution of higher education, at loggerheads with the Minister or the Authority, refuses to submit a financial statement.  I do not apprehend that any existing institution would behave in that way; however, the Minister might like to know that this section as it stands leaves him powerless to proceed in any direct way&mdash;perhaps there are ways of the &ldquo;uisce faoi thalamh&rdquo; type which might enable him to bring an institution into line&mdash;to ensure that an institution will carry out their duties.  I do not propose to put down an amendment on this matter.  If the Minister agrees with me that this represents a loophole or lacuna in the Bill, it is up to him to put down an amendment. I thought it worth while to draw his attention, and the attention of the House, to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="722" /> On section 11 there was a debate in the Dáil with regard to the idea that institutions of higher education should supply:</P>
    <P>...all such information relative to the institution as An tÚdarás may require for the purpose of performing its functions.</P>
    <P>I submit&mdash;and this was submitted in the Dáil&mdash;that it is too much to pharse the section like this.  It is too much to lay a blanket duty on an institution of giving any information that An tÚdarás may require.  I believe the section should be extended by inserting some word such as &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; before &ldquo;require&rdquo;.  For example, a possibility of abuse of a political kind might arise where An tÚdarás, in the exercise of one of their functions, might require personal information from an institution regarding a member of their staff or one of their students.  I do not think it proper that An tÚdarás should be put in a position of requiring that kind of information unless it is necessary for the discharge of main functions, and I do not think An tÚdarás should be the sole judge of that.  It should be made objectively determinable by the insertion before &ldquo;require&rdquo; of the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The first subsection of section 12 provides that:</P>
    <P>There shall be paid to An tÚdarás, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, such amounts for institutions of higher education as may be approved of by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>This subsection received a good deal of attention in the Dáil and the point was made, which represents a point which is strongly felt by the Academic Staff Association of UCD and the Irish Federation of University Teachers, that it appears to allow the Minister to pre-indicate how this money is to be allotted as between different institutions. I do not want to exasperate the Minister, I realise he has had to face this point before, but I felt I ought to indicate that I propose to put down an amendment to it, the object of which <Col N="723" /> will be to ensure that the Authority will be able to make up its own mind how money should be allotted as between different institutions and should not have to receive dictation from the Minister, or the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In section 13 of this Bill the Minister proposes that:</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás may institute and conduct studies on such problems of higher education and research as it considers appropriate and may publish reports of such studies at its discretion.</P>
    <P>I believe&mdash;although a case could be made for very special circumstances of another kind&mdash;that if An tÚdarás does institute and conduct studies on problems of higher education and research it ought to publish these studies for the benefit of the public.  Although the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in a legal setting has been frequently interpreted and might, indeed, here be so interpreted as meaning &ldquo;must&rdquo;, I do not think the section should be left to the mercies of legal interpretation.  It should be put beyond doubt that if the Authority does institute and conduct studies on problems of higher education and research, the results of these studies must be made available to the public generally and to these Houses.  I do not see that there could be any excuse for the Authority conducting studies into problems of higher education and research at public expense and keeping the results a secret.  That could not be justified.  I know the Minister may be surprised to find that I am even adverting to the possibility.  Agan I say &mdash;and I assume in the Minister's favour that he would not wish such a thing ever to happen&mdash;that we are legislating not just for this year but possibly for 20 or 50 years ahead.  We are still operating in the National University under a statute which is 63 years old, and we have got to take account today of the possibilities which may arise in the 21st century.  I want to see this Bill freed, so far as our limited foresight enables us to free it, of possibilities of later abuse.</P>
    <P>Section 14, subsection (1) says:</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás may appoint such and so many persons to be its officers <Col N="724" /> and servants as, subject to the approval of the Minister, it from time to time thinks proper.</P>
    <P>No amendment was put down in the Dáil to this subsection.  Reading it as best I can, it seems to me to mean that the Minister is given the power to approve and, therefore, implicitly to withhold approval from the nomination, not only of officers and servants in regard to their number, but also in regard to their identity.  It is fair enough for the Minister to say: &ldquo;You need a secretary and a certain subsidiary staff of four, six or eight or whatever number of people, and I will pay the salaries or make money available for paying these people's salaries.&rdquo; That is fair enough.  But it is not right&mdash;and for a reason which will become very relevant later on&mdash;that the Minister should be entitled to say: &ldquo;Not only will I tell you that you can have six or eight officers and servants, but I am going to tell you who these servants must be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us talk plainly about this.  The effect of this subsection as it stands seems to me to be that the Minister can transplant from his own Department into An tÚdarás such civil servants of his own choosing as he wishes. In the ordinary way there could be no objection to that.  I can see no reason why that should not be done, but there is an objection to it which I shall explain later on.  My submission will be, and I propose, I hope, to incorporate it in an amendment, that while the part of the section which speaks of &ldquo;so many persons&rdquo;&mdash;the number of officers and servants should remain subject to the Minister's approval&mdash;the identity of these persons should not necessarily be a matter for approval by the Minister.  It would be fair and unobjectionable for this Authority, which is being given such wide and important powers, that they could at least be trusted with recruiting their own staff.</P>
    <P>The Authority itself is going to consist of people, most if not all of them, part-time members.  Certainly all but the chairman will very likely be part-time members of the Authority. Thus the Authority are going to have to operate by officers and servants.  I <Col N="725" /> cannot see what objection there is to that Authority being given the freedom to recruit whoever they like, if necessary to advertise for their officers and servants outside the Civil Service altogether.  I am not saying that that would necessarily be a good thing, but circumstances might arise in which it might be a good thing.  I cannot foresee these circumstances.  But again I feel that the possibility here, not of this Minister, but some Minister in the future, packing the Authority with his own nominees, and these are the people who will be doing the work, ought to be avoided.  The Authority should be trusted to appoint their own officers and servants.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to the Schedule; I do not wish to say anything about sections 15 to 21 at the moment.  I wish to say something about the Schedule which describes the constitution and operation of the Authority.  I have already hinted in what I said about the definition section that I am uneasy about section 2 of the Schedule which reads:</P>
    <P>2.  The members of An tÚdarás shall be a chairman and not more than eighteen ordinary members of whom at least seven shall be academic members and at least seven shall be other than academic members.</P>
    <P>I have already said I am not happy with the idea that somebody whose attachment to a higher institution is purely nominal could be regarded as an academic member.  While I have not got offhand a good definition of an academic member&mdash;and I do not at all say it must be somebody who has no other occupation than teaching in an institution of higher education&mdash; an academic member of this Authority should be somebody, certainly, whose main work in life is connected with or takes place in the employment of an institution of higher education on the academic side.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I do not like to see that the membership of this Authority is one which might be so contrived&mdash; again not necessarily by this Minister &mdash;as to have only a very thin and superficial representation from the institutions <Col N="726" /> of higher education that it is now going to have such a strong position in regard to.  I realise the Minister has said that he himself does not propose in the first instance to appoint out of the full 18 members.  Whether he does or not, the section as it stands leaves the academic members in a potential minority.</P>
    <P>I know there is a widespread suspicion of academics.  Next to lawyers, I suppose, they are the easiest targets for cheap criticism, which they receive and have got in this House.  I know the idea is current&mdash;or at least if it is not current it is easily suggested to the public&mdash;that academics are unrealistic people, frequently engaged only in pursuing their own interests and that these interests are of no public importance or value.  I could rebut it, and do so very fully, but it would take up too much of the time of the House if I were to do it here.</P>
    <P>I must say that the proportion suggested in this section which leaves the academic members potentially in a permanent minority is an undesirable one.  It is perhaps right that it should be in the power of a Minister, if he sees good reason at a particular time, to leave the academic members in a minority.  I do not think it should be done in this way.  This mention of the word &ldquo;seven&rdquo; seems to me to invite a Minister to appoint only seven academic members.  It seems to me virtually to invite him to appoint that minimum.  It may not be the present Minister's intention to do that, but it seems to me nonetheless to be an invitation to make the academic members of this Authority a fairly small minority.</P>
    <P>In section 4 of the Schedule I see that&mdash;</P>
    <P>An ordinary member of An tÚdarás shall be appointed by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister and, before making a recommendation, the Minister shall consult thereon with the chairman of An tÚdarás.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister accepted an amendment in the Dáil of a kind which, as I said last day, seems to me to be vague enough, in regard to one of the <Col N="727" /> functions of the Authority being to &ldquo;promote the democratisation of the structure of higher education&rdquo;, and as the Minister accepts that there is some value in the idea of democracy operating in institutions of higher education, I would have hoped that the associations, whether formal or informal, representing people who have to do the teaching in these institutions should be consulted before appointments are made.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that the Authority should have to go to the academic councils, or governing bodies or to the staff associations and say: &ldquo;Would you please elect or re-elect people for us for the Authority?&rdquo;.  I am not suggesting that, but I do suggest that this section ought to be extended so as to invite the Authority to take counsel with the academic councils or the academic staff associations of these institutions before making appointments.</P>
    <P>It is possible to ruin an Authority of this kind and to get everyone's back up against it by appointing the wrong people.  That happens not only in connection with State bodies.  It can happen also in connection, for instance, with appointments to the judiciary.  It is possible for a Government to make a serious mistake in appointing a judge, to appoint the wrong man, somebody who is known to be the wrong man and whom anyone in the profession could have told you was the wrong man, no matter what political side he belongs to.  It is possible to do that and it has happened in ths country.  I am not going to get into the question of political patronage but the reason why it has happened, apart from the political patronage angle, is that the Government, possibly inhibited through the fact that it is a delicate inquiry, has not taken enough or any advice from the people who are best qualified to advise it on who is going to make a respectable judge, because a judge who is not good, a judge who is rude or ill-tempered, who is short or unfair brings not only his own court but all the courts into disrepute.</P>
    <P>Exactly the same thing is going to happen with an Authority which is <Col N="728" /> going to have any kind of influence on an important section of life like higher education.  If these seven academic members are hacks&mdash;and there are such things as academic hacks, I know that and I make Senator Ó Maoláin a present of that information if it suits him&mdash;there are such things as academic hacks, and these people can be pressed into the service of a government by being made chairmen of commissions, or being put in charge of boards, or being asked to compile reports or something of that kind.  While they may do that job well, honestly and so forth, it impairs to a large extent their elbowroom, their freedom of manoeuvre and it undermines confidence in their impartiality and in their commitment to their own profession and its interests and to their own vocation.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I have used too strong a word when I have used the word &ldquo;hack&rdquo;, because I know that many of the people I have in mind have acted throughout with only the public interest at heart.  But there is a certain number of academics in this country whose services have been availed of from time to time, and who have come to be identified with the Government.  I do not mean with the Government Party exactly, but with the Government in a larger sense, with the establishment, and who although they may have done valuable work have compromised their situation with their own colleagues.</P>
    <P>I think that if An tÚdarás turns out to have academic members in which such people are heavily represented it is not going to enjoy the confidence of the ordinary academic staff&mdash;let alone the students; that is another day's work.  But it is not going to enjoy the confidence of the ordinary staff.  I am not going to suggest that the Authority should be dictated to by the staff associations or by the academic councils as to who should be members of it, but I think the Government should be at least advised, in some perhaps permissive way, to take counsel with the staffs, whether in the formal organisation of the academic council or in the informal organisation of the staff associations, before appointments to the Authority are made.  The only reason why I say that is that the <Col N="729" /> Authority, if they do not take account of staff feelings, are going to handicap themselves from the outset.  If there are people on the Authority who do not enjoy the absolute confidence of their colleagues in regard to their impartiality, whose freedom of action, freedom of manoeuvre appears compromised to their colleagues, this Authority will be handicapped before they start.  I confidently predict to the Minister&mdash;and it may not be his intention&mdash;that if he appoints to this Authority academics who are not in a general way in a position of enjoying some confidence among their colleagues he is going to be in a situation of conflict right away.  It will not be any time at all before that Authority are going to find themselves in conflict, and I think that it is important therefore that this section should be extended&mdash; and I am going to put down an amendment accordingly, in such a way as to enable the Government to take counsel with them before appointing members of the Authority.  The same goes for the removal of an ordinary member of the Authority from office.</P>
    <P>I want to keep this debate on as impartial and neutral a level as I can, but I have often noticed, since I came into this House nearly two years ago, that Senator Ó Maoláin, for example&mdash; I hope he will take this in good humour, I do not mean to be contentious&mdash;rarely misses a chance of firing some of his arrows at the academics on the other side.  I sometimes feel that the reason for that is because his own party has not succeeded in recruiting enough academics, and if they could recruit them, we would hear less criticism of academics from them. It seems to me to be a fact which speaks for itself, that when people are put in a position of independence, namely in university jobs, they tend not to support the party that Senator Ó Maoláin represents.  It is only when they have something to gain by supporting it, when people are looking for something, that they tend to flock towards that party.  I wish, therefore, that Senator Ó Maoláin and those who feel like him about this would acknowledge that university people although in a position of privilege, which I also freely admit and will <Col N="730" /> come back again to later on, would not be worth a damn if their approach to life was not critical, and that means that on the whole they tend to be dissatisfied with the establishment that they see around them.  That may be one of the reasons why what Senator Ó Maoláin finds so inexplicable happens, that he can scarcely turn on his television set without seeing a professor or a lecturer laying down the law about something in such a way as to blacken the eye of the Fianna Fáil Government.  If there was a Fine Gael Government in this country for long enough, the same thing would happen, and people on this side of the House would probably be complaining, though I hope not in such abusive terms, about the fact that the universities were filled with people who seemed to spend their lives taking cracks at us.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the question of the mental disposition of an academic, I think it is important that the staffs of all these institutions should be consulted both about the personnel of the Authority on their appointment and about the possibility of removing one of them.  Suppose you appoint a professor or a lecturer or an assistant or some academic person to the Authority and he turns out to be a thorn in the side of the Government, that would be a very bad reason for removing him, but there is nothing in this Bill which will prevent his removal for that reason.  I know that the Minister has gone some distance towards meeting this case in the Dáil by accepting an amendment which requires the Government to consult with the chairman before removing an ordinary member of An tÚdarás from office, but an amendment which was pressed in the Dáil to the effect that removal can only take place on a cause shown was declined by the Minister.  I do not know whether the right way to do it is to insist that cause be shown or not.  It might be more sensible if the removal of a member of An tÚdarás could be resolved on only by An tÚdarás.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be wrong that it should be possible for a person who is a thorn in the side of the Government to be taken off this Authority for that reason only.  It is inherent in the <Col N="731" /> nature of an academic that his approach to life will be critical, and if he finds a Government conditioning the life around him for too long, his criticisms will tend to point in that direction.  I am not suggesting that this will necessarily happen only under Fianna Fáil.  I do not think any Government should be in the position where because a member becomes critical of them, appears on television and speaks harshly of them, says nasty things about them, the Government are entitled to put him off the Authority.  If that sort of thing happens, it will destroy the standing of the Authority with the university staffs and produce a sort of conflict compared with which the conflicts on Radio Telefís Éireann are a picnic.  There will be conflict between the Authority and the universities if the staffs are not consulted and if their feelings are not borne in mind.  I am, therefore, putting down an amendment to this section.</P>
    <P>There are only two other sections in the Schedule upon which I wish to speak before I move to some more general matters and to put the Bill in a more general setting.  Before doing that I wish to draw the attention of the House to two other sections of the Schedule.</P>
    <P>Section 16 says:</P>
    <P>Every question at a meeting of An tÚdarás on which there is disagreement among the members present shall be determined by a majority of the votes of the members present and voting on the question and, in the case of an equal division of votes, the chairman of the meeting shall have a second or casting vote.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to press this with vigour, and I have not yet made up my mind whether I will put down an amendment on it, because if the Minister, in replying, were able to convince me that the point was of no substance, I would not waste the time of the House.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the majority in the Authority in a voting situation should be a qualified majority.  There should be some way of making sure <Col N="732" /> that, if conflict develops in the Authority between the academic and the non-academic members, the non-academic members cannot outvote the others.  As the Minister knows, there are such things as qualified majorities in the European Economic Community to which we are seeking admittance. This ensures that on certain issues and in some contexts, smaller powers have an entrenched position which cannot be taken from them.  It would not be a bad thing if the majority spoken of in section 16 were a qualified majority, qualified in such a way that the academic members, if unanimous, against the rest, could not be outvoted; in other words, that the academic members, if themselves unanimous, could effectively veto what the non-academic members, although a numerical majority, wished.</P>
    <P>In case Members on the other side think that this is undemocratic or that it is in some way unprecedented in our legislation, I will draw their attention to the examples provided by the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946, which sets up a Censorship Board of five persons of whom four can form a quorum.  A book cannot be banned by these four members unless three vote for its prohibition.  If there were four members present, one did not vote and one voted against the prohibition and two voted for prohibition the book could not be banned.  There must be three out of four people present voting for the book's prohibition.  The intent of that qualified majority is to favour the liberal end of the question. Where the committee is divided, the preference is given, or the benefit of the doubt is given, to the liberal side.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to equate liberal with academic, but it is an equation which is far from being necessarily wrong.  It would not be disgraceful if this Authority were to be placed by law in a situation in which they could not vote down all their academic members.  In other words, if all academic members are solidly against something which the Authority by their non-academic majority proposes to do, it should be possible for the non-academic members to block it.  That is not undemocratic, or, if it is, it is something which is <Col N="733" /> being forced on me by the way in which the Authority are proposed to be constituted.  I urge the Minister to consider this.  I may put down an amendment about this.</P>
    <P>The last matter I wish to deal with is this.  Section 22 of the Schedule says:</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás shall appoint one of its officers to be Secretary of An tÚdarás.</P>
    <P>Section 23 says:</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás may perform such of its functions as it may deem proper through or by any of its officers or servants duly authorised in that behalf.</P>
    <P>I have already explained to the House what is proposed by the Minister in regard to the recruitment of officers. Putting it bluntly, it is proposed that the Minister should provide the Authority with a staff.  I presume that that staff would be drawn from his own Department.  I am willing to be contradicted if I am wrong in this, but it seems from the drafting of section 14 that this is the intention of the Minister.  In other words, the Minister can probably, as I would read section 14 of the Bill and section 22 of the Schedule, decide who is to be secretary of this Higher Education Authority.</P>
    <P>Section 23 of the Schedule permits the performance by an officer or servant of the Authority of any of its functions in its own discretion.  If we look at the functions which the Authority have got, we find that the financial ones are perhaps the most important.  In section 12 (2) it is proposed&mdash;</P>
    <P>Any payment to an institution which An tÚdarás makes out of the amounts that it receives under the foregoing subsection shall be made in such manner and subject to such conditions as An tÚdarás thinks fit.</P>
    <P>The joint effect of section 12 (2) of the Bill and section 23 of the Schedule is that it is open to the Authority to say &ldquo;We propose that our function under section 12 should be exercised by the secretary of the Authority on our behalf,&rdquo; in order words by a civil servant. I do not think it likely that the Authority of the kind I believe the existing Minister would set up would be likely to do that.  I am saying&mdash;<Col N="734" /> for the fourth time in this speech&mdash; we are legislating, not for today, but possibly for half a century.  We do not know what kind of Government we will have.  They may be far worse than any we have ever known.  We may get a Government inimical to learning and dissent, and inimical to the kind of places which produce learning and dissent. It is a serious loophole if this Bill goes through with section 23 of the Schedule, unamended, which gives a blanket permission to the Authority to confer any of their functions on any of their officers, who are not members of the Authority but permanent officials.</P>
    <P>As I said, I do not think it likely that the Minister will appoint this kind of Authority.  I cannot imagine an Authority in the year 1971, such as might be appointed now, conferring in an unqualified way on their secretary or one of their other permanent officials drawn from the Civil Service a function of this kind.  But as this Bill stands it is possible for them to do so as I read it.  It would be possible for a permanent official over which no House has any control and over which the Authority themselves have only a limited control, to be given the job of deciding the manner in which, and the conditions subject to which, payments to institutions are going to be made.  It may be that I have misunderstood the joint effect of these sections, or it may be that the Minister has an amendment up his own sleeve to deal with it.  However, I ask him to consider seriously the possibility to which I have adverted.  Unless he convinces me that I have misunderstood the joint effect of these sections, I intend to put down an amendment.  This will be to remove the possibility of the Authority being allowed to divest themselves of this important function, and to entrust it to one of their own permanent officials.</P>
    <P>I cannot leave the subject of this Bill without putting the whole question of higher education into a somewhat larger context.  Last week I said that the Authority which we are now about to set up are going to be dealing not with just an academic product, but with a highly political product. We know what is meant by that. <Col N="735" /> We know that higher education and all forms of education are politically sensitive today, in a way in which they never were before.  The reason for that is that the things which are thought of as desirable by people in this kind of society&mdash;a society which is competitive and capitalist&mdash;I am not necessarily using these words in order to imply condemnation&mdash;are things which are increasingly accessible only through education.</P>
    <P>I am often angered when I see in newspapers the jargon which pours from ministerial mouths, and sometimes from our own side, too.  These are phrases which turn into clichés in a matter of weeks or months.  The one which most enrages me is &ldquo;the quality of life&rdquo;.  You cannot open a newspaper without seeing the Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, or Deputy Haughey or some other Minister telling schoolchildren about the quality of life.  It is a revolting expression, not so much by itself but because very often it is uttered by Ministers whose own contribution to the quality of life here has been so unremarkable.</P>

      <P>If I must use this phrase&mdash;which has been made distasteful to me by its abuse by people who have done nothing for the quality of life&mdash;it means that people should have maximum leisure and opportunity to develop their own interests and to unfold their own personalities.  These are vague enough words, but we know the conditions in which these things cannot be done.  They cannot be done by a man who has to work 60 hours a week, or by a man living in grossly overcrowded conditions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There are plenty of men who, in order to produce big incomes <Col N="736" /> for themselves and their families, work up to 60 hours a week on overtime. The Senator knows that very well.  I am far from being an expert on labour matters but I know that much. There are plenty of people who do it and I do not consider that they should have to do it.  When I hear people criticising busmen or other workers of that kind for always being dissatisfied when they are bringing home £70 or £80 a week, I say to these people: &ldquo;What do these men have to do, in order to earn that kind of money?&rdquo; They have to work in a way that is impossible for you or me.  They are able to do it only in the early part of their lives, when they have their health and strength.  It would kill you or me if we had to do it.  I think that a 40-hour week should mean what it says, and it should be possible for people, working no longer than that, to have the &ldquo;quality of life&rdquo; about which we are always reading.  They should not have to work all night as well as all day.</P>
      <P>Having to work too hard, for too long hours, living in bad conditions and being kept in ignorance by other people's deliberate act or by neglect, are things which militate against a decent life.  That is the reason why education is now so politically sensitive.  Unless one has access to it one is going to be left behind in the race and in a competitive society one is going to sink to the bottom of the barrel.  There is an old piece of ancestral wisdom, &ldquo;Trí ghlún ó rí go ránn&rdquo;.  Sometimes it is not three generations at all, but one generation in which somebody sinks through the floor of the social stratum of his parents into the stratum underneath. It is not at all uncommon and, except for the fact that I should be giving potential offence to people who are in that situation, I would give examples of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That kind of competitive society, in which education is one of the means for climbing up the ladder, very often kicking the fingers of the people below you, is one which offers terrific industrial, political and social problems, and education is only one aspect of them. This Government never publishes policies and only operates from day to day, in a pragmatic way&mdash;I do not <Col N="737" /> mean to sneer at that mode of operation; it is not a good one but it may have something to recommend it&mdash;and has never sat back and taken a long look at the thing on which its Ministers are always giving us lectures, the quality of life and how it is to be attained.  We are not going to have social peace and order as long as there is a complete free-for-all, with education as one of the ladders to the top. Rationalising education and making it available, with all our resources, in the best way we can, is only part of the problem.  It is only scratching at the problem to pretend that education is going to solve it all.  It will not solve it all, because a saturation point is easily reached in a small country like Ireland.</P>
    <P>We can certainly educate and turn out any number you like of people with university degrees.  That is not going to make any difference at all to the possibility of people fulfilling their potentialities and having a decent kind of living, if there are too many of them.  A couple of weeks ago I noticed that the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary spoke to the Irish Federation of University Teachers.  His speech was reported in the newspapers on 14th June, 1971.  I was amazed to see that Deputy O'Kennedy&mdash;who should know perfectly well what the situation is in this regard&mdash;appears to be laying at the door of the universities the responsibility for controlling this political problem. It is a political problem.  If we are going to have a large population of unemployable BAs&mdash;and that is what we are heading towards, and I do not want to sound alarmist&mdash;it is going to represent a political problem and not an academic one.  It cannot be solved inside the doors of UCD, or Trinity College, or Cork, Galway or Maynooth.  It represents a nettle that some Government will have to grasp.</P>
    <P>As reported in the press, Mr. O'Kennedy said:</P>
    <P>At present each university functioned as an individual entity and endeavoured to provide facilities for more and more students, without apparent regard to the fundamental consideration of whether the requirements of the community justified <Col N="738" /> their supply with the particular type of qualification they had obtained. The instance of 1,600 candidates for the higher diploma in education this year, when the schools could not possibly absorb this number, illustrated this point.  Not only did the production of a large surplus of graduates or diplomates mean that precious financial resources had, to that extent, been wasted, but it meant also that young people were being brought along an academic road at the end of which they met with disappointment and frustration.</P>
    <P>He then asked:</P>
    <P>Would the universities not consider that they have some responsibility here to try, in the interests of the community, to achieve a more suitable balance of output as between graduates who are surplus to the community's requirements and persons of technical and technological qualifications who are so much needed?</P>

      <P>I am just coming to that.  Last year University College, Dublin, decided that its night Arts degrees were not satisfactory academically. They decided to change the system by converting the evening degree into a cyclical degree, in other words, cut the number of Arts entries to night courses by two-thirds.  There was a ferocious uproar and a lot of anger was aroused; saying this it is not my intention to annoy Professor Jessop, but none of it was directed at Trinity College, which closed down its night degrees a couple of years previously. UCD are cutting their numbers by</P>

    <P>I do not recall any Minister or Parliamentary Secretary speaking up in defence of UCD when anger was directed towards us, with the use of pickets and so on.  I do not recall Deputy O'Kennedy saying: &ldquo;After all there is a limit to the number of BA degrees the community can afford and if UCD are cutting their numbers by two-thirds, they are doing the right thing in the national interest&rdquo;.  I do not recall Deputy Faulkner springing to our defence, and I do not remember <Col N="739" /> any of the Ministers or ex-Ministers, who lecture us so sententiously about the quality of Irish life, leaping to our defence either.</P>

I know it will be very hard for me to keep my patience by the time I have finished listening to Senator Ó Maoláin's views on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Brugha's point that people doing night degrees were people who were already in society is valid.  I was deflected by Senator Ó Maoláin's cheap implication that the fact that they were <Col N="740" /> working during the day disentitled them to regard from us.  That is not true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to describe it accurately.  What does Senator Ó Maoláin know about what inspired the arts faculty or the academic council or the governing body to take that decision?  He knows nothing about it.  He is drawing his own conclusions from the few academics whom he has seen on television and who give his own party a bad time. Long may they do so.  When we get in, after a while we will have to put up with the same thing.  I will put up with it patiently if I am there.</P>
      <P>Senator Brugha's point is fair enough; these people are already in society.  They are already working and to that extent they are in a different category from a school leaver.  Where Senator Brugha's point fails to answer my contention is that admitting these night students to a university course generates in them exactly the same expectations as will be generated in a school leaver who enters the university at the age of 18.  This is the point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind giving way if the Senator wants to say something, but it seems to me that it is very much the same.  The school leaver who finds himself going to the university has developed in himself the very expectations that the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O'Kennedy says are likely to be disappointed.  A man who is working during the day and sacrifices his evenings by going to college and becoming a B.A. or B.Comm. has shown ambitions and expectations of exactly the same kind, and will be subject to exactly the same machine, once he has graduated, and will probably be exposed to exactly the same disappointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not complaining about the logic behind Deputy O'Kennedy's words, because I think they are logical <Col N="741" /> enough.  I can see the point he is getting at.  What I am complaining about is that he, whether wittingly or not, presented the problem as one arising from a national responsibility which the universities themselves should bear.  I know what would be said if we axed our Arts entries by half.  I know well what would be said if University College, Dublin said &ldquo;Not only will we reduce the night students by two-thirds, but we will axe the day students by two-thirds also because the national interest requires that the number of our B.A.s should be kept down, and that you fellows should go off and become plumbers and carpenters.&rdquo;  I cannot see, judging by the record of our present Government, that anyone would spring to our defence.  I do not think it is right or proper or honest to talk about a national responsibility placed on a body receiving public money, which Ministers themselves would not defend if University College, Dublin, or any other institution were to draw the necessary conclusions from it.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that there is not a serious problem.  There is a serious problem.  I think Deputy O'Kennedy is right in pointing out that we have limited resources and that we cannot afford, either in humanity, commonsense or in economic terms, to be producing an enormous output of unemployable graduates.  We cannot and we ought not to do it.</P>
    <P>The solution to that does not lie with the governing body of the institutions. If we close the door and lock out these people, uproar will be caused.  I saw a lot of uproar two years ago in University College, Dublin, as much as many people on the other side have ever seen anywhere else.  We are used to it.  Any kind of an organisation, academic or otherwise, cannot continue in conditions of turmoil.  Turmoil is what we will get if this problem is solved piecemeal, until the Government or some Government make time and sit back and say: &ldquo;We have a large social problem on our hands deriving from the fact that people today have high expectations in regard to the standard of living.&rdquo;  Fifty years ago people did not know how well off <Col N="742" /> their next door neighbour was or how well off the people at the top of the ladder were.  Now they can see on television how well off people are, and they want to have the same amenities and they want to have &ldquo;quality&rdquo; in their lives.  They are not going to be denied it.  The only way of dealing with that problem is to take some absolutely drastic measures of an incomes policy kind which will not make everybody happy, but which will at least take the pressure of competition off the present avenues to advancement, in particular, the avenue of education.  It is not an appropriate place for it.</P>
    <P>Are we ever to have a Government here that says they are going to lay the axe to the root of competitiveness and jealousy among our various sections of the population so as to do away, not only with industrial strikes, but with social jealousy, which is just as bad?  Until we get some Government that has the knowledge and the means and the courage to do that, lecturing the universities about taking in too many potentially unemployable graduates is a waste of time.  It will solve nothing if we do that.  These people will say: &ldquo;There are the dons for you, there they are in their ivory towers, they want to be left in peace and not bothered by too many of the plain people of Ireland.&rdquo;  That is simply not true.  We do not mind turning out as many graduates as the buildings will hold.</P>
    <P>I am not complaining about our job by any means.  I will make concessions about it in a minute which I hope will soothe Senator Ó Maoláin.  Many of us work in conditions in which we would not have to work in any other country in Europe.  I do not excessivly complain about them, because, even at that, we enjoy a degree of freedom and leisure and prestige which most other professions do not enjoy.  These are very ample compensations.  Many of the people who teach in higher institutions here do work in what, by outside standards, are very difficult physical conditions; and the students work in conditions which are nearly impossible.  The situation is, of course, not so bad now in UCD with the opening of the Arts Block in Belfield.</P>

      <P>These people have to work in these conditions.  We do not mind turning out as many people with qualifications as we possibly can.  But, if it is nationally undesirable and if it is inhuman to arouse expectations in people which will not be satisfied, then it automatically becomes a political question which it is cowardly to expect the academic councils or governing bodies of universities to solve.  They cannot solve it.  It is a matter for direction and political decision of the highest level.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to waste the time of the House by advancing foolish theories, but it is not long ago since I heard someone suggest that one simple way out of the industrial troubles of this country would be to prescribe that every working man would receive exactly the same wages and the differential between them would be reflected by the fact that some of them had nicer jobs than others.  That may seem an extreme point of view, and I know it could not be defended rationally without falling into great difficulties.  However, there is something in that theory.  If you have two men, one of whom is earning £1,500 a year but works physically very hard, in dirty conditions, to earn it, and is just considered as one of the toiling masses, and the second is earning the same money as a university lecturer which confers, according to the conventions of present society, a certain standing on him, that man has a better deal and is seen to have a better deal than the first one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am far from being a doctrinaire socialist and I am not defending the solution as it stands, it is far too crude, but I would not mind a severe incomes policy in this country designed to ensure that the differential between <Col N="744" /> human beings, which will always be there, would be reflected in the fact that some jobs are nicer than other jobs.  I would not at all mind the difference in earnings being evened away to disappearance point.  A difference must always remain between people who are careful with their money, save it and provide themselves, through savings, with capital and then put the capital to whatever use they think best, and people who get money and spend it on present enjoyments.  That corresponds to two different types of human beings and you cannot provide against it.</P>
    <P>However, I would not be against an incomes policy which would even out, almost to vanishing point, the cash take-home pay of every man working in this country allowing, of course, for social welfare differentials of various kinds depending on the burdens which he has to carry and allowing for the conditions of his life which may impose burdens on him of a kind which everybody else would not carry.  I am not at all against the idea that people should be given the same wages and should be given the same opportunities, so far as money can do it, of enjoying life in the same way.  I do not think just because I am a professor I am entitled to earn three times as much as a bus driver or that a bus driver in order to earn the same wage as I do should have to work 60 to 70 hours a week.  I do not believe in that kind of theory and I would be ashamed to advance it.  When I hear people advancing such a theory in favour of their own professions I think they are completely wrong, and such a point of view is unseemly in a small Republic like ours in which class distinctions are only now beginning to appear, helped on by forces for which this party has not been responsible.</P>

      <P>I am anxious that the horrors of social competition and jealousy, which are at the bottom of most of the trouble in this country which is not of a strictly political kind, would be removed so far as it can be done politically.  I am willing that the universities should help here, but the degree to which they can help is very limited.  I want to drive this point home, as I know it will come up later in the debate.  It will solve nothing, nationally, if we simply close our doors on half the number of people who are battering to get in.  That will solve no national problem.  All it will do is turn away a large number of discontented and disaffected people who feel that society has let them down.  Those people are the classical fuel of revolution. I know Senator Ó Maoláin is not a revolutionary, and that he does not believe in revolution, but revolution is what he is likely to get if our universities turn themselves into that kind of élite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="746" /> University College, Dublin, with its great difficulties through the years, and with the difficulties of the seedy old railway station in Earlsfort Terrace to cater for 3,500 students or upwards, has never chosen that way out.  We will take as many students as we possibly can in order to discharge this national duty.  Naturally, there comes a time when the matter has to be looked at in a bigger perspective and that is what I am urging on the House now.  A political solution of a drastic kind which will cut to the root of social competition and of industrial and social unrest will be necessary before this problem can be solved.</P>
    <P>There are a number of things which can be done, one of which is, as I suggested at the beginning of my speech, to confer on the Authority the additional function of planning the absorption of graduates.  I intend to put down an amendment to that effect and I shall speak about it at greater length then.  If the Authority were equipped to plan, in the long term, for the absorption of graduates they would be contributing something towards easing this problem, although certainly not solving it in a radical way.</P>
    <P>Another thing which the universities could do&mdash;I am speaking for myself when I say this and I hope I will not engage the anger of the people who work in the same place as I do&mdash; is to scrap the slavish imitations of English universities which give the outward symbols of élitism to the university graduate here.  I have no time for this business of caps and gowns.  I never wear a gown myself when lecturing and I do not like to see my colleagues wearing them.  All this matter of caps and gowns is just aping the English, like so many other things we do.  That practice does not exist anywhere else in the world, so far as I know, except in the countries which draw their academic tradition from Britain.  The French&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No French graduate of the University of Paris or German graduate from Bonn, Heidelberg or Berlin has the kind of pomp we see <Col N="747" /> here in UCD or in Trinity on conferring day.  I know it is natural for parents to take pride in their children's achievements and I do not grudge them the pleasure of seeing their children with this external badge of success, but against that has to be weighed the mental effects of it, the effects of creating a sense of deprivation in other people.  For my part I would willingly scrap all the caps and gowns and trappings which add nothing to the academic standing of a university and serve only to encourage a sense of deprivation and jealousy, even if unconsciously, among those who have not been lucky enough to get admission to the universities.  I think an objective defence can be made in favour of wigs and gowns and I may make this point when the Courts Bill&mdash;which Senator Ó Maoláin has promised us&mdash;reaches its Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ought to get away from the differentiation of people from their neighbours by putting letters after their names.  It is often said in terms of respect about somebody that he has a string of letters after his name.  I have a string of letters after my name, but I do not feel it is any addition to me. I do not think of those letters as something which puts me above anybody else, and I always feel humiliated and exasperated when I am appealed to as being somebody, who because of academic qualifications, should be wiser than he is.  That I know is a rhetorical flourish with Senator Ó Maoláin and his friends when they say: &ldquo;The professor will not explain this to us, or he has carefully avoided explaining that, or he has made a fool of himself with regard to some other problem.&rdquo;  It is a positive disadvantage to carry these titles, and for myself I would willingly do away with them. The same can be said of the various grades within the university.  I suppose even in the army of a communist republic, there has to be some way of differentiating people according to function and seniority, but I attach no importance or value to the differentiation between lectures and assistant lecturers, readers and associate professors <Col N="748" /> and professors.  In case Senator Ó Maoláin thinks otherwise, I want to assure him I am sincere about that.  I positively dislike having this word used to me in a deferential tone.  I find it humiliating in a curious way, and I believe many other professors feel the same way about it.</P>
    <P>There are limits to the degree to which you can do away with the external symbols of differences of function and seniority.  I do not want to drive this point too hard but so far, certainly, as the badges of superiority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was trying to put it in perspective, but I realise I have gone beyond what I should have taken to be a reasonable time.  I will leave that particular topic and come to my closing words.</P>
      <P>The question of autonomy and privilege in regard to the academic life is something which has frequently been adverted to in the debate on this Bill in the Dáil and I know it will be adverted to here.  It was adverted to by Deputy O'Kennedy and it was a frequent theme of the Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Lenihan, when he was Minister for Education and of the late Minister, Deputy O'Malley, before him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not so keen on the word &ldquo;Authority&rdquo;&mdash;although I notice it was given the blessing of our party spokesman in the Dáil&mdash;because it seems to me to conflict somewhat in its overtones with the freedom which is proper to a university.  I know, and I am prepared to make the other side a present of this, that a lot of rubbish is talked in the name of university autonomy and academic freedom, certainly in the name of academic freedom, and that a good deal of what is said&mdash;some at any rate&mdash;is special pleading; but it is a positive asset to a community to have within its shores, and paid if necessary out of the public purse, a body of people who are almost irremovable <Col N="749" /> from their jobs&mdash;let me speak plainly&mdash;certainly who by convention are not easily removed.  That is a positive asset, because it gives these people a freedom to speak their minds which not many other people in the community enjoy.  Look around you and ask yourselves how many other people in the community enjoy the freedom which a university teacher enjoys, who can speak his mind without fear of the consequences.  I have sometimes heard it alleged that junior staff in the universities do not like speaking their minds because they are afraid their head of department will penalise them for it.  I have never heard of such a case myself, and I do not know any of my colleagues who would dream of doing such a thing, nor would I do it myself.  But look around you and see how many other professions enjoy that kind of freedom.</P>
    <P>A doctor has to watch his step because he may have among his clientéle, let us say, a large number of clerical patients and he may not wish to offend them.  That instantly inhibits his utterances on certain matters if he has certain opinions.  An architect or an engineer has to watch what he says very carefully.  He may be depending on the patronage of a political party or some commercial interest for his livelihood. If he opens his mouth too wide his wife and children may feel the breeze.</P>
    <P>Needless to say the same goes for the Civil Service, the Army and the police for reasons which are perfectly obvious.  But the same does not go for the university teacher and I want to acknowledge unreservedly that the university teacher to that extent is in a position of great privilege.  I would never attempt to deny that or make out that we were in some way a neglected part of the community.  We are not. We do enjoy a very substantial privilege to that degree.</P>
    <P>I could not have taken an interest in politics had I been in some other profession. It would have been very difficult for me to do so without watching the consequences.  I acknowledge freely &mdash;I will not say &ldquo;gratefully&rdquo; because I think the Irish people are entitled to no less&mdash;the advantage, from my point of view, of having that freedom.  I <Col N="750" /> should like to say that no pressure has ever been brought to bear on me by my political opponents to shut up.  I know they would like me to shut up sometimes, but I acknowledge that, so far as I know, I have never been got at unfairly by them in the context of my own job.  It would be disgraceful if they were to do so, but for what it is worth it has not been done.  That is an asset to the community.</P>
    <P>If this Government goes out and is replaced by another Government they will find it an asset, if there are people free and uncontrolled in this regard and able to speak their mind.  Deputy Faulkner, if he finds himself on the Opposition side of the House, will find it a very substantial asset indeed if there are people in university jobs who dislike the kind of Government which has succeeded Fianna Fáil and are prepared to say so publicly, and to say why they dislike it.</P>
    <P>That, to me, is a colossal public advantage, irrespective of what kind of democratic Government comes or goes. It is a persistent, continuing advantage, and the Irish people, even if they got nothing else out of university education, would be getting a great bargain if they have 1,500 or whatever it is, people there whose position renders them virtually, certainly conventionally, immune from attack or control and immune from being pressurised or repressed if they speak what they take to be the truth.  That is a terrific advantage.</P>
    <P>While I acknowledge that the people who are the immediate recipients of that advantage&mdash;the people who have these jobs&mdash;are in a position of privilege, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rest of the community and therefore, owe the community a corresponding responsibility, I want to make it perfectly clear that the existence of that profession, and its degree of freedom, is something the benefits of which must be felt by the entire community.</P>
    <P>When I find Ministers becoming impatient, as they sometimes are, with things which academics say on television or otherwise&mdash;I am not speaking about myself now, but I know Senator Ó Maoláin dislikes hearing certain things from university lecturers, <Col N="751" /> he has spoken about it here now and then&mdash;let him put himself in the position of somebody who is in opposition when the Government are out.  Suppose Senator Ó Maoláin in opposition was rejoiced every time he turned on his television set and found a university lecturer&mdash;whether clerical or otherwise&mdash;cutting the tripes out of Fine Gael in Government, would he not think differently about it then?  That is the question which he must pose to himself, and if he does so honestly he will see that the existence of a free profession of this kind is a terrific advantage to any community, and that any community which does not have it is very much the poorer.</P>

      <P>I do not want to become controversial or insulting to the other side today&mdash;we have been friendly enough up to this&mdash;but one of the reasons why I hate and detest the system of patronage in this country and backslapping and jobbery is because it makes people unfree.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am not talking about patronage in that sense. Senator Honan's idea that it would be a good thing if the freedom to speak the truth as one sees it, enjoyed by university people, were also enjoyed by the rest of the community.  I unreservedly agree with that, except for the obvious exceptions which would have to be made.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons why I hate political patronage is because it makes people keep quiet.  There are too many people in this country who have to watch what they say, because they are afraid that the loss, if they open their mouths too wide, can be computed in money, and that means in potential hardship, or in the foregoing of an advantage to themselves or their families. I do not want to go too far afield about this, but if you take the legal profession that I have spoken about already, there are people in the legal profession who could double their incomes by supporting Fianna Fáil, or pretending to support them, but they do not do it.  They do not do it.  But there is a pressure on them to do it all the time.  It is not an active pressure, but the temptation or the invitation to do so is there all the time. And that makes them less free than if there were no such temptation.  It makes them less free than if the Government work were given out on merit alone, irrespective of party affiliation.</P>

      <P>That is perfectly true.  When other Governments were in, they dispensed legal patronage on the same basis.  I do not deny that. I have never denied it.  I still say it is a rotten system and our intention is to get rid of it.  That is my intention if I am ever in a position to put it into effect.  The reason for that is to make free men out of the people in the Republic and get them up off their knees, and stop them coming crawling to Deputies and Senators and Ministers for <Col N="753" /> something which is their right or should be their right if they merited it. That is why I want it.  It is the very thing that Senator Honan is talking about.  I want the people of this Republic to be free and the freedom will come to them through&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to conclude by saying one thing about the question of advice.  This Authority is now being constituted by legislation.  There is an <i>ad hoc</i> higher education authority with the same name, An tÚdarás um Ard-Oideachas.  I hope that this Authority will not follow the example of the <i>ad hoc</i> authority or of the Minister's and his advisers over the last few years and make arrangements about higher education without taking proper advice.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to talk any longer on the principle of the merger, or the way in which the merger between the Dublin institutions was decided on.  I want to give an example, of which I have first hand knowledge, of how a process like the merger of institutions can go ahead on bases which have got nothing whatever to do with education. The original proposal of the late Deputy O'Malley on 18th April, 1967, envisaged that arts and sciences would go to the Belfield campus and that the other subjects&mdash;I am speaking from memory&mdash;would go to Trinity.  It was succeeded by further proposals by Deputy Lenihan on 6th August, 1968, in which a variation was proposed, but still involving the transfer of all law teaching to Trinity College.  Subsequently, under the pressure of this proposed solution talks were held between the two colleges and a tentative agreement was reached under which it was again provided that all the teaching of law in Dublin would be concentrated in Trinity College.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That may be a good solution or a bad solution for legal education in Dublin but I want to say this.  During <Col N="754" /> that entire period, for three years of which I was Dean on the Law Faculty of University College, Dublin, and, therefore, of the biggest law school by miles in the Republic, bigger I think than the rest of them put together, I was never once asked my opinion by anybody about whether I thought that law teaching should stay in UCD, or go to Trinity or should remain divided, nor was any of my staff formally asked by anybody for their opinion. We were never once asked by the Minister, by the Department of Education, by the Higher Education Authority, or by the authorities in our own college for our formal views on the educational content of this problem. Never once, and to this day we still have not been.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of Senator Robinson's intervention.  I was about to say, but of course not with the same authority, that I believed the same was true of Trinity College.  It may be the correct solution, but if so it will be the correct solution by accident, because the only people qualified to have a view about this&mdash;I will not say the only people&mdash;but people at any rate who are among the best qualified to have a view about it, those involved in teaching it, those who know about the problems of library resources, of staff acquisition, of potential future growth in the professions, the people who might be expected to know most about it were never asked about it, and I believe that the tentative arrangement arrived at between the two universities in regard to the various faculties has been arrived at not on academic grounds but on horse-trading grounds. That is no way to run a merger or anything else.  A commercial merger would never be conducted in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you were in charge of a large business which had several branches manufacturing different products, like ICI or something of that kind, and you considered merging with some other business, you would not just have an overall blanket scheme; you would go along to each factory, to <Col N="755" /> each plant manufacturing each product and say &ldquo;What is going to be the best thing for this aspect of our business.  It has got special needs, special conditions affect it.  What is going to be the best thing for it?&rdquo; We were never asked.</P>
    <P>I do not in any way want to preempt the question of whether the decision of the two colleges is the right one or the wrong one.  It would not be relevant to this Bill, but I want to state solemnly that the law faculty in UCD was never consulted about its views on whether the teaching of law in Dublin should be carried out either in two law schools, as at the moment, or in one, and, if in one, whether on the Trinity campus or on the Belfield campus.</P>
    <P>If the new Authority proposes to operate like that in the future, I confidently predict that it is going to make a bags of higher education.  I use that vulgar word advisedly because I hope it will get through to people who are not perhaps listening to this very carefully.</P>

    <P>That is the note on which I want to end at this stage of the debate: to recommend to the Minister to ensure, so far as he can do so, that this Authority proceed on the basis of getting advice from the people who are qualified to give it, from the best possible source.  And that it should not proceed on the basis that the grabbing of a headline or the making of a quick decision which is going to capture public imagination is the best way to handle higher education.  It is not.  It is the worst.  That was the way in which the merger proposal was first sprung on the people.  I could not compute the amount of academic damage and the <Col N="756" /> loss to pure learning or the simple diffusion of knowledge which that merger controversy generated in UCD at least over the last few years.  Countless thousands and thousands of man hours were wasted in committees, in councils, in acrimonious disputations, in discussions. It was impossible to have a cup of coffee in the place without being drawn into a discussion about the merger.  The whole thing now is a bottle of smoke.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to carry on from some of the points raised by Senator Kelly.  Particularly I should like to begin by talking for a short time about this idea of university autonomy and the autonomy of educational institutions.  Senator Kelly painted rather vividly the social problem that leads to a possible encroachment on the autonomy of academic institutions, namely that if you have a society in which a large number of people are choosing an academic stream of education for which there are no ready employment opportunities a political problem is certainly created.  Who deals with this situation? How can the educational pattern be brought into conformity with the social and economic pattern of society?  When one tries to grapple with this problem it looks as if some direction, some orientation of education is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was sorry I did not hear the first part of Senator Kelly's speech, and I <Col N="757" /> have not as yet read it, but I was surprised that in dealing with this topic of autonomy he did not raise the issue of finance.  He painted the issue solely in social and economic terms.  A major threat to autonomy in education these days springs from the financial predicament of the State in trying to finance the future of higher education.  This is the point which strikes one most forceably when reading the first Report of the present Higher Education Authority, which is linked with our discussion of the Bill here today.  In this first Report the Higher Education Authority paint a frightening picture of the finance which would be required, according to their view of things, if existing Irish education was to maintain an international standard and also if provision were to be made for the additional students which they see entering education between now and 1975.</P>
    <P>Anyone looking at these financial projections in the Report of the Higher Education Authority in a realistic way will see that money of the kind they project just will not be available.  The implications seems to be that, if this is the situation, even the business of financial restriction will mean controls on educational establishments and the development of education.  Hence, I would argue this as another way in which we may see, as it is put rather dramatically, threats to university autonomy.  The point I should like to make is&mdash;and this is not as dramatic a solution as Senator Kelly might suggest when he says it involves striking at the roots of a competitive society&mdash;that I would hope that this problem could be dealt with in a pragmatic way.  The Parliamentary Secretary at least played a useful role in underlining the problem when he spoke to the university teachers.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kelly is right in pointing out that this is not just a university problem.  I would stress the diversity of the approach to the problem.  It must be solved by a combination of effort, not only by the Department of Education and by the Higher Education Authority, but also by the universities and educational institutions. <Col N="758" /> Through many of the detailed recommendations of the Commission on Higher Education have been left behind along the way as we move on to implement in legislation some of its recommendations, I found, in reading the Report of the Commission on Higher Education at least from what is said in chapter 18 on &ldquo;The State and the Institutions of Higher Education&rdquo; that a valuable working spirit is there to be followed.  Although this legislation differs in some way from the recommendations of the Commission on Higher Education, it is important that the authority and our educational system work within the spirit suggested and recommended by the Commission.  I might quote from page 480, where the Commission make it quite clear that, even when there might be an Authority, responsibility for the actual provision of higher education would continue to rest on the institutions jointly and severally.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Commission would not lessen the importance of individual institutions, diminish their responsibility, or detract from their functions.  The Commission, therefore, would not be a superior element in the system, nor would it be given excessive power. Its standing, however, could not be less than that we propose for it.</P>
    <P>I support the standing proposed by the Commission and it is a standing which we find in the legislation before us.  In dealing with the problems of higher education and indeed in discussing this Bill, we must realise that we are dealing with a situation in which we are not creating a new institution which will &ldquo;carry the can&rdquo; for higher education; we are creating a new institution which we hope will play a constructive and dynamic role in the inter-relationships in education between the State, the Authority and the educational institutions concerned.</P>
    <P>In this context the way in which I see some possibility of ameliorating the situation which I have described, which seems to pose a threat to educational autonomy, is by a process of mutual exchange of ideas and information between the parties of higher education <Col N="759" /> and by consultation and contact with some bodies and organisations outside education.</P>
    <P>When one talks, as Senator Kelly does, in terms of the social problems of education and the social aspirations of students, one is talking about aspirations which spring from family life&mdash; family life which recognises that education in this complicated world is not a matter of getting an absolute scientific assessment of the aptitudes of a child and slotting that child into a perfect placement.  That ideal is not practicable. We are living our family life in a world which is subject to market pressures, where there cannot be a range of opportunity that will meet the full complex range of ability of our children and where, even today, with the growth of counselling and guidance in our schools, we are not even within shouting distance of mastering the problem of assessing in a definitive way the ability of our children.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to talk of the situation as it is now and the sort of problems that the Higher Education Authority and people dealing with higher education have to deal with.  Parents discussing the situation with their children, who may be potential students of a college of technology or university students, will be discussing the availability of places in different subjects; they will be discussing the career prospects facing those particular subjects; they will also be influenced, to some extent, by what they read in the newspapers and hear on television about economic trends and what is likely to be a good line in the future.  They will also be influenced to some extent by the advice and guidance they get from whatever sources may be available.  It should be ensured that the best possible realistic information is channelled into this complex situation.  That is, information about the economic and social trends <Col N="760" /> of our society in the future.  By doing that alone we shall help to remove the possibility of any severe constraint on educational institutions to provide particular types of education.  We may also help to channel the market forces in such a way that many of the problems which face our society will be dealt with in an informal way.  For example, it is very important that the Department of Labour give more publicity to the work they are doing in the manpower field, in their projections for certain areas and patterns of employment in the future, and also in the development of a proper youth employment service.</P>
    <P>In the sort of situation which I have described, if it becomes part of general knowledge that future trends and opportunities lie mainly in the technological area, for example and if this becomes part of the general factual understanding of the way our society is going, it will create a demand in parents and students for a particular type of education.  It will tend to eliminate many of the ridiculous snob values which now prevent people from considering certain types of career or certain types of education for their children.  Proper understanding between all our educational institutions and the proper exchange of information between the higher education authorities, the universities, and the community at large, about economic trends in society will help us in a major way in the future to make better use of our resources.  It will also help us to produce a pattern of education which will serve our society more effectively.</P>
    <P>There may be nothing dramatic about this and it may sound extremely vague, but I certainly think that an appreciation of the facts in the world at large helps people to arrange their affairs more effectively.  Many academics, when they get extremely concerned about matters like autonomy, are concerned in a vacuum.  They are not aware of the needs of the society around them and in many instances, as underlined by the Commission on Higher Education, they are not prepared to recognise their responsibility to society.</P>
    <P>We are at an interesting situation in <Col N="761" /> our society where, because of the dramatic advances that have been made in education and because of the political importance which has been given to education, there now seems to be a general agreement about the objectives of education in our community.  It is interesting that in the Bill before us the general functions of the Higher Education Authority are functions on which everyone would be agreed and which most people would accept.  The Bill has been amended during its passage through the Dáil.  Many feel that the aim of the Authority to promote the democratisation of the structure of higher education is an extremely advanced aim for the Authority and it is valuable that this aim is now included.</P>
    <P>In this connection I am strongly in favour of student participation in the governing of their own institutions and, indeed, in discussing the future of education.  I am speaking from experience because I have acted as secretary, in a university, to a committee which was set up with a students majority, to advise the board and council of the college on virtually any matter of interest to the students.  My experience as secretary of this committee has been entirely favourable.  I regard this as proof of the point that if you want people to participate, and to learn responsibility for participating in the government of any organisation, the best thing to do is to give them the opportunity to participate.  That is education in itself.  Many of the students who have frightened so many people away from student participation and have created such a bad image for university students in society are people who, apparently, are opposed to everything and are particularly opposed to all institutions of government.  But their opposition is often based entirely on ignorance.  They have no idea at all what it is like in practice to participate as a member of the committees and governing bodies, which they attack, attempt to drag down and overthrow completely.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that it may cause some difficulties initially, if some of these students can be given the experience of the practical working of the institutions that they appear to be so <Col N="762" /> anxious to smash, they will learn that, though it involves a lot more time than they anticipated, though it involves their doing a lot more homework in study of facts and figures and background than they anticipated, these various channels which originally they had regarded as rigid, closed and authoritarian bodies, are, in fact, working democracies inside our democracy. They will learn that, if you are to put forward a point of view in a way that it will be understood and have effect, you have to do your homework, you have to be prepared to attend meetings, you have to be prepared to listen to the other person's point of view.</P>
    <P>In working on a committee with a student majority given a responsible task, I have found that this is often the impact, even on students who appeared to typify everything that is rebellious in a student.  As soon as they see that institutions are working in a spirit of goodwill they are prepared to take on the responsibility involved and work, by and large, in an effective and constructive way.  I say &ldquo;by and large&rdquo; because, naturally, from time to time, there can be breaches of confidence, there can be leakages to the newspapers and this kind of thing.  This can be a problem.  However, it is true that in institutions of higher education and many so-called confidential bodies one is just as likely to find an academic who is ready to break confidence and leak stories to the newspapers.  This problem of confidentiality and of responsibility is not one confined to students alone.</P>
    <P>I know the point of view I have put forward is not one with which everyone agrees.  People are very apprehensive about the short term implications of what the democratisation of education may mean.  I am completely satisfied that in the long run this is certainly the way in which we will build up a full spirit of participation in our community in other institutions as well as in higher education.</P>
    <P>Another point that I should like to underline is that this Higher Education. Authority will not be concerned exclusively with university education. Unfortunately, in this House it is quite possible that many of us will tend to speak about university problems.  Nor <Col N="763" /> is the allocation of grants the be all and the end all of this Higher Education Authority.  They will have a much wider field of responsibility in dealing with institutions other than the universities. I commend the role envisaged by the Commission on Higher Education for this Authority.</P>
    <P>In this context it is difficult to talk about the Higher Education Authority Bill entirely on its own.  In a sense, the Bill, as it affects the university problem must be considered in conjunction with the Bills to establish the new universities and also the Bill to establish the conference of Irish universities. Probably some of the detailed points of autonomy in higher education will be better discussed when we are dealing with that legislation.</P>
    <P>There is one other Bill concerned with higher education to which I look forward, and that is a Bill which will spring from some of the recommendations made in the First Report of the Higher Education Authority.  They made these recommendations even before they published this First Report. These are the recommendations to do with the setting up of a Council for National Awards.  I hope that this legislation will be before us as soon as possible because I think the Council for National Awards will offer a feeling of status and an additional challenge for our institutes of technical education.  Here is an example of the type of thing I was speaking of at the outset: the fact that there will be a National Council for Awards, which may provide awards of degree standard to students from technical institutions, could be a factor in persuading more people to enter the technical field.  It may be for the wrong reason admittedly, but I do not think we should be too concerned if it is a part of a general pattern we are trying to achieve and in which we are trying to recognise and guide as benevolently as we can the frailties of human beings.</P>
    <P>I hope when the Council for National Awards is established its work may not be confined simply and solely to the technical area.  I often think&mdash;and this is a point relevant to the quality of life about which Senator Kelly spoke&mdash;that in society part of <Col N="764" /> the satisfaction and challenge for many men and women, and particularly Arts graduates who find themselves in jobs which do not give them an opportunity to use the studies which they have obtained earlier on, might well be the opportunity of further study for a higher degree.  Such further study at present may be quite difficult or impossible for them if they do not live in an urban centre or fit into the context in which higher degree studies are organised in our universities.</P>
    <P>I should hope that the Council for National Awards might make it possible for Arts graduates with aspirations towards higher degree study, not necessarily in the field of technology, to get higher degree recognition for work which they might do over a period of years following up a particular piece of research or interest, provided that the standard is still the international standard of recognition that is achieved in the more orthodox pattern of university education.</P>

      <P>The present Bill seems, quite rightly, to be giving rise to a rather useful general discussion based on the HEA and ranging a fair bit over the universities and their problems such as employment potential and so on.  In some ways it is rather unfortunate that in discussing higher education we have not got before us the outline of the plan for the development of the higher educational system as a whole.  We are still awaiting the Government decision on the joint proposals made by the NUI/ TCD delegations.  Until we know the attitude of the Government to that it is rather difficult to be quite certain of the exact role of the Higher Education Authority.  Likewise, it is agreed that we need, associated with this largely financial body, an academic body, a council of Irish universities, which will bring the university groups together in discussions on academic matters. Thereby, they will advise the Higher Education Authority on the academic significance of their problems.  It is a very necessary part of the rational development of our higher education system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concede that we could not expect to have all of this plan before us and accordingly I am asking the Minister <Col N="765" /> to regard this Bill as a type of an interim Bill.  It seems to fit in with the general ideas that most bodies have of the role of the Higher Education Authority.  It would be worth our while, when the complete pattern comes before us in a year or two, to take a look again at the Higher Education Authority; and if there is need to amend or alter any of their functions &mdash;the alteration perhaps being suggested by the eventual organisation that emerges in the other bodies&mdash;we should proceed to do so.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give an assurance, in his reply, to the Seanad that we will have another look at the Higher Education Authority when the other Bills come before us.  Many of us would have preferred if the Higher Education Authority could have dealt solely with university education, with the financing of the universities, but the Government decision is that the Authority must deal with the whole third level complex.  I hope that decision will not give rise to any difficulties or tensions within the HEA.</P>
    <P>It is now almost three years since the HEA was set up and indeed it had a very dubious start.  The conditions imposed on the members at the time were resented, and quite rightly so, by most thinking people because there were some ministerial pronouncements at the time which almost suggested that the members of the Authority were bound hand and foot by the decision of the Government of 6th July, 1968, which was that they were there solely to advise the Government on the implementation of these proposals.  Fortunately, the members at the time responded magnificently to the pressure brought to bear on them by the then Minister.  The result was a confrontation and the issuing of a statement by the members of the HEA on their role.  That statement is contained on page 28 of the First Report of the HEA and it contains also the statement of the Minister on 12th September.  The HEA were determined then to function as an autonomous body and would function as such in the interim period pending the introduction of formal legislation.  It was in no way an executive arm of the Government or of any Department of <Col N="766" /> State.  That was the Minister's statement at the time but it was largely got by the persistence and tenacity of the members of the HEA at that time. They are to be congratulated on their stand.  Since then they have shown themselves to be a very independently minded body and I have been very happy with the contribution they have made.  The HEA have been very fortunate in their chairman who has always been a devoted servant of education and he is doing an excellent job of work.</P>
    <P>I had the privilege, with a delegation from the NUI, of meeting the Authority and we were all very impressed by their approach, although there was more than a suggestion that they felt they were still tied by the 6th of July proposal.  However, that seems to be in the past because the two universities came together and, after three months of discussion and exploration of the problem, arrived at a unanimous agreement on the pattern for the future.  That pattern for the future, based on four independent coordinated co-operating universities, is the real answer to the problem.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Government need appear unduly worried about appearing to have to change their minds on the original O'Malley plan.  The O'Malley merger plan was very necessary to bring the universities together and to get them to accept the coordination and close co-operation that the NUI/TCD proposals envisaged.  In fact, without the O'Malley merger plan the proposals from the joint universities would have aroused a storm in the universities.  That storm would not have raged against the Minister but against the negotiators who came up with that solution.  The Minister, and all those interested in higher education, should regard this as the end product in the evolution of a system where the victory is for commonsense and rationalisation in the modern context.  With that approach I feel happy that the stage is set for the future and the HEA, as proposed here, fit very well into that context.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to get on with the job.  Time is passing and already we have suffered from too long a delay, but perhaps a delay is <Col N="767" /> better than a wrong solution.  Now that the right solution has been found&mdash;a solution, the NUI/TCD proposals, based on co-operation and freely arrived at and accepted by the bodies concerned&mdash;I would ask the Minister to let us have a Government decision quickly on this matter.</P>
    <P>Most of the points of the Bill on which I have some reservations may be better dealt with on Committee Stage.  I am always worried about complete reliance on the State and the fact that in a body, such as An tÚdarás, all the members are nominated and appointed by the Government.  That is assuming a government of angels and a continuation of that heavenly system. We all know, in the past, in nominations to governing bodies and so forth &mdash;nominees had to carry your party card on their chest.  It did not matter whether it was Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.  We always had on the governing body of University College, Cork, and I am sure on most other governing bodies, a stalwart party representative from the party in power.  When the inter-Party Government took power in 1954 they changed the representative and the man who was appointed was an openly acknowledged and prominent member of their party.  That has been the response of the Government in the past to appointing Government representatives on the governing bodies of the universities, apart from the few <i>ex officio</i> members of those bodies.  On our governing body in Cork we have Dr. Lucey and Dr. Perdue, who are more or less <i>ex officio</i> members of the governing body.  Whenever there is a chance of rewarding a party man it is done through this means.</P>
    <P>I am not for a moment suggesting that we have not been well served in Cork by some very prominent members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They have contributed a great deal to the university, but whenever a change in the membership was due many of the prominent members of the party in Cork city decided they wanted to become Government representatives on the governing body, and they made a straightforward canvass to the Minister for the vacant position.  Fortunately, <Col N="768" /> a student had to be appointed this time and that gives us three <i>ex officio</i> members and does not leave us any room for party representation.</P>
    <P>That is a tradition, of political patronage, that we have got and therefore, that tradition will, unfortunately, strive to build itself into the HEA in the years to come.  Indeed I know academics who make no secret at all of the fact that they got on certain commissions and bodies because they knew the Minister concerned.  They may not be fully identified politically but they are not unidentifiable either.</P>
    <P>The members concerned have many excellent qualities but acceptance to the party has been the predominent asset.  I hope on Committee Stage I may be able to move some amendments on this.  I would have preferred some type of direct nomination from the institutions concerned, though to my surprise the institutions concerned do not seem to be anxious to take them.  I do not know why.</P>
    <P>There is an intermediate position in this by which there could be a pool of names submitted to the Minister from various bodies, the universities and others.  Perhaps the Minister might have a pool of, maybe, twice the number or three times the number required, from which he would be compelled to select.  That would go some way towards calming the fears of many who feel there will be an unholy scramble by some academics in the future to get on the HEA.</P>
    <P>At present we are assured by the Minister that he will reappoint in block the present HEA to function as the first statutory body.  I understand the Minister has given that assurance and, if he has not given it, I hope he will give it in his reply.</P>
    <P>Seven academics are mentioned out of 18 and it seems the tendency is to treat the seven as a minimum number. That number, I hope, will never be treated as a minimum number.  I think it is as far-fetched to believe in the academics ganging up together as a theory that was advanced here when the health boards were being set up, that the politicians of all parties would gang up together against the poor unfortunate <Col N="769" /> non-politicians.  It is exactly the same in the case of the universities. I do not anticipate anything like that happening.</P>
    <P>We are discussing, in conjunction with this Bill, the First Report of the Higher Education Authority.  Later I will move formally that we note this report.  The report itself was quite an interesting document.  It seemed to frighten some because of the sums involved, some £24 million over a period up to 1977.  This is just part of facing up to the commitment the Government gave, first of all, concerning post-primary education for everyone and then the fact that everyone had the right to go to the university with the qualifications involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the suspension of business I had come to the First Report of the Higher Education Authority.  The time has come when the Government and the nation have got to face up to the implications of the social policy being pursued by the Government in education.  The greatly increased numbers in the post-primary sectors and the increased numbers going into the university call for adequate resources to meet this challenge. The Government have singularly failed to do that.  The Report of the HEA places the demand for university places at an increase from 15,000 to 30,000 in the decade from 1970 to 1980.  Having examined what places were available the Report comes to the conclusion that there are 7,000 unprovided for.  That costs real money and their estimate is that it should cost £24 million. This is a realistic estimate for that number of university places.  It can be checked against costs in England, North of Ireland or elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was bordering on insolence the quick way the building unit of the Department of Education came back and said &ldquo;Nonsense, we can provide those places for £15 million.&rdquo;  No professional group of planners or builders would accept such a ridiculous estimate.  The fact is the figures from the HEA stand.  They stand at £24 million but what has to be questioned and questioned very strongly is can the <Col N="770" /> country afford all those places in the university system?  Has the time not come to face up and severely restrict numbers in the universities?  It has to be all part of an overall manpower policy because the Government have gone on to suggest that university education is the be-all and the end-all of every endeavour and to promulgate the idea that students are failures if they do not succeed in getting from the post-primary system to the university.  While all this has been happening no efforts have been made to attract people to the posts that have been previously filled from the leaving certificate honours.  I refer to the recruitment to the Civil Service and other such posts which in the past competed with the few university scholarships that were available for the cream of the talent coming from the leaving certificate. But today these posts have largely been taken by those who have not the talent to get university scholarships, even with the greatly increased number that are there.  Obviously, we cannot build on such a foundation.  The manning of the Civil Service and of the ESB and of all other such bodies depended on leaving certificate recruitment.  We cannot consciously depress the level of recruitment into these bodies without disastrous consequences to the future of the economy.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the solution is either that we face up to making recruitment to these bodies attractive and make it again begin to compete for the best brains from the leaving certificate, or that we take a good deal of the recruitment to these bodies from the pass degree stream.  There is nothing to be disparaged about the pass degree stream because it consists largely of students who got four, five and six honours in the leaving certificate and is comparable to a very good honours performance in the leaving certificate. It is just that, while in the leaving certificate, I think, one out of three students gets an honours rating, in the university, especially in the Arts faculty, the rating is scarcely one out of 12.  Only the very few succeed in making the honours degree.  Consequently, far from despising the pass degree stream, we should regard it as the regular stream coming from the <Col N="771" /> university and one from which the State should be seeking to recruit into the various employment avenues.  We should have a mixture of both types of recruitment&mdash;from the leaving certificate, and the pass degrees.  We find in England, France and other countries that of students qualified and seeking university places less than half can be provided for and the others have to go elsewhere.  We should not despise any student who succeeds in obtaining a degree.  Some of the best engineers, holding very responsible positions, have come from the bottom of the class.  The talent is there but our economy cannot absorb it.  We have to accept the fact that many people who are capable of holding professional jobs cannot be absorbed into our economy.  We have to do some type of realistic manpower forecasting as to where our numbers go.</P>
    <P>The most inexact science we have at the present is manpower forecasting. You might as well gaze into a crystal ball and would come up with as good an answer.  This applies to other countries too.  One would think some kind of calculation could be made as to the number of medical men required.  Holland spent large research funds on this 12 years ago.  Their estimates have not even been good guesses.  The Department who advised the Parliamentary Secretary were out of touch with reality when they accused the universities of failing to plan for these 1,600 higher diploma students who had taken the examination this year.  No such planning could be done in that, or any other, group.  It is a four year course. Four years ago in 1967, the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley, God rest his soul, was in full flight&mdash;only the sky was the limit and education was to expand in all directions.  If you look back on the speeches in this House, the biggest obstacle to the fulfilment of what he planned at that stage was not finance but the scarcity of trained teaching personnel in all ranks.  The advice of every responsible person then was that the numbers in the teaching profession was totally inadequate.  There is always room for more there.  Who were at fault then?  The blame lies squarely with the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="772" /> We put up grandiose schemes about education, having got this development branch, which is a complete abortion of the idea of a development branch, as given in the Lynch Report, <i>Investment in Education</i>.  Many seek comprehensive education, with all sorts of pick and choose facilities available to students, which are not to be confined to just a few subjects.  Face the realities of this.  It surely requires more trained personnel.  The trained people are there today.  They have had their preliminary training.  They can be trained for any one of those other specialist activities whether it is guidance or any one of the various facets of what comes under comprehensive education.  They can be trained and made available in a few years to teach our post-primary students.  But, like the dole, the Government will not make the money available for this.</P>
    <P>There are 200,000 post-primary students with 10,000 teachers.  By the comprehensive standards of comprehensive education existing in the USA 10,000 is totally inadequate.  You have just to talk with any of the post-primary teachers and visit the schools to see how overworked they are. Twenty students per teacher calls for classes of 40 and 50 in many cases.  A teacher, especially at post-primary level, is not like a perpetual motion machine.  Any rational system calls for at most 16 or 17 hours contact with the students.  If the teacher is to counsel and advise, if he has to keep all the reports of which the development branch are so enamoured, he will have to spend many hours per week on that work.  He will have to spend many hours interviewing parents.  These are all excellent activities, but call for greatly increased number of teachers to carry them out.</P>
    <P>We have not, by any stretch of the imagination, a surplus of trained teachers.  There is a definite reluctance on the part of the Government to put up the money that is necessary to use those teachers.  At present, the graph of our enrolment to post-primary education is increased at about 5 or 6 per cent per annum and is expected to increase more.  We expect that our population is going to increase, with the Common Market, all of which calls <Col N="773" /> for an increase in the teaching body associated with our schools.  That is common sense.  If we break down the 1,600 who are taking the examination this year, perhaps 1,400 will get the examination between summer and autumn.  Of that 1,400 the ordinary losses, due to deaths, marriages, retirements and so on from a teacher body of 10,000&mdash;even with the fact that the body is a bit young&mdash;would require at least 300 new teachers under this heading alone.  Take a 5 per cent increase in student numbers.  To project it for next year, to maintain even the same teacher numbers, to have the same teacher coverage in schools, would require 5 per cent of the 10,000 which is another 500.  That is 100 accounted for.  If you have 400 or 500 left, admittedly it would cost £1 million, rising to £1½ million, per annum to employ those.  However, 500 put into a student body of 10,000 only improves the ratio just one in 20.  In other words it would give the overworked teachers in our post-primary schools an additional 1½ hours per week free to talk with parents, to keep records, to give guidance to the students.  How much can they do under those three headings in 1½ hours a week?  Or who is going to do it?  These are the realities of the situation and I am calling on the Government to face up to those realities.</P>
    <P>Again, take the 7,000 additional places that the HEA is looking for in the university system in the next decade.  It is pretty well certain that the economy cannot employ those as graduates. Therefore, the decision that has to be made is: have the numbers to be restricted, and restricted considerably, due to this fact?  Or else, do we face up to the fact that university education at any level is good in itself, and therefore that the student who can make it, and given the opportunity, has got something that will be valuable to him in whatever career he follows later?  At that stage we should be able to get some of the frontier spirit into our graduates.  That is they should regard the degree as merely a continuation of their education and they should be prepared to tackle anything that came afterwards.  We are lacking very much in that spirit at present and it is one of the most progressive forces in <Col N="774" /> the American economy, where graduates diversify their training and are prepared to tackle any job that arises.</P>
    <P>There is a great responsibility on the State to face up to the fact that each year we are going to deliberately have a redundancy problem in emerging university graduates.  Many of those will be what are called the lower pass graduates and these are the four and five honour boys and girls from the leaving certificate.  Therefore, they have quite a valuable potential for our economy.  However as they come from our system, we are not able to absorb them in the regular channels.  At the same time, if then we can identify areas where manpower is needed, surely we need to provide for graduates the counterpart of the redundancy training that is carried out by AnCO and others for workers who find that their line of work is not what is required at the time.  Why cannot that be done with our graduates?  It is fashionable to say that we need technicians and that we more need people trained in many technical areas, and that many of those doing pass degrees should be pushed out or encouraged to transfer to technical colleges.  However, we are a democracy and students must have some freedom of choice.  Besides we cannot predict what human beings will do nor can we evaluate them with anything like the precision that is purported to be feasible by advocates of career guidance.</P>
    <P>If we need more technicians or more people with any particular skill, and if they are not materialising through the ordinary channels, from the leaving certificate, what is wrong with squarely facing the fact that some students have spent three years in a university and have received a broader and more general type of training than they would have received if they had gone direct to the technical colleges immediately after leaving certificate?  They are then deficient in the required technical skills, but what is wrong with giving them a crash course for six months or a year.  Eventually, the country would have a broader trained person, that would be a little more expensively trained than if he could have been sent direct by the all wise <Col N="775" /> State to the appropriate technical college in the first instance.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem in the pass leaving certificate stream.  We are all aware of the heartbreak of students who do not pass with honours and who cannot, therefore, go to a university. In many cases, this means putting off a work decision for an additional three or four years.  Many people say: &ldquo;They were taking useless academic subjects where they should have been taking more technical subjects, such as drawing, electrical and machine work, etc.&rdquo; Let us accept that.  Is it too late after completion of the leaving certificate to proceed to do in six months or a year what could have been acquired in the preceding two years in a more technical type of course?  If we need technicians, is that not the way to get them?</P>
    <P>In our economy we have excellent brains but few opportunities for using them to their full potential&mdash;opportunities that are available in big industrial countries like America or Germany. I am appealing for flexibility in approach.  We should not have the idea that we can pigeonhole our children at every stage of their careers.  We should have as many retraining courses or reorientation courses as possible at every stage.  This does not end at leaving certificate or at degree level. We have recognised that in industry it is part and parcel of a modern industrial set-up to have strong emphasis on retraining of workers to alleviate the inevitable redundancies.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford to allow everybody in the country who is capable of profiting by a university education to have one.  This is the harsh reality. Even England and America, and other wealthy countries, cannot afford this open ended commitment.  We should have a real down to earth approach. We totally reject the ideas which were mooted by the Parliamentary Secretary in education in his speech that the university&mdash;or anybody else&mdash;is able to select students and advise them, with any precision, where jobs can be obtained four or more years in advance. Yet this is the type of guidance for which the students are looking. <Col N="776" /> Most ordinary students have an aptitude for quite a few lines.  The higher their IQ, the more diverse the careers they are capable of pursuing.</P>
    <P>Any of us who have had experience of advising should be humble enough to say that the crystal ball is almost as good as the long-range advice we can give.  The numbers of students attending university have grown but the provision made by the Department of Finance is worse now per student than it was three years ago.  It was recognised three years ago that there should be more staff to give a modern education in our universities.  The staff ratio as given by the Commission on Higher Education is 1:19; in Northern Ireland it is 1:9; in England it is 1:7.  Is it any wonder that the staff in Queen's University and in Coleraine are not enamoured with joining forces with their weaker brethren across the Border?  Do they step down to our level or can we hope to rise up to meet them even half way?</P>
    <P>The Commission on Higher Education recommend that we should aim at a ratio of 1:12, which is substantially more than the British system but yet is a realistic target for us.  If that is a realistic target, then the provision by the Government through the Department of Finance should provide a certain percentage increase each year to bridge the existing gap over a ten year period.  Yet the staff ratio is worse today than it was three years ago in all our institutions.  Is this the type of progress that the late Donogh O'Malley envisaged when he made such ambitious pronouncements about university education?  We are a weak, small country with a scarcity of finance, but we must be realists.  We cannot expect the Irish university system to continue to compete with the system in the Six Counties or elsewhere unless we provide somewhat comparable resources.  I am not suggesting that we reach the British system but we must improve substantially on what we have.</P>
    <P>Senator Keery asked that the Authority should plan for the absorption of graduates into our economy. Surely this is something that should rest at Government level.  They should plan for all students, whether they are <Col N="777" /> of leaving certificate standard or of university standard.</P>
    <P>I was taken by some of Senator Kelly's comments, especially by his attack on some of the ceremonial occasions in the university.  I thought that he should have a sense of humour and recognise that even political parties like to let off steam and have victory celebrations.  The students who have worked hard deserve a pat on the back, which is essentially what the conferring ceremony does.  The students' parents deserve it also because they have usually worked hard to provide the resources to keep their children at the university.  I do not see anything very undemocratic in such well deserved celebrations.  If Senator Kelly is worried about graduation ceremonies he should keep a sharp watch on the development branch of the Department of Education, which is so pro-American and slavishly copy everything that happens in America because in many schools in the USA there are even graduation ceremonies from kindergarten !</P>
    <P>I was wondering why the Senator seemed to suggest that people might benefit only through their savings.  If people are all paid equally, some can be more prudent with their savings than others and therefore by that means they can afford something more. Surely the young boys and girls who spend from the age of 16 to 22 or 23 working hard at their studies, are doing hard work which calls for a great deal of self discipline?  Most people think of students in terms of relaxation and enjoyment, but I can guarantee that the average student works far harder and makes many more sacrifices during his course than the person who finishes his education at 16 or 17 years of age and then enters a job.  The student makes many sacrifices and it is something that deserves recognition.  If a degree means anything it is that it has increased his capacity to be of service to the community, be it in administration, planning, engineering, teaching, or medical service, and in this case, too, the labourer is worthy of his hire.</P>
    <P>By any standards, I think we have a relatively classless society here and a society where, by and large, people are able, if they work hard enough, to <Col N="778" /> reach the heights of whatever profession or career they choose to follow. If we go back and examine the back-brounds of the leaders in the various professions we will find the vast majority came from very humble homes and that they had to struggle and work hard to reach the top.  There are tremendous opportunities here for people who are prepared to work hard. The trouble is that most of those who are planning in this country are trying to do it without introducing hard work. I can vouch that in a university the staff and students work hard by any national standards.  The failures are the few who abuse their privileges and their autonomy, and they are obvious to everyone.  The man who works in his laboratory until 12 o'clock or 1 o'clock in the morning is not obvious. Again, I would ask for a little more appreciation from the general public of the devoted work being done in our universities.  We should all realise that we are in a small country with very limited opportunities.  Hard work and co-operation alone can improve those opportunities.</P>
    <P>Most of the other points I wish to make can be left over until Committee Stage.  However, in the report there is the rather political question of the Limerick Higher Institute.  Again, I think realism is called for here.  Realism means that Limerick must walk before it can run and if Limerick, over the next five to ten years, can provide good diploma courses which are integrated with industry in the area, types of sandwich courses, it will be contributing a great deal to the country.  At present we are turning out too many graduates and I do not see any function in this regard for Limerick during the next ten years.  After that time I hope the economy will have strengthened and grown to the extent that, within 20 years, we will be in a position to establish a full university in Limerick.  In the meantime, I would appeal for realism by all in developing the Limerick Higher Institute.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, is mian liom tagairt a dhéanamh do ráiteas an Aire sar ar thosnaigh an dhíospóireacht seo an tseachtain seo caite.  Dúirt sé:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="779" /> Tá sé ráite agam cheana ach chreidim gur fiú é a rá athuair gur aonad amháin é an t-oideachas.</P>
    <P>Táim cinnte gur fíor é sin agus nach bhfuil dul thairis.  Is maith liom ar an ócáid seo gur luaigh sé an pointe sin mar is íontach an rud le rá é, <i>mirabile dictu</i>, go bhfuil daoine ann fós a cheapann gur féidir an t-oideachas a roint ina chodanna.  Is fíor go mbíonn scoileanna áirithe ag plé le leanaí suas go dtí a 12 nó a 13 de bhlianta, ansan scoileanna eile óna 13, abraimis, go dtí a 18 agus ansin scoileanna eile óna 18 go dtí, abraimis, 21, 22 nó 23, ach, mar sin féin, is fíor gur aonad amháin an t-oideachas. Bíonn an t-oideachas i gceist ó thagann an leanbh ar an saol agus fiú amháin deireann a lán siceolaithe go mbíonn tionchar ar an leanbh i mbroinn a máthar sara dtagann sé ar an saol in aon chor ón timpeallacht agus is cinnte go leanann an t-oideachas san go bhfaigheann an duine bás.  Aon oideachasóir tríd na haoiseanna gur fiú trácht air bhí an tuairim chéanna aige agus má théimid siar go dtí na Gréigigh bhí an tuairim sin acu go láidir.  Pé scéal é, beidh mé ag cur síos ar an nGréig agus ar na Gréigigh agus ar an gcóras oideachais a bhí acu níos déanaí ach rachaidh mé ar aghaidh go dtí leathanach a 2 de ráiteas an Aire ar mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh dó:</P>
    <P>The necessity for some method of co-ordinating the development of higher education, of eliminating wasteful overlapping and of ensuring that the substantial sums of State money invested annually in higher education would be used to the best advantage has been recognised by many people for quite a considerable time.</P>
    <P>That is one of four very important statements I picked out of the Minister's address.  Concern has been expressed already by various speakers regarding the amount of money available for higher education and I assume, by implication, for education in general.  It must be admitted, and the facts prove it, that no Government, since this State came into existence, has been more liberal as far as educational <Col N="780" /> needs and the financing of them are concerned than the present Government. Problems arise, and will continue to arise, mainly because of the Government's concern that every child, irrespective of class, creed or any other environmental circumstance, will have the chance of developing his potential to the fullest.  Because of the Government's concern in this matter, probblems of finance and accommodation will arise.  Since our country has limited means we must use the best brains we have and address ourselves to the task of getting the most sensible, practical, economical and efficient system possible so that the best education can be got by those who are able to partake of it at the most reasonable outlay possible.</P>
    <P>Other countries have their problems in these matters.  Our near neighbour Britain, for example, has colossal problems in education at all levels.  We have to face the fact that we cannot compete with Britain in the matter of finance.  We are a comparatively poor country as far as wealth, in the sense of what used be called pounds, shillings and pence&mdash;pounds and pence now&mdash;is concerned.  We have other kinds of wealth but England has old money and old wealth.  We must face our problems in our own way, solve them in our own way and cut our cloth according to our measure.</P>
    <P>Later on, I will have some suggestions to offer as to how we could meet the needs particularly of those who are interested in higher education at a far more economical rate than would be the case if some of the suggestions already made by other speakers were adopted.</P>
    <P>In section 3 of the Bill there are subsections (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e).  I am very interested in subsection (e) which reads:</P>
    <P>(e)  promoting the democratisation of the structure of higher education.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I am sure, when replying will explain that fully.  I have my own ideas of what it means.  I was rather disappointed at the approach of a number of speakers.  They seemed to assume that higher education had to deal solely and only with education at universities.  We will deal with that point later on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> The last point I should like to refer to in connection with the Minister's speech is where he says:</P>
    <P>I have already stated and I repeat that the concept of university autonomy is one which must be restricted in any society which had ears for academic principles.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of people, possibly a number of Senators, and perhaps a number of visitors in the Gallery were rather astonished when, earlier in the debate, one of the Senators referred to the extraordinary privileges that academics have.  It was stated that when a person becomes a university professor or lecturer he retains that status irrespective of any views, no matter how extraordinary the views are, he may put forward about any subject under the sun.  It is a very wide power and thank God it has not been abused in this country so far.  Certainly the academics we have in this House are men who would never abuse what privileges they have.  They are men of the highest integrity and I should like to pay that tribute to them now. We are very lucky to have such men here in the Upper House.</P>
    <P>The Minister points out that the university has a dual responsibility. It has a responsibility to pure learning and one to the society which sustains it.  There we are landed right into the square marked &ldquo;society in which we live&rdquo;, the society in which we would like to live.  No man can escape from his environment.  We in this country get our philosophy, our outlook and our traditions from streams coming from Greece, Rome, Judea and from the extraordinary Celtic streams that seems to have come from the mists of long ago in this island.  We might be described as Christian Celtic or Celtic/Christian&mdash;I never know really which it should be.</P>
    <P>The stream dominating education in Western Europe, of course, came from Greece, Rome and Judea&mdash;and when I say Judea I mean that Christianity came from there.  The Romans had very little impact here except the impact they made through the coming of Christianity.  The amazing thing about it is that, while we did not seem to have any direct contact with Greece, <Col N="782" /> except through the Fir Bolg, our thinking often runs parallel to the thinking of philosophers of old Greece. I have often noticed a striking similarity between the Greeks and ourselves. If one may say so, I sometimes think that if we had had the kind of climate the Greeks had at that time&mdash;the kind indeed that the Greeks of the present day enjoy&mdash;we might have had a Socrates in Skibbereen, possibly a Plato in Portadown and an Aristotle in Ardoyne or possibly Ardee&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Ah no, Dunleer would be better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichealCranitch" hpid="Mícheál Cranitch Mícheál Cranitch">
      <NameTxt>Mícheál Cranitch</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;possibly it would give Aristotle all he could do to deal with what had to be dealt with in Ardee and Ardoyne, too.</P>
      <P>The point I should like to make is that the Greeks always believed in the education of the full man.  They did not believe in a one-sided education. Their object was to develop everyone's potentiality to the highest.  When Plato laid out the ideal scheme for the training and education of youth in his republic, he certainly was a man before his time and I suppose was the forerunner of all great planners for programmes and educational reform.</P>
      <P>Some speakers have already referred to this technological age and I am sure further speakers will do so also.  This is a technological age and I do not have to tell anybody that we are trailing behind as far as technology goes. One of the big problems facing An tÚdarás will be to establish colleges of higher technology as soon as possible because we have to have highly skilled technicians especially in view of the fact that we will be competing with the best technologists in Europe in a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great fear I would have is this: that we might at some stage become too one-sided as far as technology goes and that we might be inclined to forget the pursuits of the mind.  Sometimes that happens.  Some people pursue wealth.  They forget the inner man.  They forget the mind.  They forget the intellect.  The Greeks would not have it that way and every educationalist <Col N="783" /> worth his salt always emphasised this fact that the full man must develop.  Already the new curriculum in primary schools is having a good effect.  Of course in any good primary school before the new curriculum ever came in, the good teacher always made sure that the children were developed on all sides.  There is no point in developing a one-sided personality because every child will grow to be a man or woman and will have to live in society and he will be regarded for his overall characteristics and his overall development and the impact he will make as a complete human being in society.</P>
    <P>When An tÚdarás is planning for higher education I think the most important things they have got to put before their minds are the ends for which they plan rather than the means. Often nowadays we are inclined to think of the means by which we do a thing and that the ends will look after themselves.  Again, I come back to the phrase that was thrown out earlier this evening, &ldquo;the society in which we live&rdquo; and the society we plan for.  We have got to make up our minds what we are planning for.  That, I think, is the biggest question before An tÚdarás.</P>
    <P>To come back for a moment to Plato. I just came across this paragraph in his writings in which he says:</P>
    <P>Whenever the populace crowd together at any public gathering booing and clapping until the rocks ring, and the whole place redoubles the noise of their applause and outcries in such a scene what do you suppose would be a young man's state of mind.  What sort of private instruction would give him the strength to hold out against such a torrent or to save him from being swept away down the stream until he accepts all their notions of right and wrong, does as they do, and comes to be just such a man as they are?</P>
    <P>One would think Plato was living in 1971, in this very complex and distorted world where young people are caught up in a torrent of shoddy values; when things we held sacred when we were, let us say, a little younger than we are now, are now <Col N="784" /> being bandied as just mere nothings. Values seem to have changed.  Things that were regarded as being absolutely right are now supposed to be proved wrong and those we believed were false are now declared to be true. Living in a world of disquiet, such as we are, we will have to depend on the influence and the teaching of wise men. Let us hope that An tÚdarás will be able to do something in its wisdom to make sure that those who handle higher education in this country will be worthy of their calling, because the men and the women in the universities and in the institutions of higher learning have indeed a very heavy responsibility. They are people who wield very great influence and those who wield great influence, indeed, have a very grave responsibility to the people whom they influence.</P>
    <P>Thomas Henry Huxley's type of man is the man I think we should educate for&mdash;</P>
    <P>a man whose mind is stored with the knowledge of the great and fundamental truths of nature and of the laws of her operations.  One who no stunted ascetic is full of life and fire but whose passions are trained to come to heel by a vigorous wig. The servant of a tender conscience who has learned to love all beauty whether of nature or of art.  To hate all vileness and to respect others as himself.</P>
    <P>That, indeed, is very close to the Christian ideals.  Coming to mind immediately after that&mdash;I have not got the exact words&mdash;but you will remember that when Our Lord was found by his parents in the Temple when he was 12 years old all we read in the Bible is that he went down to Nazareth and was subject to them and grew in grace before God and men.</P>
    <P>To come back to the point again, great power is wielded by educators in this country and they have the great responsibility of moulding their students and their pupils so that they will become people who live in grace before God and men.  That is the Christian ideal and that is the Irish ideal and that is the ideal that will give us the society that I think we should have.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="785" /> This Bill deals with higher education. Let it be repeated that higher education concerns more than universities as such.  University is, of course, the traditional third level institution but in the world in which we live today there are many others.  We have training colleges for teachers, we have higher colleges of technology, we have higher institutions for music and art and these all must take their place. There is a fourth or special type of institution to which I will refer later.</P>
    <P>Let us dismiss from our minds right away that the quality of education at any level depends entirely on the type of building in which the education is given.  One of the American educationalists said: &ldquo;Put a good teacher at one end of the log and an apt pupil at the other and you have a university.&rdquo;  I do not suppose that the schools we had in Ireland during the Golden Age had facilities much greater than the log I referred to.  The great scholars during the 18th century in the &ldquo;Hidden Ireland&rdquo;, the poets Eoghan Rua Ó Suilleabháin, Art Mac Cobhaigh, Aogán Ó Raghaille had not much in the line of facilities, either.  All they had was a cabin and the turf fire.  The hedge schoolmaster very often had not even that much&mdash;just the open skies. These men had a love of learning, a love of truth and a love of scholars and they fired their pupils with the ideal of learning for learning's sake.</P>
    <P>What I have said may give some indication of my idea of what the staff of any institution of higher learning should be, or indeed the staff of any institution dealing with learning.  The men chosen for these positions should be men who are able to inspire, because without inspiration, learning or, indeed, any task, becomes mere drudgery.</P>
    <P>A question was raised earlier about the very large numbers trying to get into the universities.  This is true and more students will be knocking at the doors.  But it is not a case of &ldquo;knock and it shall be opened unto you&rdquo;. Perhaps it is time that the Údarás would look into the question of entrance to higher colleges, particularly universities.  So far, entrance to university is based entirely on a written examination. For years I have been advocating <Col N="786" /> a reform as far as entrance examinations to any institution are concerned, or for any appointment.  It is most unjust that a person's whole career or the direction a person's career has to take, will be decided upon by what he gets down on an answer paper at a certain time of the day, on a certain date of the month.  I have come across too many instances of children who were ill, and who did a bad examination as a result.  I have known children who were suffering from nervous strain and those who could not sit for the examination.  We also had cases where without any shadow of doubt, through human error&mdash;and examiners are human&mdash;dreadful mistakes have been made and wrong marks assigned to various pupils.  What I have advocated before and what I advocate again is that entrance to universities and other colleges be based partly on a written examination and partly on an interview.  I think this interview is most important because we have young men and women of 17, 18 and 19 years entering universities seeking careers as teachers, and lawyers, for example, and they are totally unfit by reason of some organic defects in their speech and would never be able to face a class or take up a case in a court of justice.</P>
    <P>A good team of interviewers, people specially trained for this task, could, within half an hour, assess the potential of the candidate and assess his or her suitability for work as a university student.  I hope the day will come when An tÚdarás will see that particular point.  I know that for certain positions, for instance the Army, the Garda Síochána, entrance to training colleges, the interview is an absolute necessity. As a result we have very few mistakes.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer again to the question of cost.  I do so particularly because of the fact that the demand for higher education will accelerate.  As a result of various inventions, advances in technology, etc. people have now more time to spend at leisure.  It is for the good of the country that this free time be used for laudable purposes rather than for carousing, drinking, betting and all the things that go with them.</P>
    <P>In Britain in 1969 what is known as <Col N="787" /> the open university received a Royal Charter.  This was something entirely new as far as education was concerned. The best way I can introduce it is to give the extract from the inaugural address by the Chancellor of the University which was delivered on the 23rd July, 1969.  He says:</P>
    <P>We are open first as to people. Not for us the carefully regulated escalation from one educational level to the next, by which the traditional universities establish their criterion for admission.  The task before us to cater for the many thousands of people who are fully capable of a higher education who, for one reason or another, do not get it, or do not get as much of it as they can turn to, a fact that they sometimes discover too late.  It is only in recent years that we realise how many such people there are, and how large are the gaps in educational provision through which they can fall.  The existing system for all its expansion leaves a great unused reservoir of human talent and potential.  Men and women drop out through failures in the system, through disadvantages of their environment, from mistakes of their own judgment, or through sheer bad luck.  These are our primary material and to them we offer further opportunity.</P>
    <P>The idea in this open university is that lectures are given on radio and television and a lot of material is sent by post.  Those who desire to enter this open university fill up a long questionnaire, very minute as regards their educational attainments.  There are five faculties there at the moment&mdash;arts, educational studies, mathematics, social science and technology.  There we have possibly the basis for a solution, or at least a partial solution to our difficulties, as far as university education is concerned.  Not all those who seek a university education intend to use the degrees they will be awarded and forward their financial interests by securing better jobs, better positions. Many of those people who like to study and take out a university degree do it for their own personal satisfaction. Those people who study evening courses at universities do it just for <Col N="788" /> their love of knowledge.  Perhaps not all of them do, but I should say that the bulk of them do it, because they wish to pursue a particular course of study.  They like to be awarded a degree.  It is different in the case of those who go through a full-time day course.  They usually wish to follow various professions such-as medicine, teaching, law, engineering and so on. Here there is a means of satisfying the desire of a great percentage of our people who seek higher education.</P>
    <P>The first point made in the Chancellor's address in July, 1969, was that first of all, they were open, as to people. The Chancellor continues: &ldquo;The open university is not the rival of the existing universities.  It was designed to take over where they are compelled to leave off.&rdquo;  Then he says: &ldquo;We are open as to places.  The university has no cloisters.  Of course, that is a connotation of an enclosed place.  Hardly even shall we have a campus.  We are open as to methods.  We start independent on, and in grateful partnership with, the BBC, but already the development of technology is marching on and I predict that before long actual broadcasting will form only part of the university's output.  The world is caught in a communications revolution.  Every new form of human communication will be examined to see how it can be used to raise and broaden the level of human understanding.  And lastly,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;we are open finally to ideas.  It has been said that there are two aspects of education both necessary.  One regards the individual human mind as a vessel of varying capacity into which is to be poured as much as it will hold of the knowledge and experience by which human society lives and moves. This is the Martha of education.  We can have plenty of these tasks to perform. But the Mary of education regards the human mind more as a fire that has to be set alight, and blown with the divine efflatus.  That also we take as our ambition.  Again we come back to the word for it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I throw out that idea to the Minister and to his Department to examine at some time, particularly in view of the fact that we shall have Radio na Gaeltachta before very long.  They could see what could be done to establish <Col N="789" /> an open university entirely of our own.  We have a lot to give the world and to give ourselves.  We have an extraordinary heritage of courage and endurance.  People could study poetry, song, and music with the aid of television and radio.  From my knowledge of the people, they are just hungry for something of this nature.</P>

    <P>There are scores and scores of instances of nations which in the past have lost their languages.  We know of no nation however which was so enlightened as to allow willingly its native tongue to die.  Nor do we know of any nation which, having <Col N="790" /> lost its language, was not completely assimilated by the nation whose language was imposed on it no matter what differences of religion, history and culture existed formerly between these nations.  The Irish langauge, widely spoken throughout the country, is the only guarantee we have that in the future Ireland will not be a mere satellite of England or America.  What sort of society do we envisage for this country in the years to come?  The tendency to ape these countries has been on the increase a thousandfold in recent years.  We read more and more of their books, newspapers and magazines, we look more and more at their films and television programmes, we sing more and more of their songs and behave more and more as they do.  Would you be satisfied that this generation be the first generation in our history to take the irrevocable step of formally abandoning Irish and then let Irish people discover in 100 years that their country was nothing more than a nice, material-minded replica of Lancashire or Jersey?  Have we the right to do this.  The fundamental reason for our struggle for independence was that we were basically distinct from England.  The Irish language is at the heart of that distinotiveness. Should we now abandon the real reason for our independence? Should we now sit back and laugh at those who fought and say to them that they might as well have left us to evolve peacefully as part of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Léiríonn na focail sin go héifeachtach, sílim, an bhun-chúis atá laistiar d'athbheochan agus de leathnú na Gaeilge. Go dtí seo ach go h-áirithe, bhí an t-ualach ar fad maidir le cúrsaí oideachais á iompair ag na múinteoirí bunscoile, na múinteoirí náisiúnta. Rinneadh iarracht&mdash;d'éirigh go h-an mhaith, go sár-mhaith leis an iarracht sin&mdash;a chur ar cumas na leanaí óga an Ghaeilge a labhairt agus í chleachtadh. Ach d'fhéadfadh aon oideachasóir gur fiú trácht air a rá leat gurab amhlaidh a dheineann leanaí óga aithris ar dhaoine fásta agus nach amhlaidh a dheineann daoine fásta aithris ar leanaí óga.  Is ag an mbárr is ceart <Col N="791" /> tosnú.  Agus sílim go bhfuil sé de dhualgas ar gach ollamh, ar gach léachtóir agus ar gach coláiste a bhaineann le hard-oideachais, le meán-oideachas nó le bun-oideachas an Ghaeilge a bheith ar a thoil aige agus gach cúnamh a thabhairt do na daoine ar mhian leo Gaeilge a chleachtadh nó a gcuid oibre a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Agus arís ag an bpointe seo caithfidh mé na hollúin atá sa teach seo a mholadh.  Is féidir le beagnach gach aon duine acu a ghnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge.  Tugann siad an dea-shompla i gcónaí.  Ach sna coláistí, ní amháin ins na coláistí ollscoile agus ins na coláistí oiliúna agus ins na coláistí eile, tá daoine ann gur cuma in Éirinn leo maidir le hathbheochan agus leathnú Gaeilge.  Agus an tionchur a bhíonn acu san ar na micléinn, nuair a chuimhním air tagann fearg mhór orm. Ní haon chabhair na dea-smaointí agus an dea-shompla a thúirt do na daoine óga nuair a bhíonn siad óg, nuair a a bhíonn siad ar an mbunscoil nó ar na meánscoil muna leantar den deaobair.</P>
    <P>Nuair a théann siad go dtí an ollscoil ansan agus castar ollúna agus léachttóirí orthu is amhlaidh a bhíonn siad ag magadh futhú.  Tá an mhí-shásamh in Éirinn i gcoláistí áirithe mar gheall ar sin.  Maidir le ceann de na coláistí -agus níl mé chun ainm an choláiste a lua&mdash;tá fianaise agam istigh sa chlúdach seo agus dá léifinn é chuirfeadh sé scanradh agus alltacht ar a lán daoine anso.  Baineann an scéal seo leis an Roinn Oideachais i gcoláiste ollscoile áirithe.  In ionad dea-shompla a thúirt do na micléinn agus cabhair a thúirt dóibh is cosúil go dteastaíonn ón Roinn sin gan aon rud a mhúineadh trí Ghaeilge agus taispeánann siad go soiléir de réir deallraimh gur beag meas atá acu ar an nGaeilge.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí an bhun-chéim á déanamh agam agus on tÁrd Diploma in Oideachas leis, bhí ar mo chumas an t-ábhar oideachas a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge i gcóir na bunchéime agus i gcóir an Ard Diploma, gach péipéar scrúdú Gaeilge agus gach aon rud trí Ghaeilge.  Níl sé sin ann a thuilleadh de réir dealraimh i gcoláistí áirithe. Caithfidh tú an tÁrd Diploma in <Col N="792" /> Oideachais a dhéanamh trí Bhéarla.  Fiú amháin is cuimhin liom bhí an spiorad chomh láidir sa Coláiste Ollscoile i gCorcaigh gur fhreagair mé an páipéar in Eacnamaíocht trí Ghaeilge agus bíodh is gur i mBéarla a tugadh é, bhí cead agam an páipéar a fhreagairt as Ghaeilge, rud a rinne mé agus do ceartaíodh é.</P>
    <P>Tá moladh anso ó Chomhairle na Gaeilge, leathanach a 3, Meabhrán an Údarás um Árd Oideachas Árd Diploma san Oideachas, alt 21.</P>
    <P>Molta go mbeadh deis ag micléinn cúrsa iomlán Diploma nó mór-chuid de a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge sna hollscoileanna.</P>
    <P>Sílim go bhfuil sin an-thábhachtach ar fad go mbeadh seans go mbeadh de cheart ag na micléinn an cúrsa a bhaineann leis an Árd-Diploma san Oideachas a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge, nó an chuid is mó de ach go háirithe. Mar na daoine atá faoi oiliúint ansan ag an bpointe sin siad san a bheidh ag dul amach sa saol mar mheánmhúinteóirí agus ba cheart go músclófaí spiorad agus grá ina gcoíthe do Ghaeilge agus do chultúr na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>Is linn féin, is cuma cén creideamh atá againn nó cén aicme a bhainimid leis, is linn féin an teanga, teanga na Gaeilge, agus is ceart é sin.  Tagann fearg orm uaireanta nuair a chloisim daoine a bhfuil ainm an léinn orthu agus gan ar a chumas fiú focail simplí ar nós &ldquo;An Taoiseach&rdquo;, &ldquo;Fianna Fáil&rdquo;, &ldquo;Fine Gael&rdquo; a fhuaimiú i gceart.  Is minic a chloisim daoine a bhfuil ainm an léinn orthu ag tagairt don &ldquo;Teeshock&rdquo;.  Níl a leithéid de dhuine ann.  Déanann siad tagairt do &ldquo;Fine Fale&rdquo;.  Níl a leithéid ann.  Déanann siad tagairt do &ldquo;Fine Gale&rdquo; agus níl a leithéid ann.  Daoine iad san go bhfuil ainm an léinn orthu.  Is mór an náire é sin na laetheanta seo. B'fhéidir nach dtugann siad féin faoi ndeara é, ach sílim chomh fada is a baineann sé le h-oideachas agus le léinn, go mbeadh ar chumas duine a theanga féin a labhairt agus pé méid den teanga a labhraíonn sé go mbeadh na fuaimeann go cruinn aige agus gan é bheith ina ábhar magaidh ag na daoine.</P>
    <P>D'fhéadfainn i bhfad eile a rá mar gheall ar cúrsaí sin ach tá an t-am <Col N="793" /> ag imeacht agus gan dabht beidh anachuid cainteoirí eile.  Deineadh tagairt do na seomraí agus na foirgnímh a bhaineann leis na coláistí, do na gearáin mar gheall orthu nach bhfuil siad sásúil.  Mar a dúirt mé níos lua; &ldquo;If you have a good teacher at one end of the log and an apt student at the other, you have a university.&rdquo; Teagmháil an léinn an caidreamh idir an ollamh agus an macléinn, idir an duine léannta agus an dalta.  Tá andhualgas ar fad ar an Údarás, agus is é an dualgas atá ar an Aire an tÚdarás a chur ar a bhonnaibh ach níor mór liom dó é.  Is mór an cúram ar fada é agus tá súil agam go mbeidh rath ar a chuid oibre agus go mbeidh rath ar obair an Údaráis agus dá bharr san go mbeimíd ag druidim leis an lá nuair a bheimid ní amháin léannta de thoradh ár gcuid oideachais ach go mbeimíd i bhfad níos gaelaí.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there can be any very strong objections to the Bill because its intent is to give a statutory basis to a body which has existed on an <i>ad hoc</i> form since August, 1967, nearly four years ago. The purposes of the Authority, as outlined in the Bill and referred to in the Minister's introductory statement, are ones with which we would all agree, namely, to co-ordinate the development of higher education, to eliminate wasteful overlapping and to ensure the substantial sums invested in higher education are used to the best advantage. Whether we are taxpayers or not &mdash;and I think most of us are taxpayers &mdash;we would be wholeheartedly in favour of these objectives.</P>
      <P>The Bill goes on to state the Authority's further objectives which are:</P>
      <P>...furthering the development of higher education&mdash;</P>
      <P>Speaking as a Limerick man, that is an objective in which I have a particular interest.</P>
      <P>&mdash;assisting in the co-ordination of State investment in higher education and preparing proposals for such investment;&mdash;</P>
      <P>The next objective is most important.</P>
      <P>&mdash;promoting an appreciation of the value of higher education and research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" /> The Bill provides for an increase in the membership of the Authority from the present 14 members to 18 members, with the addition of a chairman.  It provides that at least seven members will be academic members and at least seven members will be non-academic members.  I should like to suggest to the Minister, as a layman, that the majority of members of the board should be non-academic members.  I do not wish to say that in any spirit of criticism of the value of academic members, but I wish to suggest that it is good policy that a majority of any body should be disinterested persons without a vested interest, so to speak, in the body which they represent. By and large, the average layman, while possibly not having the same academic, technical or technological qualifications as the academic member, would have in many ways a broader concept of the value of higher education and of its necessary application to an ever-widening number of our people.</P>
    <P>The Minister has expressed the view that the Higher Education Authority will be an independent body.  Here again, I would suggest to the Minister that a mere wish in itself is not sufficient. The Higher Education Authority should not only be nominated, or stated to be independent as a body, but they should act as an independent body and give their views independently of any possible interference by any Government or Minister.  The Minister has described it also as an advisory body to him, but in one essential factor the Minister himself will hold the decision: he will decide what institutions are to be recognised as institutions of higher education and thereby qualify for financial assistance. I feel that the Higher Education Authority, as an independent body, should be in a position to advise the Minister.  The Minister should not be the sole judge of what institutions will qualify as institutions of higher education.</P>
    <P>I am rather sceptical about the financial arrangements.  According to the Bill and the Minister's statement, global amounts will be requested by the Authority but in the final analysis the Minister for Finance will de <Col N="795" /> cide what amount is to be made available for expenditure on the universities and other institutes of higher education designated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Who will decide how the scaling down is to be apportioned between the current and capital needs of these various institutions?  In other words, if the Higher Education Authority seeks £5 million or £10 million for the various institutes of higher education and this is scaled down by the Minister for Finance, how is the scaling down going to take effect as between current and capital requirements? If this is not very clearly spelt out in this Bill it seems to me that it is not the Higher Education Authority or the Minister for Education who will decide how the institutes are to be financed or how the money is to be expended but it will be the Minister for Finance.  It would negative the whole purpose of this Bill and the whole standing and status of the Authority if the Minister for Finance was to be the deciding factor in how the money was to be expended.</P>
    <P>There is one point I should like to talk about for a few moments and it is one very dear to the heart not only of a Limerick man but also of a Clare or Tipperary man.  It is the very important question of the Limerick Institute for Higher Education.  As most of the Senators are aware, and certainly the Minister is aware, the people of the Limerick region&mdash;and in this region I include the people of Clare, Tipperary and North Kerry as well&mdash;have been fighting for a university for more than 25 years.  I can remember during my 30 years in the Limerick City Council being a member of a university committee in 1946, which is a long time ago.  At that time the former president of University College, Cork, Dr. O'Rahilly, came to Limerick and well and truly knocked the idea of a Limerick University.</P>
    <P>As an alternative he suggested we should be satisfied with some form of higher institute of technology.  The fight for Limerick university subsided for a couple of years but subsequently was revised in 1956 and went on again with an ever-increasing demand and an <Col N="796" /> ever-increasing number of young people in the Limerick region entitled to and anxious to obtain a university education. The fight was really brought to its optimum when the Limerick University Project Committee was established some ten or 11 years ago.</P>
    <P>In view of the appalling let-down which the people of the Limerick region suffered recently, it is interesting now to recall the memorandum which was issued at the end of 1968 by the Higher Education Authority in which they recommended the establishment of our Institute for Higher Education in Limerick.  The then Minister for Education on 12th December, 1968, issued the following statement:</P>
    <P>1.  The Government have decided to allocate the capital funds necessary to establish a third level educational institution in Limerick. The Higher Education Authority has been asked to recommend how such an institution might be fitted into the existing or future position for higher education.</P>
    <P>2.  Negotiations for the purchase of a site of about 80 acres for this institution are in progress.</P>
    <P>3.  The Government have referred to the Authority the question of establishing a body which would award national qualifications at technician and technological levels.</P>
    <P>4.  The Government have also requested the Authority to make recommendations in relation to teacher training in the context of the future provisions for higher education.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>That statement, made over two and a half years ago, is very significant in the light of the present situation in regard to the Institute for Higher Education in Limerick.  On 20th March, 1969, the Institute for Higher Education issued in very clear, concise and precise terms, its concept of the Limerick College of Higher Education.  In paragraph 13 of this document they enunciated the principles which they considered should govern the establishment and evolution of the Limerick College of Higher Education.  It is very interesting to recall these now in view of the recent events:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="797" /> (a)  It should be a national institution meeting the needs of the country as a whole and attracting students from a wide area.</P>
    <P>I think that statement certainly refutes the statement made here tonight by Professor Quinlan that this was to be a local institution catering for purely local needs.</P>
    <P>(b)  It should cater for the specific needs of the region.</P>
    <P>(c)  It should be under an independent governing body but the legislative proposals for its establishment as well as its financing should come within the ambit of the Higher Education Authority.</P>
    <P>(d)  Its constitution should be sufficiently flexible to cope readily with future national and regional demands.</P>
    <P>(e)  It should offer Certificate, Diploma and Degree courses, of a standard to satisfy the Council for National Awards, with the Council as the award giving body.</P>
    <P>(f)  Initially Certificate or Diploma courses, including the sandwich type, would form the major part of the College's work.  These, while helping to meet regional and national needs at their own level, would give valuable experience in planning the development of degree courses.</P>
    <P>(g)  Entry standards to degree courses should be the same as those required for entry to such courses in the existing Universities.  For entry to all other courses a Pass Leaving Certificate or its equivalent should be required.</P>
    <P>(h)  The work of the College should be based primarily on a technological content, but with a significant element of the humanities.</P>
    <P>That statement and these announcements created a considerable amount of joy in Limerick and the contiguous counties.  It was felt by the people of Limerick that the unceasing efforts of more than a quarter of a century had at long last reached fruition.  Although the proposed Institute of Higher Education, to be termed the Limerick College of Higher Education, did not meet the full demands of the people <Col N="798" /> of the region, they accepted it as a reasonable compromise and something on which they would ultimately build a fully-fledged university.</P>
    <P>The statement dated 20th March, 1969, and signed on behalf of the Higher Education Authority by Dr. Ó Raifeartaigh, went on to say:</P>
    <P>We consider that the steps towards its establishment should be:</P>
    <P>(1)  the setting up by the Minister for Education of a Planning Board of not more than six persons;</P>
    <P>(2)  the appointment of a Director and some senior staff.  The Director would be Chairman of the Planning Board, which would arrange for the siting and provision of the new building, formulate specific proposals for courses and see that the requisite staff, equipment, and library facilities are made available;</P>
    <P>(3)  The drawing up by the Planning Board, within the principles set out in paragraph 13 above, of a draft constitution for the College for submission to the Higher Education Authority.</P>
    <P>As the Minister and his predecessor are aware, those steps were followed out faithfully by the Limerick people concerned.  The planning board was established with representatives from the project committee on it; a director, Dr. Walsh, was appointed and proposals were submitted to the Higher Education Authority.  Everything seemed to be in order and the Minister's predecessor and the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, in various correspondence, confirmed that the Limerick Institute for Higher Education would open with degree courses in September, 1971.  Nobody knows what happened in the interim but after long delays, which were certainly not appreciated in the Limerick area, the present Minister made an announcement that the opening of the Limerick College of Higher Education was to be deferred for one year and no assurance was given when the institute opened in 1972 that it would have degree courses at the outset.  To say the least of it and putting it very <Col N="799" /> mildly, there is dissatisfaction and disappointment in the Limerick region and, as one who has been actively associated with this long effort to get educational facilities for our young people in Limerick, I feel that I am entitled to express the feelings of the Limerick people at this let-down which they have suffered.</P>
    <P>The reason I mention this, apart from expressing the disappointment at this breach of faith by the Minister, his Department and, indeed, by the entire Government, is that one of the objectives for which the Higher Education Authority is being established is to encourage an understanding of the benefits of higher education for all our people.  I should like to ask the Minister how does he hope that this Authority will encourage an understanding of higher education if, as in this instance, the people are going to be deprived of it.</P>
    <P>The people of Limerick, Clare, Tipperary and North Kerry have been paying and paying substantially for generations so that young people more fortunate in their situation could have a university education.  The time has long passed when we in the Limerick area should have the same facilities for higher education as young people in other areas.  We feel very strongly and very deeply about this whole matter. I do not attribute all the blame to the Minister for this breach of faith that has occurred.  The Minister has inherited a very difficult situation.  I am prepared to believe that.  I think he is honestly trying to do his best in the circumstances.  But I do hold the Government, as a whole, responsible for this appalling state of affairs, for the way the people in the Limerick region have been deceived in this whole matter.  I hope the Minister, when he is replying to this debate on the establishment of the Higher Education Authority, will take a little time off to give a firm commitment that the promises made by his predecessor and that the statements enunciated by the Higher Education Authority will be put into effect and put into effect in their complete form, that there will be no withdrawal or no watering down or diminution of the proposals as originally <Col N="800" /> outlined, and that we in Limerick city and the contiguous counties can look forward without any doubt whatever within the next 12 months to the establishment of an institution that will give our people the opportunity to enjoy the same higher level of education as young people in other centres.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis, only a comparatively small number of young people will ever avail of higher education. It may be only 10, 12 or 15 per cent.  But I am sure the Minister would agree with me that we must ensure&mdash; when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean we who are Members of the Oireachtas&mdash;that this right is shared equally by all our young people who can benefit from the highest education, that it is not going to be the right or the privilege of a certain number who happen to be geographically better placed than others.  After all, it is not so long ago that we were told there should be only one university in the whole country, that courses and staff were so expensive and buildings were so expensive, that the proper course to follow was to shut down all the universities and just have one gigantic university in Dublin.  I think that sort of thinking is past.  It is obvious from the rate at which the demand for university education is rising that in a very short time the Limerick Institute for Higher Education will not alone have a starting number of 1,000 or 1,500 pupils but will grow to the number of pupils now regarded as the minimum of at least 4,000 to 5,000.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister in the context of this Bill to give the people of our region an absolutely unequivocal statement that this College of Higher Education is going to be established in 1972&mdash;it is now too late to establish it in 1971&mdash;and that it will open its doors and will open its doors with degree courses from the very first day. I do not think that is asking too much. I know the Minister is having a rough passage in more ways than one now and I do not want to be appearing to add to the number of his critics, but I do think we have a justifiable case in our region and I believe that there are other Senators from my region, perhaps not of my political persuasion, <Col N="801" /> who feel equally strongly on this question of the provision of facilities for higher education in the Limerick region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a great deal of eloquence today on this question of education.  I had a few things I wanted to say but having listened to all the other speakers my mind has got somewhat enlarged.  I will try to be as brief as I can.</P>
      <P>Let me say at the outset that I agree with a lot of the views Senator Russell has expressed about this technological school proposed for Limerick It is true for him to say that we are in an era of high industrial development and this is a necessary requirement for us. There are great disabilities being experienced by industrialists through the shortage of trained people who are available to them.  I do not wish to repeat what Senator Russell has said but I must say that I am in accord with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would prefer to speak mostly on my experience of some of these higher education problems.  I was listening to Professor Kelly today and I have no doubt that he is a very dedicated man in his profession.  I heard him extolling the autonomy of the universities and the great privileges they had above practically all other people.  They could express their views freely and nobody could call them to account.  I do not begrudge them that.  But if you have such autonomy and rights you also have comparable responsibilities.  I have some experience as a member of a vocational committee, and we find that you cannot look at university education or higher education without taking a look back at what happens in the primary school and in the secondary school, because these are the workshops where you get the people who will eventually become the entrants to the university.  Without a great deal of efficiency in the primary, post-primary and vocational schools you just could not work in the realm of higher education.  A high degree of efficiency from the primary to the post-primary levels is a very important factor in education.  There is more talk about education in this country at the present time than there is about many <Col N="802" /> other things.  We, as a vocational committee, have the greatest difficulty in recruiting teachers of the standard required. It is not their fault.  Many of them go to the universities and they are looking for something which gives them a status symbol, which is a degree.  Having got their degree, they come up against the practicalities of living and they have to find a job. Fifty per cent of those entering university at this time come out with arts degrees.  I could not say what percentage come out with B.Comm. degrees.</P>
    <P>The country is being flooded with students from the universities, but when you want a teacher for a vocational school, there are none to be had.  They come out of the universities without any specific training for the career they wish to take up in after life, and while I recognise that the universities have their problems and no matter what is said about the autonomy or the great freedom that exists in the universities, there must be an end product to their efforts.  You cannot have a situation in which the Higher Education Authority are prepared to allow this to be perpetuated.  At the other levels of education, the primary, secondary or vocational, this kind of education cannot be given.  It can be done at primary level because they have their own college where they are taught the principles of teaching. We are constantly under pressure at vocational level, having to recruit teachers who have no qualification for teaching.  They have a degree but that is not enough.  When these young people enter university and opt for an arts course, after some time, say, a year, they should be given some kind of career guidance to find out what their aptitudes are, so that if they wish to pursue a teaching career, they might arrange for some external courses.</P>
    <P>The present system is not fair to the children whom these people are going to teach.  They have no experience even of elementary teaching methods.  Somebody will have to shoulder these responsibilities some time.  This problem is there and must be recognised by the Minister and An tÚdarás.  It is causing a great deal of <Col N="803" /> difficulty to vocational committees and I am sure to a lesser degree to post-primary organisations.  This practice of people coming out of universities and posing as teachers cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the relationship between academic and technical and vocational teaching I have an extract from some figures that were published by the OECD.  In Finland they have one academic to 6.7 technical or vocational teachers; in the Netherlands there is one academic to 4.4 vocational or technical; in the United Kingdom they have one academic to 2.4 vocational or technical; in France they have one academic to 1.2 vocational or technical; in Germany there is one academic to 2.6 vocational or technical; in Ireland we have one academic to .031 technical or vocational.  This is a very revealing fact because it seems we are on the threshold of our entry into the EEC. It is evident to anybody who has anything to do with industry or business that we are starved for people in factories, in management and business generally.  It is almost impossible to get these people.  I know of cases where factories had to bring in people from Germany and France.  I do not know if An tÚdarás can deal with this problem but, as I said about the teaching staffs, we cannot shelve this problem any longer.  You cannot have that ratio and expect the economy to expand.</P>
    <P>I come from an area, as Senator Russell probably knows, where it is a big strain on parents to have to send a child to Dublin to attend university. When these students are finished, with the exception of two faculties, either medicine or engineering, where they are backed by powerful organisations, there is no future for them.  I see hundreds of these young people flying to America from Shannon every day because there is no future for them here.</P>
    <P>These problems I mentioned are ones I know exist and I think the responsibility will have to be accepted by someone.  I do not know what the cure is but, if there is reluctance by he staffs of the universities to move hemselves a little bit away from the reat privilege of autonomy, the people <Col N="804" /> will do it for them some time.  I am often horrified at some of the stories I hear about these matters.  It is of great importance that this question be looked at, especially now that we are going to provide more money.  If somebody is completely dependent on the State for money, no matter what their objectives or their tasks, they also have a responsibility to the State.  I should like to see them being asked to take on this responsibility, not for the sake of the Government or the Houses of the Oireachtas but in the interests of the children and their parents, who made such great sacrifices to have them there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I should like to deal very briefly with some points that have not been dealt with so far.  I have certain reservations about the Bill.  I welcome the idea of setting up the HEA because it is very necessary.  Many of the problems which the Authority will have to face have been outlined.  We should be grateful to Senators Cranitch and Honan for keeping the academics' feet on the ground and for not letting them fly up into the clouds.  There are many problems and they pointed very strongly to the fact that there are many types of higher education other than university education.  This is something we ought to bear in mind constantly.  I should like to restrict myself to the part of education in which I am involved, which is the university side, and make some comments about the Authority and some of the functions which it will be fulfilling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at education as a whole, and, as Senator Honan has just said, we cannot separate the various bits. We may have to become departmentalised from the point of view of administration.  The whole educational complex is too big to have it treated administratively as a whole.  However, looking at it as a whole, I have much sympathy with the Minister for Education and his Department.  If we go back over the history of the development of education, say, over the last 20 years, we find there was a leap forward about 12 or 13 years ago.  This may have been the result of a great deal of hard thinking that had gone on over the previous years.  However, there was a <Col N="805" /> point where there was a sudden surge forward, where we moved very rapidly into the twentieth century.  In some cases we seemed to move into the twenty-first century and then moved back.  There was a tremendous awareness on the part of the public of educational problems; much discussion took place and all sorts of new schemes &mdash;free education, university mergers&mdash; came out together, and so created problems.</P>
    <P>One of the problems which the Department still have to face up to&mdash; and I do not mean to make my criticisms sound carping; I shall try to be constructive&mdash;is a problem of public relations.  When all these schemes are being implemented together you do not want to appear as if you are there with a big stick, beating the donkey over the top of the head to gallop the final 100 yards to the tape.  You want to try to get the donkey to move on by using a form of inducement by swinging a carrot in front of it, and put your schemes over so that the aims are not just acceptable.  The means by which these schemes are achieved, the way they are put forward and the publicity attached to them should appeal to the public.  Most of the moves made by the Department all over the educational field are correct, and I should like to support those aims.  However, I do not always support the way in which they are put forward.  The Department does not belong to a political party.  It is our Department of Education and the Minister is responsible to us, so we could help him by trying to improve the Department's image.  Certainly, it is something that needs improvement.</P>
    <P>My family are involved in all levels of teaching.  They are university teachers, secondary and primary school teachers, so I have a view of the whole idea of our educational system, and I think that the problem of public relations is a tremendously important one and is something that I hope the Department will endeavour to improve. Any suggestions that we may have and anything that we can do in this respect can only be of benefit to the country, because what the Department are trying to do is correct, but the ways in which the schemes are being <Col N="806" /> put over to the public are not always the best possible.</P>
    <P>One of these schemes, which involves university education, is the merger.  I do not wish to go back over the whole merger issue; this is not the time for that.  I should like to take Senator Quinlan's point of view that, whatever one thought about the various machinations that went on and the various announcements and so on that we had two or three years ago, we are now getting to a position from which we can make a constructive move forward and that position is the one in which we have four separate universities. This is a position which has come about through various pressures.  At times we talk about the big stick but the big stick ought to work in reverse. It may be great when there are a lot of votes to be gained by achieving a certain objective, but if the public can be persuaded&mdash;and the universities are a pretty powerful organisation when it comes to numbers of voters associated with them&mdash;that the moves are not in the national interest, then the big stick works in reverse.</P>
    <P>However, whatever about the history of the merger, we are now in a position from which we can move constructively forward and, as Senator Quinlan has said, the <i>ad hoc</i> Authority has started in this direction and has made a promising start, and I hope that we can look at this university question from a most constructive point of view.</P>
    <P>I have been involved with my colleagues in University College Dublin for some time, working out joint courses and joint symposia, joint seminars, sharing our facilities, getting towards looking at joint degrees, and in general co-ordinating, as two neighbouring universities should.  One of my colleagues, who is a very distinguished mathematician in the National University, was very keen that no moves should be made above the ground until it was absolutely clear that the merger was dead, in the sense in which it was originally announced. His philosophy was that he was not going to let himself be seen to be pushed around by Government Departments. That is an extreme reaction <Col N="807" /> but it illustrates that academics react strongly when there is a threat of a big stick.  I think that the inducement, co-operation and co-ordination which is happening now is the sort of approach that is most profitable from all points of view.</P>
    <P>I should like to make some remarks about another organisation with which I hope the Authority will have some informal links, but it is an organisation which does, in my view, perform a very valuable service to higher education, and that is the Royal Irish Academy. I am not a member of that organisation, but some Members of this House are, and perhaps the Leas-Chathaoirleach is.  The Royal Irish Academy is a body which basically deals with scientific higher education and plays some functions in Irish education which are recognised by the Government.  The national committees work through the Academy.</P>
    <P>I have been working on an Academy sub-committee which has been linking the universities in this country in efforts to promote mathematical research, which is a wide and specific subject. This has worked well.  The great advantage the Academy has over another body which has stronger connections with the Civil Service is that it incorporates the northern universities.  I have been involved in running summer schools in which all the Irish universities have participated.  By participating I mean putting in funds, which is the crucial thing, sending people to take part and generally working together. This is very important.  I hope that the Higher Education Authority will be outward looking in this respect, especially towards the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I disagree with what Senator Quinlan said earlier.  I think we have a terrific amount to gain from co-operation with the universities in the North of Ireland and I think they have a great deal to gain in co-operating with us.  This is <Col N="808" /> already happening under the auspices of the Royal Irish Academy.  This should be encouraged and I hope that the Higher Education Authority will work together with the Academy because both can benefit a great deal.</P>
    <P>One of the sad things in Irish education was some years ago when the New University of Ulster was set up in Coleraine.  I felt that north and south missed a great opportunity to work together on a university that would have had to have been placed in Derry, which I think was the right place for the college, and to share the costs, to share the student numbers. To have students from Donegal, Derry, Coleraine, Portrush, Sligo all coming together would have been a marvellous opportunity to further north-south co-operation.  We lost out there.  It would have been a difficult thing to arrange but, had we been farsighted, it would have been a tremendous step forward in north-south co-operation. I hope we do not lose such other opportunities and I hope that the Authority will keep their eyes very closely on the opportunities to be gained in the EEC.</P>
    <P>The EEC have plans for trying to integrate European university education and I think that our Higher Education Authority could benefit very much from any such integration with European universities.  We have a lot to give them and they have a lot to give us.  I plead with the Minister to get this Authority to be as outward looking as possible.  His Department are now looking at education schemes throughout the country and throughout the world.  Our education, like all other parts of Irish life, has a lot to gain by going into Europe.  I hope the whole Authority will be as outward looking as possible in this respect.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 1st July, 1971.</P>
