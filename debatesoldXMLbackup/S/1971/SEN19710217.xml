    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 6, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a couple of points on subsection (2).  We find in this subsection:</P>
      <P>...an officer or servant of the Board authorised in writing by the Board to enter upon premises and to carry out such inspection as may be reasonably necessary....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not happy that an officer or servant of the board may carry out this inspection.  If the Minister is asked <Col N="700" /> about a certain inspection or any infringement of personal rights which occur as a result of it he can say that it is not his responsibility, that it is the responsibility of the board, and he can push the responsibility on to the board.  It is much more difficult to get an answer from a body such as the Nuclear Energy Board than to get an answer from the Minister.  The Minister should be answerable for all inspections.  I would feel much happier if there were some provision, as in the United Kingdom, that the Minister should be answerable for all such inspections.</P>
    <P>The second point is that the officer or servant of the board can enter upon &ldquo;premises&rdquo;: that is the word used in the subsection.  I am unhappy about this term &ldquo;premises&rdquo;: it is an omnibus term.  I should feel happier if the servant of the Minister or the servant of the board were allowed to enter on premises which were licensed in some sense to cover the nuclear or the radioactive machinery or installation that is contained in the premises because, in an earlier section, we have seen the difficulty in definition of &ldquo;radioactive or fissile&rdquo; substance. As was pointed out, every human being is radioactive in some sense or other.  As a result, legally speaking, under this section, an officer or servant of the Minister or officer or servant of the board could enter private premises to investigate radioactivity. This may be unlikely but it is something we ought to guard against.  It should not be allowed under this section. Some change should be made to ensure that people cannot enter into private houses, for example, to investigate the radioactivity of the inhabitants, without some particularly good reason.  I suggest some licence provision to ensure that the premises being inspected were radioactive or contained radioactive installations or materials in the proper sense of the word.  In the corresponding section of the United Kingdom Act, inspection of private premises can only be carried out on a warrant issued by a magistrate who has been presented with sworn information in writing.  Something should be done to ensure that <Col N="701" /> way I have described.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator West on this point. We have here in section 6 (2) a rather free power for entry on premises.  This is an open term: no restriction and no definition of it is contained in the definition section of the Bill.  While it is appropriate that an inspector should have power to enter premises where there are nuclear installations, the subsection would seem to be far too wide.  We would perhaps link it up, as Senator West suggested, with subsection (1).  Under subsection (1) it is necessary to have a licence for the custody, use, manufacture, importation, distribution, transportation, exportation or other disposal of fissile or other radioactive substances.  I should imagine it would be appropriate under subsection (2) that the power of entry given <i>simpliciter</i> to enter premises should be restricted to premises in respect of which a licence has been issued under subsection (1) of this same section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what Senator Dooge has said and, indirectly, to support, in part anyway, what Senator West has said.  Work may be going on in a physics laboratory or a laboratory attached to a hospital where proper arrangements have not been made for the safety of the workers and the disposal of the radioactive materials.  If these premises can be entered only as a result of a warrant, the people concerned have ample notice to put their affairs in order and, as soon as the inspection is over, they may relapse into their original bad ways.  Parallel to the procedure here, in the matter of the use of animals for laboratory purposes&mdash;in other words, the Vivisection Acts&mdash;all places where such work is being done are licensed under the Department of Justice.  Inspection can then be made without more than a formal notice, a relatively short notice at that, to see that the conditions for the keeping of animals and the disposal of infected material, and so on, are being observed.  There is a distinct parallel between that kind of situation and what would obtain worded.  The Minister will understand <Col N="702" /> here.  We do not want to have people entering premises that are essentially private premises without proper authority. On the other hand, we do not want the misuse or dangerous use of materials in these premises to go on without the possibility of direct supervision, at relatively short notice, to make sure the matter is put right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad this point has been raised by Senator West. The point he is, I think, making is that, while he agrees, in effect, there may be danger from radioactivity, he wants to prevent the widespread invasion of private premises by inspectors. I presume that is what Senator West is really getting at.  With that I am in agreement and I think Senator Dooge has supported it also.</P>
      <P>Fundamentally, if I have to support any one of the three speakers fully, it will be Senator Jessop in that there may be occasion when, in premises other than those which it is the intention of Senator West and Senator Dooge to license, this danger may occur.  I would be the last to agree that there should be an invasion of premises in regard to anything of this nature.  Senator Jessop, speaking as a medical authority, has put a finger on a point.  I am not quite sure how this can be overcome by altering section 6 (2).  I am not as well-versed in this subject as Senator Jessop or maybe Senator West, and especially Senator Dooge who probably knows more about this than I do, to be able to say whether the danger of radiation can be extended by people in contact with radiation and brought into private premises or, as Senator Jessop has said, by animals and other things used in medical research&mdash;of course, that comes within the ambit of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, one must go very carefully in either accepting or rejecting section 6 (2).  I am more inclined, on balance, to agree with Senator Jessop. The principles Senator West and Senator Dooge have enunciated are of prime importance to all who wish to look after the privacy of the individual and this is one of the interests of the Oireachtas at all times.  It is very difficult for me to be definite or to suggest to the Minister how this should be this section cannot be misused in the <Col N="703" /> from statements just made by previous speakers and myself our fears in this connection.  The question is whether our fears can be resolved by limiting it to licensed areas and whether, indeed, licensed areas will be sufficient to cover the danger involved.  With the best will in the world, the licensed areas may not embrace every possible premises involved.  I see that fear.  I think that is Senator Jessop's point.  No matter how much one licenses an area, there may be an area outside this where the effects of fissionable material radiation may occur.  It would be very wrong of us to suggest at any stage that we should not embrace this within this subsection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much need for me to make the point that has just been made for me by Senator Belton.  That is precisely our thinking on the matter.  This whole question of radioactive substances is of such vital safety interest that it is very important that the provisions empowering either the Minister or the board&mdash;we are leaving it both ways for the present; either can do it; we shall work out afterwards who in fact will be responsible for the specific inspection operation&mdash;do not, in any way, circumscribe the inspection that may be necessary not only for the safety of individuals but conceivably for the safety of the whole community.  If we confine this inspection to licensed premises then we obviously exclude unlicensed premises. The main purpose of any such inspection will be to deal with potential illegal nuclear or radioactive experimentation or dealings of one kind or another.  This is the type of investigation that will be of paramount importance as far as any inspector is concerned. It is very important that we do not circumscribe such inspectors in any way by confining them to licensed premises.  It is important that we leave it open to them, under order of course, to make such inspection as they may wish in regard to any premises where some nuclear or radioactive operation may be taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Minister's point &mdash;his interest in unlicensed premises in <Col N="704" /> the nuclear sense of the term.  I agree about the difficulty inspectors could have.  I agree it would be very difficult to set down the terms of a licence so that it embraced all the situations which might need to be covered in this respect.  I should like to ask him about the first point I raised.  This was the matter of responsibility: the accountability of the inspector.  When a person asks about the behaviour of a servant of the board, acting as an inspector, will the Minister be able to say: &ldquo;This is the function of the board.  This is the responsibility of the board.  It is now no responsibility of mine&rdquo;, or will all these inspectors be accountable to the public through the Minister?  This is very important.  We do not want to transfer responsibility here.  It is very important that the public have redress through the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two options open under the subsections as regards the order and as regards the licence issued under the order.  In either case, the Minister will carry ultimate responsibility either via the board in one set of circumstances&mdash;if that is considered the required way to make the order&mdash;or directly, as is also provided for here in the subsections.</P>
      <P>Generally, this is the thinking right through this Bill.  We are leaving the sections as general as possible so as to enable us to develop by experience. This is not just in connection with this section: I have said the same thing in regard to other sections.  It is as well to leave it global at the present time where the order can be made either by the Minister directly or indirectly by the board.  With experience and research, according as information comes to hand through the aegis of the board, it is decided in what specific way to proceed: what way is the most feasible way to proceed, whether via a board or directly through a Minister.  The Minister carries the ultimate responsibility. No matter which way it is done, the Minister will be the ultimate responsible person, and rightly so, in regard to any particular wrong alleged to have been done, under this or under any other section of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that the Minister is accepting responsibility <Col N="705" /> for this.  Surely, then, he must be answerable to any questions raised in the Lower House on foot of this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is the practice to answer any questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  This is all very well.  This is the Minister's intention. Is it in the Bill?  Could a successor to the Minister say: &ldquo;This is a function of the board.  I am not answerable in Parliament&rdquo;?  It is all right for the Minister to have good intentions but, unless they are in the Bill, they are not of any use at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I am making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the House wishes, I shall look into this between now and Report Stage.  At a glance, I cannot pin it down&mdash;which, I think, is Senator Sheldon's desire&mdash;that is, specify the board as the Minister's agent.  I could put in that qualification. Whenever board is mentioned under this section, we could specify, after &ldquo;board&rdquo;, &ldquo;as the Minister's agent&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge the Minister to look at it from that point of view.  One way of getting round the difficulty here would be that, in regard to inspections, authorisation by the board should not be sufficient for the board's inspector.  If the inspection is made on the Minister's authorisation and if the Minister is answerable, this might meet the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly look at that.  The principle in the idea appeals to me.  I shall look at the drafting of the section with a view to incorporating the ideas adumbrated here by Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important because the section reads very strongly. A person who obstructs an inspection &mdash;this even means somebody who does not know what the inspector is looking for: somebody who does not know what it is all about: somebody who shuts a door in his face&mdash;under this subsection &ldquo;shall be guilty of an offence&rdquo;.  It makes it an absolute <Col N="706" /> offence in this way.  I think it would need softening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will incorporate that safeguard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it would protect the individual's privacy, and at the same time, it would achieve the effect desired under this section if a warrant was issued for an inspection of private premises on sworn information supplied to a magistrate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be carrying it too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was a genuine difficulty, surely a warrant could be issued very speedily?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I have to argue against my previous support of Senator West here.  I think there would be cases in which even these delays would not be tolerable.  It might come to the notice of an officer of the board that some radioactive material had been removed from a premises which was licensed to a private dwellinghouse.  In these circumstances, very rapid action might be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is my feeling.  Senators might notice that, under section 6 (1), we already have incorporated the words &ldquo;save under licence issued by him&rdquo;&mdash;the Minister&mdash;&ldquo;or by the board as his agent&rdquo;.  I shall check with the draftsman if this should be continued right down through the whole section, as has been suggested by Senators.  I shall check if that is necessary.  I shall check if it is a factor governing the other subsections.  I am not quite clear about it; it is a draftsman's point.  Certainly, if required, I shall make it quite plain, between now and Report Stage, that the Minister carries ultimate responsibility and that any operations by the board or by inspectors of the board are operations carried out on the basis of being the Minister's agent and, therefore, the Minister carries the ultimate responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the multiplicity of inspection, the multiplicity of licensing, the multiplicity of regulation.  Can the Minister give us information about the numbers of Departments of State, and agencies, who will be concerned in the regulation of radioactive material and the general lines of demarcation between them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is set out in section 6 (i):</P>
      <P>The Minister may, after consultation with the Ministers for Finance, Industry and Commerce, Agriculture and Fisheries, Labour, Health and External Affairs, by order regulate, restrict, or prohibit (save under licence issued by him or by the Board as his agent) the custody, use, manufacture, importation...</P>
      <P>and so on of radioactive material.  The relevant Ministries and the relevant agencies are all incorporated there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>My query is a little more specific.  The listing in subsection (1) indicates they are concerned.  My query is: How many of these have power to issue regulations in regard to the control of radioactive substances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under existing legislation, actually the Department of Labour can do it from the workers' safety point of view.  The Department of Health can do it under existing legislation in regard to the safety of radioactive materials used in hospitals, clinics and health generally.  That is the situation at the present time.  The Minister for Transport and Power is getting the power here to deal with it as under subsections (2) and (3).  At the present time&mdash;so far, anyway&mdash;the only people statutorily entitled are Labour and Health.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Just one thing arising out of the phraseology of subsection (1). I take it that, in every case the Minister must consult with all those Ministers. I was visualising possibly cases which would concern only Health and why should Agriculture and Fisheries, Finance and everyone else be consulted? It says &ldquo;and&rdquo;.  They are all lumped together: they must all be consulted.  It strikes me that this is the sort of thing that could add to a great deal of paper work between Departments. I think most people would agree there is too much of that already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the developments envisaged by the Bill proceed in years ahead, the other Departments referred to will obviously become involved. Agriculture and Fisheries, for instance, in regard to soil treatment, could conceivably be involved with the radioactive material.  Industry and Commerce obviously could be involved from the manufacture and production point of view.  Finance could be involved from the financial point of view. From the point of view of international conventions and arrangements External Affairs, could be involved in regard to the distribution of this type of material.  In 99.9 per cent of cases, this will be just a formality.  In fact, it will be the Minister for Transport and Power and/or the board who will really do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Sheldon's point that, if the particular issue at any time refers to any one Department, no other Department should be brought into it.  He cited Health.  Why, then, make it all-embracing&mdash;that all the others should be considered at the same time?  If an issue arises pertaining solely to the Department of Health, as Senator Sheldon mentioned, why involve all the other Departments as well?  Is that Senator Sheldon's point?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my Department's order.  Once the order is made, <Col N="709" /> there is complete freedom of action for the Minister for Transport and Power and the board.  That is, consultation is connected with the preparation of the order under which the action will proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is what is in the order?  The actual carrying-out of what is in the order will refer to one Department: no other Department will be consulted at that time?  I see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite a common thing for health matters in other Departments to be looked after by these Departments and not by the Department of Health.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has control of health matters in the various industries and factories.  Factory doctors are appointed not by the Department of Health but under the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  So there is this, as it were, relationship between health and various organisations and activities where health matters arise.  Provided it is done not all in a bundle, as Senator Sheldon seems to fear, it is quite reasonable to have these other Departments mentioned in it.</P>
      <P>I think a lot of the trouble under this licensing and inspection arrangement would be avoided in the draw-up of the definition of &ldquo;radioactive substances&rdquo; which we referred to the last day.  When that is properly done, I think then we can have a much freer view of what is going to take place.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of this debate, it has emerged that Members of the House are concerned about the dual function of this board &mdash;the fact that the board will be concerned with schemes for the production of nuclear power and also with regulatory agencies.  I do not want to go into the merits of this on this section: we shall be discussing it again on Report Stage.  If we proceed, as the Minister would like to proceed, giving <Col N="710" /> all these functions, operated by separate boards in Britain but by the one board here, I wonder if he is perhaps being a little restricting in limiting the number of the board to seven?  If we were thinking of a board to operate just one function then I think, indeed, the number is a good one.  The number is probably about the optimum number for such an operation.  If what would be in Britain two boards is in this country to be one board, I wonder if the Minister might not be better advised to leave this somewhat loose &mdash;perhaps not to specify the precise figure but to give a range of not less than five or more than nine, or something of this type, so that, as the work of this board develops, the Minister could appoint what he thought was an appropriate number to the board at any particular time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

      <P>I want to make the comment, also agreeing with Senator Dooge, that not only do I think that this might possibly be a small number of members of the board but, on the wording of it, it would be possible to have a board of two people.  I do not think this is the intent of the Minister but there is no figure that the board must be composed of, so it could be composed of two people&mdash;one of them being the chairman, I suppose, and the other being an ordinary member of the board&mdash;and not more than seven.  I should be inclined to agree with him, because of the nature of the board's functions, that possibly this will be found to be rather restrictive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know, on the drafting of it, why the Minister for Transport and Power has found it necessary at every stage&mdash;I can understand in the remuneration but in the appointment and even if he wishes to remove a member of the board&mdash;to have the consent of the Minister for Finance.  It seems rather unusual that the Minister himself cannot decide since the members of the board will hold their tenure, with the consent of the Minister.  Why does he need further consent from the Minister for Finance? I note, under section 9, that the Minister, again, in appointing the chairman, must get the consent of the <Col N="711" /> Minister for Finance.  Is there a particular reason for this?  If not, why could the Minister, as the appropriate Minister under the section, not take the responsibility on his own?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the last one first, this being a stock phrase incorporated in recent legislation dealing with State sponsored boards.  It is proper as it brings the Minister for Finance more into these matters.  The thinking behind this is to make for more collective Government responsibility.  The situation in the earlier Acts establishing State-sponsored bodies was that the Minister alone had the sole authority. It makes for greater collective responsibility within the Government to have the Minister for Finance involved in such appointments along with the relevant Minister, thereby bringing the Government, as a collective body, into such decisions to a greater degree.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of not more than seven, it is set out in section 11 (7) that the quorum of the board shall be three.  We must at least have three; the intention is to appoint seven.  We have discussed this with the various international nuclear agencies and they advise that seven appears to be the proposal that emerges as being the most practical.  Indeed, from our own experience here in dealing with bodies of this kind&mdash;State agencies, State sponsored bodies&mdash;the figure of around seven is the one that gives the maximum of experience and breadth of knowledge.  At the same time, it is consistent with the efficient working of a board.  If there are more than seven it could lead to trouble and if there are less than seven there could be less spread of experience.  From my own knowledge of State-sponsored organisations I would say that seven is the ideal figure.  I do not think anything else arises.</P>

      <P>I am wondering about one point under subsection (3).  The Minister very properly is making sure that a person that has been on the board for a while can never be on it again.  Is this too limiting?  It refers only to the effluxion of time.  Surely it could be possible for a person to cease <Col N="712" /> to be a member of the board for some other reason?  It might be wished that he should become a member later on. This appears to me to act as a prevention against that happening.  It is almost too limiting.  Supposing someone was away for a year, and had to retire and then returned and the Minister wanted to put him back on the board, he just could not do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Senator's point.  Indeed, it appears to be unduly restrictive to limit it to effluxion of time.  It could be illness; it could be absence from the country or a number of other factors that might make an admirable person ineligible for reappointment. We will check on that between now and Report Stage with a view to deleting that and to have it read <i>simpliciter</i> that a member of a board whose term of office expires shall be eligible for reappointment.</P>

      <P>I cannot allow the continued appearance of the word &ldquo;effluxion&rdquo; to pass without registering once more a protest against it.  I know that it is beloved of the parliamentary draftsman, and maybe it is his and Senator Sheldon's love for the word that is responsible for the introduction of this particular subsection.  I wish to point out to the House, once again, that the standard dictionaries give the secondary meaning of the word &ldquo;effluxion&rdquo; as &ldquo;abortion&rdquo;.  It is a good description of this particular word.  I have great admiration for our parliamentary draftsmen.  That admiration would grow to new heights if they could manage to avoid this particular phrase which lingers on from earlier centuries to the annoyance of at least one legislator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a time for all passions to be spent.  Just returning to an earlier point, I agree with the Minister when he says that about seven is the appropriate number <Col N="713" /> for this board.  I fail to see how he goes from the opinion of &ldquo;about seven&rdquo; being the correct number to the precision of binding himself to appoint seven, no more and no less.  It would be entirely appropriate in most instances if seven were to be appointed. I think it inappropriate that there should not be some freedom in the particular subsection.</P>
      <P>I want to raise another point under subsection (5), that is, that a member of the board may at any time resign his office as member by letter sent to the Minister and the resignation shall take effect upon receipt of the letter. I would like to raise here the meaning of &ldquo;receipt of the letter&rdquo;.  It may well be that we would have in a body such as the Nuclear Energy Board very sharp differences of policy. A member of the board might well resign over policy.  I would like it to be clear beyond any doubt whatsoever that &ldquo;receipt of the letter&rdquo; means receipt of the letter by the Minister personally.  I should hate to think that under the Ministers and Secretaries Act receipt in a Department of a letter of resignation addressed to the Minister would immediately bring about the automatic resignation of that person without that letter having reached the actual Minister to whom it was addressed.</P>

      <P>Does this mean that a member of the board cannot give notice of his pending resignation? If he wants to resign he sends the letter.  As soon as the Minister gets the letter the resignation takes effect. If he were to say to the Minister: &ldquo;I would like to resign as from the 20th of next month&rdquo; he cannot do that because if his letter arrives on the first of the month then that is the end of his term of office on the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a point here which is largely a point of clarification.  Section 8 provides that a member of the board should be paid out of the funds that fall to the board such remuneration as may be agreed.  I should like to ask if the wording here in regard to remuneration of the member of the board allows for distinguishing different rates of remuneration for different members of the board and if it allows, in particular, for a particular rate of remuneration for the chairman.  In the plain reading of it, it allows for a rate of remuneration to be fixed for &ldquo;a member&rdquo; of the board, thus putting them all on the same basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is drafted globally, but the remuneration is a matter for decision.  I do not see a situation where we will have board members paid at different rates.  That would be a most unusual practice and there is no precedent for it.  All members of every State agency, board or commission are paid the same rate.  Rates vary from board to board but they are paid the same rate and the chairman is paid a specific rate over what the board members are paid.  No decision has been made on this yet.</P>

      <P>At present, our policy, as I said on the last occasion here is to get this board off the ground, and we will learn by experience from the expert advice that we hope to get from the board.  In the initial stages it is envisaged that the chairman and members of the board will all be part-time but expert representatives of the various university, technological, business, power, health and safety fields, people who are concerned with this matter. However, the section, as drafted, is flexible enough to provide for a whole-time chairman and whole-time board members, if necessary.  If this development advances the way we envisage it advancing in the future, there may be need for a whole-time chairman and whole-time board members.  This is a very real possibility and the section, as drafted, leaves it open to proceed either way.  The thinking at the moment is to proceed by way of having a part-time chairman and part-time board and, if necessary, if the work load develops&mdash;as it probably will develop&mdash;to have a full-time chairman and full-time board members, as required.</P>

Subsection (3) seems to conflict with subsection (5) of section 7 because subsection (3) purports to prevent the chairman ceasing to be chairman until the next meeting of the board held after the board has been informed by the Minister of the resignation; but the chairman, if he wants to be immediately shut of the job&mdash;as very often is the situation when someone wants to resign&mdash;can very easily resign from his office as a member of the board under subsection (5) of section 7.

      <P>On this section the Minister has told us&mdash;we agree with him&mdash;that he looks to the members of this board as being members with particular expert knowledge and experience.  Accordingly, I wonder if section 10 is not rather tightly drafted in that regard.  In particular I wonder if the preclusion of a person taking part in any deliberation or decision in regard to a contract with a company or <Col N="718" /> concern in which they had any interest is not, as I say, drawing this section a bit too tightly.  It may well be that the courts would interpret &ldquo;interest&rdquo; here as being pecuniary or financial interest, but I think it might be preferable if this were spelt out. If for example, somebody who was either a director or a senior staff member of the Electricity Supply Board were to be a member of the board, one could conceive of circumstances in which the Electricity Supply Board would have a pecuniary interest in a matter which was under deliberation. There are many other matters in which the Electricity Supply Board would have an interest, as being the body largely concerned with the production of nuclear power and the control of materials.  I merely raise the point for clarification.  While it is quite proper to avoid any conflict of interest based on a person having a financial stake in a particular concern, perhaps the word &ldquo;interest&rdquo; here is rather broad and the prohibition might be made more particular.</P>

      <P>At the same time, we all know how important it is to retain integrity and respect for public institutions.  Justice must be seen to be done as well as be done.  This provision is a usual one in articles of association for private companies and indeed, in all the various Acts setting up State-sponsored bodies.  I would not like to depart from it in this case, particularly when it is quite clear here that it relates to any contract the board may undertake. In practice, if we read section 10 as a whole, the effect of it is that, if there is an interest involved&mdash;and in my reading of it it is a financial interest because it relates to &ldquo;any deliberation or decision of the Board relating to a contract which the board proposes to make&mdash;it is very desirable that a person on a board who has got an interest in any contract which the board proposes to make should not take part in any deliberations or decisions concerning the making or adjusting of that contract. A contract implies profit or loss or business, and it is quite clear what &ldquo;interest&rdquo; means in this context.  I want to make sure that this board, when established, will be pristine, pure and seen to be concerned with its subject and that it will be composed of people who will be above suspicion. In a board of this kind, which is concerned with a most important future development, we should not depart from any practice which might impugn a lack of integrity or respect in regard to its membership.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, does the Minister think that it is all that proper?  There are two points.  Firstly, the Minister appears quite content that we can take &ldquo;interest&rdquo; as being pecuniary interest.  This relieves one of my worries.  Even so, I think, as Senator Brugha has said, to exclude such a person from all deliberations may be unduly restrictive.  If it is a question of a possible contract with say, the Electricity Supply Board, or any contract which involves the operations of the Electricity Supply Board, this means that any person who is a director or employee of the Electricity Supply Board must sit mute at that particular meeting.  It means that, in fact, he cannot offer his opinion to the board.  If the chairman turns to him for a point of clarification he must refuse to speak.  There is certainly a point here, as Senator Brugha has said, in regard to the deliberations.  It might well be that we could ask him to declare his interest&mdash;this should be recorded in the minutes&mdash;and that he should take no part in the deliberations except on invitation of the chairman, and then take no part in the decision.  To exclude him completely, even from answering questions or from giving information or a judgment, would be unduly restrictive.  We are all agreed on the principle of this but perhaps, in the interest of the &ldquo;pristinity&rdquo; about which the Minister was talking, we may have gone a little too far.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to agree with the Minister.  I do not see how, in relation to contract, you can divorce &ldquo;deliberation&rdquo; and &ldquo;decision&rdquo;.  I would have thought that it might be possible in reply to a request by the chairman or a member of the board for information to be given on a point, that this is hardly taking part in deliberations. This point could possibly be got over in that way: that to answer a net question is not quite a deliberation. Deliberation, I feel, has a sense of argument for and against whereas in a question like: &ldquo;Do you want ten kilowatts or 1,000 kilowatts?&rdquo; he just says which, and it is not quite deliberating on it.  &ldquo;Deliberation&rdquo; is a nice, vague word when you start to think about it.

      <P>Take the position of a member of the Electricity Supply Board sitting on the Nuclear Energy Board when discussion comes up, under section 5, subsection (1) (b) of this Bill, advising the Minister on proposals for the construction, installation, operation and supervision of a nuclear power station.  Surely it would be very important that the member of the Electricity Supply Board would be allowed to speak?  This would come up under a contract which the board might propose to make.  Surely it would be very important that the member of the Electricity Supply Board be given a full chance to air his views on a contract of this nature?</P>

      <P>I must correct the Minister in one thing he said. He said that it is usual to have a provision of this kind in articles of companies. It is neither true of public companies nor private companies.  If you adopted without amendment the provisions of the Companies Act, if you adopted the regulations and did not make any change in them, the language <Col N="722" /> is very explicit.  One of the points I am fond of making with regard to this Act is that it has been receiving consideration for 120 years or thereabouts and has got the benefit of all sorts of judicial interpretation as to the meaning of language, and words like &ldquo;deliberation&rdquo; do not appear at all. I think an amendment could easily be made which would effect a remarkable improvement in this section.  Perhaps I would be permitted to say what appears in the regulation relative to a public company, which is relaxed very much in the case of a private company:</P>
      <P>A director shall not vote in respect of any contract or arrangement in which he is so interested</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;an earlier regulation requires him to declare his interest&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>and if he so votes his vote shall not be counted.</P>
      <P>It further states:</P>
      <P>nor shall he be counted in the quorum present at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Under this section he could be counted in the quorum present at the meeting. He could be a formidable character whose very presence, silent though it might be, might procure what he wanted.  I am not going to give a lot of the exceptions.  These provisions do not apply to certain things and I will not go into that.  For the record, it is Regulation 84, Table A, First Schedule of the Companies Act, 1963.  They go on to say at the end something which again might be considered desirable:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...and these prohibitions may, at any time, be suspended or relaxed to any extent and either generally or in respect of any particular contract, arrangement or transaction by the company in general meeting.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, you might not think it right, in relation to a body receiving public money and having such responsibility as this body would have, that the body could have the power to relax.  The Minister might be given the power to relax in relation to a particular transaction that a certain individual, having disclosed his interest, would be free to vote and be counted in the quorum.  I offer that to the House on that particular aspect <Col N="723" /> of this matter.  I have other points to make but I should like the Minister to observe on that.</P>

      <P>I will certainly look into this to see whether we can make it more open, as it were, in view of the points that have been put here by Senators.  I am very concerned that we do not have any section dealing with any other public body that would in any way impute or impugn motives, rightly or wrongly, to particular people on the board.  If I can improve the terminology of the section I shall certainly do so.  I will check with the Companies Act and the phraseology used in respect of other State-sponsored bodies.  I know the wish of the Seanad is not to lose the expert knowledge and experience that can be given by such a person, even if that person has an interest, so long as that person is excluded from any decision or any vote taking.  I take it that is the view of the Seanad.  I cannot go very far in that direction but I will see how far I may go.</P>

      <P>I have a few more points to make on this section. I have been advised by a very experienced parliamentarian that at Committee Stage it is unwise to make more than one point, because there is a chance that one point will be dealt with, but if you make&mdash;as I propose to do&mdash;a few points, they may get lost.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  At any rate the point is that interest here should not be merely the interest of the member but the interest of the member's family.  He or his wife or his children could be beneficiaries under a trust.  His own interest is very easily avoided.  He does not have to talk to too many people to discover that an interest would be an interest of his own but not an interest of his wife or an interest of a trust established by him for the benefit of his children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Minister that he would not have an interest within the sense intended by this section.  That is the first point I want to make about it.</P>
      <P>The second point is that I am unhappy with the language here.  &ldquo;Any interest in any company or concern with which the board proposes to make any contract.&rdquo;  At what point in the management of what may be a great big company do the members of the board learn that, in fact, officers or servants of the board have been planning and preparing applications to come to the board?  Eventually the board may initiate an inquiry along a particular line and the people concerned will bring that along to the point where they think it is right that the board should make a decision as to where the contract should be placed. At what point has the board proposed to make the contract?  Is it when somebody employed by the board starts negotiating and does not waste the time of the board until he has brought the negotiations to the point where a decision is required?</P>
      <P>I should have thought &ldquo;proposes to make a contract&rdquo;, if it is to be used, should include &ldquo;of which the members of the board are aware&rdquo; or something of that kind&mdash;some language which clearly calls on them to declare their interest.  There may be proposals made on the board's behalf before the members of the board are aware of these proposals at all.</P>
      <P>The third point is this.  When is the member to disclose his interest to the board and, in fact, the nature of it? It is usual, and I think it would be desirable, to do so at the first meeting of the board held after he has acquired the interest.  The member may not have had an interest at the time of one meeting but may have acquired it by the time another is held.  It is at that meeting he should make his disclosure, but not until then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final point is this.  I do not understand this measure as I should, in all its aspects, but I understand that there may be substantial contracts entered <Col N="725" /> into by the board at some stages.  I think it prudent for the Minister to consider whether he should not add &ldquo;failure to disclose an interest shall not invalidate any contract entered into by the board&rdquo;.  What happens if you find yourself having a contract with an American company, well-advised by American lawyers, who wanted to get out of their contract and who tried to rely on this section to escape liability? I think it important that the board should not be damaged, or the interests of the board damaged, by the failure of a member to disclose his interest. Indeed, the American company could have made arrangements for it.</P>

      <P>It is an interesting point.  In regard to the other points made by the Senator, I am not so much in sympathy with this question of when the board ascertain to what extent the company is coming in in which a member of the board has an interest.  I do not know what sort of drafting could cover that type of situation.  However, there is some validity in the Senator's last point.  I should not like to see a situation in which a company with no business being done, and a contract signed, could escape liability on the basis that a member of the board had an interest.  It should be ensured that such a contract would not be invalidated by reason of the participation in the deliberations or decisions by a member of the board who had an interest.

      <P>There are two points arising on section 12 in regard to the officers and servants of the board.  The first one that I should like to refer to arises in subsection (3) and is concerned with the payment of remuneration and allowances to the officers and servants of the board which are subject to the approval of the Minister.  What is the intention in regard to such officers and servants? Are they to be subject to conciliation and arbitration machinery or what would be the form of industrial relations which the Minister would anticipate?</P>

      <P>On this section I should like to ask the Minister why we have to have this terminology &ldquo;officer&rdquo; and &ldquo;servant&rdquo;?  This to me smacks of class distinction and goes back to the days when blue-collar workers were considered as servants and white-collar workers were considered as something superior.  I should like to see this raised on all the sections, that &ldquo;officers&rdquo; and &ldquo;servants&rdquo; be removed and supplanted by one simple term of &ldquo;employees&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my own view too.  This is outdated phraseology. The ramifications of &ldquo;officers&rdquo; and <Col N="727" />&ldquo;servants&rdquo; are quite amazing.  This phrase is in every piece of legislation going back for years.  You might run into legal trouble if you started changing it now.  It is a well-tested definition. Everybody knows what &ldquo;officers&rdquo; and &ldquo;servants&rdquo; mean.  We do not want to start people inquiring why we changed from &ldquo;officers and servants&rdquo; to &ldquo;employees&rdquo; and probably imputing from the change in terminology some motive that is not there. That is the sort of unfortunate reality that might arise in regard to a matter like this if it came before the courts. We are, therefore, sticking to the established and tried definition and phraseology.  I agree it is outdated. I shall have a good look at it some day, perhaps get all the statutes together and eliminate it entirely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EvelynOwens" hpid="Miss Owens Miss Owens">
      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that the Minister is sympathetic to my point of view.  However, I feel that by continuing it into another piece of legislation in 1971 we are just continuing the bad old days.  At some stage we will have to say &ldquo;stop&rdquo; and have a look at it.  As far as I understand, the legal ramifications of it are mostly tied up with the superannuation provisions.</P>
      <P>In section 14 the Minister gives the board power to draw up a superannuation scheme.  Surely in the scheme under this Bill you could use the word &ldquo;employee&rdquo; and have the same provisions for all the officers and servants of the board who would all be termed employees under the superannuation scheme.  Therefore the legal difficulties&mdash;I accept they exist in all the statutes I have seen&mdash;would be eliminated.  I think 1971 is the time to start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, and as far as the officers in my Department are concerned, we had a good healthy row with the draftsman on this very point.  We wanted &ldquo;employees&rdquo; put in and he insisted on retaining &ldquo;officers and servants&rdquo; there for one of the reasons mentioned just now, the superannuation code.  The words &ldquo;officers and servants&rdquo; are used throughout every section of the superannuation code. <Col N="728" /> As the Seanad are aware, the superannuation code is very involved, being concerned with many statutes passed over the years.  The draftsman felt that in some way a person might be prejudiced by reason of not being defined as &ldquo;he&rdquo; or &ldquo;she&rdquo; is defined in the superannuation code.  However, I shall go back to the draftsman and bring the Senator's view to his notice.  I am fully in accord with that point of view. There was another point made by Senator Dooge on this section as well&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is right.  In this case we are not dealing with an ordinary type of board.  There will be much expert, and certainly costly, employment on a board of this kind. This is employment for which the ordinary type of conciliation and arbitration procedures, such as we have, say, in the Public Service, are not ideally suited.  It is essential that the board should be at liberty to negotiate conditions of employment for their staff, because of the particularly specialised knowledge that many of the staff of this board will have to have, and which will be very costly knowledge as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear the Minister on this point.

I hope it will not be said that these people, though not formally under conciliation and arbitration, must be brought within its ambit indirectly through the Minister's powers of approval or disapproval under subsection (3).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I refer to what has been said under subsection <Col N="729" /> (3).  It is well known that there is a different position prevailing with regard to the chief executive officer in some State bodies from which prevails in other State bodies.  The Minister for Finance is in no position to prevent the body in question paying the salary for the job to get the right man.  In this case the Minister for Finance will be in a position to prevent that.  It is correct to say that in all cases other than the chief executive officer the Minister is in control of what the board may pay&mdash; and not necessarily with desirable consequences in every case.  I should have thought that, in relation to this body, the board must be trusted to take the best advice as to what the board will have to pay by way of remuneration to get the key man for the job.  I have no particular reason to argue on any basis for such key men, but it is inevitable that the scale of remuneration in the Public Service must affect the judgment of the Minister for Transport and Power as to what is reasonable, even though the board may have taken the best possible advice on how to secure the services of the man with the qualities required by the job.  For the efficiency of this board, I suggest strongly that the Minister ought to consider the wisdom of the policy proposed in relation to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has opened up a very wide-ranging field, that is, the whole question of governmental control of State-sponsored bodies generally.  This is germane to the present investigation by Mr. Devlin and his committee into the whole system of remuneration in State-sponsored organisations and in the Public Service generally.  The objective in recent years by conscious Government policy has been to remedy the disparities that have been there over a number of years and that have arisen under various statutes passed without any thread of application of common principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In legislation establishing very recent bodies the terminology has been on these lines all the time: that the relevant Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may decide.  This is one of the main recommendations also in the report on the Public Service <Col N="730" /> that we had to hand some months ago from Mr. Devlin.  Apart from the remuneration aspect, one of the main recommendations there is that the various State-sponsored bodies should be to a greater degree brought under the umbrella of Government so that a consistent policy be seen to operate right through, both in regard to organisation and administration and to remuneration. There is also the further point that Committees of the Oireachtas should act on an overlordship basis, as it were, in regard to these State companies&mdash;that the various chief executives of these State companies should come before Oireachtas Committees on the same basis as the account officers of the various Departments come before the Committee of Public Accounts at the moment.</P>
    <P>All of this is very desirable and that is why in recent legislation we have been adopting a constant formula in regard to this matter.  The purpose is, as far as possible, to put the terms of appointment, remuneration and administrative relations between State bodies and the Oireachtas on a common basis so that the disparities in regard to the remuneration and administration and the relationship between Government Departments and the Oireachtas be removed and that we have instead a rational method of dealing with State-sponsored organisations on the basis of accountability to the Government and accountability to the Oireachtas.</P>

I do not know what the Minister means when he talks about a common policy with regard to State bodies and the authorities generally concerned to administer our affairs.  I would argue most strongly that, if this means that the chief executive officer in one body is to be paid the same salary as the chief executive in another, the policy is entirely wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are going to have in this case, if I understand what is proposed, a <Col N="731" /> body vested with extraordinary power, extraordinary responsibility, a body whose chief executive officer is not merely going to be someone with a competency, training and experience in affairs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Despite my own degree of skill, or whatever competency I may have, I cannot profess to have understood fully all that Senator Dooge was saying, nor what the Minister was saying in reply.  The sort of person we are going to have in charge of this body is a person who is not merely shrewd and intelligent in dealing with people, trained in all the modern skills in relation to affairs, but he is a person who understands the ways of scientists and the language of scientists.  Otherwise, he would not be able to reach or advise the board on the right decisions.  Such a person must be paid, perhaps, a salary which will stagger everybody, particularly the Minister for Finance and his advisers.</P>

      <P>I think Senator FitzGerald has a point here, particularly in relation to such an important body as this.  You do not want to find yourself&mdash;I am sure what the Minister has said has covered it&mdash;in the silly position that you cannot command the qualities you want for an organisation as important as this.  The difficulty I see, as the Minister mentioned, in opening a wide area is the possible influence that a very high salary may have on many other areas. Nevertheless, I think that in the case of this body you may need to have a high degree of flexibility because you have got to get the person with right qualities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question but that the chief executive in a position like this would have to be paid on a basis unrelated to any other executive post in the country because very specialised qualities are required. What I was suggesting was that the same system of remuneration should apply to all State bodies.  On a formula such as is incorporated here the relevant Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, should fix the remuneration.  Obviously, the remuneration in this case, if we are to get the right man, could be quite an expensive item.  But it is the system of fixing the remuneration that I feel, and the Government feel, should be on a common basis.  At present you have so many variations of the method of appointment and the method of remuneration in regard to the chief executives of State-sponsored bodies that it just does not make sense.  In some cases one cannot even get the information by way of question in the Dáil because the particular legislation is drawn in such a way as to make it entirely the prerogative of the board and the Minister cannot inquire into it and the legislator cannot inquire into it.  I think this is indefensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that this whole question should be on a straightforward, open basis.  There will be variations in the remuneration, of course, depending on the job to be filled and the person to be appointed.  But at least there should be a straightforward system of appointment and of remuneration common to <Col N="733" /> all State-sponsored agencies.  This information should be available to the Government and to the Oireachtas, and I look forward to the time when Oireachtas Committees can have such chief executives before them to outline their work, their policies and their expenditure.  This is very desirable.  The other practice has grown up over the years because we established our various State-sponsored bodies on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, meeting a situation with <i>ad hoc</i> legislation.  Now is the time to co-ordinate these various State-sponsored bodies and to ensure that the Government&mdash;and the Oireachtas above all else&mdash;can have all of these bodies under an umbrella where, consistent with public policy, the fullest investigation can take place and the fullest knowledge is made plain, not alone to the Oireachtas and the Government, but to the public in regard to the activities of such bodies.</P>

      <P>I share the Minister's view that there ought to be procedures whereby the public, through its representatives, are able to have, in some fashion&mdash;perhaps directly and not even through committees&mdash; control over the operations of State bodies.  Frankly, if it is found that somebody is being paid, say, £15,000 a year&mdash;I mention that figure because I heard of an Irishman who was being paid that amount in Britain and had to be persuaded to vacate his job and come back to run an industry here.  I can see what could happen in Dáil Éireann the day it is disclosed that someone is being paid £15,000 a year to run a State body.  The danger of one such debate taking place is that no person would be advised to take such a position with a State body.  Indeed, in the past certain people's names have been dragged in the mud here&mdash;not with my approval&mdash;people who were doing magnificent jobs in their positions. It was undesirable that their names should be dragged in the mud. They were tough characters and were able to stand up to it.  The House probably knows one or two of those I have in mind.  There will be many people who will have the qualities required for this job but who will not be prepared to stand up to this sort of <Col N="734" /> thing and who will not take the job. The Minister should get this information from this board, but does that necessarily oblige the Minister to pass it on?  I think the Minister receives a lot of information on all sorts of subjects which he does not choose to give to Dáil Éireann in answer to questions. I do not mean the Minister personally</P>

      <P>I do not know to what extent this has been covered as I am engaged on another job which prevented me from being here for the full discussion.  We are on section 12 (4) which states that the board may at any time remove any officer or servant of the board from being its officer or servant.  It seems to me that that provision in subsection (4) is too blunt and too wide.  There is no requirement on the board's part to state their reasons why they wish to remove an officer or servant from office.  It does not matter, to my mind, from the point of view of presenting the argument, whether the person involved is a servant or an officer or whether the particular office he holds is one of considerable importance or one of lesser importance, I would suggest to the Minister that in ordinary justice there should be an obligation on the board, if they want to remove any officer or servant, to state their reasons for doing so.  I would ask the Minister to consider inserting in that subsection the words &ldquo;for stated reasons&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any need for the addition suggested by the Senator in this matter. There is no detraction from the legal rights the employee has under both statutes and common law.  This gives the board this discretion in regard to its officers or servants.  Any officer or servant has his or her rights in regard to what legal action he or she may take.  It is a standard type of subsection and it is designed to ensure that the board would have complete discretion in regard to the matter of employment of staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that point of view.  Perhaps I could have anticipated that that would be the <Col N="735" /> Minister's reply.  Possibly I should have dealt in my remarks also with subsection (2).  Subsection (2) gives the board certain rights to fix the terms and conditions of employment.  It seems to me that it would be open to the board, in fixing the terms and conditions of employment, to incorporate a condition that the officer or servant would not have any right to require the board to furnish information in the event of the board desiring to remove him from his office.  If the Minister wants to talk legalities it seems to me to be the legal position that the board would be given authority, implicit in subsection (2), to fix conditions of employment which would preclude the officer or servant requiring reasons in the event of his dismissal.  When you couple that with the blunt provision in subsection (4) that the board may at any time remove an officer or servant from the service of the board then it does seem to me that there is danger that circumstances may arise where an officer or servant is removed and is unable to ascertain from the board why he is being removed. I do not see that it weakens this section in any way if the Minister imposed in subsection (4) an obligation on the board to state their reasons in the event of their requiring to remove an officer or a servant.</P>

      <P>I rise to emphasise a point.  I know that Senator FitzGerald has impressed himself on the Minister. But I feel that the points which Senator FitzGerald made warrant full and detailed consideration.  With this Bill we are entering a new field.  It is a field which, of necessity, should command the advice or employment of people in very specialised subjects.  We will have to utilise the advice, brains or intelligence of nuclear physicists, of mathematicians, maybe of experts in computer services.  All over the world today these people are commanding a salary far beyond what we consider here as a good salary, especially salaries given to chairmen or leaders of semi-State bodies.  It would not be correct to have second rate individuals advising us, that is, individuals with second rate knowledge; I <Col N="736" /> am sure the Minister will agree with me that we are looking for experts. These people, if they have any ability at all, can command a huge salary. Senator FitzGerald mentioned something in the nature of £15,000 a year, and this is not an exaggeration.  These people can command this in other countries.  If we are to be comparable in this field of nuclear energy we must employ people who will work, give us the benefit of their advice, knowledge and intelligence and we will also have to pay them on a scale comparable to that which they can command in other parts of the world.</P>
      <P>In other semi-State bodies people are not commanding the salaries commanded by people in the field of nuclear physics.  I am not saying whether they should or not; I do not know all their abilities.  Perhaps some of them should not.  I do not want to make an odious comparison, but if we have to get the right men we have got to pay them here&mdash;and this, of course, raises a hare immediately.</P>
      <P>The people involved in running or advising other State bodies will immediately demand increased salary scales.  I do not know the answer to this.  It is a fair point to put before the Minister.  Specialised knowledge is required here and specialised knowledge cannot be commanded unless those having it are paid on the same standard, or nearly so, as their counterparts in other countries.  If we have those people here with these abilities, they will emigrate if they do not get the salary that is commanded generally. Senator FitzGerald has made a very valid point.  I have not produced any solution for the Minister, but it is no harm to indicate the difficulties facing him.  To that extent I support what Senator FitzGerald has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EvelynOwens" hpid="Miss Owens Miss Owens">
      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of what Senator O'Higgins said under subsection (4), I would agree with him that it seems to be presenting the board with a blank cheque for the removal of officers and servants.  It may be intended that, under subsection (2), the conditions of employment would cover the type of dismissal and presumably would cover the necessity to inform the employee <Col N="737" /> tion of the State-sponsored organisaas to why it is being done.  But subsection (4) does seem to give the board rather dictatorial powers in regard to the removal of officers and servants. Perhaps if the Minister had a look at the local government code he might add another subsection which would give a right of appeal to the Minister. There is a procedure for appeal under the local government code and it might very well be valid in the case of this section also.</P>
      <P>I find myself, rather strangely, in agreement with the Minister and not in agreement with Senator FitzGerald on the question of subsection (3).  I would not like to go into a debate&mdash; even if the Cathaoirleach allowed it&mdash; as to whether we should have a review of all higher remunerations.  However, I am inclined to think that all the officers and chief executive officers&mdash; indeed any grade that is not arbitrable under an existing scheme&mdash;should, in fact, come within the scope of the review body.  I do not think there is anything wrong with disclosing what salary is offered for the job or what, in fact, the man is getting.  Presumably, the post of chief executive officer will be advertised in the public Press.  His salary should be stated.  The public will have to face the fact that it is going to be a very important post, requiring a high degree of skill and knowledge, and that the proper rate for the job should be paid.  I do not think keeping it quiet helps the public in any way, or would help the chief executive officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put to the point raised by Senator O'Higgins, and encouraged by Senator Owens, I find it difficult to visualise their being able to employ either officers or servants if written into the whole contract was something that deprived these officers and servants of their rights.  It is going to prove difficult enough getting the right people without writing anything so ridiculous into the terms of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other point, I will agree with Senator Owens that I hope the Minister will not listen to Senator FitzGerald. I have been a Member of the <Col N="738" /> Senand for 27 years and in all that time there has been an unending fight to persuade the Executive that it was desirable that any State or semi-State body should be answerable to Parliament and that a Minister should not be allowed to duck behind a provision and say: &ldquo;This is day-to-day administration; I have no function; the Deputy will get no answer.&rdquo;  In the same way the Public Accounts Committee has advocated time and time again that public bodies should be answerable, because they are dealing with public money.  I hope the Minister will stick to this and that we will have full accountability.  The people of this country are sophisticated enough to realise&mdash;I do not think they are half so silly as some people would make out&mdash;that, if you have a very important job requiring a very specialised knowledge and you are in competition with other countries, the job has to be paid for.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone will really baulk at this sort of thing.  Of course, you may get the old chap in the pub who says: &ldquo;Look at what he is getting and I am doing far more&rdquo;, but you will get that anywhere.  If you only pay £2,500 there will be fellows down the country who will say he should not be given any more than a road worker. I do not think the Minister should be put off by this and I imagine he will not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the last point first, there is no question but that the chief executive of an organisation such as this will have to be paid at the rate that he or she would command in the international market, and it ought obviously be a very highly paid job.  That goes without saying. What I am saying, though, is this: I see nothing wrong with disclosing that.  I agree with Senator Sheldon and with Senator Evelyn Owens.  I feel we are a more sophisticated and mature race than many people give us credit for&mdash;including ourselves.  I do not see any reason in the world why there should not be such a disclosure.  Certainly, since I became Minister for Transport and Power, I have made it a practice to answer questions in the Dáil relating to the internal administrations <Col N="739" /> under my aegis, and I look forward to the time we can fully implement the Devlin recommendations in regard to the supervision of the State-sponsored bodies by the Public Accounts Committee or by some other Committee, so that the chief executives of these various organisations can be as accountable to the Oireachtas or to an Oireachtas Committee in the same manner as the accounting officer of a Department of State is accountable.  I have discussed this with some of the chief executives of the State-sponsored organisations and, contrary to the view traditionally held that they were trying to hide something, the best of them welcome the chance of coming here and explaining the position, explaining their policies before such an Oireachtas Committee.  I think this is all for the good of democracy and political education generally in the country.  However, this is not really relevant.  I think I am responsible for broadening the debate a bit in this matter, but the fact is that the Minister for Transport and Power, with or without the consent of the Minister for Finance&mdash;and I feel it should be with his consent&mdash;cannot get the sort of brains required for this type of operation without paying for them.  It is as straightforward as that.</P>
      <P>Relative to what both Senator O'Higgins and Senator Owens had to say in regard to the nature of the removal from employment provision in subsection (4), perhaps Senator Owens's suggestion of incorporating a right of appeal to the Minister might meet the point of view expressed by both Senators.  That might be a better way of doing it, by adding a subsection there providing for a right of appeal to the Minister.</P>

In considering what he will do about the inspection of premises I hope he will bear section 13 in mind because this gives the board power to have any of its functions performed through a servant.

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister, when he is looking at section 13, to look back at section 10 and consider, in the light of the language of section 13, what I have said with regard to the board proposing to make any contracts.  It seems quite clear that under section 13 the board can propose to make a contract with an officer or a servant.  The proposal might be of such a general nature that the contract might not emerge to the knowledge of the board until a much later stage.  I am still not happy about the words &ldquo;proposing to make a contract&rdquo;.  Disclosure of the interest should only be necessary under section 10 when the members of the board&mdash;and not their officers or servants under section 13&mdash;propose to make the contract.

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister, in regard to section 14 and the question of superannuation schemes, whether this is broad enough to allow for the board, at its own wish, to introduce either a contributory or a non-contributory scheme.  It seems to me that, as read here, the board is confined to a contributory scheme only.  Even if the board consider that, in view of the particular market of potential employees, a non-contributory scheme was better, they would not be empowered to introduce a non-contributory scheme.  What is the reason for this restriction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Senator is right in his interpretation.  It is limited to a contributory scheme which is the usual provision in the case of all State-sponsored bodies.  One could not envisage a scheme where there would be no contribution at all from employees of such an organisation. There would have to be some contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>But this does happen in some organisations from which persons might be drawn.  It happens at the moment in the Civil Service.  It happens in many of our academic institutions. In the absence of any scheme such as there is in Britain of the FSSU, where free transfer from one scheme to another is possible.  If there is no way out of this and if it is necessary that it be confined to a contributory scheme, it should be a flexible scheme.  It should be possible, in respect of a person coming in from outside, to make special arrangements whereby that person may be able to transfer from any scheme which is based on an insurance policy and that he would not be left in the position where it was necessary for him to be part of a contributory scheme of the type which rules in semi-State bodies and of this scheme only.  There is a great need for flexibility here.  I think the section may be drawn a little too tightly to allow for such flexibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="742" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a reading of the section as a whole it is very flexible. Apart from the limitation to contributory, it does limit the percentage of contribution which could vary from 1 per cent to 50 per cent.  The rest of the section is very flexibly phrased and will enable an arrangement to be made between a potential employee and the board in regard to the type of scheme and the conditions attached to it.  In any such arrangement, of course, the degree of contribution would be a factor to be taken into account in the arrangement of salary between the potential employee and the board itself. Apart from the limitation with regard to &ldquo;contributory&rdquo; it is wide enough. The reason why we have &ldquo;contributory&rdquo; there is because that is the position with regard to all other State bodies.  There is a contribution element in the superannuation and the percentage of contribution varies in every case.  Consistent with the principle, which I mentioned earlier on, of the degree of consistency with regard to administration and statute obtaining with regard to all of these boards, I feel we should not make an exception in the case of this particular organisation with regard to superannuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with the Minister, provided one can interpret as different classes of persons, persons who before employment were in different types of superannuation schemes in their previous employment, that the section might prove flexible apart from the inbuilt difficulty that all schemes must be contributory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a further point with regard to superannuation that I should like to raise.  The success of this board, particularly in its early years, will depend on its ability to recruit staff. We are, in this country, rather disinclined to change jobs.  There is in our employment, particularly the employment of skilled personnel, far too little mobility for the good of the country or, indeed, for the good of the individual. We have made some move towards overcoming that in allowing transfer of pension rights under the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1963, and I would hope that Act will <Col N="743" /> be fully availed of in regard to the new Nuclear Energy Board.</P>
    <P>In that regard I should like to ask the Minister if he would now be prepared to say, on the passage of the Bill, that all senior posts under the Nuclear Energy Board will be designated and that in fact it will be a designated organisation under the 1963 Act, so that from the very first day it would be clear that persons transferring from other bodies will be able to carry their pensionable service.  I would ask that, at the very least, there would be immediate designation of all posts under the 1963 Act.  I would also raise the general question&mdash;not for decision now but perhaps for discussion between the Minister and his colleagues&mdash;that as it is now ten years since the introduction of this code consideration might be given towards moving further along the road of mobility.  Some Members will recall that, when the 1963 Act was introduced, it was introduced in a most tentative fashion.  In practice the Act has been used to a greater extent than was envisaged when it was framed.  Its success has been such that consideration might well be given to introducing permanent legislation which would do away with the necessity of designating different bodies or designating separate posts.  If this step were taken it would greatly facilitate recruitment under this particular Bill.</P>
    <P>At the very least I should like the Minister to express an intention of making the Nuclear Energy Board a designated body under the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1963.  Inability to transfer pension rights has been the great obstacle to the mobility of highly-trained personnel.  It has been removed in respect of many jobs.  There are others in which it could be removed and, in respect, of those in which it can be overcome, the procedure could, with advantage, be made less clumsy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the proposal to make the Nuclear Energy Board a designated body for the purpose of the Superannuation Act, 1963.  I can assure Senator Dooge that is the intention. The section is designed to ensure that intention can be carried out.  I agree <Col N="744" /> with him also on the whole principle of mobility in regard to the transfer of pension rights.  Again, the section is sufficiently widely drafted to enable that to be incorporated as well in regard to any such arrangement of bringing over pension rights into the new organisation from an existing organisation.  I agree with the Senator on both these aspects.</P>

      <P>On section 15, subsection (1) (c), I object to the inclusion of this clause in the Bill.  It can mean that any number of years can be lost forever in calculating a pension.  A similar type of clause was introduced into the Horse Industry Bill and the Opposition benches here raised it unsuccessfully with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  It seems to be an innovation in legislation in the last few years.  As I understand it, the situation which previously existed in regard to semi-State bodies was that if a person became a member of either House he had the option of paying the contributions himself, thereby preserving his pension rights under this scheme.  As the scheme envisaged under this Bill is to be a contributory pension scheme I do not see any reason why we should now say that it is not possible to reckon any whole or any part of the period while serving in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we all know, the life of any Senator or Member of Dáil Éireann can be precarious.  I am sure it has already happened that Members have served for six years or six years and nine months and have not qualified for an Oireachtas pension.  If this scheme is to operate for an officer or a servant of the Nuclear Energy Board, there is no <Col N="745" /> way in which he could make up those six years again.  This could mean, depending on the service and the type of scheme brought in, if it follows the normal type of superannuation scheme, he could be disqualified from earning his full pension if he enters the Nuclear Energy Board at an age when he could not make up the 40 years if six years are taken off because of membership of the Dáil or Seanad.  This is very unfair, particularly when dealing with pension rights.  I would go further and say that, depending on how long the person in question lived, it could happen that he would lose all his benefits under either scheme, that is if he were unfortunate enough to die at the wrong time.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge mentioned on the previous section that it is quite normal now for service to be transferred from one pension scheme to another.  If it is not possible&mdash;and I contend that it still is&mdash;for an officer or servant to have the right to continue paying the superannuation contributions himself&mdash; thereby contributing to two pension funds, one for the House of the Oireachtas and one for the Nuclear Energy Authority&mdash;surely the overall service can be reckoned for pension purposes? I do not think it should be beyond the ability of the accounting staff in both organisations to make the financial adjustment.  This happens quite regularly as between one local authority and another where there has been transferred service.  I strongly object to this section because I think we may be perpetrating a great injustice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Miss Owens.  It is the present statutory position in regard to other bodies in this field such as CIE and the air companies.  I do not see why a person who becomes a Member of the Oireachtas should be prejudiced in this way.  The option would be to pay the double contribution, to pay his or her own contribution and the contribution which the organisation would pay, so as to sustain the pension during the period of absence from the organisation. I will prepare an amendment along those lines between now and the Report Stage.  This would not in any <Col N="746" /> way qualify a person to draw two pensions.</P>

      <P>There is an argument to be made about not drawing two pensions.  The two contributions would be quite large; it would work out at around 12 per cent overall, which is quite a substantial amount.  Perhaps the second way of allowing the service in the House of the Oireachtas to be added on to the service would be a better way of dealing with it, because there is a contribution in the House of the Oireachtas as well.  I do not know what contribution the Minister has in mind or what the board will bring in, but it is usually in the region of between 5 per cent and 7 per cent.  I think it is 6½ per cent in the ESB and 5 per cent in the local authorities.  That might be the better way to do it.  I would be quite satisfied if the Minister has a look at it and brings in an amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister's attitude to this is most commendable. I was most impressed by the argument which Miss Owens made on this section and on the similar section in the Horse Industry Bill.  The argument made by her then was not accepted.  I want to make this point. The reason why, I am sure, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries did not accept it was because we were debating that measure when the Dáil adjourned or was about to adjourn, and the Minister could not accept it without going back to that House, which is one of the disagreeable features of being faced with a lot of legislation in the last week of July.</P>

      <P>The point that arises on subsection (4) of section 16, <Col N="747" /> on which I should like clarification, is this.  The subsection reads:</P>
      <P>The acts of a committee appointed under this section shall be subject to confirmation by the board.</P>
      <P>The query is whether in fact executive action can be taken as the result of a committee decision between the date of the committee meeting and the confirmation of the board.  Or does it mean that all decisions of committees &mdash;this might well be important in the actual operation of this board&mdash;must be suspended until such time as the board meets and confirms the committee decision?</P>

      <P>I agree with the Senator there.  The purpose of subsections (1), (2) and (3) is to delegate to the committee functions which in the opinion of the board, can better be performed by the committee.  Then the composition of the committee is given in subsection (3) and then the acts of the committee who have been appointed to perform functions shall be confirmed by the board subsequently.  I think it hangs together.  I will have a look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should have a look at it.  There is the general point that there is a reflection here of one of the faults of delegation in practice.  There is insufficient realisation that the delegation of power to make decisions should include delegation of the power to make mistakes, even if only in the short term.  Delegation that does not include delegation of power to make mistakes in the short term is not worthy of the name of delegation at all.  It is quite proper that a committee to which power is being delegated should report to the delegating body, so that they can perhaps overrule or perhaps make their intentions more clear to the committee to <Col N="748" /> whom they delegate.  But to leave it in a position that the delegation is merely just the offloading of work and not the real dispersion of power is something that is not worth while and, indeed, something that this organisation would be better without.</P>

      <P>Under subsection (3) the committee to be appointed here can consist&mdash;it is quite clearly expressed in the language of the subsection&mdash;of persons who are not members of the board, but who have delegated to them the functions of the board.  There is no obligation on them, such as is on members of the board, to disclose interest under section 10.  So you can have a board which should be getting a recommendation from a committee which consists of persons who are not members of the board, who are interested in the matter in hand, and who are making a contract subject to the confirmation of the board.  The board may not be aware of the fact that this is coloured by an interested party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>To be quite candid about this, I have not yet directed my mind to the precise nature of the annual report and the form that it will take.  Under subsection (2) it is flexible enough, as the Seanad can see.  That subsection gives the Minister power to direct what the annual report shall include with regard to information on any particular aspect of the board's proceedings, as the Minister may specify.  It is broad enough to include whatever the Minister wants at a particular time.  Has the Senator any particular view on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one particular point that occurred to me. The Minister, in issuing instructions to the board in this regard, should not forget the very important public relations aspect of the problem.  We talked about this on Second Stage: the fact that the public are perhaps predisposed against nuclear energy, against the use of radioactive substances, because of the connotations of nuclear war and its horrors.  It might be as well if the Minister would urge the board, in making their report, that they should keep this fully in mind.  For example, they might well include descriptions of the precautions that are being taken to an extent which purely for informational purposes for the Minister, or for those who would be directly interested, might seem tedious, repetitive, perhaps facile and hardly worth including in a report of this type.  The report should be considered as being in part a report to the public.  The Nuclear Energy Board should be very much concerned, not only in its report but in all its actions, with its public function, as well as with its economic and scientific decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>This section ties up with sections 5 and 6.  One can appreciate that for an offence under section 6 the board might prosecute. However, as I understand it, an offence under section 5 would be an offence against a code not prepared by the board to be regulated by itself; not prepared to be regulated by it as an agent of the Minister for Transport and Power, but in regard to advising, in regard to codes to be regulated and administered by other Departments of State or by other agencies.  If this is so, then the intention is that the Nuclear Energy Board might act as a prosecutor in regard to a code on which they had given advice, but a code in respect of which they really have no statutory standing once it had given its advice, and the code has been promulgated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the situation. Under subsection (1) (c) of section 5 the board can be requested by a Minister of State&mdash;any of the Ministers concerned with the field of nuclear activity&mdash;to act as agent for the Minister for the enforcement of safety regulations made by the particular Minister dealing with fissile or other radioactive substances or irradiating apparatus.  That is the situation.  Somebody must do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more.  I have been on earlier sections urging that it is appropriate that one body should prosecute, just as I think it is appropriate that there should be one regulatory body.  But the Minister is taking the position that there should be more than one regulatory body, that the Minister for Health should still maintain inspectors and that the Minister for Labour should still maintain inspectors.  Is it then appropriate that the Nuclear Energy Board or their officers should, in fact, initiate the prosecution?  If it is the Minister for Health's regulations that are being breached, should not the prosecution be brought on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said on the last <Col N="752" /> occasion that I would hope we would move towards a situation where the sole agency concerned with this whole thing will be the Nuclear Energy Board.  We are not interfering for the present with existing functions discharged by the Minister for Labour or the Minister for Health in this particular field.  You have the administrative apparatus residing in both of these Government Departments at the moment concerned with this matter. You have officers there.  You cannot overnight transfer them to the body that is very much in the embryo stage at the present time.  When this body develops, I would envisage it absorbing the whole thing from the staff point of view and the administration point of view.  Pending that, I would suggest that from the prosecution point of view, we can do that immediately, have them as the sole authority for that.  It will be evidence of the fact that we propose, furthermore, to have them as the sole authority ultimately in regard to all staff and administration relating to nuclear matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is attempting to disarm me by saying that he is moving in the direction I wish him to go.  I see a difficulty here.  It may well be that what the Minister says will happen, that it is appropriate the board will initiate prosecutions under all the various regulatory codes.  It may then become the custom that it is the Nuclear Energy Board which initiates all prosecutions.  We now come round to the point: what happens when it has to prosecute itself? If it is responsible for the safe conduct of the importation of fuel it may do this on a direct basis and, indeed, it may find itself in a position somewhat reminiscent of some of our great Celtic art, a position of devouring its own tail in this particular respect.</P>
      <P>I realise the section does say &ldquo;may&rdquo; but if in fact the intention is that they should be the main prosecuting agency, then, they may without realising it, issue a summons against themselves one fine day.</P>

      <P>Could I refer to section 6.  I think it was agreed in the <Col N="753" /> discussion that the inspectors would act as agents of the Minister.  If that is the case, is it correct that it would be the board that would prosecute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  The board would prosecute in all these cases.  I think I am meeting Senator Dooge's point by an amendment which I propose to bring in on Report Stage to section 5, and which I indicated on the last occasion I would bring in, that is to eliminate the word &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo; which is in section 5, subsection (2) (b) and (c).  Where &ldquo;responsibility for&rdquo; is the wording at the moment, to substitute instead the phrase &ldquo;the making of arrangements to ensure&rdquo; and then continue with &ldquo;the safe custody of fissile fuel&rdquo; and &ldquo;making arrangements to ensure safe operation of nuclear power.&rdquo;  That would eliminate the situation where the board would be in a position of prosecuting themselves for which they had responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I was spent, but I am not.  Section 6 creates an offence.  This section provides for the liability of a person who is guilty of an offence.  Section 5 creates no offence and there is no provision for liability if someone is convicted of the offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>This point is again a reinforcement of this difficulty of a multiple code.  As I take it, the penalties for the offences which would arise under orders provided for in section 5 are prescribed in the statutes to which section 5 refers.  I think there may well be difficulties in the fact that we again have this idea of prosecution by the Nuclear Board for penalties that are in statutes which have nothing to do with the Nuclear Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, in effect, the situation: that the prosecution is envisaged.  There are other than prosecutions under section 6 or prosecutions under other regulatory codes that exist at the moment, primarily, say, <Col N="754" /> under the Factories Acts and under the various Health Acts where there are specified offences and penalties laid down.  This enables the Nuclear Energy Board to prosecute under these sections of these other codes in respect of nuclear radioactive offences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to my colleague and the Minister for that information.  But, just for my own understanding of it, is the position under section 5 (1) that the board will draft the regulations which will then be made by Ministers under existing statutes which themselves contain provisions for offences if the regulations are made?  But, to take up Senator Dooge's point, would it not be a great help if we had all of this in this Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be the idea.  As I say, the reason why it has not been done is the pragmatic reason of getting this organisation going.  First of all, it will have to grow and develop. If one were to automatically transfer existing functions, functions that are working admirably under the administrative apparatus of existing legislation with particular Departments and Ministers, I do not think it would be appropriate to transfer them until the &ldquo;child&rdquo; here has grown up, as it were. It is going to take some time to get this organisation properly going and at that stage, once it has proved itself and once it has developed its role, I would envisage legislation being introduced&mdash;this might take a few years&mdash; to absorb all the other functions concerning nuclear matters that now reside under statute with these other Departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>We are on this section concerned with prosecutions and which has raised the question of penalties.  When we were speaking on an earlier section, the Minister did indicate that he hoped the penalties in regard to all the various breaches which might be made under different codes would be the same.  Since we had that discussion I have managed to take a look at the position and find that, in fact, if prosecution is taken under section 5 by bringing into play the Health Act, 1953, the penalty will be <Col N="755" /> quite different in some respects from the penalty under section 6.</P>
      <P>The Health Act allows for a fine on summary conviction not exceeding £500, whereas in section 6 on summary conviction the fine may not exceed £100.  Of course, on a conviction of indictment the fine is £500 and we have provision for imprisonment in the penalties under section 6, but no such provision under the Health Act code.  I think it might well be that the Minister should take a look, possibly before Report Stage, at the penalties under the Health Act and the Factories Act.  There may, indeed, be a case for amending those particular statutes to bring the penalties into line.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;()&mdash;(1) There shall, by virtue of this section, be established a committee to be known as Coiste Comhairle Breoslai (in this section referred to as &lsquo;the committee&rsquo;) to perform the functions assigned to it by this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="756" /> (2)  The committee shall, in addition to any other functions assigned to it by the Minister, have the following general functions&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) to advise the Minister on State fuel policy and matters connected therewith,</P>
    <P>(b) to keep itself informed concerning all aspects of the production, supply and distribution of fuel in all parts of the world and development of and research for and upon substitutes for fuel now in use in industry, agriculture, commerce, transport and by private consumers,</P>
    <P>(c) to advise in the formulation of a State policy for the coordination of the utilisation of fuel in industry, agriculture, commerce, transport and by private consumers.</P>
    <P>(3)  The committee may do all such other things as arise out of or are consequential on the functions assigned to the committee by or under this section.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Minister shall appoint the committee which shall consist of not less than ten nor more than 20 persons and shall determine the period for which the committee shall hold office.</P>
    <P>(5)  In making an order under this section the Minister may prescribe conditions and the committee shall comply with such conditions.</P>
    <P>(6)  The committee to be appointed by the Minister shall include representatives of the producers, suppliers, distributors, researchers upon and users of fuel.</P>
    <P>(7)  The Minister may by order bring this section into operation notwithstanding that the Government has not made an order under subsection (1) of section 2.</P>
    <P>(8)  The Minister may by order revoke or amend an order made under this section.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to say very much about this amendment because I have already argued on both Second Reading and Committee Stage for the <Col N="757" /> establishment of such a committee.  I wish to summarise my position on it and perhaps direct the Minister's attention in particular to subsection (7) in relation to this advisory body.  I am told that my Irish description of the proposed committee is not correct; the person who told me so said that this really only qualified it for the Irish naming of a statutory body, that it had to have some slight defect in it to be right.  However, I do not know whether this is fair.</P>
    <P>The general thinking is that we should bring together for the benefit of the Minister all the different bodies that are concerned with fuel.  Events which have occurred and reports that have been made since this debate began in the Seanad only emphasise the view which I expressed on the Second Reading&mdash;that we are facing not a possible crisis which is likely to disappear quickly but a long period which will be critical.  I am thinking in terms of ten years rather than two years.  There are all sorts of possible political conditions which can exacerbate this present situation.  If I may make a general comment in regard to the way we conduct our affairs, I think we would find in the Common Market countries that Departments and State bodies tend to pursue their own independent lines without sufficient effort being made to cohere all the lines to make a unified policy.  The advisers to the Minister would find it of benefit if they were being advised by a body of people who know all about the planning of our industry&mdash;representatives of industrial development authorities as well as the Department of Industry and Commerce, people like CIE who pursue their own policy with regard to transport, people in the Department of Local Government who pursue their own policy with regard to road construction and the utilisation of road transport and so on, the ESB, the Gas Company, all the oil companies and the coal importers.  If all these people were thinking ahead for the bad day when the Minister would be advising his colleagues, presumably in the Government, that the Government must make an order under section 2 declaring that the crisis had come, <Col N="758" /> every kind of contingency would be considered.  If the representatives of industry were meeting the representatives of the fuel importers and the oil companies, each would be likely to suggest trains of thought to each other which would be of benefit in meeting the different contingencies and in thinking up the kind of provisions that ought to be made for them.</P>
    <P>There is no Government amendment before us.  I find this depressing, because I would not advise the Minister to accept the amendment I have put down myself.  Someone in Parliament to whom I spoke about this said he just put down an amendment and told the House that he was not the parliamentary draftsman, nor was he being paid for being such.  Neither am I the parliamentary draftsman, nor being paid for being such.  I have tried to express here the idea of the sort of body that ought to be there and the sort of powers that I think the Minister should take with regard to it.  It is not possible at this stage to expect him to come up with an amendment in substitution for what Senator Russell and I have put down, but he has the Dáil to look forward to and I would press him to give thought to this, and if I may say so, as I have done before putting down this amendment, to consult with people who are concerned with the planning of industry and these various interests.  Quite a number of those to whom I have spoken see great merit in a body of this kind which would have a purely advisory function and which would come into existence whenever the Minister wanted to bring it into existence, but which I should have thought he would bring into existence as soon as he decided who were the right persons.  I should have mentioned, not merely industry but farming also because that aspect of it is there to be represented too.  I have no more to say on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a word in support of this.  Senator FitzGerald is perhaps being very modest when he speaks about the drafting of this amendment.  This, to me, is an excellent amendment and an excellently drafted one.  I cannot see <Col N="759" /> that it would, in any way, clog the operation of the Minister or the Government under the Bill if it were to be accepted.  I am not suggesting this as a device to the Minister, but it is clear from the amendment that there is no question of Senator FitzGerald or anyone else trying to force the Minister's hand to bring into being a body of this description if it is not wanted or when it is not wanted.  Discretion is given to the Minister under the terms of the amendment as to when such a body might come into being.  Having said that, I could agree entirely with the remarks of Senator FitzGerald as regards the desirability of having this body and of having this body now.  The Minister has already pointed out very clearly that the Bill is in the nature of a precautionary measure.  He hoped that it would not be necessary to invoke its provisions at all, but that in the kind of war or near-war situation and certainly the acute scarcity situation which was envisaged that it was desirable to have the powers contained in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The kind of body which is suggested by Senator FitzGerald in this amendment would, I think, be useful to the Minister not only in the conditions which the Minister envisages&mdash;possibly it would be less useful to him in those conditions than in more normal conditions&mdash;but with the prospect of the type of condition occurring that the Minister envisages, it certainly would seem that, before it occurs, a body of this sort could be of very great use in advising the Minister and his Department.  The suggestion is that they should be purely an advisory consultative type of body and that they should advise on questions of State fuel policy.  I do not want to indulge in anything which would seem to be contentious in urging this amendment, but I think there is a feeling held by some that it is necessary there should be, and known to be, a State fuel policy when a situation, such as the Bill, as it stands, is designed to meet, might arise.  It seems to me desirable that in framing and in pursuing a State policy on fuel, it is not only a question which should concern the Minister, <Col N="760" /> as the political head of his Department, and his civil servants: it is a question of vital concern to the ordinary consumer and of vital concern to the people engaged in industry as well as those engaged in the business of fuel production or importation or trading in fuels and I would urge the Minister to accept the amendment as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am against this amendment.  I will have a look at it between now and the Dáil, but the arguments against it are quite substantial. First of all, it is superfluous. I and my officials have regular discussions with the various fuel interests in the country.  There is a specific fuel and power division in my Department. That division is in daily communication with coal importers, oil interests and the various power operators directly under my control, such as Bord na Móna and the ESB, and also CIE, which has also a substantial store of fuel.  All of these bodies are directly under the aegis of my Department. As I say, there is regular contact maintained with the private interests, primarily the oil and coal importing interests in this country.  In addition, we are members of OECD and, as such, we are members not alone of the specialised oil committee of OECD but of the more general energy committee of that body.  Each of these committees meet at least twice a year and there is a wide exchange of information and advice.  Therefore, there is almost day to day contact between this section of my Department and the various national and international interests concerned.  We are at the moment negotiating with the oil interests with a view to increasing stock supply.  At the moment we have stock levels held at a level of two months supply, as far as the State is concerned, by arrangement with the oil interests&mdash; Gulf Oil in Bantry, the other oil companies and the oil refinery in Cork. In addition, the ESB and CIE have special stocks for their own use with a three months supply limit.  Just now we are negotiating with the oil interests to increase that supply level above the two months supply, and all OECD countries are doing this at the <Col N="761" /> present time with the various oil interests.</P>
      <P>During the winter there was danger of a coal shortage by reason of the diminished coal production situation in Europe and Britain and America and we had regular meetings and discussions with representatives of Irish Coal Importers Limited and we revised our arrangements with Poland as the main current supplier to us.  In these circumstances I do not see what is to be gained by having a committee of the kind proposed in the amendment, because I can assure the House that there is constantly the closest degree of discussion, negotiation, and communication in this particular region&mdash; and rightly so because it is such a vital area.  The whole question of fuel and power is basic to the community.  It is so vital that there is, as I say, a specific division in my Department concerned with it.  At any time of difficulty, such as the coal crisis that was likely to loom up before Christmas and the oil crisis that was recently with us, I personally am in constant communication with the officers concerned and get regular reports on the whole position.</P>
      <P>The big difficulty in stockpiling, of course, particularly in regard to oil, is the cost.  I might mention to the Seanad, as a matter of interest, that it costs at least £6 million to store one month's supply of oil alone.  For that reason it is out of the question for the State to supply storage capacity.  What we are doing is making arrangements now with the oil companies to lift the percentage of oil on constant storage here so as to go well above the two months with which we have been content for some years.  We want to get over three months supply as a minimum, if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to what I have said just now I can, if I want to, at any stage set up such an <i>ad hoc</i> committee.  I do not see any particular reason why it should be incorporated in a statute. There is no reason in the wide earthly world, if I am not satisfied about the degree of communication existing between my Department and the fuel and power industry generally, why I cannot set up this sort of body myself. <Col N="762" /> I do not require the authorisation of statute to do so.  So then, all in all, I do not see the necessity for this amendment. While it is worthy enough that such a committee should be established and, if necessary, as I say, I will establish it, I think it is superfluous to incorporate it in this statute.  I do not like incorporating superfluous or redundant matters in legislation, especially matters that can be dealt with in an administrative way.  I can establish this committee administratively and there is no need for a section in this Bill.  The Bill, essentially, is a straightforward, emergency Bill, designed as a precaution in the event of the community being endangered.  It enables me to take immediate action in a drastic manner to preserve and conserve and organise fuel supplies for the community in a state of emergency. I do not like clogging up the Bill with anything else.  It is a simple, plain, surgical, straightforward type of measure, designed for an emergency situation.  I can consult with anybody and everybody, set up all the bodies in the world that I like outside the statute, if required.  I would dislike cluttering up the Bill with a section of this kind, although the sentiments expressed in the section are admirable and indeed in a given situation such a committee might be necessary, but I do not think it needs any statutory authorisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>To take what the Minister has said just now of course it is completely correct that he has this power to establish the committee <i>ad hoc</i> without requiring this statute to give him that power.  However, one thinks of bodies that did start off as <i>ad hoc</i> bodies.  For example, the Industrial Development Authority which was in operation for, I think, a year before the Industrial Development Authority Bill was enacted.  There must be some administrative or other reasons why it is found desirable in some cases, at least, and in many cases, I think, to follow the creation of an <i>ad hoc</i> body by a Bill which gives it statutory authority.  I do not know how the matter of fees, for example, is dealt with.  There is probably some general power which would enable the Minister <Col N="763" /> to pay on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis for the expenses of the body set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point which I might have made when introducing this amendment and which I think I should now make.  It arises out of the Minister's reply, also.  I understand that as a result of the very difficult situation which is emerging, not merely in Europe but all over the world where there is need for fuel, a great deal of research is being done on substitutes for existing fuels.  There may well be, within the Minister's Department, persons with scientific training who keep themselves informed on the development of these substitutes.  One wonders if the very excellent Institute for Industrial Research and Standards is among the bodies with which his Department is in close touch.  I am thinking of a critical situation arising, perhaps, in two years time when knowledge of this kind should be available to the Minister who will have to make the decisions.  He did not mention liaison with the Industrial Development Authority.  I do not know if the normal communications which should exist between the Department of Industry and Commerce and his own Department would mean that the section of his Department is kept informed daily &mdash;to use his own words&mdash;about the development of industry in this country. I do not know the relationship between the Industrial Development Authority and the Department of Industry and Commerce with regard to the communications that take place between them or the constancy of these communications.  Is contact kept with the Export Promotion Board, which will be concerned with the application of the policy for establishing priorities, if this difficulty arises?  Nothing but good can come from the Minister's having a body empowered&mdash;if he wishes to empower it in a suitable amendment to my amendment&mdash;to keep him and his advisers&mdash;and taking some of the load from them&mdash;informed of the current situation with regard to supply.  The Agricultural Institute is another body which could help here. I imagine that that section of the Department is very busy indeed and may <Col N="764" /> not have time&mdash;just to think of Devlin again&mdash;to do that kind of long-term policy-planning which will have regard not merely to the immediate likelihood of the procurement of fuel but to the long-term supply and demand trends of different types of it.  Is there correlation between, for example, the planned growth of industry and the planned requirement of fuel?  One knows that the ESB has such a plan.  Is it kept informed and, if so, in what fashion? There ought to be a body of this kind. I recommend this to the House.  It is encouraging that the Minister will consider the matter before introducing it in the other House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on this Bill in the sense that it is pleasant to find the Minister and the Government taking time by the forelock and being ready for this type of emergency rather than being faced with something else to deal with the emergency when it actually happened.  I should also like to congratulate the Minister on his whole approach to the Bill and the remarks made on it by Members of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>In the ordinary way, when a Bill reaches this stage in the Seanad, there is little one can do except to pass polite or rude remarks according to one's opinion of the Bill.  In this case, with a Bill introduced in the Seanad which has still to appear in the other House, I should like to make a few remarks on the way some of its provisions are expressed and suggest that the Minister might take the opportunity to make some changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 3 (2) provisions are mentioned in an order under the Bill.  These include the power to grant or issue such authorisations or licences and to give such directions as shall appear to the Minister to be necessary.  It is quite clear from this subsection of section 3 that a direction is a provision.  The reason I mention this is that in section 4 (1) and subsection (3) provisions and directions are separated.  I suggest to the Minister that it is not necessary in section 4 to say, as in subsection (1) &ldquo;or in a direction&rdquo; because a direction <Col N="768" /> is a provision.  As the Minister will have noticed during the debate, people are a bit wary of directions.  Where it is not necessary to emphasise the fact that a direction may be made, it would seem wiser to leave the word out.  If the Minister wishes to emphasise the fact that a direction may be given in an order, I would suggest that, in section 4, a slight change should be made in both subsection (1) and subsection (3). Each one reads now: &ldquo;contravening a provision in an order made by the Minister under this Act or in a direction&rdquo;. One would think, from the phrasing, that a direction was something other than something made under the Act.  If the Minister will not take out the word &ldquo;direction&rdquo; altogether, I suggest it would be wise to say, instead of what is in the section, &ldquo;a provision for direction in an order made by the Minister under the Act&rdquo;.  It would then be clear that the direction referred to was the type of direction mentioned in section 3.</P>
    <P>I am all for complete clarity and the avoidance of annoying people with something which looks slightly vague or might give the idea that the Minister had something else in his mind other than the directions mentioned in section 3.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is a curious section.  It says: &ldquo;The powers conferred on the Minister by this Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other powers exercisable by the Minister.&rdquo; What precisely that means, or what types of other powers which the Minister has which this Act might interfere with, I do not know.  It is a bit like the sort of verbiage that lawyers in general, and parliamentary draftsmen in particular, are fond of shoving into things.  For a while, it was quite customary in statutory instruments to provide that the Minister was acting by virtue of the power under section so-and-so of such-and-such an Act and then they went on to say &ldquo;or in each and every other power thereby enabling&rdquo;, or some such phrase, which did not really mean anything.  Gradually the Statutory Instruments Committee persuaded Departments to abandon this unnecessary verbiage.  One or two bodies still persist but they are <Col N="769" /> of a type who do not often make statutory instruments and probably, in between, they forget.  The committee always takes care to remind them that this is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>This seems to me to be rather similar. I should have thought the powers conferred on the Minister in the Act were perfectly clear.  To say that they are in addition to whatever other powers he has, whatever they may be, seems unnecessary.  It is also vague.  Here is a measure which, when it is brought into force by the Minister, would be fairly draconian in nature and could interfere greatly with the normal transaction of business.  It ought to be clear what precisely the Minister is doing. He should not suddenly out of his hat or his sleeve produce some other power which no one quite noticed might apply to the supply of fuels.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take another look at these things and, if he thinks it is wise, take the opportunity of going to the other House with the Bill.  Someone suggested the Minister was welcoming the idea of appearing in the other House with the Bill.  This, I think, is probably going a bit too far. It does provide him with the opportunity of presenting the Dáil with a Bill which at least is partially processed and not just in the raw state in which the parliamentary draftsman normally leaves one.</P>

      <P>It is always refreshing to hear Senator Sheldon who has been carrying on a gallant running battle with the parliamentary draftsman over a number of years both in this and the other House.  In regard to section 3, I think &ldquo;direction&rdquo; is the appropriate word there because this section is, if you like, the real meat in the whole Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the point. Clarification of &ldquo;direction&rdquo; and &ldquo;provision&rdquo; is certainly worth consideration. The Senator suggests &ldquo;direction or provision.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  May I clarify it? <Col N="770" /> I am suggesting, if the Minister wishes, in section 4(1) and subsection (3), to keep in the word &ldquo;direction,&rdquo; which I think is necessary, but it should be in a different place in the sentence. It should be &ldquo;a provision or direction&rdquo; in that order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  That is reasonable.  I shall certainly consider that between now and the Dáil.  It is properly set out in section 3 but if &ldquo;provision or direction&rdquo; is included in subsection (1) of section 4, it flows then from section 3: it followed on logically.  Is this the Senator's point? I shall certainly bring that to the draftsman's choice.  It appears to me to be logical; I agree.</P>
      <P>Section 8 is a saver section.  In case any of the provisions in this Bill might be thought to take from the provisions in the other Acts&mdash;the Gas Acts, the Electricity Supply Acts&mdash;it is made quite clear that the powers conferred on the Minister in this statute are in addition to and not in derogation of powers exercisable by the Minister under other Acts.  I agree with the Senator.  He knows quite well what is involved.  One could say it is a lazy man's way out of it.  This is probably the Senator's point.  However, it does ensure that existing legislation, particularly legislation along the lines I have mentioned&mdash;the Gas and ESB provisions&mdash;is not in any way taken from by what is here.  I do not see any reason why it does.  However, it is just a saver section in the event of any legal or court interpretation finding that some of the powers here take from, derogate, powers exercisable by the Minister under the other Acts.  Lest that interpretation is taken by the courts or by legal advisers, this section makes it quite clear that that is not so.  It is spelled out precisely and specifically that the powers are in addition to, and not in derogation of, powers exercisable by the Minister particularly under the Acts I have mentioned which are largely the pertinent ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain powers for the control of these basic commodities already exist under statutes relating to both gas and electricity.  We want to retain those powers.  We want to make it quite <Col N="771" /> plain to the legal people and to the courts that anything that is conferred on the Minister in this Bill is in addition to the powers in relation to the other Acts and that nothing in this Bill takes from those powers.  This is the reason Senator Sheldon argues that, if we are precise in our drafting, there should be no need for this section.  That is roughly the tenor of what he has said.  It is a saver section to make sure that the courts or the legal people do not hop on something that could infer that, in some way, we are diminishing powers already given by statute and exercised under existing law.</P>
    <P>I shall certainly look at the other point and clean up the drafting there in regard to subsection (1) of section 4.  The best way to do it is probably as the Senator suggests, namely, to add in &ldquo;or direction&rdquo; after &ldquo;provision&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>In page 3, subsection (1), lines 8 to 10, to delete the definition of &ldquo;units&rdquo; and to substitute the following definition:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;units&rsquo;, in relation to a unit trust scheme, means any units (described whether as units or otherwise) into which are divided the beneficial interests in the assets subject to any trust created under the scheme;&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This is technically a drafting amendment.  It arises because, in the original definition, the unit, in relation to a unit trust scheme, was extended to mean securities.  Due to the fact that we have throughout the Bill &ldquo;securities and any other property&rdquo;, it was necessary to alter the definition of &ldquo;units&rdquo; in the interpretation section. <Col N="772" /> It is a drafting amendment designed to make the definition as clear and as descriptive as possible.</P>

      <P>The amendment is acceptable to me, as I understand it.  However, I think it would have been necessary to amend it even if the definition of the unit trust scheme had excluded&mdash;as I think it ought to exclude&mdash;any other property whatsoever. The previous definition was really nonsense, with great respect to the draftsman.  &ldquo;Units&rdquo; means &ldquo;securities&rdquo;. It could not.  &ldquo;Units&rdquo; means a share in, a part of, a unit participating in whatever assets were settled. This was a necessary drafting amendment. As such, I accept it, while reserving myself on the question as to whether or not the definition of &ldquo;unit trust scheme&rdquo; should include, as it does, not merely securities but any other property whatsoever.</P>

      <P>It was never the intention to catch private trusts by this Bill.  The parliamentary draftsman was doubtful if they could be omitted without introducing the danger that large-scale public unit trusts might evade the intentions of the Bill.  The draftsman now feels that the word &ldquo;public&rdquo; is sufficiently precise to embrace all the unit trust schemes open to participation by the public.  It is recognised that the scheme for participation of employees, even in a big company, such as Guinness or CIE, will now be outside the scope of the Bill, in addition to quite a number of what might be described as small family trusts.  This is the reason for deleting &ldquo;persons&rdquo; in this subsection and replacing it by &ldquo;the public&rdquo;.  In fact, the same operates in connection with amendment No. 4, dealing with section 6 (4) of the Bill.</P>

      <P>So far as the amendment goes, it represents a remarkable improvement on what was in the original definition of &ldquo;unit trust scheme&rdquo;.  In relation to the point, we are here, so far as we go, in advance of the British legislation.  The parliamentary draftsman's doubt&mdash;the doubt of the Minister's advisers&mdash;is hardly a doubt.  The unit trust scheme would, in fact, include a private trust&mdash; according to the best opinion I can find&mdash;if you did not make the amendment that is now being made.  The Minister has given an illustration of the persons who will now be able to benefit from this which I think raises a question that requires further consideration by him.  What constitutes, in fact, the provision of facilities for the public is a matter of such doubt that I would refer the Minister to section 61 of the Companies Act, 1963, to which I have, unfortunately, to make reference from time to time&mdash; a section, by the way, which makes some effort to deal with an old thorny question arising with regard to the issue of prospectuses.  It is not thought that the solution offered by section 61 is, in fact, a satisfactory one.  It is not thought that it eliminates the question as to whether or not you are issuing a document.  If you issue a document to the public, certain serious consequences flow to the people who issue that document.  Accordingly, the legislature in Britain tried to solve this problem by introducing a section in the 1948 Act.  We have its equivalent here.  It is just as well perhaps that this debate will go on elsewhere.  Let me put this on the record:</P>
      <P>Any reference in this Act to offering shares or debentures to the public shall, subject to any provision to the contrary contained therein, be construed as including a reference to offering them to any section of the public&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;any section of the public: employees of Guinness, for example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;whether selected as members or debenture-holders of the company concerned or as clients of the person issuing the prospectus or in any other manner and references in this Act or in a company's articles to invitations <Col N="774" /> to the public to subscribe for shares and debentures shall, subject as foresaid be similarly construed.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) goes on&mdash;and this is where the legal questions arise which I will not bother the House with&mdash;</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) shall not be taken as requiring any offer or invitation to be treated as such as made to the public if it can properly be regarded in all the circumstances as not being calculated to result directly or indirectly in the shares or debentures becoming available for subscription or purchase by persons other than those receiving the offer or invitation or otherwise as being a domestic concern of the persons making and receiving it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Here I think might be a valuable phrase: we may require a definition of the &ldquo;public&rdquo; to achieve what the Minister is laudably trying to achieve</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;shall not be taken as prohibiting the making to members or debenture-holders of an invitation which can properly be regarded as aforesaid...</P>
    <P>If a thing is a domestic concern then it is not on offer to the public.  If it were on offer to the employees of a particular company, it would not be, I think, anything other than a domestic concern and, therefore, it would not come within the definition of unit trust scheme and have all the consequences of this measure.  It might be wise to have that section considered in relation to the amendment which, as far as it goes, I certainly welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the effect of Senator FitzGerald's amendment or suggested further alteration would be to narrow still more what the Minister has in mind.  The definition of the word &ldquo;public&rdquo; appears in many Acts of Parliament.  We have it in the Public Dance Halls Act.  It is fairly well known.  The Companies Act extends the definition instead of reducing it.  What the Minister wants to do, as far as I see, is to ensure that a section of the public, such as employees of Guinness and so on, if they were offered unit <Col N="775" /> trusts in the company, if they had a saving scheme for employees, that it need not necessarily come within the definition of the Act.  I think that is what the Minister's amendment has in mind.  I think it would most effectively bear it out.</P>
      <P>In some companies they have savings schemes whereby to encourage workmen to save a man puts by a certain proportion of his overtime.  The company, in addition to encouraging to save, add to that and they give him certain benefits, on the basis that the man who is saving is usually a better type of employee than the man who does not save.  I think it would be a very great pity if anything were done in this Bill to inhibit something of that nature.</P>

      <P>My advice from the parliamentary draftsman on this, in relation to section 61 of the Companies Act, was that this word &ldquo;public&rdquo; here was sufficiently precise to embrace all unit trust schemes open to participation by the public.  On the other hand, it would exclude the type of private trust, or the trust to which we refer, the sort of trusts or schemes of this nature within firms for the benefit of employees, because of the fact the interpretation of the word &ldquo;public&rdquo;, as Senator Nash has said, deals specifically with trusts open to participation as such by the general public.  The question raised by Senator FitzGerald was looked into in relation to the aspects that he mentioned.  I have been assured that the interpretation is the interpretation I had hoped I was getting in relation to this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As always, any contribution on such a matter from Senator Nash is helpful and he may very well be right in his reference to section 61 of the Companies Act.  Who am I to question the advice the Minister has received, particularly when he tells me that the section has, in fact, been considered?  I would suggest that an offer which can be made so extensive as to apply to thousands of people who have a particular relationship to the managers of the fund, or those who are promoting it, might well <Col N="776" /> amount to an offer to the public if this Bill did not contain the exclusion which is contained in subsection (2), where it is expressly stated that, where the matter is a domestic concern, it is not to be regarded as an offer to the public.</P>
      <P>We have much more to say on this Bill and I do not think I should delay unduly on this point, particularly when I have a sense that I have done my duty in relation to the point.  Having made it I will leave it to the Minister for further consideration.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of definitions I should have liked to have seen in this section but which are missing from it.  First of all, it would be well to get it on the record that there is no doubt, subject to any correction the Minister may administer to me, that in the United Kingdom&mdash; after all our economies are interlocked whatever way our politics may be&mdash;no unit of trust scheme would now be approved of which permitted investment in immovable property.  The Board of Trade would not approve of a scheme which provided for such an investment. There were such schemes in existence and there were difficulties of administration, problems about the rights of the investors which proved difficult to solve; and finally the Board of Trade refused to approve of any further unit trusts which permitted such investments.  I agree the definition of the unit trust scheme in the Prevention of Fraud Act, 1958, contains this language, but the Jenkins Report, paragraph 329 (b) says specifically:</P>
      <P>We recommend that the definition of the unit trust scheme should in future cover only schemes whose underlying assets consist of securities and cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a wealth of experience behind that recommendation&mdash;the experience of disappointed investors, mistaken policy and much difficulty.  The difficulties which occur relate to another definition which I think should be in this section&mdash;the definition of value. There is reference in this Bill to value. How do you value a site which is being <Col N="777" /> acquired by a unit trust management? It goes in at cost.  Do you add to the half developed site the cost of construction work which is being put on it? What value has a half developed site? How is this to be treated when the unit trust investor wants his money back? Who is to determine in what manner that valuation is to be made?  Then, when fully developed, is it still in at cost, or cost plus construction cost or original cost?  How is this done?  In relation to the operation of the whole scheme of the Bill does the Minister take power?  May I say, with respect, that he takes a great deal of power. I would like to see him spell out, if he takes power to prescribe the proportion of the unit trust that is to be invested or permitted to be invested&mdash;if this definition of the unit trust scheme is to stand&mdash;in any other property whatsoever.</P>
    <P>This is for me something that is unsatisfactory.  We are not dealing here with an insurance company; we are dealing with a unit trust scheme, the beneficiaries of which must be entitled to get their money back when they want it.  There must therefore be a statutory obligation on the executive, on the Minister, to see that the proportion to be invested in immovable property is limited to a particular proportion. However reputable people may be, we cannot rely entirely on reputation; and the Minister is not proposing to rely on reputation because he is taking full powers to prosecute people for offences and taking full powers to cancel unit trust schemes if he finds them unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I regard this as being particularly important.  I am aware, to some degree, of the difficulty of valuing investments even in private companies, on unquoted securities.  There ought to be, somewhere in this Bill, such a definition as I take from a unit trust scheme of a rather large nature.  I will not burden the House by giving the full definition.  I would ask the House to note that this particular scheme is operated under the British code and therefore there is no question of the valuation of immovable property. They recognise, as this Bill recognises, that the unit trust managers may invest in private unquoted securities.  I <Col N="778" /> think it is good that I should put it on the records of the House:</P>
    <P>Value with reference to an investment at any given time except as herein otherwise specifically provided means the value thereof calculated by reference to either the lowest available market dealing, offered price, or the highest available market dealing bid price (according to the context) at that time quoted on any recognised stock exchange or if not so quoted, as quoted by a competent person, firm or corporation in any part of the world for such amount of the investment in question as the managers may consider in the circumstances to provide a fair criterion or if no such price is available such price as may be certified by an approved broker.</P>
    <P>I just throw that out as a specimen definition of value with a strong suggestion that there ought to be consideration given by the Minister to include a definition of value which he would regard as satisfactory in the context of the policy which I invite him to tell us, as Members of this House, he intends to operate with regard to unit trust investments in immovable property.</P>
    <P>It may all be provided for in these orders but, to me, this is not satisfactory. We must have a statutory obligation taken on by the Minister with regard to this.  The whole question of policy arises with regard to the wisdom of permitting investment in any other property whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The consequences of the gentleman's agreement, to which the Minister referred in his Second Reading speech, have, I think, been clearly inflationary in their effect on the property market.  It is very regrettable, but this has got to be faced: unit trust managers, pension fund managers, insurance company managers, if they are required to invest in Ireland in the Irish economy&mdash;may I say, so that there be no misunderstanding of my position with regard to this, that anything which harnesses Irish savings for Irish investment meets with my full approval and I wholly welcome it as a prime consideration in relation to this or any other legislation&mdash;but now we <Col N="779" /> must think in terms of the practical consequences of the proposed legislation with regard to this.</P>
    <P>There are three possible alternative investments in Ireland.  One is, of course, in Irish Government securities. I imagine the ambition of the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Finance, will be that the effect of this legislation, and of the proportion which he will determine that must be invested in the Irish economy, will be that there will be a support provided in the Stock Exchange for Irish Government securities.  I imagine, in so far as we get unit trust schemes as a kind of right, that this is what will happen.  There will be some unit trust schemes established based on a high yield performance basis.  High yield performance does not necessarily attract everybody, and these are questions which we will deal with more appropriately when we come to section 8.</P>
    <P>That is one possible choice.  That is a laudable ambition if the Minister can get away with it and effectively haul back savings that have been going out into unit trusts based elsewhere.  In regard to my reference to the Minister for Finance's remark concerning information being made available, I know information has been made available and there must be information available with regard to the outflow of savings into UK and other unit trusts.  It would be a help to us all if we had this information.  I do not know to what extent the information is available.  My own suspicion is that a good deal of money has been flowing out to UK unit trusts but my own unfortunate position with regard to that also is that it will be exceedingly difficult to stop it flowing out.</P>
    <P>That is one type of investment.  The other is in the Irish domestic equity market.  I have long been a supporter of any measure which would enlarge the equity market here, but one must recognise facts and the number of people who are buyers in the Dublin market at the moment is small and artificially prompted.  This may be another source of artificial prompting. I am not making here a political <Col N="780" /> point.  I made the point to the Minister when dealing with the Finance Bill here and I do not think experience has shown me wrong on this.  The change in the basis of income taxation of corporations has been a major error, which has excluded many people from the Dublin market and which will reduce the returned profits of Irish companies. The wit of the Irishman is considerable.  When faced with what he regards as excessive taxation it is extraordinary what he can do, within the law, to see that these profits available for taxation are reduced.  A phrase that has been used recently is &ldquo;the dogs in the street are barking&rdquo;.  When the Minister comes to consider what that proportion ought to be, despite the barking of the dogs, he must have regard to the position of the Dublin market: what proportion of his funds is it right for a manager to put into the acquisition of Irish equities when he is in the position that he may be called on to sell, to repay unit holders who want repayment.</P>
    <P>I mentioned Irish Government securities, I mentioned equities and I have mentioned in another context immovable property.  Here I would strongly counsel the Minister and the Seanad generally to consider the deletion of these words: &ldquo;the securities or cash&rdquo; because, of course, no unit trust could possibly operate if it did not have the ability to hold cash and to put money on deposit.  I see some reference here that &ldquo;securities&rdquo; means</P>
    <P>&mdash;rights (whether actual or contingent) in respect of money lent to, or deposited with, any industrial and provident society, friendly society, building society.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister might have a look at that definition.  If you include one thing&mdash;an old principle of the law &mdash;you are taken to exclude something else.  We would not like the position to be, particularly having regard to the problems of taxation which arise with regard to investments abroad, that rights in relation to a company, even if it were not an industrial and provident society, friendly society or building society, should not be included within the definition of debentures.  A deposit with a company, for example, <Col N="781" /> may not be a debenture; it may simply be a deposit.  A deposit of money with a company is not necessarily debenture. A debenture need not be something that is secured on the assets of the company, but it must be an acknowledgment in a formal way of the debt by the company.  A deposit may not be such and I think it must be included.  Am I going on too long? Would the Minister like to deal with what I have said?</P>

      <P>My strength would be equal to it even if the Minister were.  Even if one knows perfectly well that the audience would like to be elsewhere, one likes to feel that one's remarks are being considered by those who have the job of governing the country.  I hope the Minister will not misunderstand that is not being in any way derogatory of him, because I do not wish to be, but the points are not unimportant, I think.</P>
      <P>There is a necessity for a definition of effective control.  This appears in section 3, subsection 1, paragraph (d). There is great doubt as to the meaning of these words, which appear in British legislation.  For example, if there are common investors, common managers, common directors, common secretaries and so on, is there a sufficient separation between them to mean that one does not effectively control the other? I quote from a book on the subject:</P>
      <P>The meaning of this provision is not free from doubt.  Does it mean, for example, that the manager and the trustee may not have any common directors or shareholders?  If it does not, how many common directors or shareholders may they have without the management losing its independence?</P>
      <P>This is very important in Irish circumstances, as everyone in the House will realise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain companies who engage in the business of being trustees and whose securities are quoted on the market.  Insurance companies and banks are the people who mostly do this business.  The two big <Col N="782" /> banks are both quoted on the stock market.  One insurance company&mdash;in fact there are two, I think&mdash;is quoted on the market.  If there happened to be shareholders in that is there effective control?  Are the managers and trustees at arm's length?  I think there should be a definition about this.  I am not asking the Minister to say what that definition ought to be at this stage, but I am arguing for a bit of hard work by the parliamentary draftsman to try and cut out a problem which is greater in Ireland than it is in Britain.  When you think of the contradiction in interest there is between certain banks and certain insurance companies and the investment of insurance companies in certain banks, you realise that there is a problem.  It may be solved simply by saying that having shareholding that does not amount to a majority shareholding does not amount to effective control, or something of that kind.  You have to have it if you want to have legislation that is meaningful.</P>
    <P>I should like now to mention one other thing.  There are references in this Bill to a subsidiary of a company. Where the reference to &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo; first occurs the definition given is that given in the Companies Act.  The form of our legislation here in Ireland is, I think, far superior to that generally used in Britain&mdash;this is my own view&mdash; because of the practice laid down by the first parliamentary draftsman, who was a very experienced and senior chancery lawyer.  He was a dedicated man who, in fact, remained four years working for the Government before the Minister for Finance would agree on what he should be paid.  I refer to Arthur Matheson.  He was a trained chancery lawyer who said that all the definitions should go into the first section so that everybody would understand what came afterwards.</P>
    <P>The British have not yet got round to that system.  It is a most appalling job to try to read an English Act, where you get definitions in Schedules half way through the Act, and so on. This Bill is pretty good on this point but there is one definition that should be here&mdash;it appears later on&mdash;and that is the definition of &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo; by reference to the Companies Act.  I do <Col N="783" /> not think the definition of &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo; in the Companies Act is a good definition.  I should like the Minister to give some thought to this.  The definition of a subsidiary in the North of Ireland Act of 1960 includes, as a subsidiary, a company which is half owned, not merely a majority of the voting shares held.</P>
    <P>There is a well-known commercial device, if you want to lock away profits that you do not want to come up to the parent company because you do not want to declare a dividend or you want to lock it away for the days when the wintry gales are blowing that you have a half-owned company. This is not a subsidiary under our Bill and is not a subsidiary under the UK Act, but it would be a subsidiary in Northern Ireland.  When we are applying, as we are in this Bill, many stringent provisions to subsidiaries, and I think should be applying in some cases other provisions that at the moment apply only to the parent to a subsidiary, the definition of the subsidiary ought to be extensive enough to catch what is after all a device like this.</P>
    <P>I was dealing with a foreign lawyer recently and he used an expression which delighted me.  To get over certain statutory obligations in that particular country he said the only thing to do was to have an underhand agreement, which I thought was splendid. An underhand agreement is simply one between the parties concerned which nobody knew anything about except themselves but whereby they achieved what they wanted to achieve. I think the definition of &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo; in the North of Ireland Act, 1960, is the definition the Minister ought to adopt, if I may suggest that, in relation to section 1.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this is the correct point of time in which to make this remark.  I ask the Chair to tell me if it should appear somewhere else. I know the Minister is the Minister for Industry and Commerce and not the Minister for Finance and that he only brings this Bill into effect when he makes a certain order, but there are certain absolutely essential changes required <Col N="784" /> in the taxation law of the country if unit trusts are to be established here successfully.  I noted the Minister in his reply to Second Reading used very pertinent language in saying that this was not a unit trust promotion Bill.  I took that well but I think he must face the situation that we have people here, who are small savers, who are investing in UK and foreign trusts. He must accept the fact that he is not proposing to make that illegal.  He said that in his Second Reading speech and it is clear from the Bill that it is not going to be illegal.  He must do everything to facilitate the success of any unit trust that is established and has to comply with the provisions of this Bill when enacted.</P>

      <P>The most important factor to which the Senator referred was the definition of a unit trust scheme.  He was worried about the addition of &ldquo;or any other property whatsoever&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;securities&rdquo;.  The definition is:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A unit trust scheme means any arrangement made for the purpose, or having the effect, of providing facilities for the participation by persons as beneficiaries under a trust, in profits or incomes arising from the acquisition, holding, <Col N="785" /> management or disposal of securities...</P>

    <P>One of the reasons the Senator gave for his suggested amendment in this regard was that this had not been included in similar legislation in the definition of a unit trust scheme in the UK.  This is one of the deficiencies in the legislation in the UK: that property trusts, as such, operate without any supervision.  I appreciate the position arising when the management of the unit trust buy or invest in certain property with the result that, when the trust holder comes in to reclaim his money or to sell back his trust to the management, the liquid assets are not there to meet the demand. However, my view is that on the registration of the unit trust, the Minister for Industry and Commerce would take into account the manner in which the management would invest their money.  The reason for the inclusion of &ldquo;any other property whatsoever&rdquo; in that regard is not for the purpose of enabling the trust to invest all its money in property.  The Senator commented to me &ldquo;The Minister may say he would be regulating that by order&rdquo;. From my point of view, this would be one of the factors that would require to be spelled out by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the operation of this Bill.  There is the necessity of ensuring that there would be investment in realisable securities, so that the subscribers could collect their money at any time.</P>
    <P>This legislation is more comprehensive by reason of the inclusion of &ldquo;or any other property whatsoever&rdquo; in the making of the regulations with regard to the investment of the income by the management.  The Senator pointed out that it is a disadvantage to have this included in this interpretation section. My view is that it has the advantage of giving control, on behalf of investors, to the Minister to act in the interests of the investors.</P>
    <P>The Senator also mentioned that it was desirable that a definition of effective control should be included.  He mentioned that the words &ldquo;effective <Col N="786" /> control&rdquo; were used in section 3 (1) (d). This was to cover what was likely to happen here&mdash;the type of management setup we would have here.  We could visualise a situation whereby personnel of the management of the unit trust scheme might also be involved as directors in the trusteeship.  I do not feel that it is necessary to define or to outline a definition of &ldquo;effective control&rdquo; because there is a problem in this regard.  One would have to say that, if there are more than such-and-such a percentage, say 25 per cent, of the directors of the management committee who are also directors of the trustees, then that would be too many. The section to which the Senator referred, section 3 (1) (d) states:</P>
    <P>...that the Minister is satisfied that the scheme is such, that the effective control over the affairs of the manager and of the trustee under the scheme will be exercised independently of one another.</P>
    <P>The Senator expressed the feeling that &ldquo;effective control&rdquo; should be defined in that regard.</P>
    <P>I feel it is rather difficult, indeed well-nigh impossible, to endeavour to define &ldquo;effective control&rdquo; or the volume of influence that named people could have as part of the management board, on the one hand, and part of the board of trustees on the other.  That would be wrong, and it would be more appropriate that this be left to the Minister's discretion, were to refuse registration on the basis that he felt that the affairs of one would impinge on the other, he would be in the position of refusing, as Minister, to issue registration. Under the terms of the Bill the proposed trust would have the right of appeal to the courts.  It is far better that I should not endeavour to define &ldquo;effective control&rdquo; from that point of view.</P>
    <P>The Senator also referred to the question of the subsidiary company. One could speak about that in much the same way, leaving it to the discretion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, for the time being, to decide whether the question of a subsidiary company or a subsidiary board <Col N="787" /> could be open to undue influence by the trustees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take the points in the order in which the Minister has made them, and then deal with the one he did not deal with, which to me was the most important one.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not correct, if I may say so, in telling the House that the definition of a unit trust scheme in legislation in the United Kingdom is any different from that contained in this legislation.  It is, in fact, precisely the same and includes the words, &ldquo;or any other property whatsoever&rdquo;.  What I said with regard to that was that despite the provision in this legislation for the registration of a unit trust scheme which could invest in any other property whatsoever, the Board of Trade has for many years refused to register any scheme with power to invest in any other property whatsoever. This is important because the Minister went on to say that, if he did not have this, he would not have control and that they do not have control in the United Kingdom.  I should like to remind the Minister that the Act of 1958, which repeats the provisions of an Act of 1939 in Britain, is an Act described as the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act.  The sole effect of the decision by the Board of Trade not to register a unit trust with the power to invest in any other property whatsoever is that the unit trust in question does not get the benefit of being free from the licensing provisions of that Act.  We have in Britain the control involved in the fact that schemes which have provision for investment in any other property whatsoever are not permitted dealers, under the Act in question.  I think the Minister should have another look at that because it is quite an important point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may have dealt with the point I made about effective control by saying he has control in the sense that he must be satisfied there is effective control over the affairs of the manager and of the trustee exercised independently of one another.  All I can say with regard to that is that section 17 of the Prevention of Fraud <Col N="788" /> (Investments) Act, 1958, gives precisely the same power to the Board of Trade and lawyers in Britain have expressed great doubt as to what is the meaning of this.  There is some difficulty in Britain, even in a large commercial place such as the City of London, where there are countless different trustees and managers.  When one looks at the numbers in Dublin, and at the requirement of what a trustee is to be&mdash;there must be £500,000 of which not less than £250,000 is issued &mdash;how many of them are around? How many of them are, in fact, in one way or another, invested in the managers? Having said all of that I am still suggesting that if the Minister wants to maintain the idea that there should be independent effective control of the two, I remain in the greatest doubt as to the necessity for it at all.</P>
    <P>If companies are established on this sort of scale in Dublin&mdash;and the Minister will know the bodies with which he is dealing&mdash;I wonder is it necessary to have this separation at all?  I know that theorists in this field feel very strongly about the desirability of it. One knows of people in different professions who are capable of advising people with conflicting interests and yet they are able to give them correct advice.  Trustees will have certain responsibilities and they are not exonerated in this Bill from the discharge of those responsibilities.  I wonder if there should be a rethink on the necessity for a division.  I seem to be running contrary to what I have said earlier about this, but I am not really. If we are going to have effective control, let us know what it means. Although it is perhaps more appropriate to make this point on a later section, and I shall do so then, is it wise to have this separation which is an imitation from Britain?  The requirement as to the substance of the manager might be supplemented by an equal requirement as to the substance of the trustee, which I do not think is in the Bill.  Perhaps I am overlooking something, but I do not think it is in it.</P>
    <P>With regard to a subsidiary company, I would repeat my invitation to the Minister to consider again whether <Col N="789" /> there should not be a proper definition of &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo;.  It is referred to and defined in relation to the Companies Act at a later stage in the Bill which, in any case, with great respect to the draftsman, seems to me to be bad.  If things are going to get defined, they should all get defined in the same section so that we can look at them all at the same time.  It should not necessarily be the definition of &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo; in our 1963 Act.  Equality should render a company subsidiary.  When we come, for example, to a section such as that contained in section 12:</P>
    <P>A manager under a registered unit trust scheme shall not carry out transactions for himself, or make a profit for himself from transactions, in any assets held under the scheme.</P>
    <P>I do not think it should be &ldquo;himself&rdquo;, but we will be dealing with that another time.  However, it would be very easy for him to organise a subsidiary that would do those things.  I think that &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo; should go in there.  The section, as drafted, does not take in the activities of a subsidiary, and the activities of the subsidiary throughout may prove to be important.  Therefore, in this first section, we should have a definition of &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not deal with the valuation of property, and I am not now asking him to do so.  However, between now and Report Stage, I should like him to give consideration to this whole question of the valuation of property, the subject of the trust.  I think this is a most difficult matter.  The prudent practice followed by one company of valuing shares in a private company at the cost of acquisition of the shares, if the company is one which does not have to render a return to its investor by a distribution, may be a right policy for it to follow.  But say you have a unit trust that has put £100,000 into a private company which is now worth £200,000 and somebody who has put his money into the unit trust wants to get it back, at what price is the private investment to be valued? If it is cost, then he is robbed; if it is not cost, who is to determine what the value is.  I do not think this is a matter which should be left to ministerial <Col N="790" /> order, with great respect, because when the Minister is making his orders we will have power of annulment I know 21 days after the last sitting day of the Seanad, whatever that is.  By that stage everybody will be bored to death with it and when it is made we will not annul it anyhow, everybody will march in as they should, do their duty and support the order.  We will not have been present when the deliberations are taking place between the Minister and his advisers as to what form this ought to take&mdash;and we are present now.  We should hear what are the intentions.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has come in here with the Unit Trust Bill which has been in the oven for some years, and is half baked.  I imagine that there is a good deal of regulation and order baked in the background of the oven. We ought to know the principle of the Minister for Finance, that the public ought to be informed of what is going on.  Who better to be informed than the likes of us who have not to cast our votes on such a measure&mdash;our energies must be spared&mdash;but have to discuss then and to express any view that we think might be useful for the Minister to hear.  In relation to this, I do not know whether the Minister has got any people in his Department who have managed unit trusts, who have formed unit trusts, who are aware of the practical problems involved in unit trusts.</P>
    <P>I admire all the Minister's advisers, whether they be present or absent, but I have got to take note of the fact that it is only in this place and in the other place that people are going to be able to give expression to opinions based on information which they can get, which they can interpret, which they may be able to look at from an entirely different point of view from the Minister's advisers who, as I said on the Second Reading speech, have had to do their work in relation to this under a shadow cast by the gentlemen's agreement with the insurance companies.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has put down an amendment to section 8.  I am looking forward very much to hearing a full explanation from him as to what <Col N="791" /> he has in mind.  I hope it is an ameliorative provision.  I think it may be and it may well be that, if it is, a lot of my troubles will be going out the door. But I think that this question of the valuation of the assets is very important. There is another section&mdash;by the way I do not want to anticipate again but perhaps it is no harm to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Senator commenced by saying that I referred when I was speaking earlier to a number of the matters he had raised in the first instance but that there was one, which he felt was the most important one, which had not been referred to.  I think this must be the one he was speaking about, defining &ldquo;value.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator took the opportunity of anticipating my remarks in this regard at that time when he said that&mdash;and to my mind the problems of valuation do not arise until the Bill has been enacted and the Orders are being made <Col N="792" />&mdash;this would be too late to deal with them as such.  I do not think that it is necessary to include in the definition section a definition of &ldquo;value&rdquo;.  He outlined the problem that could arise because of the non-definition of &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo; and drew attention to section 12 in this regard.  That particular section may need eventually some elaboration but I do not think that the word &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo; even need be included&mdash;&ldquo;carrying out a transaction for himself or on his behalf&rdquo; could cover that without the necessity for using the word &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like this section to be greatly expanded so that we will know what the register will contain.  There is no provision, for example, for an annual return to the register.  We have conflicting provisions with regard to the information which will be laid before the House and the obligation to furnish information which will be available for inspection in the registry, whether it is laid before the House or not.  There is a provision for the registration of the deed establishing the trust, there is no provision for the registration of a deed supplementing the deed establishing the trust.  So that the original deed, when amended, may not be available for inspection.  The trustee may contain provision for the amendment with the name of the trust scheme.  I do not find any provisions here requiring the unit trust scheme managers or trustees to register any change of name.  What are the obligations with regard to the register cast on the managers or trustees?  What are the penalties if they fail to comply with the obligations?  I think of &ldquo;register&rdquo; as a strange word.  It may contain little, nothing, or very much.  It should be spelt out in one section what is to be in this register which is to be available for inspection.  Perhaps an example of what I mean with regard to the matter would be this.  I do not see that&mdash;perhaps the Minister may be able to tell <Col N="793" /> me if I have missed something in this &mdash;all the information about the manager and the trustees is to be in the register.  I am always afraid to another section, but it appears that the manager can be a company.  The Miniser has tabled an amendment to make it clear that it is a body corporate.  It may be a company, a friendly society, or an industrial and provident society or a building society.  These various institutions all register information about themselves in different places.  It ought to be possible for somebody interested in the operations of a unit trust scheme to be able to see it all in one register, kept in one place and not in two places. The register of companies operates in one place, the register of friendly societies, who also takes in industrial provident societies, as the Minister knows, operates in another place.  Consideration ought to be given in this section, or in relation to this section, what the register ought to contain.  I imagine that the officer in the Minister's Department who has to deal with companies will have a lot to tell him what should be in that register.  It should be available for inspection.  If you are engaged in the pursuit of somebody for the recovery of something, which some of us have to be from time to time, it is very important to get the information quickly.  I have no more to say on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister for some information on this register.  The register of unit trust schemes clearly includes unit trust schemes founded and managed in this country.  I am a bit worried that unit trust schemes which are not founded in this country will be classified as unregistered schemes under the terms of the Bill.  Is this the Minister's intention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the rules and regulations and prohibitions concerning unregistered unit trust schemes would apply to any unit trust scheme not founded and managed in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  This is so.  One of the objects of the Bill is to try to <Col N="794" /> ensure that as much money as possible is invested here and is in a position to be reinvested in the State. Certainly, any trust that is not registered cannot be advertised here.  There is nothing in this that Senator FitzGerald did not mention earlier on. I am not taking the power to make it illegal for any Irish subscriber to invest in a foreign unit trust, but I am taking the power, as far as possible, to discourage outside unit trusts from endeavouring to attract our money.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senator FitzGerald's remark that &ldquo;maybe the Minister will tell me if I have missed something&rdquo;, the Minister appreciates that the Senator does not miss very much anyway.  I think that the various other sections which have yet to come such as section 3 (1) (f) and sections 14, 15 and 17 all deal with the further information the registrar will have. The register can be examined and is open to the public at all stages. The Senator said section 2 does not spell out sufficiently what is required. What is required under this section is to ensure that a record of unit trust schemes is available for inspection by the public.  This is mainly a list of the names of the unit trust schemes.  The affairs of the unit trust schemes are dealt with in the various other sections but this particular section just enables the registration by the registrar of the various unit trust schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is quite correct with regard to that. I thought that section 15 did not require the registration with the registrar, but it does.  I would simply leave the Minister with the idea that it might be worth looking at that particular section to see if it should not all be brought together in one section, so that we would have no difficulty in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">

If we group them all together we might find things missing <Col N="795" /> which it might be desirable to have.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to section 3, I have a number of points and some of them have been anticipated but others have not.  First of all, I will take section 3 (1) (a).  I am sure the Minister should consult with the Central Bank of Ireland with regard to the matter mentioned.  I should have thought that he should also consult with the Minister for Finance, because you could get two different points of view on the same information.  Indeed, if I may be allowed to comment, we have had over the last two years two different points of view on the same information. It might be useful for the Minister to become satisfied after he has consulted not merely with the Central Bank but also with the Minister for Finance.  That is my first point.</P>
      <P>I made this, my second point, in my Second Reading speech.  There may be some kind of fiscal objection to it.  I thought that the body corporate should not merely be incorporated and have a place of business in the State, but should also be resident in the State. The effect of that would be that the Exchequer would get taxation on the profits.  A body corporate could be established in the State and because of the 58 per cent taxation of body corporates, would manage to arrange itself to be managed and controlled outside the State.  Therefore, the Minister would only get the corporation profits taxation of the manager, I think 23 per cent, whereas it could get 58 per cent if it were managed and controlled here.  That might be worth looking at anyhow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I anticipated my next point, but again I think it is worth repeating.  I am on to subsection 1 (b).  The words which appear in the equivalent English Act&mdash;by the way, it is the wrong Act altogether for this kind of stuff to appear in that is, prevention of fraud; it should not be in such an Act at all <Col N="796" /> and is much criticised for being there&mdash; but the words have been excluded in this subsection 1 (b).  I do not know why.  I am going to give the words now.  At the end of (b) it says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the manager under the scheme is a body corporate that is incorporated and has a place of business in the State,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that should read &ldquo;managed and controlled in his place of business in the State&rdquo;.  The following words, which are in the English Act, have been omitted for some reason from this Bill, I would have thought it particularly desirable to have them included:</P>
    <P>...at which notices and other documents are received on behalf of the body corporate...</P>
    <P>This follows from my point that the Registrar of Friendly Societies and the Industrial Provident Societies is in Kildare Street.  I think the existing Registrar is in the Attorney General's office, but his Register is kept in Kildare Street although the Companies Register is kept somewhere else.  It would be desirable if we were able to serve our documents on the place of business because companies have a habit, particularly if they are not doing all they ought to be doing, of not keeping registers up to date about where they are now registered and this is quite a problem.  We ought to be able to serve notices under this section on their place of business.</P>
    <P>I made a mistake earlier which I should like to correct.  It is the trustee here who is obliged to be a person of substance, not the manager.  I think the manager should be a person of substance. I make the point for consideration at any rate.</P>
    <P>I have quite an important point to make with regard to paragraph (c) (i) which states:</P>
    <P>(c) the trustee under the scheme is a body corporate that is incorporated in and has a place of business in the State, and&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) has a capital (in stock or shares) for the time being issued of not less than £500,000, of which an amount of not less than £250,000 has been paid up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="797" /> May I suggest the addition of the words &ldquo;in cash&rdquo;.  One can pay up a great deal of capital in goodwill and in know-how based on one's management.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is easy.  It is a simple exchange of cheque operation.  One can subscribe for a great deal of capital by saying one has been a trustee of unit trust schemes in Switzerland and the Bahamas and consequently one's know-how is worth a £100,000, and that means paying up for 100,000 shares in know-how.  I think the words &ldquo;in cash&rdquo; should be included, or &ldquo;goodwill&rdquo;.  I dare not mention names, but the reputation of certain well-known unit trusts would be such that they might be able to say their goodwill is worth so much and they would attract a great deal of money because of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It might or it might not, but the point is they could claim from the point of view of qualifying, as a trustee that they had discharged their obligation under this section.  Perhaps the Minister will be satisfied by an examination of the books.  I do not think it should be left in that form.  The end of paragraph (c) is very good; it states:</P>
      <P>...and the assets of the body are sufficient to meet its liabilities (including liabilities in respect of the repayment of its capital),</P>
      <P>Surely that should read &ldquo;of its paid up capital&rdquo;?  If it has taken 500,000 shares, should they be obliged to have assets to cover the unpaid capital?  I mention this for policy consideration. I do not know what my view is on the subject, truth to tell, except to say that I would have thought logically it should be paid up capital.</P>
      <P>Section (c) (ii) (I) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...is wholly owned by a body corporate (in this paragraph referred to as the parent body) in relation to which the conditions as to capital specified in subparagraph (i) of this <Col N="798" /> paragraph are complied with, and</P>
    <P>Why are the conditions with regard to assets not required to be complied with?  Subparagraph (i) requires not merely that there should be a certain amount of paid up capital, but that the assets should be sufficient to meet its liabilities.  May I compliment the Minister on the next paragraph (c) (ii) (II):</P>
    <P>...the discharge of the liabilities of which is guaranteed by the parent body.</P>
    <P>That is an excellent provision, It cures a real defect that appears elsewhere. We have had this thing about effective control and we need not go into that again, I imagine.  With regard to 1 (e), my main criticism is that it is a lazy compilation, if I may be excused for saying so, in so far as the Minister has given himself the greatest freedom to make any orders without any regard to any matters.  You are given some idea of the policy of the Board of Trade if you look at the First Schedule to the British Act&mdash;Prevention of Fraud Act of 1958.  I am not one who thinks we should be emulating the British in all matters, I can tell you, but they have experience in relation to this field.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to look at the Jenkins Committee Report on this and consider whether he should spell out statutory obligations throughout which are not spelt out and which are intended to be covered by orders.  He should take unto himself the additional power to make orders in case the statutory obligations are not sufficient. Then a person wishing to establish a unit trust would know where he was. This is the whole policy of the Act as here disclosed by the statutory obligations. Rationally, the Minister takes power by order to supplement what is in the statute.  I would not deny him that power at all.  In fact, I think he should have it, because financial circumstances are changing all the time and he must have power to add to the obligations.  He must at this stage know that the obligations he is going to exact in these orders should be in the statute with power to amend them, and power to add to them, by order.</P>
    <P>The deed, which is the fundamental <Col N="799" /> document in the whole affair, should contain a covenant obliging the trustees and managers to comply with the statutory obligations in giving the necessary rights arising from that to the persons who are beneficiaries under the deed, who will have civil rights if there is a covenant to comply with the statutory obligations.  I should like other Senators, either at this Stage or the next, to give thought to this. I do not know whether those persons will have civil rights if an order is made and not complied with.  There would probably be prosecutions and I am not sure that this should be so.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1), paragraph (f), provides for the filing of a deed, but it ought to provide that any alteration in the deed should also be deposited with the Registrar.  It is a constant feature for deeds to be amended to deal with changing circumstances.  They should be obliged to deposit the deed and all supplements to the deed with the Registrar. The only power the Minister has is the rather unsatisfactory power of cancelling a scheme.  This is too much and ought not be so.  It is too rough an instrument to deal with it. There ought to be a system under which the deed can be amended, provided it is in order, and then deposited with the Registrar.  Probably, what would happen is that a draft of the deed would be sent over to the Minister and they would not dare amend the deed without the Minister seeing what they were proposing to do.  The logical thing would be that the amended document, as a matter of legal obligation, should be deposited with the Registrar.</P>
    <P>With regard to the registration of unit trusts&mdash;I am not very good on the matter of the proof of documents &mdash;how does one prove that a unit trust scheme is a registered unit trust scheme?  Should the Registrar not be obliged to issue some document over his name which would certify that a unit trust is registered under the Unit Trust Act?  I think that would be desirable.</P>
    <P>I should like to praise the Minister for breaking new ground here in the provision for appeal to the High Court. I welcome this.  However, I will have a criticism to make about subsection</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="800" /> (3) in a moment.  If we are going to have the right to appeal to the High Court for a refusal&mdash;which could be very damaging to the persons concerned with the whole exercise and enterprise&mdash;the reasons for the refusal should be specified under this section, as the Minister proposes to specify the reasons under section 5 (2).  If he is sensible enough to specify the reasons under section 5 (2) why not specify the reasons for refusal under section 3 (2)? This would mean that when the matter was brought to court we would know what we were talking about, what the argument and the reason for it was?</P>
    <P>I now come to subsection (3).  I do not profess to have any knowledge of constitutional law but has the Legislature a right to require a decision of the High Court to be final?  I should have thought in a question of law, that the Supreme Court was always available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>To take one point at a time.  I would ask the Minister to accept the suggestion of Senator FitzGerald which is an excellent one, that in section 3 (c) (i) the words &ldquo;paid up&rdquo; to interline the words &ldquo;in cash,&rdquo; because as he has rightly pointed out, very often shares are issued and treated as being paid up when there is nothing only goodwill or something else, and the value of goodwill is a subjective rather than an objective one.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies to Senator Nash's point, I should like him to clarify what exactly that subsection means?  If you have £500,000, of which £250,000 has been paid up, does this mean that the other £250,000 is on call?  If it is on call what are the assets that follow on here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the points made by Senator FitzGerald in this regard I wish to say, first of all, that Senator Nash has backed his observations on section 3 (1) (c) (i) in relation to the question of including &ldquo;in cash&rdquo; after &ldquo;paid up&rdquo;.  It appears to me that there is no reason why I should not do this and that there are quite a number of reasons why I should.  I would propose to introduce that, by way of amendment, before Report Stage.  I will also consider before Report Stage Senator FitzGerald's observations in relation to section 3 (1) (b).</P>
      <P>On the question of the inclusion of assets in section 3 (1) (c) (2), there is a share of merit in the fact that assets should be included there.  I should like, without fully committing myself, to take all these matters into consideration in relation to possible amendments for the Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald said that the number of potential trusteeships to make this amount of guaranteed money available is rather limited but I do not think that goes well with his argument about a management committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Minister for indicating his attitude to some of the points I have made.  The Official Report will contain a record of any other points I have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without going into them at all, I should like to draw attention to one &mdash;the first one I made and which the Minister did not mention, this was that the Minister for Finance ought to be consulted.  Secondly, any supplemental deed or amendment of the deed should be registered.  Thirdly, we should be told now what is the Minister's policy in regard to these unit trusts, and that should be in the statute.  There should be a covenant required to be in a deed, as a statutory obligation, that the statute would be complied with. In addition, I made the point about the evidence that there is a properly registered unit scheme.  There should be provision made for that.  I also <Col N="802" /> suggested that, as the Minister has proposed to provide in section 5 (2) (a), when he is considering the representations to be made under subsection (2) should specify the reasons for any refusal.</P>
    <P>I welcome subsection (3), so far as it goes in providing for the decision of the High Court as being unappealable, but I think this should be expressed. Our Acts should go forth reconcilable easily with each other and with the Constitution.  I failed to make a point, which I now make.  I should like the Minister to look at subsection (2) (a).  This lays down that whenever the Registrar proposes to refuse to register a unit trust scheme in the Register:</P>
    <P>he shall notify the manager and the trustee under the scheme that he so proposes and of the reasons therefor and that the manager and the trustee may, within 30 days after the date of the giving of the notification, make representations....</P>
    <P>Should that not be &ldquo;or the trustee&rdquo; as in subsection (3)?  Subsection (3) provides that the manager or the trustee may go to the court.  It is a drafting point, and I do not attach any importance to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator FitzGerald and the Minister are <i>ad idem.</i> as regards the suggested registration of an amending deed if one considers paragraph (e) and paragraph (f) together as relating to the trust deed. The scheme must be expressed in a trust deed which complies with the provisions of the order.  The deed must be deposited with the Registrar.  If the scheme is altered by an amending deed, then the first deed no longer applies, because the amending deed alters it.  Therefore, unless the amending deed is lodged with the Registrar, the company and the whole scheme is invalid and does not come within the framework of the Bill at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On reconsideration, Senator FitzGerald may agree that this is so.  The scheme must be expressed in a deed. If I alter one deed by another deed it is the second deed which is the effective deed; or if I alter one will by another <Col N="803" /> will, the second will is the effective will.  If the deed which creates the scheme which is now the second deed is not lodged with the Registrar under paragraph (f), the whole thing is invalid. I do not think it would be necessary to provide expressly that the second deed must be lodged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>One of Senator FitzGerald's points may not, for some odd reason, have been picked up by the Official Record.  He did ask the Minister&mdash;this is subsection (1) (c) (i) with regard to including liabilities in respect of the repayment of its capital&mdash;that it should be its paid up capital.  I think that may have been overlooked in the general discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On Senator Nash's point&mdash;he knows I respect his view on these matters&mdash;but I would require time to consider this.  The scheme is such as to secure that every trust created in pursuance of the scheme is expressed in a deed.  Then the deed aforesaid is to pass to the Registrar.  The trust is created by the original deed but the terms of the trust are altered by a subsequent deed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>

      <P>Let us accept the fact that I propose, as I have indicated to the House, to take into consideration the various observations that have been made and the various amendments that have been suggested on this section. Also, looking at the discussion that we have had in connection with paragraphs (e) and (f), I am inclined to take the view that the depositing of an amended deed, as Senator Nash puts it, is the same as a new will.  The intention is the same and it is a question of how best we can accord with that.  It is necessary that there be no cross purposes of how best we can do it.  I am most anxious to have a further opportunity of looking at that as well.</P>

      <P>If you add to (f) after the words &ldquo;the deed aforesaid&rdquo;, &ldquo;any amendment thereof must be deposited with the Registrar&rdquo; that would put it beyond all possible doubt.</P>
