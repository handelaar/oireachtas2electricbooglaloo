      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Health Services (Limited Eligibility) Regulations, 1971</P>
      <P>a copy of which was laid before Seanad Éireann on 14 July, 1971.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>These draft regulations have two purposes.  The first, and main purpose is to provide for an increase in the income ceiling for limited eligibility for health services from £1,200 to £1,600 in the case of the self-employed&mdash;other than farmers&mdash;and persons with private means.  This is in line with the recent increase in the income limits of social welfare insurance of non-manual workers.  It has been settled practice to follow the social welfare limit for the purposes of limited eligibility for health services.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the regulations would substitute a definition of income in accordance with income tax practice for the present definition, which is based on rules set out in the Social Welfare Acts.  Those rules were geared towards assessing the need for financial assistance, such as pensions, and took account of the realisable value of a person's property as well as his cash income.  It is considered more appropriate to look at visible income, such as is done for income tax purposes, in reckoning eligibility for health services. This change incidentally would facilitate the arrangements under the Health Contributions Bill for the collection of certain health contributions through the agency of the Revenue Commissioners. It will not have any sensible influence on the numbers of persons eligible for services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped also to include in these regulations a provision fixing income standards for full eligibility, that is for that category who are entitled to medical cards.  After very detailed and careful studies of the matter, I have come to the conclusion that, as circumstances other than the purely financial vary so much as between country and town and between one family and another, I should not at this stage make regulations on such standards but rather leave it to the chief executive officers of the eight health boards to try to achieve the greatest practicable uniformity in their decisions on eligibility.  I am arranging for my Department to bring the chief executive officers together with a view to working out a formula for achieving maximum unity of approach.  The reduction from <Col N="1697" /> 27 to eight in the number of bodies responsible for the operation of the health services should facilitate a reasonable degree of consensus in the matter.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers will have available to them in their discussions the considerable volume of statistical material which was assembled in connection with the Departmental examination of this subject.  I would hope that the outcome would be the removal of the inconsistencies which have in the past existed in relation to the issue of medical cards, without substantially altering the total number covered.  This should mean more equitable treatment for both the persons seeking the service and for the taxpayers and ratepayers who must meet the cost of it.</P>
    <P>I should be grateful for the approval of the House to the proposed regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Any explanation such as this is welcome.  I suppose it is an attempt to define &ldquo;limited eligibility&rdquo; to make it easier to discuss a Bill we will be dealing with later.  The Minister said he intended defining &ldquo;full eligibility&rdquo; by regulation, but found there were certain difficulties about that.  He is leaving it to the chief executive officers of the health boards to achieve the greatest practical uniformity in their decisions regarding eligibility.  There have been discrepancies between counties in the issue of medical cards.  The Minister told Deputy Tully in the Dáil that he would bring in regulations for the definition of those entitled to hold the medical card before the recess.  I accept that was the Minister's intention.  When the Minister and his officials tried to define eligibility for medical cards they found it was not so easy, as most of us know.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to one part of the draft regulations that may be in conflict with a certain statement of the Minister on Second Reading of the Health Contributions Bill.  I am referring to paragraph 2 of the regulations:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) &ldquo;Income&rdquo; for the purposes of subsection (1) (b) shall mean the income of the preceding year ended <Col N="1698" /> on 5th April and shall include all income which the person may have received for that year from all sources.</P>
    <P>Senator Owens in her speech on the Second Reading of the Bill asked a question what would happen about overtime&mdash;would that be taken into consideration as part of the income? The Minister stated, in his reply, at col. 1273, Vol. 70 of the Seanad Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Overtime payments will not influence entitlement to middle income service and that has been the case previously.</P>
    <P>Is there a conflict here?  If we pass these regulations, as drafted here, is this in conflict with the Minister's statement in his reply to Senator Owens?  The answer may be that the middle income group and the limited eligibility group are not synonymous.  The Minister made this statement at the beginning of his introductory speech:</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to ease the serious burden of health costs on the Exchequer and rates through the introduction of a scheme of regular contributions towards the cost of hospital and other services by those who are eligible for the services and who may be regarded as able to bear the contribution proposed without hardship.  These are persons whom the category described in the Health Act, 1970, as having limited eligibility for health services.</P>
    <P>In other words, in the Health Contributions Bill the particular people whom the Minister is referring to are those who come within the category of limited eligibility.  At the same time in his draft regulations, which he has put before the House, he says that all income, no matter from what source, will be taken into consideration.  Again he says, in answer to Senator Owens that:</P>
    <P>Overtime payments will not influence entitlement to the middle income service and that has been the case previously.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1699" /> There is some inconsistency and some discrepancy here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The overtime question involves only those with social insurance, and they are automatically insured. If they are on overtime it is dealt with through social insurance.  The question of income is assessed on self employed people and retired people. Overtime will have to be included in any event in the upper income limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I see that the Minister may have an explanation for all that but are there no particular people who would not come into the social service group, who would do overtime and who might come within this category?  Is the Minister excluding all people with overtime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see that there would be anybody who would be earning overtime who was not in a job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>If I knew the answer I should try to help the Minister.  I am only posing the question in case there were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is a complication in relation to these regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just pointing it out in case it may arise.  I have not at hand any particular example of what I am referring to, therefore I cannot help the Minister in this.  I think it is valid that it should be pointed out here.  Otherwise the regulations are a help in defining the category to which the Bill which we will be dealing with later will apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister is unable to define &ldquo;full eligibility&rdquo;.  I also think that the definition of &ldquo;limited eligibility&rdquo; may present difficulty.  Those who are just outside the category of full eligibility obviously come into the category of relative eligibility.  Therefore, to some extent, the definition of limited eligibility depends upon the definition of full eligibility.  I think the Minister should take steps to review occasionally any discrepancies that may occur in the issue of medical cards in different areas of the country, where the chief <Col N="1700" /> executive officers of the eight health boards might interpret the conditions governing the issue of medical cards in different ways.  Notice should be taken of the discrepancies that have occurred. However, in general, it is good to have this explanatory memorandum and the regulations in force before we proceed to discuss the Health Contributions Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to bring about, greater uniformity by bringing together the chief executive officers of the eight health boards so as to achieve, in the Minister's own words, practical uniformity in decisions on eligibility.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to explain in detail this question of overtime, incen tive bonus, etc. and how it may affect eligibility.  When you move the ceiling for limited eligibility from £1,200 to £1,600, does this mean that overtime earnings which might bring the insured person above £1,600 would make that person ineligible?  This problem often arises.  I agree that in trying to admin ister a health service at present, with due regard for both the person who needs the service and for the taxpayer, there should be some degree of decision in relation to eligibility but a good deal of confusion continues to arise on this question of additional earnings which may be either overtime or may be some sort of incentive bonus which may only apply to one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should explain that this would be the arrangement for providing the upper limit of £1,600 in accordance with exactly the same regulations as now apply in the Department of Social Welfare.  Whatever the Department of Social Welfare have done in the past in relation to overtime will also apply in relation to the limited eligibility regulation.  I understand they generally work on the basis of the rate for the job in assessing the upper limit.  The House can be assured that I am not making any alteration.  Whatever the Department of Social Welfare did in relation to social welfare limits when they were £1,200 will be done in relation to £1,600. There will be no change in the methods adopted.  That is as clear as I can make it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably as clear as the Minister can make it, but there is still some confusion about the old method.  One is continually running up against the problem of different types of earnings such as basic earnings, incentive or percentage earnings and overtime.  In giving advice to a person one wonders what return you make and are you making a false return by leaving out overtime, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter should have been raised on the Social Welfare Bill, which we propose to follow.  The Department of Social Welfare will conduct this operation for us using the same methods as heretofore.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I can see, the published draft regulations are, basically, a copy of subsection (1) of section 46 of the 1970 Act with the substitution of £1,600 for £1,200 and going on to give an actual definition of income for the purposes of subsection (1) (b).  The first parts are as were laid down in the 1970 Act.</P>
      <P>This involved both the Health Contributions Bill and the whole question of contributions generally.  I am a bit disappointed remembering that the Minister for Social Welfare was in the House within the last ten days or so when he announced that, while he had raised the social welfare income limit to £1,600 this year, he hoped in the course of this same year to abolish that income limit completely and to make social welfare contributions obligatory upon all earners of wages and salary. Bearing that in mind I am surprised that the Minister has seen fit at this stage to introduce health eligibility regulations tied in with the £1,600 limit of the Department of Social Welfare, apparently with the intention of operating the regulations basically under the provisions of the social welfare code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us whether, when the Minister for Social Welfare extends the social welfare code to cover all wage and salary earners he would also envisage extending the contributions under the Health Act to <Col N="1702" /> cover all wage and salary earners from all categories?  In other words, in the course of the next 12 months will the Minister introduce an obligatory contributory scheme on all employed persons?  If he will not, it is a pity.  If he will, it is a pity he did not wait and do the whole job at the same time as the Department of Social Welfare.  I am sure the Minister will give his views on this when replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be better to reply now, so that nobody else need raise this point.  The answer is that there was no limit in the social welfare insurance system.  We will have to reconsider the whole problem because you have the entire medical profession involved in virtually the ceasing of a great deal of private practice.  The whole of the remuneration of consultants is based on a certain amount of private practice.  It would add enormously to the cost, so that the matter, at that stage, would have to be reviewed fundamentally before I could make any such change and say that the limited eligibility group now covers every person who is earning up to any limit of revenue.  I am sure the House will understand that.  It would completely upset the system of medicine we have in this country which involves a mixture of private practice for 10 per cent of the population helped by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>An old dog for the hard road.  There is no danger of the Minister, so early in the morning, stepping in and telling us what plans he really has for the future health services. I thought we might be able to draw him.  The Minister is now telling us that he wishes to introduce regulations with the limits geared to correspond with the existing social welfare code limits, which all sounds fair and reasonable as it stands now.  It will not look fair and reasonable in six or nine months if the Minister for Social Welfare scraps his limits completely. Surely at that stage the Minister for Health will have to have another rethink about the contributory system. I agree that to have a contributory system extending over every wage and salary earner would mean a revision of <Col N="1703" /> the health services generally, but this will have to come.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister, in his reply, would tell us whether these regulations will, in any way, alter subsection (8) of section 46 of the Principal Act, which is the section that permits the CEO in cases of undue hardship to place persons in the limited eligibility category even if they do not fall within the defined limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The hardship arrangement continues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fair enough.  As long as we have an upper income limit the question of overtime will be a contentious one.  It is obvious from what the Minister has said and from what we know of the working of the social welfare code that if somebody is in the limited eligibility category, has paid contributions for a year or 15 months and then it transpires that because of his overtime earnings in the last assessable year he is now above the £1,600 limit, he will be deemed as no longer a person in the limited eligibility category.  He is not entitled to benefit.  This is the fact of the matter.</P>
      <P>Where the confusion lies is rather in the Minister's reply on the Health Contributions Bill.  As I understand it it will operate in the same way as the social welfare code.  That is to be the system.  Just as somebody with full eligibility at the moment because of a change in his position gets better overtime payments will move automatically out of the full eligibility category into the limited one, instead of getting full medical services he will have to pay to get a limited service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other comment I should like to make on the regulations is that I would agree with the Minister that it would be more than desirable that we should be in a position to define the full eligibility categories.  There always has been and will continue to be mistrust and misapprehension about the granting of medical cards and about the reason why one person receives a medical card and another does not.  In my experience of the administration of that system in the Dublin area, it was <Col N="1704" /> done with strict impartiality and fairness. That does not alter the fact that many of the applicants, always the unsuccessful ones, are quite convinced that there is some strange Machiavellian way whereby public representatives and others can manipulate the medical card for those who are not entitled to it.</P>
    <P>We all know that is not the case in the Dublin area and I assume throughout the rest of the country.  It would be better if we could arrive at a code whereby people would know clearly who was entitled and who was not.  I understand the difficulties in doing this, but in relation to other matters, such as the higher education grant scheme there is quite a complicated sliding scale worked out between persons with one child earning a certain amount of money per year and persons with two children earning a certain amount.</P>
    <P>The Department will have to work out a fairly complicated sliding scale based on earnings, size of family and average weekly outgoings.  I know that in the granting of medical cards the medical history of the family and other factors are taken into account, but there could be a safety clause built into the regulations to cover that.  If we are able to define the upper limit for this limited eligibility class&mdash;to take the simplest definition, if we are able to say that £1,600 is the upper limit for limited eligibility&mdash;then I do not understand how these regulations any more than regulations regarding full eligibility can apply if we do not define the lower limit.</P>
    <P>It is no good saying the lower limit of the limited eligibility class is the upper limit of the full eligibility class. If anyone should ask what is the upper limit of the full eligibility class the Minister has the power to say: &ldquo;We do not know because every case is taken on its merits.&rdquo;  There is a whole lot of grey in there between the top of the full eligibility and the bottom of the limited one.  It would help generally if we could manage to get a definite standard after which one passes from the full into the limited class.  If this were to be done it would remove a lot of the misapprehension and distrust that exist at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask <Col N="1705" /> the Minister just one question about these regulations, in relation to farmers. In his explanatory notes he quotes from section 46 of the Health Act, 1970, in which in paragraph (c) of section 1 the limit is placed at £60 rateable valuation in relation to farmers.  In the new regulation the limit is exactly the same.  I am somewhat puzzled by this.  We have an increase in the limit in the case of incomes from £1,200 to £1,600, about 33? per cent. On a <i>pro rata</i> basis surely the limit of rateable valuation for farmers should be increased from £60 to £80 per annum.  I wonder why the Minister has left the limit for farmers exactly as it was, whereas he has raised the others quite substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I also should like to ask a question.  I noticed in the explanatory notes which were circulated with the draft of the Health Services (Limited Eligibility) Regulations that the Minister made the point that a subsidiary object of the regulations was to change the basis for calculating the yearly means or income of a person claiming eligibility otherwise than an insured person or farmer.  He pointed out that at present the basis for such calculations is rule 1 of the rules contained in the 7th Schedule of the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  I have looked at these rules and I think I am right in thinking that these rules, particularly rule 1 regarding capital and assessment of value of capital, is one which I remember the late Senator Sheehy Skeffington criticising time after time with great effect.</P>
      <P>I should like to inquire if this new method of assessment on the income tax basis liberalises this position somewhat. I should like to know to what extent it is an improvement on the previous treatment of capital, particularly for people of limited private means living on their own, the typical type of elderly person who is so common in parts of the Dublin area.  If this assessment system is an improvement, it is very much to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was with some regret that I learned that the Minister does not feel it is possible to have regulations to decide on the category of people entitled to medical cards.  I find this of particular <Col N="1706" /> interest in that yesterday the Interim and Final Report of the Committee of Public Accounts for 1968-69 was circulated. I find on pages 119 and 120 a very interesting discussion on this very point, the problems of deciding on eligibility for medical cards.  It becomes quite clear in the discussion by the Deputies with the Accounting Officer on the Health Vote that the present position regarding medical cards is very much a mystery.  It is also made clear there that up to the present there has been a degree of co-ordination in the Managers Association, the type of co-ordination which the Minister indicates he is going to encourage further through chief executive officers and, with the help of the statistics collected by the Department, that he is considering the possibility of change.</P>
    <P>I should like to make the point that, while I welcome this approach to uniformity in that way, it is an approach which may not do much to clear up the mystery where both the public and public representatives are concerned. Whatever about the administrative niceties, it is the public and public representatives who are most involved in this mystery of the issuing of medical cards.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat a request which I have made in discussing health topics on previous occasions.  It would be of great interest if, perhaps under the auspices of the Department, we could have published from time to time anonymous case histories of how medical cards are issued in practice so that we would have a range of typical examples giving the full details of the background and income of the people involved.  That in its own way would be a contribution towards a better understanding of the system and indeed perhaps a contribution towards the greater uniformity which, by the Minister's decision here today, I gather will continue to be dealt with in an informal way rather than in a formal way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FarrellMcElgunn" hpid="Mr. McElgunn Mr. McElgunn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McElgunn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add a few words to what Senator Keery has said.  When we were speaking on the Health Contributions Bill, I raised the point of the great inconsistency there appeared to be regarding this matter <Col N="1707" /> of allocation of medical cards.  It is quite understandable that there should be a bigger percentage of medical cards allocated in the western part of the country rather than in the eastern part. Anybody who takes into account the economic circumstances in both parts of the country would understand that. But what is much more difficult to understand and, as Senator Keery says, to explain to the public are the figures.</P>
      <P>I had figures for 1970 on the last occasion we discussed this.  Yesterday we got figures from the Committee of Public Accounts.  Appendix 20 gives percentage of population covered by medical cards at 31st December, 1969. The figure for County Leitrim is 37.2 per cent and for County Roscommon 50.4 per cent.  You can imagine my position as a county councillor and public representative because where I live I am surrounded on three sides by County Roscommon.  We have 50 per cent of the people there getting medical cards.  People come to me who have failed to get medical cards in Leitrim and say: &ldquo;A man with a higher valuation than I have, in County Roscommon has got a medical card.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These are two separate authorities now under the regional health boards. Roscommon is in one region and Leitrim is in another.  They are to have two separate managers and, even though there may be an attempt at consultation and co-ordination, I am rather disappointed that there is not, as other Senators have asked, a norm laid down which would apply to the whole country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;I am arranging for my Department to bring the chief executive officers together with a view to working out a formula for achieving maximum unity of approach.&rdquo;  I should hope that when that would be done this formula would not remain a secret formula and that it would be available to public representatives and to the public so that they would know what their entitlements are.  It is very difficult when a person comes to me or to any other public representative and asks us: &ldquo;Am I entitled to a medical card?&rdquo; You say: &ldquo;You may or you may not be. It is at the discretion of the county manager.&rdquo;  I repeat that I want to get <Col N="1708" /> rid of this thing where you can have great discrepancy in neighbouring counties in the allocation of medical cards.  I should also hope that the figures for the various regional boards would be published every year and that the formula should be subject to review so that the Minister could keep an eye on the matter and see that this discrepancy does not remain.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Jessop, I am a bit disappointed that the valuation of £60 which has been static for so long and has been in line with the £1,200 income has not been increased in the same way as the £1,200 has been increased to £1,600.  In this category there can be quite a number of hardship cases in the matter of hospitalisation due to the fact that you can have a farmer with perhaps £15 valuation on a house and £46 valuation on land a total of £61, which puts him outside the ceiling of eligibility for free hospital treatment or even for paying his £7 a year to avail of the free hospital treatment under the Health Contributions Bill.  He may have four or five children.  Where you have a family like that there is a greater element of risk for the provision of hospital treatment for those children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure anyone here who is a member of a local authority, at some time or other during his period of membership, has had people come to him with very sad cases.  Perhaps they might have a £70 valuation and they are outside the scope of any help from the local authority to enable them to pay their bills.  The result can be very serious for a family of that kind.  For that reason it is disappointing that some standard is not set.  For example, a single man with a £59 valuation can pay his £7 and be free of all worries of surgeons' or specialists' bills if he is sent to hospital. Perhaps a man with four or five children on a £62 10s or a £61 valuation would not be free of these bills if he or any member of his family happened to be sent to hospital.  I know it is very difficult to lay down a code as to how you can operate this, but I feel some allowance should be made, for example, for a wife and for each dependent child, to enable them to come within the ambit <Col N="1709" /> of the health contributions legislation.</P>
    <P>Like Senator McElgunn, I am very disappointed that some effort or some norm has not been laid down as to the standard of eligibility for medical cards.  While I agree that the Minister can bring eight people together, rather than the 27 that we had, and try to lay down a standard of eligibility, I think that&mdash;and Senator McElgunn is correct in this&mdash;there will be considerable difficulty in this.</P>
    <P>My county, for example, which might be described as one of the wealthier counties as it it close to County Dublin, is in with Cavan, Monaghan and Louth. Louth I would describe as one of the wealthier and more developed counties. It will be difficult to see how the Chief executive officer for the North-Eastern Health Board can arrive at a standard when he has to embrace counties that are comparatively wealthy as against counties which are less developed and therefore less wealthy.</P>
    <P>I know there are difficulties involved in this and I would appeal to the Minister to get some kind of standard for medical cards as soon as possible. As I said on the Health Contributions Bill, I do not think it is right that anybody who is entitled to a medical card should have to kow-tow to anybody for it.  If they are entitled to it they should get it; if they are not entitled to it they should not have it.  At the moment, as every Member of this House knows, there are people with medical cards who should not have them.  On the other hand, there are people who cannot get medical cards and I believe, and they believe, that they should have them.  This is what is happening and I hope and believe that the Minister is making such effort that he will arrive at a standard of eligibility and save every public representative and every official from having to be eternally fighting with their constituents and with the officials of the health boards for a medical card for somebody who may be a borderline case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Jack Fitzgerald, I am disappointed with the ceiling of £60 valuation, but I think we could get over it if we did not include <Col N="1710" /> buildings.  If we had a valuation of £60 on land, not including buildings, that would be an advantage because you can have a house in rural areas with a valuation of anything up to £15 and that would bring the land valuation down to £45.  We should ask the Minister to exclude buildings and make it a valuation of £60.</P>
      <P>On the point made by Senators in connection with a uniform ceiling for medical cards, there could be two neighbours, one with a valuation of £45 and the other with £60 valuation.  There are many aspects to be considered as regards family hardship.  In fairness to the health authorities with whom I have dealt in the past, I should say that they have been considerate.  I have never known of a case of anybody being deprived of service because of the lack of money.</P>
      <P>There are cases which I consider more important than hospitalisation, cases which concern doctors' fees.  You can have a man, despite the fact that he earns £24 or £25 a week or maybe £18 a week, who is debarred even though he has three children.  If he is ill and is visited a few times by the doctor he can run up a bill of £12, £14 or £20 in a month.  That is something which I think should be considered.</P>
      <P>As regards a uniform approach to the issue of medical cards, discretional powers are best and if you have a considerate manager nobody will be deprived of service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a brief plea in support of Senator Fitzgerald's idea.  I would incline to the view that the Minister might perhaps look at the scale for eligibility that is used by the universities in determining the eligibility of candidates for full grants.  This, especially where it applies to farmers and people who are at present borderline cases, gives credit for larger families.  The classic example of this is where a widow may have a poor law valuation of £61.  Her net income is very much smaller than that of an owner of a similar holding where the breadwinner would be able to carry on <Col N="1711" /> the operation of day-to-day work himself.</P>
      <P>I consider that the present regulations do not deal fairly with all the people. When Senator W. O'Brien suggested that the valuation of buildings might be excluded I though it a very fair appeal.  On farms where new houses have been built the average valuation at present is about £24 or £25 for a five-roomed house.  This means that the net income on the farm is brought down lower than it has been heretofore.  It would appear, therefore, that the Minister is not making an effort in this fairly comprehensive measure to treat all sectors equally.</P>
      <P>We have the headlines set in the educational schemes which, while not perfect, are quite an improvement on the vexatious system operated under the Health Acts.  Nevertheless, I feel that with these regulations the Minister is doing his best to meet a large and growing problem.  I would appeal to him, therefore, to exclude from the Schedule &ldquo;the buildings thereon&rdquo; and leave the valuation at £60.  If it were possible to scale the valuations as is done in the educational schemes system and for supplementary grants, taking into account the number of children and tying it up with both the income and the valuation, it would be a good thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I shall deal with the question of farmers and farming valuation.  There are 176,900 farmers out of some 200,000 farmers&mdash; this is based on the 1966 census&mdash;who are on £60 valuation.  Ninety per cent of all farmers are under £60 valuation.  In cases where farmers are over the £60 limit the chief executive officers will, as in the past, deal with hardship cases. If a farmer is over £60 and has a great deal of illness and has a large family, at present some contribution is frequently made towards his hospital expenses. That will continue as before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked a number of questions about why we have not altered the valuation limit.  One answer is that which I have given here&mdash;that 90 per cent of all farmers are under £60 as it is.  The other answer is that the <Col N="1712" /> limit was raised from £50 in 1966 to £60 at that time.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to attempt directly to relate individual farmers' incomes to valuation.  Taking total family farm income into account, when the limit was raised to £1,200 the family farm income was £141 million, approximately 20 times the total valuation.  By 1970 the ratio of farm incomes to valuations was estimated to have increased to 26 to one and proportionate increase as between 20 times to 26 times would raise the income level of farmers on that basis to £1,560.  That is very close to the £1,600 now proposed.  I think the present arrangements for farmers are fairly satisfactory, as some Senators have admitted.  The hardship arrangement can be brought into force for farmers who are over £60 and who have very heavy hospital bills to face.</P>
    <P>Senator Keery regrets the decision not to define the limits for full eligibility. Other Senators have referred to this matter too.  As I have said, I find it is better to get the CEOs to examine this rather than try to do it in my office.  They have a great deal of information which was collected all over the country to help them and I hope they will be able to do a satisfactory job.  I am aware of the difficulties they will face because there are discrepancies at present as between one county and another.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary for the CEOs finally to publish their limits.  Of course they will take into account the hardship arrangement for those in the full eligibility group, so that there will be what might be described as a grey area in between limited eligibility and full eligibility where the hardship arrangement can operate.  I will certainly review the CEOs proposals for full eligibility and see how they operate.  I am quite sure there will be a certain amount of trouble and difficulty over this.  I do not expect completely smooth running of a consistent set of limits for full eligibility.  There are bound to be difficulties that will arise and I will have to meet them when they come to me.  Senator McElgunn referred to the contrast between Leitrim and Roscommon. That is typical of a discrepancy which exists between two <Col N="1713" /> neighbouring counties.  I am certain difficulties will arise and the chief executive officer has to smooth out these inconsistencies in one way or another.</P>
    <P>The method of calculating the value of property represents an improvement on what is the case in relation to the social welfare pension means test. I have an example here.  Under the social welfare code an investment of £5,000 in a savings bank, under the Seventh Schedule to the Social Welfare Act, excluding the first £25 of capital, one-twentieth of the next £375 and one-tenth of the balance, would result in the total yearly value being assessed at £478.75.  We propose a simple income tax assessment.  As an example if we take £5,000 at 4½ per cent interest the total yearly value assessed would be £225 instead of £478.75.  That is an explanation the Seanad should have and it is an illustration of the change we are making.  We are not following the social welfare code in regard to incomes from property for very obvious reasons.</P>
    <P>There will be no change in relation to the social welfare method of calculating the upper limit for social welfare insured persons.  Whatever they do in relation to overtime and bonuses will continue in so far as the arrangements are made for the limited eligibility group.</P>
    <P>Senator Boland asked whether the CEOs would take account of the size of families.  Of course we have made it clear to them, whatever their arrangements for providing a consistent set of regulations for full eligibility, that they should relate the income of persons to the number of children they have.  That is already the case in the 27 separate health authorities and naturally this arrangement will continue when the CEOs make up their minds on what should be the standard on the full eligibility arrangement.</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>Save as otherwise provided in section 4 of this Act, health contributions shall be payable by persons who, by virtue of section 46 of the Act of 1970, have limited eligibility for services under Part IV of that Act, not being either persons referred to in section 46 (1) (d) of that Act or persons belonging to a class prescribed for the purpose of this section.</P>
      <P>This impinges on what we have already discussed.  It is correct to say that by placing No. 6 on the Order Paper today before this item we save time in that we would be discussing on section 2&mdash; we may have to have discussion on section 3&mdash;as to what &ldquo;limited eligibility&rdquo; means.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made an effort to define &ldquo;limited eligibility&rdquo; in the regulations. However, it is not as cut and dried as most things of this nature should be. I can see a difficulty in having very definite grades such as a very definite lower limit and a very definite upper limit.  I can see certain advantages in that, but there are other elements that enter into it.  I will not delay the House any further on this point because I have put down an amendment to section 3 and when that comes up for discussion I can speak on the question of eligibility.  So far as I am concerned I am prepared to let section 2 stand.</P>

      <P>As Senator Belton has said, the earlier discussion relates to this discussion.  The Minister will recall my asking him about the possibility of extending the limited liability clause in future to all classes of employed persons.  If the Minister decided that this was practicable and that it was a good thing, would he be entitled to so extend it under this section?  In other words, could he extend the limited liability class to such an extent as to embrace virtually all employed persons, or would it require a further Bill?  As it stands, it would require the introduction <Col N="1715" /> of a new piece of legislation, whereas with some slight modifications of this Bill he could have provided for what will be inevitable in the next few years.</P>

This Bill could be used, and if by chance there was an extension from £1,600 to a higher figure, then we should bring a regulation before the Oireachtas.

    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3 to add to the section a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() The measures in this Bill shall not be implemented until the Minister by regulations defines who is entitled to a medical card.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This, of course, deals in general with the discussion we had earlier.  The amendment states:</P>
      <P>The measures in this Bill shall not be implemented until the Minister by regulations, defines who is entitled to a medical card.</P>
      <P>That is approximately a definition of full eligibility and we had some discussion on it.  However, the main reason why I put down the amendment was that the Minister in the Dáil, I think on the Second Reading, said in reply to Deputy Tully that regulations defining eligibility would be brought in during this session.  In his explanatory memorandum to the regulations the Minister explains the reason for not defining full eligibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment will not be pressed to any great extent, although it is <Col N="1716" /> desirable that we have a far clearer definition of full eligibility.  At least we should have some consistency throughout the country.  Much of this has been adverted to already.  The Minister himself called for a more consistent method of valuation throughout the country.  A discrepancy in valuations from county to county exists to some extent at the moment.  The decision as to who is eligible was with the county manager until the 1970 Act came in. Now it is at the discretion of the CEOs of the eight health boards established under that Act.</P>
    <P>There is still room here for inconsistency. As I mentioned when I was speaking about the regulations, I think that if the Minister could get together the CEOs of the various regional boards and have discussions with them periodically about their methods of deciding what full eligibility is, it might go to some degree to meeting the amendment I have down here.  I put it down because it is my understanding that it is quite impossible to define full eligibility.  Indeed, it is quite impossible to define limited eligibility unless one has a definition of full eligibility.  The lower limits of limited eligibility can never be understood until the upper limits of full eligibility are understood. It has been said that there is a certain area of greyness between the upper limits of full eligibility and the lower limits of limited eligibility.  Perhaps the Minister sees some difficulty in it and may not want a complete definition of full eligibility.  There should be some understanding throughout the country at large, and some consistency throughout the various regions, as to what full eligibility means.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to accept my amendment, and the intent behind the amendment, I should also like him to accept the remarks that I have made and to ensure that there will be consultation between the CEOs and the Department. He should receive from the Valuation Office certain information that may be necessary when there are discrepancies from county to county as at present, and from health board to health board.  Even within a health board there may be discrepancy from county to county.  If the Minister <Col N="1717" /> would take into consideration the points I have raised here, I would be willing to withdraw the amendment. It will depend on what the Minister says.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage we discussed at length the question of eligibility.  Senator O'Brien mentioned the difficulty of having too rigid regulations. A big number of factors must be taken into account.  As he rightly said, there could be two families each with an income of £16 per week but one family could be twice as well off as the other.  There may be a lot of sickness in one family and there may be difficulties such as bad household management.  However, I do not consider it practicable to lay down rigid rules, because they would create more hardship than they alleviate.</P>
      <P>How this is to be finally adjudicated perplexes me.  The people operating the health authority in County Clare knew practically everybody they were dealing with and they had personal knowledge of their conditions.  Now that health authority has moved away.  I do not know how somebody in the health authority in Limerick will be able to adjudicate on the case of a person living in Clare.  I have had the experience very recently of going into the health office in Clare and being told that they had no function in this matter any more.

      <P>This might be an appropriate time to ask Senator Honan not to use the word &ldquo;almoner&rdquo; in this <Col N="1718" /> connection.  An almoner is somebody who gives alms.  This is an ancient title given to women working in hospitals to make it easier for patients to get over their illnesses.  It should not be applied to people who go around collecting information about the standard of living and so on which might be a possible disadvantage to those applying for benefits.  The word is obsolete now and those concerned have asked to be known as medical social workers, and in that connection it is even less appropriate to use that kind of person for this purpose.  I quite agree that somebody with a skill of that kind is required to get this information for the local authority or the chief executive officer, as the case may be.  I do not think it comes within the category of the medical social worker.</P>

I am not disputing what Senator Honan has said; neither am I disputing the Minister's explanation in his explanatory memorandum. I quote now from col. 232, Vol. 250 of the Dáil Official Report, where Deputy Tully said:</P>
      <P>It has been my experience that if the breadwinner, and it is the breadwinner who has to pay this extra impost, goes to hospital on very rare occasions the local health authority pay the 50p or make arrangements so that at least the person concerned does not have to pay for it.  I thought the Minister would start off by deciding who is entitled to a medical card but he says he is going to bring in regulations some time to make that decision.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for withdrawing the amendment.  As the operation of the health contributions scheme is not dependent on the publication of medical card limits, people who have cards may claim exemptions.  I could not accept the amendment, but I have given an assurance to the House that the chief executive officers are looking into this question of providing a consistent system of full eligibility limits.  They will try to do this and have group limits as consistent as possible. These will become known to the public so that everyone will be aware of the position.  This will not be easy but we have prepared a great deal of statistical information.  We have an officer from the Department who has been to a great many counties and has gone fully into this question.  The practices very a great deal.  Some counties assess full eligibility on farmers on a general valuation basis but the majority of health authorities have assessed full eligibility for farmers on an income from the farm basis.  All those matters have to be gone into by the chief executive officers so that we <Col N="1721" /> have a consistent arrangement.  That is all I need say at this stage.  I went into this in some detail on the occasion of the previous regulations coming before the House.</P>

      <P>This whole Bill was opposed by us on Second Reading and, as the Second Reading was agreed to, we now have to make do here with the best we can get out of this.  It is not our intention to obstruct the Minister.  If we take that imposition on the limited eligibility class, or the middle income classes as some people refer to them, in conjunction with section 12 (2) (a), it means that the Minister can increase, by regulations, the rate of contribution in either of these categories.  If my reading of section 12 is correct it means that the Minister may make regulations in relation to any matter referred to in this Act as prescribed or to be prescribed.  I may be wrong, but I think this is the section which empowers the Minister to increase the rate of contribution.</P>

      <P>A certain fear entered my <Col N="1722" /> mind during the Minister's reply on Second Reading.  He was replying to a statement by Senators, including myself, that the new rate of contribution would be an incentive for people to go into hospital.  The Minister said in reply, and I quote from Vol. 70, col. 1265, of the Seanad Official Report:</P>
      <P>The first observation made by Senator Belton and others was that this new contribution would encourage middle-income group people to go to hospital.  If they go to hospital excessively their contributions will go up again.</P>
      <P>It is implied therein that at any time the Minister or the Department thinks that contribution needs to be raised this method can be used.  This is the thin end of the wedge.  Of course, the Minister is collecting £5 million a year by these contributions and he is relieving the contributors to the extent of £700,000 by abolishing the daily charge of 50p in the hospitals.</P>
      <P>The amount the Exchequer is receiving is approximately £4.7 million, not £4.3 million.  That is a lot of money for a contribution compared to the benefits these people are receiving.  The danger is that this system will be used in the future as an easy way of collecting money for the Exchequer.  I have great faith in the present Minister's intention that this money will be devoted to health.  However, under a further amendment later on, the Minister must get the consent of the Minister for Finance; and if this is not forthcoming even the present Minister may be prevented from devoting to health matters what has been collected here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I made this. clear to the House on Second Stage. We are now repeating the debate we had on Second Stage.  I made it absolutely clear to the House in a very honest way, if they refer to my speech, that I did not know of any consistent method of paying for health services in any country of Europe.  I said that it was a piecemeal system that had grown up in the course of years and that all the perfect systems had been shattered completely, such as systems involving patient charges plus contributory insurance. <Col N="1723" /> They had been shattered by the enormous increase in the cost of hospital services.  I cited in particular Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden in that connection.  I pointed out that in the case of the British the insurance contributions were supposed to provide the cost of the health services and only 12½ per cent of the cost of these services is paid for out of insurance.  All the rest is collected in the form of general taxes upon the community.</P>
      <P>I made it clear that, in deciding how to pay for the cost of the health services in respect of the middle income group, it will have to be based on political hunch, human psychology and the requirements of the service.  I did not know how to define the limit to which one could charge health contributions or evolve a psychological or financial formula for it.  I explained to the House on that occasion that the middle income services totalled £35 million and that nobody would presume that I could collect 105p instead of 15p by way of contribution, because it would be quite impossible to know how to relieve the middle income group of the taxes and rates that they were paying to cover their share of the middle income group's services.  I made it clear that we would move carefully in regard to this.</P>
      <P>It is also provided for in the Bill that, if the amount was increased measurably over the 15p per week or £7 a year, we would have to do it on a pay-related basis.  I shall have the benefit of the advice of the Minister for Social Welfare who is looking into the whole of the Social Welfare code with a view to having a pay-related scheme.  It is a very complex matter.  That is the best advice that I can give to the House.  If we increase the contributions, the Bill will have to be amended and it can be discussed all over again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noticed that Senators on both sides have no material at their command to tell me that there is anything particularly wrong with £7 a year applied to the middle income group.  I am convinced that it is an amount so low that the middle income group can afford to pay for it.  When we reach the higher limits there may be controversy <Col N="1724" /> and more care may have to be exercised in deciding on a higher limit.  I have been absolutely frank with the House on this matter.  When my predecessors were asked to completely re-shape the whole methods by which health services were paid for, they were in the most frightful difficulties.  You cannot create a revolutionary new system for paying for health services without running into problems of all kinds and particularly the problem of the psychological impact of taxes, rates and insurance contributions on ordinary human beings.  The psychological impact can be quite illogical in many cases.  People may feel they will refuse to pay a particular tax and throw the Government out because of it.</P>
    <P>This Government has had a long record of administration.  Whatever mistakes we have made&mdash;I am certain we have made mistakes from time to time in our levying of taxes&mdash;we have managed to shape the taxation system on an accumulative basis.  We have arrived at the present level of taxes. Now there is argument as to whether they are sufficiently progressive or whether they are regressive.  The argument seems to me to be limited to the time of Budget debates and it relates generally to particular proposals in the Finance Bill or particular new impacts of taxes.  I do not think I can say anything more about it.</P>

      <P>To delete all words from and including &ldquo;disposed&rdquo; in line 48 to the end of the section and substitute &ldquo;devoted to financing in part the health services for the country at large and that any intended grant or intended supplementary grant to a Health Board shall not thereby be reduced&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the consent of the Minister for Finance would not be necessary.  The Minister for Health may reply that this consent is usual.  However, when we were discussing why this method of raising money had not been introduced in the Budget, where it would normally come under the control of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health said that this was a health matter and that the resultant moneys would be devoted to health.  The hands of the present Minister and those of his successors will be tied if we keep the words in this section &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  The Minister for Finance will not give his consent.  By not giving his consent, it is tantamount to appropriating money that is being collected for health purposes and allocating it to other purposes.  The intent of this amendment is to prevent the Minister for Finance from so doing.  I am not suggesting it might happen.  It is not good legislation, and never was good legislation, to say something in a Bill could happen. The interpretation of the section as it stands without the amendment is that the Minister for Finance could refuse to allow the Minister for Health to allocate the money which is being collected under this Bill for health purposes.  It has been said that £5 million will be collected, or that there will be a net sum to the Exchequer of £4.6 million.  All of that should go <Col N="1726" /> towards health purposes.  The ultimate decision should be left with the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance should not interfere in any way with the distribution of that money.  The Minister for Health should devote that money to the country at large, so that there would be some relief for the rate-payers in respect of health charges.  I also hope that this would not prevent the Exchequer from giving supplementary grants to health boards for the relief of rates.  I know this may be only a pious hope.</P>
    <P>As we all know, the cost of the health services is rising so rapidly that the imposition on the rates will be so catastrophic as to cause an outcry.  I want to retain all this money, plus whatever would be intended as a health grant or supplementary grant for health purposes.  That is the purpose of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, in reply to Senator Belton, the Minister for Finance cannot appropriate the income arising as a result of the passing of this Bill and the contribution system from persons in the middle income group. You cannot appropriate for other purposes, and section 2 of the Bill makes it perfectly clear when it states:</P>
      <P>There shall be paid, in accordance with this Act and regulations thereunder, contributions (in this Act referred to as health contributions) towards the cost of the provision of services under Part IV of the Act of 1970.</P>
      <P>Section 8 simply means that I naturally have to discuss with the Minister for Finance the use to be applied to the contribution of revenue in relation to the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, Senator Belton spoke of a pious hope that I could guarantee that the whole of this health contribution revenue would be devoted to the relief of rates.  We hope that the rates will be relieved to a greater extent in the future as a result of the collection of these contributions, but I could not give the House an absolute guarantee of that.  I merely state it as an objective that the collection of these contributions will tend to relieve the rates.  Therefore, <Col N="1727" /> I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

There is no point in having them unless they empower the Minister for Finance to refuse; they imply he has the power to refuse.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance must have some say in the way this money is spent, because money is raised from taxes, from rates and from the Hospitals Trust Fund.  It is only reasonable to suppose that in the utilisation of this contribution revenue the Minister for Finance would wish to give his consent to the method by which it was used.  That is entirely reasonable and it has come into a great deal of the legislation in this country for years. When there is anything connected with finance, the Minister for Finance gives his consent.  The Senator knows this very well.  In the legislation passed ever <Col N="1728" /> since the State was founded this has been the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I introduced this amendment because, as I said on Second Reading this is largely an enabling Bill.  What it does or what will happen under it depends on the Minister making regulations, and there is a very wide power to make regulations. I have sympathy with the Minister in this.  The Bill is just a skeleton which will be filled out by regulations of the Minister from time to time.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I am very concerned that Parliament should have control, to the greatest extent possible, of the way in which these regulations and this power are implemented.  Therefore, I welcome the fact that in section 12 there are two sorts of regulations and there is a different provision for each. In relation to the first type of regulation &mdash;these are regulations under section 3, subsection (2) and I want to add &ldquo;and subsection (5)&rdquo;.  The Minister has first of all to obtain the consent of the Minister for Finance for the regulations and lay them before the House and they must be passed by resolution of the House, as the regulations which we considered earlier today had to be passed in draft by resolution of the House.</P>
      <P>This is very valuable.  It gives the Seanad an opportunity to discuss these regulations.  It is important in areas like this that the regulations should be laid in draft.  This can be contrasted with the other type of regulation which is laid before the House but which is only subject to a provision that if it is annulled within 21 days it will no longer be operative.  All of us have been long enough in the House to realise that these regulations are very rarely referred to and very rarely debated. This is not a very good method of holding a watching brief on regulations; it is not a very good method of control and does not compare with the laying of the order in draft before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Referring back to section 3, subsection <Col N="1730" /> (2) provides that the health contributions shall, in the case of persons other than those mentioned in section 46 (1) (c) of the Act of 1970, be at a rate related to the person's income and fixed by regulations made from time to time by the Minister for the purposes of the section, and also under section (b), and these are the regulations to be laid in draft.  Subsection (5) of section 3 states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, by regulations made with the consent of the Minister for Finance, define income for the purposes of this section, either by reference to any other enactment or in such other manner as he thinks fit.</P>
    <P>I think this is crucial to section 3, subsection (2).  If the Minister can define income &ldquo;either by reference to any other enactment or in such other manner as he thinks fit,&rdquo; then he can use this definition of income by regulation, which does not have to be laid in draft before the House and which might not come to the notice of the House, to get around the provisions of section 3, subsection (2).  He could use the redefining of &ldquo;income&rdquo; to avoid the necessity of any regulations under section 3, subsection (2) and yet substantially change the range of people who would be provided for in section 3, subsection (2).  In drawing up the provision for the regulations in section 12 it is logical there to include subsection (5).  This is something to which the Minister should have no objection because it is the type of control that is intended in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the Minister would abuse his powers and evade the subsection by redefining &ldquo;income&rdquo; at his discretion&mdash;and I think he will admit he has a very wide discretion there, &ldquo;either by reference to any other enactment or in such other manner as he thinks fit&rdquo;.  I do not think the discretion to define income could be wider.  I do not think the Minister would abuse this, but we are now drawing up legislation for the future and we must be concerned with the way in which it is drafted; and it is logical and desirable that subsection (5) be included in the types of regulations which must be laid in draft and which would come to our <Col N="1731" /> notice and require a positive resolution of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept either of these amendments.  As Senator Robinson has said, the regulations under section 3, subsection (2), which fix the actual proportion of income to be represented in the graduated contributions that may come later, must be put to the House in draft form and approved before they have effect.  It would be only right that the Dáil and the Seanad should be able to debate formally the actual proportion of income, whether it is 1 per cent, 2 per cent, 3 per cent or 4 per cent of people's income.</P>
      <P>When it comes to section 3, subsection (5) in which the Minister has power to define the income on which a person's graduated contribution will be determined, this is purely for administrative purposes so that the Revenue Commissioners can operate the graduated scheme.  In practice the definition of income would be as for income tax and there would be no departure from that.  When the regulations are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and annulled within 21 days it would be very easy for anybody in the Dáil or the Seanad to notice that the Minister for Health of the day, with the connivance of the Minister for Finance, had entirely altered the principle of assessing income.  I do not think it is necessary to have a special resolution in regard to this; it is a purely administrative matter.  As I have said, the definition of income would be as for income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case, why not state here that the definition of income would be as for income tax purposes?  My quarrel with this is that, as it is phrased, it gives a very wide discretion.  I do not think it would be a very difficult matter for the amendment to be accepted, so that any definition of income would come before the House in draft.  If the unlikely happened&mdash;and I accept the Minister's contention that it would be unlikely&mdash;that the definition of income would not be the same as for income tax purposes, I still think it is <Col N="1732" /> open to the Minister under the terms of this Bill to depart from the usual practice and to define income as he thinks fit.  If he does so, it is only coming before the House in the form of a regulation subject to annulment.  I ask the Minister to accept that most of these regulations do not even come to the notice of the House, as happened recently in relation to the salaries of judges, and this is not a sufficient control.  The Minister is arguing the point in such a way that I find it hard to understand why he would refuse to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  I have made the position clear.  I cannot put the words &ldquo;income tax&rdquo; into the Bill without saying &ldquo;to define income as being for income tax purposes.&rdquo;  It is too loose a thing to do and is not practicable.  Any Government would be in shocking trouble if they took advantage of a Bill such as this to distort the definition of income and what it is generally accepted to be.  I do not think any Government would dare do it.  If there was a departure in relation to the method of defining income, the Minister of the day would have to publish this specially so that the Dáil and the Seanad could ask for a debate within 21 days.  I do not think there is any need for a special debate on the subject by way of resolution.</P>

      <P>I am very reluctant to be put in a position where I take a Minister's assurances that very wide wording in a Bill would not be construed as I can see it could quite clearly be construed.  The argument the Minister has raised is therefore an argument for clarifying the meaning and allowing the regulations to be as for the rest of section 3, subsection (2) and providing that regulations under the section would also be included in draft.  I would think that they would very often go together and that the Minister in drawing up regulations under section 3, subsection (2), would also draw up regulations under subsection (5).  It seems to me to be lacking in logic as well as lacking in <Col N="1733" /> the proper control of this House that they would not be laid in draft before the House.

      <P>We are in a slight difficulty in regard to the next item on the Order Paper.  It is now 12.40 and it is suggested that we should not break for lunch so as to ensure that the Higher Education Authority Bill will be completed by 2.30, when it is proposed to take the Central Bank Bill. If there is no objection I propose that we should do so.</P>

If it is deemed necessary, could we continue with that Bill after we have disposed of the Central Bank Bill?</P>

I could not accept the responsibility of agreeing with this in view of the fact that I am not the spokesman on our side on Education. Senator Kelly is our spokesman on Education.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 21 after &ldquo;institution&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including an institution dealing primarily with postgraduate education and research&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have suggested this amendment because, having listened to the debate on a similar suggestion on Committee Stage and having read the report of it subsequently, I was not satisfied that I had got the point I wished to make clearly across to the Members of the House and, perhaps, even to the Minister.  My previous amendment on Committee Stage referred to postgraduate students.  The Minister, quite reasonably, said that the Higher Education Authority would have within their sphere of operations and interest in postgraduate students.  The institutions of higher education that deal with undergraduate students have, of course, an increasing interest in postgraduate students.  One cannot separate one from the other.  Therefore, the Higher Education Authority must deal with postgraduate students in these institutions anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on Second Stage I was more concerned about certain institutions which have a primary and direct <Col N="1736" /> responsibility for postgraduate education and training and have not got any undergraduate students.  These institutions are becoming increasingly important, particularly in the professional areas.  They are very important in medicine and are becoming more important in engineering also.  The institutions concerned have two functions: first, to regulate the standards of practice in the professions and, secondly, to prepare people for practice in certain specialist areas of the professions.  They do this by organising courses and arranging examinations. These courses may be partly taken in the universities, where they will be covered by the operations of the Higher Education Authority, but very often they are taken in the institutions themselves.</P>
    <P>I want it to be quite clear from the Bill, when it becomes an Act, that the Higher Education Authority has no discretion about whether or not it should entertain an approach from one of these institutions to be considered as rating perhaps for a grant under this Bill.  I know that there is in the public mind a definite degree of confusion about these places.  In the past they have not been very active in their operations, but in the future they are going to be increasingly active; indeed, their activity is increasing at the moment.  If they are not catered for in this way, the interests of the community at large will suffer, because these bodies will not be able to carry out their functions in regulating the standards of people who are practising in the professions concerned.  The amendment is a reasonable one.  I do not want to delay unduly the course of the Bill through the Oireachtas, but I am quite satisfied that the Higher Education Authority must have quite clearly within its zone of operation the institutions about which I am thinking which may not have any undergraduate responsibilities at all but have definite responsibilities for education and training in the postgraduate area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is unnecessary and to some extent dangerous. There is nothing in the Bill which suggests that the kind of institution that Senator Jessop has in mind <Col N="1737" /> would be excluded from consideration. The danger is that when you specifically include a certain kind of institution, you raise the possibility that certain other institutions are not included.  It could be argued that by saying &ldquo;including an institution dealing primarily with postgraduate education and research&rdquo;, you would thereby eliminate from consideration by the Minister an institution which did not deal primarily with postgraduate education and research.</P>
      <P>If the position is at the moment that the kind of institution which the mover of this amendment has in mind is not excluded, and there is no reason to believe that it would not be considered by the Minister, more harm than good is done by putting down this kind of amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to support this amendment put down in our names, despite what Senator Eoin Ryan has said.  During the debates in the Dáil and in this House there has been considerable doubt as to whether the institutions of higher education would include postgraduate institutions. This would neither strengthen nor weaken the case of any other institutions which might seek to come in under the Act.  It would not cramp the Minister's style but it would make the matter clear in the legislation.  It is important that the institution could include the institutions which involve postgraduate students only and not undergraduates. The duties of the holder of an academic post are defined as: &ldquo;to teach any students of the institution or to carry out research&rdquo;.  This would clearly by inference include postgraduates students. This was one of the matters which was raised on the earlier Stages of this Bill. It both clarifies and confirms the fact that the institutions of higher education would include those either solely or largely devoted to postgraduate research.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from what Senator Jessop said in the beginning of his statement that in putting down the amendment he appears to harbour still some of the doubts which motivated <Col N="1738" /> him when he proposed, on Committee Stage, an amendment to ensure that the teaching of postgraduate students in an institution of higher education would reckon as a qualification for academic membership.  Speaking on that amendment, I have already told him that the expression &ldquo;student&rdquo; included postgraduate students.</P>
      <P>In relation to the designation of an institution, the Senator wishes to have written into the Bill that an institution dealing primarily with postgraduate education and research might be considered for designation by the Minister. I agree fully with what Senator Ryan has said in relation to that, that there is nothing in the definition as it stands to debar such an institution from being considered for designation, and that, therefore, there is no need to provide specifically for its inclusion.  I also concur with him when he says that in this respect, if in a definition of this type specific reference were made to one of the classes of institutions covered by the definition, the implication may be drawn that other types of institutions which are not specifically mentioned are not covered, or perhaps are less fully covered.  There is no need to make explicit in the case of one particular type of institution what is implicit in the definition as it stands.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 27 and 28 but in section 1 to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() A reference in this Act to higher education includes research of a type normally carried out in an institution of university standing.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This would have the effect of making it absolutely clear that any reference in the Bill to higher education would include a type of research normally <Col N="1739" /> carried on in a university and appropriate to such an institution.</P>
    <P>In the Act there are references in places to higher education and in other places to higher education and research. On the Second Stage of this Bill it was agreed generally that the Bill provides in the new Authority for Higher Education something more than a university grants committee of the type which has existed for some years in Britain.  In section 10 of the Bill, in which the university grants committee functions, is enshrined the phrase &ldquo;higher education and research&rdquo;.  However, when we turn to the other sections of the Bill, which make the new Údarás something more positive than a university grants committee, which give them a function in co-ordination and in planning, which give them a function in promotion, we find that the phrase used is &ldquo;higher education&rdquo; alone.</P>
    <P>It is clearly recognised that there are various types of research.  There are types of research which are appropriate only to a university or similar institution of higher education.  These are types of pedagogical research, of apprenticeship in research, which are essentially part of the training of a person who will seek a career in research work afterwards.</P>
    <P>There are, on the other hand, types of research which, though not exclusively, are largely the concern of universities, basic research, non oriented research, though the tendency in large private organisations and State organisations is for more and more of this research work to be done there as well as in the university.  There are types of research which are more appropriate to research institutes, whether public or private, than to the university&mdash;oriented research, <i>ad hoc</i> research and development work.  In the drafting of this amendment it has been restricted to research of a university character.  This has been done deliberately so that the adoption of this amendment would not interfere with any of our statutory research institutions and so that there would be no interference with the National Science Council either in the support or <Col N="1740" /> in the co-ordination of research.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;() A reference to this Act to higher education includes research of a type normally carried out in an institution of university standing.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated before the interval, the purpose of this amendment is to make it absolutely clear that in all their functions An tUdarás are entitled to concern themselves with research of a university type as well as with the other activities which are subsumed under the title of higher education.  I pointed out that in section 10, which is concerned with the assessment of the amounts of financial provision, it is quite clearly stated that what is meant here is higher education and research, whereas in sections dealing with other functions of An tÚdarás not concerned with the detailed assessment of the amounts of money to be provided but rather with the whole promotion of higher education we find <Col N="1741" /> that higher education is a phrase standing on its own.</P>
      <P>Section 3 is concerned with the general functions.  Section 6 is concerned with the review of the demand and need for higher education.  If we look at section 12, which is concerned with the actual payment out to the institutions of the moneys assessed in section 10, we find the phrase &ldquo;higher education&rdquo; only.  It is not for me to explore the mysteries of draftsmanship, but I suggest that there is to the ordinary reader, and that means to the legislator, some doubt here as to whether there is not in this Bill a different meaning between the phrase &ldquo;higher education&rdquo; and the phrase &ldquo;higher education and research.&rdquo; If there is not a different meaning, one would have expected the same term to have been used throughout.  If there is a difference of meaning, I fail to see the reason why there should be a difference of meaning and a difference of treatment in regard to higher education, including research, and higher education excluding research.</P>
      <P>It is for that reason I have put down this amendment to make it clear in the definition of the section that all references in the Act to higher education include references to that type of research which is appropriate to institutions of a university standing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see it, the basis on which this Bill is drafted and on which it has been so styled is that research is a branch or activity of higher education and that the expression &ldquo;higher education&rdquo; includes that activity.  I do not think it is necessary or desirable to include in the Bill a definition which would spell out the obvious fact that higher education includes research of an appropriate type and standard.</P>
      <P>There are further difficulties in relation to this amendment.  The primary fact is that one of the specific functions given to An tÚdarás, as mentioned by Senator Dooge, in section 10 (1) is to assess the amounts which they recommend for higher education and research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 makes it clear that the general functions stipulated in that <Col N="1742" /> section are in no way in substitution of any of the specific functions.  To include a definition, as is proposed by the Senators, would merely confuse the issue wherever there was reference in the Bill to higher education and research.</P>
    <P>In the context of the reference in section 3 to the specific functions of An tÚdarás and to the fact that these specific functions include assessing the financial provision to be made for higher education and research, the references in section 3 are no more than general references.  The fact that they refer to the development of higher education on the one hand and to the promotion of an appreciation of the value of higher education and research on the other hand, does no more than lay stress on the need to refer to research when speaking of promoting an appreciation.  As I said on the Committee Stage the people who will be primarily involved here will be the parents of students and employers. Research is an inherent part of higher education, but this might not be readily apparent to those people.</P>
    <P>With general reference to the Bill, first of all we start off by defining what an institution of higher education is. The definition includes institutions which engage in higher education in all its aspects including teaching and research.  There is no definition of an institution of higher education and research nor in that context to my mind is there any need to have such a definition.  If you look at section 5, where there is a reference to institutions of higher education, or in fact to any of the sections where there is such a reference, there can be no doubt whatsoever, in my view, that the reference also includes a reference to research. Apart from the fact that the amendment put forward by Senators Dooge and Kelly is quite possibly bad by definition, in my opinion there is no need for it.</P>

      <P>If this is so and if the Minister is clear that every reference to higher education includes research, would he accept that it is too late to put forward an amendment on Report Stage.

      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said in this regard.  It would be intolerable if the understanding of the Minister proposing this Bill were anything other than the fact that higher education, which is the responsibility of this Authority, would include research.  Accepting the position that higher education includes research, a difficulty arises because of two phrases which are used in the context of the various sections of this Bill&mdash;on the one hand, the phrase &ldquo;higher education&rdquo; standing alone; on the other &ldquo;higher education and research.&rdquo;  As long as it is absolutely and ultimately clear that higher education does include research in each and every section of the Bill, that An tÚdarás in their duties will not neglect this extremely important aspect of higher education&mdash; on that we will have to wait and judge them when they are appointed and in operation&mdash;this is not a very serious point.  Nevertheless, the Bill would have been clearer if the one phrase had been used throughout.  The word &ldquo;research&rdquo; is perhaps used here from the point of view of emphasis.  In this regard there is some significance in the sections in which it is specifically mentioned, although this emphasis should have been given in other ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the whole Bill, as it stands, I am not quite sure of the number of times in which higher education is mentioned.  The need of appreciating it is certainly mentioned.  There is, of course, need for emphasis here and I <Col N="1744" /> do hope that An tÚdarás will have regard to that.  There is also a need for money in regard to research.  I hope that An tÚdarás will not be found wanting in this particular respect. Furthermore, the word &ldquo;research&rdquo; is mentioned in regard to studies.  I hope again that An tÚdarás will find time, even in its early years, to take up the study of the particular problems that concern research in this country.  We do not have perhaps as good a strategy of research as is appropriate to our conditions.</P>
    <P>Research in universities is played in an international league.  Our disadvantages of finance and manpower make it extremely difficult for us to compete. It is only by focusing on certain areas, where we can make a special contribution for one reason or other, that we can remain within that international league.  I hope that An tÚdarás will take the initiative in commissioning, undertaking and publishing studies in regard to the development of a strategy of university research that will enable us to carry on.  Research in Irish universities in the past has been almost a matter of heroic virtue, such have been the conditions.  While we do not want to lose all our virtue in the future we would be glad to do without some of the hair shirts we have had to bear in this regard.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete all words after &ldquo;mind&rdquo; in line 2, to and including &ldquo;aims&rdquo; in line 4 and substitute &ldquo;the future of the Irish language, and of Irish culture.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the discussion which we had during the Committee Stage of the Bill we finally managed to hammer out between us on all sides of the House that section 4 was not intended to have any legislative effect but was to be, in Senator Brugha's words, an encouragement, a reminder.  Basically, I still disagree with the inclusion of sections in Bills of the Oireachtas which are no more than forms of encouragement and reminder.  The closest we have <Col N="1745" /> come to this in legislation, it seems to me, has been in the inclusion of various sections for clarificatory reasons.  I am not all happy with this approach, which involves inserting vague aspirations into legislative instruments.  If, on the other hand, we are to have a section like this in the Bill it was my contention on the Committee Stage, and it is still my contention, that the wording can be considerably improved.</P>
    <P>When I spoke on the section itself during the Committee Stage debate the Minister complained that he found it difficult to follow my arguments. On reading the unrevised version of the debate I found myself in sympathy with him and I have gone to some trouble to spell out exactly what I mean in my objection to the section in its present form.  The section contains two words which I believe should be deleted for vagueness.  These are the words &ldquo;national aims&rdquo;.  I have gone to the trouble to look up the definitions of the words concerned in the Oxford English dictionary and I strongly believe that they support my contentention. The dictionary definition of &ldquo;nation&rdquo; is &ldquo;the whole people of a country frequently in contrast to some small or narrower body within it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When we use the word &ldquo;nation&rdquo; in this section, in what sense are we using it?  It seems to me that we are not using it in the sense which the dictionary gives it, but in a different sense completely. The word &ldquo;national&rdquo; in effect in this section, as unamended, means &ldquo;pertaining to this State&rdquo;&mdash;not pertaining to the whole people of Ireland.  The adjective &ldquo;national&rdquo; is described by the Oxford English dictionary as &ldquo;of or belonging to a or the nation, affecting or shared by the nation as a whole&rdquo;. I underline these last three words &ldquo;as a whole&rdquo;.  In this section, as unamended, we are attempting to legislate on a national basis but are in fact using sectional terminology.  This confusion of terminology between the nation and this particular state is at the root of my objection to this section in its present form.</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage debate I referred to the Constitution and it is relevant to refer to it again.  The Constitution does not define any <Col N="1746" /> national aim with regard to the language.  It defines the language quite properly as the national language, but it does not attempt to define the national aims for the simple reason that there was no way at that time of adequately finding out what the national aims were. I suspect that the situation which obtained at the time when that Constitution was brought into force is still basically the one which is in effect today.</P>
    <P>We have, unfortunately, consistently acted in our legislation and in the taking of public attitudes as if the nation and the present State, which has jurisdiction over 26 Counties, were in some way coterminous.  On the occasions in which we deign to recognise the existence of a large and important body of Irishmen to the north-east of us we consistently arrogate to ourselves the right to speak for them, especially where the quality of Irishness is concerned, as if we were in possession of some special revelation that is being denied to them.</P>
    <P>This is particularly true of our attitude to the Irish language.  Whether the Government's present aim with regard to the Irish language is something which can be said to be shared by the nation is, I would suggest, something which will be very difficult for us to find out.  The restoration of the Irish language is my aim and is the aim of this State, but we must avoid falling into the confusion of discussing the policies and the aims of this State as if they were without further discussion the policies and aims of the nation.</P>
    <P>Many things have been said and will be said about the people in Northern Ireland, but two things can be said about them with some certainty.  The first is that the majority of them would regard themselves as Irishmen in at least some form.  The second is that the very great majority of them resent very deeply the activities of people who claim, often very vociferously, to speak on their behalf.  In saying this I am not subscribing to any sort of two nation theory.  I am simply submitting that any discussion about national aims, what they are and what they are not, should be carried on with a sort of decent restraint pending any reunification of <Col N="1747" /> our country.  I should hope indeed that the majority of Irish people would subscribe to the kind of aim which finds expression in section 4.  For the moment I suggest that it would be wiser and less divisive not to attempt to speak on their behalf until they have had an opportunity of speaking for themselves.</P>
    <P>That is what this section in its present form claims to do.  I would go even further.  I would suggest that the longer this State continues to proclaim as national aims something which pertains only to this State at the moment, the less chance it has of getting truly national priorities accepted for what they are by the people of the whole country.  There is a very simple reason for this.  There is a real danger that the people of Northern Ireland, because of their genuine and very often justified distrust of the activities of the Government in the Republic, may throw out the baby with the bathwater. There is a danger that, in reacting against the insubstantial and often misleading and sectional rhetoric of Irish Government spokesmen, they may also jettison the underlying reality.</P>
    <P>To be more concrete, I believe that whatever goodwill exists for the Irish language north of the Border it is imperilled because of the implication in this section&mdash;and it is an implication which is reinforced in other forms of legislation&mdash;that full adherence to the present policy of the Government of the Republic is in some way a tradition of being accepted as an Irishman.  Does this mean, therefore, that we have to remain silent about the Irish language? I do not believe so.  I believe that we should proclaim it to be what it is: the Irish language, the national language.</P>
    <P>I would refer the House to another definition of the word &ldquo;national&rdquo;.  It also finds a place in the Oxford English dictionary.  &ldquo;National&rdquo; means &ldquo;peculiar to the people of a particular country, characteristic or distinctive of a nation.&rdquo; I do not think anybody disagrees that the Irish language fills this description absolutely perfectly and completely or that the Irish language can and should be described as the national language. Where we have difficulty is in transferring <Col N="1748" /> the adjective &ldquo;national&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;aim&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The same is true, to a certain extent, of the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo;.  I feel&mdash;I would be interested in the Minister's observations on this&mdash;that the drafters of this section, whoever originally drafted it in the form in which it found a place in earlier legislation, had a rather sectional idea of Irish culture in the sense that they identified it totally with Gaelic culture.  I believe that Gaelic culture is Irish culture, but I do not necessarily believe that Gaelic culture is coterminous with Irish culture.  The sheer impossibility of defining the word adequately makes me wonder at the wisdom of putting it into a legislative instrument like this.</P>
    <P>The form of words that I have suggested to take the place of the words that I object to is, I submit, more accurate in terminological terms, less divisive, and has the additional advantage of simpler words.</P>

      <P>I have been very interested in hearing Senator Horgan's observations on the amendment which he and Senator Robinson put forward. I have read and studied it and the conclusion which I have arrived at is that, if this amendment were to be accepted, it would considerably weaken the intention of section 4.  I will read the section as it would appear if amended:</P>
      <P>In performing its functions, An tÚdarás shall bear constantly in mind the future of the Irish language and of Irish culture.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into too much detail on the amendment but I would feel that that amendment, certainly the description, &ldquo;the future of the Irish language&rdquo; would raise immediately in some minds the whole question of whether the Irish language has or has not got a future.  In comparison with the original section, it leaves out the entire picture most people would have of the whole idea of language, culture and identity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not presume to speak on behalf of everyone, but it is a general question <Col N="1749" /> of outlook that is important here. Senator Horgan has covered a fairly wide area and I should like to preface my remarks by saying that we are engaged here in an examination of the means and methods which have been employed over the past 50 years in relation to the question of language, culture and identity.  I think it will be some time before we have arrived at a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>At an earlier stage of this Bill I described section 4 as being to my mind inadequate in the sense that I had never seen anything that would adequately describe what is the sense of the aims in relation to language and culture.  To some extent what was in my mind was the effect that time has on words. When one talks about culture here in this day and age and when one talks about the Irish language, it invokes different feelings in the minds of people to the feelings and attitudes that would have been evoked perhaps 50 or 60 years ago.  This is a sort of erosion that takes place in relation to the use of words: they become almost clichés in the minds of people.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the true meaning of the words does not change.  It is to some extent the attitude of people towards words, because of the way in which different words have been used by different people and different organisations, that is changed.  This is one of the handicaps, from which the Irish language has suffered over a number years, both to some extent from those supporting it and from those who tend to be antagonised by the methods employed to try to strengthen it.</P>
    <P>Senator Horgan referred to national aims, and in doing so referred to the dictionary and implied that it must mean the aims of the State.  I do not want to go into the problem that we have.  God knows there has been enough talk about it and there is a serious enough problem of division in this country, but I would say in relation to this aspect of it that one should attempt to do what one can irrespective of whether the country is divided or not. In this sense, while not presuming to speak on behalf of any particular group, I think the words &ldquo;national aims&rdquo; here refer to the nation.  I would <Col N="1750" /> also suggest that the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; here does not relate to Gaelic culture alone, which Senator Horgan spoke of. It is not referred to here.</P>
    <P>There are other traditions which we, I think, must respect, and encourage the best that is in them and that they can give to us.  I understand what Senator Horgan has in mind when he speaks of &ldquo;decent restraint.&rdquo; The section does not appear to me to be unrestrained.  One has to try to look ahead to a period when we will not be here, if I might express a personal opinion, what is described as the minority in the north-east have been released from the historical prison in which they find themselves.  Then one will find these people, the Protestants of the North, far more interested in and far more enthusiastic about the question of a language and our identity than one has found in the past couple of generations here in the rest of the country.  I know, from personal experience of meeting what I might describe as Protestants from the North who have discovered Ireland, that their interest and enthusiasm for the Irish language in particular does not have any bounds.</P>
    <P>I would be the last to encourage the use of words which would in any way whatsoever put off people in the North, but I do not think the description in this section, which is idealistic to say the least of it, should have that effect.  I know that all sorts of arguments are used by a particular political element in the North to suit their own immediate political situation and that questions of compulsory Irish and various other things have been used as political arguments.  Other arguments, such as the disparity in social welfare payments, have been used but most of these arguments are merely used to cover up an attitude of mind which does not want to have anything to do with us at any price.  This is an attitude of mind that must change eventually.  I do not want to go into it too deeply here.  It is founded on a history of fear and of prejudice.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to express here&mdash;and it is not a legal expression in my opinion&mdash;the generally accepted wording such as &ldquo;national aims.&rdquo;  We are <Col N="1751" /> engaged here in a re-examination of the methods and the means which have been employed in relation to this problem of language.  The intentions of those who introduced Irish into the schools over two generations ago and of those following them have always been the best.  The methods have not. We have to conduct a continuing examination of the effect these methods are having on progress in relation to Irish.</P>
    <P>As this Bill deals with higher education and not with the Irish language, I do not wish to go too far into that subject.  I would merely repeat, in conclusion, what the Minister said while speaking in Irish, that the language is something that belongs to the nation. It does not belong to any section or group.  It will, I hope, belong to the people to whom Senator Horgan referred and one would hope in the future that it will come into use in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, I think we should be content with setting out what is an ideal in the best way that we can.  We may, over the next few years, arrive at a better way of describing it.  If one is trying to do so in a short couple of sentences it is hard to find better wording than we have got here.  I could amplify this considerably and possibly give more expression and meaning to it, but I would need a page to do so.  In the meantime I am satisfied that this describes, in so far as we are able to, the national aim we have in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to prolong this discussion which is not really central to the Higher Education Authority.  Although I am sorry on a matter of this kind to have to disagree with Senator Horgan I have to disagree with him in this regard and for reasons similar to those which Senator Brugha has given.  We do not need to apologise to people in the North of Ireland for any interest we have in the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The desire to restore a language from a position of being moribund, of rescuing it and ensuring that it is spoken again by a viable community in the social sense, is something which is civilised and honourable.  This desire <Col N="1752" /> must appear to be so in any country in the world which lays claim to being civilised.  People in the North of Ireland, of whichever political persuasion, could be encouraged to see it that way. We should not have to apologise to them for pursuing this aim.  If they in the North of Ireland had some linguistic phenomenon on their hands which was unconnected with the Gaelic world and unconnected with the religion or ideology of the majority of the people in this country&mdash;if, for example, there were a small enclave of Norse-speaking Protestants in Antrim&mdash;we here would regard them as being barbarous if they shamed that enclave out of existence in the name of progress and in the name of rationalising communication.  We would think them barbarous if they allowed a natural species, particularly one as unique and as subtle as a language, to disappear simply because it was not easily harmonised with the needs of the modern world for efficiency.</P>
    <P>In the same way I would expect a civilised person from the North of Ireland, whatever his political beliefs, to respect the wish of the people in this part of the country to hold on to what is left of the Irish language and to stabilise it at least within its own small frontiers.  What the people in the North object to, in my view, is not an interest in promoting the Irish language but the methods by which it is being promoted under which half-hearted attempts have been made to restore it and the unrealistic objectives which have been attached to it.</P>
    <P>To speak about making Irish the spoken language of this country before we have ensured that it will remain the spoken language of Carraroe is idiotic, but that is what we have been doing all along.  The results are plain to be seen. We have been pursuing and stating these objectives which by any standard are fatuous, while all the time the reality of the language has been draining away bit by bit and day by day.  Along with the statement of these ultimate objectives which we could very easily leave to the next generation to fulfil, we have been pursuing the revival of the Irish language by means which have made us a laughing stock inside and outside our territory.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1753" /> I do not want to invoke the annoyance of the Chair by making a speech about this subject.  The House probably knows my views on it already.  Not a month goes by in which we do not see a demonstration of some kind of hypocrisy, sham and bogus pretence, in regard to the Irish language.  We debated this section in Irish for a while and I exonerated&mdash;if it is not condescending of me to say so&mdash;the Minister personally from being a hypocrite in this regard.  I know very well he is not.</P>
    <P>The language movement for too long has been conducted by people who were content, and were allowed to be content, with mere gestures and it is not surprising that the majority of people in the whole of Ireland are sick and tired of the revival as they have witnessed it up to this.  Not a month goes by but the people get some proof of the idiocy of those conducting it.</P>
    <P>What is a man in the North of Ireland to think on reading that a lady from Chicago, who does not know any Irish and never will learn any Irish, is being brought over here at colossal expense to advise us on what the Irish public attitudes to the Irish language are?  It is situation which Jonathan Swift might have invented.  Nobody with a lesser degree of satirical imagination than he could possibly have invented it.  Yet this Government has made it a reality.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of thing that Senator Horgan should be directing his fire against and not against this relatively innocuous section which, I think, will not make any difference either way.  His criticisms should be directed against the methods and objectives which are irrational and unreal and are supported by a great number of time-serving hypocrites who have made the Irish language a hissing and a by-word.  It is for that reason, and not for the language itself, that people such as Senator Horgan feel they must offer an apology to the people in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should begin by saying, in reply to Senator Horgan, that there is no question of section 4 being drafted for the purpose of giving expression to vague aspirations.  The section places a definite onus on An <Col N="1754" /> tÚdarás and was drafted with that intention in mind.  It was drafted in such a manner as to endeavour, apart from any other consideration, to get as much co-operation as possible.  I mentioned in reply to the Committee Stage debate that I am personally interested in the revival of the Irish language but I am more anxious to make friends of the language than enemies of the language. For that reason I have stressed on many occasions, and particularly in the Dáil, that I have not claimed at any time that the Irish language belongs to my party.  It belongs to all parties and to all the people of this country.</P>
      <P>Senator Horgan made reference to whether we were concerned with a Gaelic culture or some other type of culture.  May I say that it refers to all types of culture.  If we were to study more carefully the cultural attitudes in the North, not superficially but in depth, we would find that there is no great difference there in relation to attitudes to culture than there is here.</P>
      <P>I agree with some of the remarks made by Senator Kelly, but I would take issue with him on one point.  I recognise fully how essential it is to keep the Irish language alive in the Gaeltacht areas.  This is, in my view, an absolute essential.  As I mentioned in Irish the other day, I played some part in endeavouring to do this by establishing new industries in the Gaeltacht areas so as to enable our people not only to remain at home, but to come back to the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I take issue with his apparent belief that it would be possible to keep alive the language in Carraroe and in the various other Gaeltacht areas without any effort being made to revive the language in the rest of the country.  One of the things that the people in these areas must see clearly before they will accept that there is an obligation on them to keep the language alive is that we in the other parts of Ireland are also interested in the revival of the language, and that we are also interested in having it made a spoken language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into this question of the universities, but I mentioned on previous occasions that it was essential that the Irish language be taught in our <Col N="1755" /> schools so that our young people would have an opportunity of learning their own language.  Then when they became adults, it would be up to them if they would continue to speak it, and I should very much prefer if they did. However, we began at the wrong end of the ladder and, while it was essential that the language should be taught to our young people, more leadership should have been given from the other end of our educational system.</P>
    <P>It surprises me that, as may be seen from an earlier amendment on Committee Stage, Senator Robinson and Senator Horgan appear to have strong misgivings as to the form which section 4 takes in its present wording. On a previous occasion and again today, Senator Horgan cast doubt as to whether restoring the Irish language and preserving and developing the national culture could correctly be described as national aims.  I have no doubt whatsoever in this regard. Successive native Governments have recognised these aspirations as national aims and, as Senator Horgan stated in the course of the debate on Committee Stage, all political parties put the achievement of these aims high in their programmes, although there may have been differences of opinion in the parties regarding the methods which should be employed in order to achieve them. Senator Horgan also mentioned that during the last general election an organised effort was made by a particular group to make this question of the Irish language an issue in the election, and it was abysmal failure.</P>
    <P>I could not accept an amendment which would water down the section or which would appear to do so.  This amendment, if adopted, would relieve An tÚdarás of the duty imposed on them by the section as it stands at present of endeavouring to promote the restoration of the Irish language and the preservation and development of national culture.  It is precisely to give that duty and function to An tÚdarás that the section has found a place in this Bill at all.  To amend the section, as suggested here, to read:</P>
    <P>In performing its functions An tÚdarás shall constantly bear in <Col N="1756" /> mind the future of the Irish language and of Irish culture,</P>
    <P>would be to reduce it to a nebulous provision.  That is not what I, as Minister, wanted.  It is not what the Government intended when the terms of this Bill were being drawn up, and I am sure that it is not what the great majority of the Irish people would wish.</P>

      <P>I shall be very brief. I shall try as best I can to reassure both Senator Kelly and the Minister.  There was not an ounce of apology in what I said about the Irish language, as he will discover when he reads the report. What I had to say was very carefully thought out.  I do not disagree one iota with Senator Kelly about our aims with regard to the Irish language. However, the purpose of my amendment is to try to make it clear that they are our aims, that we are not speaking of people over whom we have no jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>In its present form, the section claims to speak on behalf of people over whom we have no jurisdiction at present.  I have read up the dictionary for the definitions of &ldquo;national&rdquo;, and to the best of my understanding of them, they refer to all the people who are called Irish and who live on this island.  The amendment that we are discussing now is an attempt to make it clear that this claim is being made on behalf of the Government and people only, unfortunately, of the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
      <P>Here we are engaged in legislation and we can on occasion spend hours discussing individual words.  It is important to use precise language and to use language about whose meaning nobody is in any doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is why I object to the practice of describing as national aims something which cannot be proved to be national.  The only basis on which this section makes sense is on the assumption <Col N="1757" /> that the Irish nation and the Twenty-six Counties State are coterminous.  I do not accept this and I tried to frame an amendment to give effect to my belief that they are not coterminous. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 41, after &ldquo;functions&rdquo; to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;if an institution considers any such demand for information unreasonable, it may appeal to the Minister, whose decision shall then be final.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an amendment to section 11, which many regard as conferring far too much power on An tÚdarás.  It can ask from each of the institutions &ldquo;all such information relative to the institution as it may require for the purpose of performing its functions.&rdquo;  In other words, it can ask any information it likes.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the point that An tÚdarás or the <i>ad hoc</i> body and the institutions had already agreed on the form that this information would take. That is not at all correct.  It is one of those half statements, or half truths, that we are constantly plagued with. The negotiations and the discussions between the <i>ad hoc</i> An tÚdarás and the institutions&mdash;I have knowledge of university institutions only&mdash;have centred solely on the type of budgetary information and budgetary control and does not in any way cover the vast field that is open here for all such information. It could be information on any facet of the university, or of the institutions' operations, whether concerned with finance, with statistics or with academic affairs.  There is no limit to the amount of information that could be asked on this.  In addition, there is no limit to the burden that it could place on the institutions about assembling and collecting this information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is right that there should be some limitation to this.  The limitation that we have proposed here is a very reasonable one.  At least the institutions concerned, if they thought the information asked was unreasonable, could <Col N="1758" /> appeal to the Minister and the Minister's decisions would be, of course, final.  It is a very minimal request to ask in the interest of safety.  We should have preferred a more definite statement and a more definite delineation of what is to be covered by the information.  It is obvious from the debate on the Committee Stage that the Minister would not yield to our requirements and our suggestions about limiting the range of information.  As a last resort we are requesting that any institutions which felt that the information sought was unreasonable should be able to submit to the Minister and then let the Minister's decision be final.  Surely this is the only way we can balance this?</P>
    <P>The attitude seems to be, as one goes down the scale of authority that no restriction should be put on a body dealing with those under them.  On the other hand, the hands of those under them are completely tied: they are subject to the bodies over them. This does not seem to be a democratic organisation of affairs.  We pointed out on Second Reading and Committee Stage that certain of the powers of the Government <i>vis-á-vis</i> An tÚdarás put An tÚdarás in a position where they had to depend on the reasonableness of the Government in interpreting the statutory conditions set down here.</P>
    <P>We have now reached the other stage where the institutions under An tÚdarás have to appeal and depend solely on the reasonableness of An tÚdarás in interpreting the blanket authority that is given to them in section 11.  This seems to be very bad law, when it is up to everybody to act reasonably.  Surely the whole purpose of having a law is that it can be used when people are acting unreasonably?  We would not need law courts if everybody acted reasonably.  That is why in this case what we are asking is very little.</P>
    <P>I know the apprehension of the bodies concerned at the abuse of powers that could take place here, especially as it could be carried out by a majority decision of An tÚdarás. Such a decision could well be opposed by all the university members, because they constitute only seven out of 18. Therefore, it could give rise to friction between the two distinct streams of <Col N="1759" /> third level institutions that are encompassed by An tÚdarás&mdash;both the university system and the regional technical colleges.  It is unreasonable that either of those should feel that they were the subject of any type of a majority vote largely engineered by the other section. It would not lead to good relation.  It is the Minister's job to ensure that such should not happen.  By letting the Minister have the final say it could well help to dispel friction between An tÚdarás and their subordinate institutions who are supposed to be autonomous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make just one very brief point in support of Senator Quinlan.  On Committee Stage the Minister made considerable capital of the reasonableness of the Authority-to-be. All that we are proposing in this amendment is that, if a conflict arises about the extent of the Authority's reasonableness, the Authority should not be judge and jury in their own case. The final accountability in this particular instance should rest with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I argued long enough with the Minister about this section on the last day and I do not want to repeat these arguments now.  I should like to make the additional point which perhaps he has not considered.  Section 11 is what would be known to a theoretical lawyer as a <i>lex imperfecta</i> which is a law that imposes duty on somebody but attaches no apparent sanction to a failure to perform that duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, so far as the section goes I cannot see that an institution of higher education will have anything to fear if they simply disobey the requirement which the section imposes on them, unless the Minister and his Department have in mind that the function of section 12 will be used in a penal way to bring to heel an institution which does not supply the necessary information.  I know quite well that the institutions here are reasonable and that the Authority will quite probably consist of reasonable people, and I do not foresee any conflict.  I cannot even sketch out in a hypothetical way a setting in which conflict could arise. <Col N="1760" /> I can imagine in the years to come conflict arising over questions which a university or an institution of higher education might regard as personal and confidential&mdash;something to do entirely with their own staff or students, which they would feel were no business of the Authority.  A conflict might conceivably arise in a case like that.  I think that an institution would be within their powers and within their rights if they say: &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the Authority. If they say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the Authority, section 11 contains no sanction or penalty whatever for imposition on an institution which disobeys their obligations under that section.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is the section which entitles the Authority to make payments to institutions out of the amounts they get from the State in such manner and subject to such conditions as they think fit.  Is the intention that these conditions and this manner is a polite way of saying, in the context of section 11: &ldquo;Until we get the information we require you will not get a penny from us&rdquo;?  I do not want to make a major issue of this as it is possibly something the Minister or his Department have not thought about, but it is something which can arise in the future.  It is foolish to assume that there never will be such a conflict and the House should be told now if the intention is that the obligation of section 11 should be enforced by penalising institutions by withholding funds under section 12.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what Senator Kelly has said.  Perhaps the Minister's answer will be, as Senator Kelly said, that a penalty will be imposed under section 12, by witholding funds, if an institution of higher education refuses to supply information, although there is no specific penalising clause in section 11. That would be a very wrong way of penalising them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An analogy would be the case of a garage who are refused planning permission. They cannot be penalised by the local authority.  They could put up a filling station and erect pumps and a local authority could not withhold a licence for those pumps even though planning permission had not been <Col N="1761" /> granted.  If the institutions of higher education were penalised by the withholding of money the effect would be felt down along the line.  What may be involved here is the withholding of information of a personal nature which An tÚdarás may not have any legal right to.  It may concern a person's domestic life, a political remark or something written to the newspapers. If reasonable information is sought from an institute of higher education and refused there should be some method of penalising that institution other than by recourse to section 12. An tÚdarás, by majority vote, may seek only information concerning the proper running of the Authority and not information of a personal nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have discussed the question of the insertion of the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; on a number of occasions on amendments in the Dáil and on at least one occasion on an amendment in the Seanad.  I pointed out that information which is vital to An tÚdarás for the performance of their functions could be withheld on the grounds that it was not reasonably required and we would have a stalemate.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinlan has added to the original amendments.  I will deal with this presently.  The information which An tÚdarás will require from any institution will be related almost entirely to matters pertaining to the provision, financial and otherwise, to be made for the institution concerned. The manner in which such information will be supplied has, as I already stated here and in the Dáil, been agreed. Nothing more will be involved in relation to further requests for information than the type of information which they have traditionally been supplying to my Department.  I should like to mention that much of the information which was requested by us from these institutions and given to us related to Dáil questions.  I am sure no Member of the Seanad would suggest that we should not be enabled to get this information if it is required by the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mentioned on a number of occasions the somewhat remarkable fact that Senators have taken great <Col N="1762" /> trouble on the one hand to ensure that An tÚdarás be vested with the greatest possible autonomy and freedom and on the other hand they have introduced amendments which would restrict the power and dilute the discretion which the terms of the Bill bestow on An tÚdarás.</P>
    <P>In relation to this amendment I must repeat once again, though Senator Horgan has referred to it, and I make no apology for repeating it, that we must assume that An tÚdarás will be a reputable body who will perform their functions in a responsible and reasonable manner.  If we go on the assumption that this will not be so, we should have to restrict and circumscribe An tÚdarás to such an extent as to make them a completely ineffective body with practically no freedom of action or powers of discretion.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the likelihood postulated by this amendment of An tÚdarás making an unreasonable demand for information on any institution.  I do not accept, therefore, that the amendment of the Bill to provide against such a contingency is necessary.  Even if a situation where there was disagreement could arise, I consider that the decision in relation to this matter should rest with An tÚdarás.  It could obviously be very frustrating to An tUdarás, in theory, if each demand they might make for information could be the subject of appeal to the Minister.  The Senators who have spoken in favour of this amendment have objected to the Minister having such discretionary powers as are given to him in the Bill, such as the designation of an institution or the removal of members from office.</P>
    <P>We have had a number of discussions on the question of autonomy during the course of the various debates on the Bill as related to universities.  I find it extraordinary that any person who would be prepared to speak loud and long advocating autonomy for universities should wish that this would apply only to universities.  We must come back to the point that both the institutions concerned and An tÚdarás will consist of rational beings and there will be no question of their going to the extremes <Col N="1763" /> of looking for information that some Senators appear to visualise.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister be good enough to tell the House whether in making these remarks he is bearing in mind the section which allows the Authority to confer any of their functions on one of their officers or servants?  I see the Minister's point that the kind of Authority which he would visualise being set up this year would consist of reasonable people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I could condense it into one question.  Is the Minister equally confident that the kind of officer or servant who would be given, by delegation, the function either of requisitioning information or of allotting funds would always be equally reasonable?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>This would be for An tÚdarás to ensure.  If an officer of An tÚdarás decided to try to obtain certain information from an institute of higher education and if a complaint were made to An tÚdarás in relation to the type of question he was asking and it was suggested that it was not reasonable, then it would be for An tÚdarás to decide and order him to desist from asking that particular type question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before replying, could I ask the Minister one question. It is a vital one and he has not replied to it.  In the case of an institution failing to comply with the request in section 11, does he think it reasonable that section 12 could be used to penalise that institution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to make any remark on that.  This would be a matter for An tÚdarás but I would not visualise a situation like that arising.  I have already mentioned that I feel there can be no question about the fact that we will be dealing with two rational groups.  I cannot visualise a situation arising where such a type of sanction would be necessary nor would I like to <Col N="1764" /> see that type of sanction having to be applied.  The final decision in relation to this is a matter for An tÚdarás.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand what we are doing here at all if the whole world is made up of rational human beings in all societies.  We cannot even visualise that any of our laws will be transgressed, therefore we are unable to take steps to cope with the situation when the inevitable transgression takes place.  It baffles me what we are doing. It is a complete dereliction of our role as legislators to adopt an ostrich approach, burying our heads in the sands of ignorance and indifference, and failing to comprehend what is likely to occur.</P>
      <P>Every Bill that comes before us has penalties and clauses specifying what happens when powers are transgressed. The Minister's statement as to what types of questions An tUdarás would ask of institutions is an eminently reasonable view given by an eminently reasonable man.  All we are asking is that this very eminently reasonable view given by an eminently reasonable Minister should be available to the institutions concerned if this very unlikely disagreement between reasonable people occurred.  It is as simple as that. I do not think we could ask anything simpler.  We are not in any way yielding the autonomy of the university in that, because there is nothing to yield.  We tried early on to ensure that autonomy was preserved and this is only a second last resort; in other words, asking a reasonable Minister to act as a reasonable umpire in such a situation.  I would be appalled to think that An tÚdarás would use the powers under section 12 to deliberately force the institutions to give information under section 11, information which they considered unnecessary or unreasonable or that undermined their autonomy.  Over the past 12 years if I spent my time answering all the fool questionnaires I received from different bodies I do not think I would have time to do anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I generally consign three-quarters of these fool questionnaires <Col N="1765" /> to the waste paper basket. The world goes on just as well, although I have not spent my time trying to answer those questionnaires and the people at the other end have not spent their time trying to deduce something from the answers they got.  With all those eminently reasonable people about I would not have too much worry if the people concerned were not solely appointees of the Government. In other words, if a large section of An tÚdarás had been nominated by existing institutions, or at least if the Minister were constrained to select the members from some pool that was provided by outside bodies.  I would not be too worried about the fact that reason would prevail if the body was academic in the sense of the University Grants Committee in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I warn the Minister, and he has already been warned by academics, that it was taking quite a gamble to have the one body covering the whole of third-level education, especially with the dangers of tensions arising.  I do not like to use the words &ldquo;ganging up&rdquo;, but that could happen.  I hope this will not occur but it is surely one of the things that we should guard against.  The main irritant is in section 11.  An tÚdarás is primarily a financial body and its incursions into academic affairs should be very limited.  I hope the institutions concerned will be on the watch at all times to ensure that is so.  The question of academic co-ordination in academic affairs is rightly within the province of the Council of Irish Universities which we will probably be legislating for within the next year or two.  I would hope&mdash;since there does not appear to be any chance of changing the Minister's mind in this no matter what we say&mdash; that within the next two years, when we will be looking at the final shape of the institutions and when we may be dealing with a different Minister and even a different Government, at that stage we will have had time to have had second thoughts on this and devise a more forward-looking practical system of balances and checks than we have got here.  I hope, above all, that we will see that section 11 will be rewritten and that the role of the other bodies, including the Council of <Col N="1766" /> Irish Universities, will be recognised and given adequate power.  Did I understand the Minister to say that, in regard to Dáil questions, the procedure is that he will have to contact An tÚdarás and that body, will contact the individual institutions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

I am sure that the happy relations which have prevailed up to this between the Minister and the institutions concerned will continue and that the institutions will co-operate with the Minister in providing answers to&mdash;I will not say fool questions on the level of the fool questionnaires that have been asked&mdash;questions that are very often of doubtful value.  We are on the Report Stage.  We have explored every avenue to try to get the Minister to help in this.  Short of pressing the amendment I do not see what we can do. Maybe in pressing it we might get some of the Members to walk across the party line and really ensure that we do not altogether become an assembly that bases its legislation simply on the nonexistence of evil in the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 43, to delete &ldquo;institutions of higher education&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;higher education and research&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be very brief about this, even though I believe it is a very important amendment.  After many hours of discussion, argument about this matter is now focused on a particular point. When we discussed this on Committee Stage, another amendment, in fact a <Col N="1767" /> similar amendment in my name, was rejected by the Minister.  In his rejection of that amendment the Minister made considerable play of the fact that he needed two votes in order to supply the money necessary for higher education in this country.  Therefore he could not possibly substitute the word &ldquo;amount&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;amounts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If I may at this stage seek the indulgence of the house I should like to amend my own amendment, by deleting the words &ldquo;and research&rdquo; from the words I propose to substitute in line 43.  I am doing this because I accept, slightly unwillingly, the assurance of the Minister that it is not actually necessary to specify research. What I am trying to do now in this amendment is to remove any possible shadow of doubt about the earmarking of grants in the various institutions.  We are all agreed about the subject matter of this.  We are all agreed that there will be no earmarking of specific amounts for specific institutions.  What we differ about is the wording of the legislation which brings this into effect.  It is my contention that to include the word &ldquo;institution&rdquo;, as is included in this section, leaves it open to a Minister for Education at a future time to earmark grants no matter what the present Minister for Education may say, no matter how great the amount, which indeed I accept completely.  The Minister has gone to considerable lengths to spell out for us the procedure he feels sure will be adopted between the Authority and the institutions before the final agreed list of allocations is published as an appendix in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>However, the section as it stands is still sufficiently ambiguous to allow a Minister for Education to override this and that is why I put in this amendment. It seems to me to meet every single one of the objections to the original amendments which were advanced by the Minister during the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Horgan dealt briefly with this amendment and I will also deal briefly with it.  I thought I had dealt with this particular matter on the <Col N="1768" /> Committee Stage.  This amendment would mean that An tOireachtas would provide money to be paid as grants by An tÚdarás for higher education and research but not necessarily to institutions of higher education.  I would like to point out, as I certainly have done on previous occasions, that the whole intent and purpose of this section is to make moneys available for payments to institutions which are recognised as institutions of higher education in accordance with the provisions of this Bill.  What the Senator would appear to wish is that An tÚdarás would have liberty or discretion to make payments in respect of higher education and research otherwise than to recognised institutions.  If that is so, then he is suggesting something which, as I explained on a previous occasion, is in conflict with the concept which is basic to this Bill, and for that reason I could not accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it hard to understand why the Minister takes this attitude.  If we look at the amendment and look at section 12 (1), this is concerned with payment from the Oireachtas to An tÚdarás.  The Minister has said that the purpose of the whole Bill is that An tÚdarás shall pay to institutions and not otherwise.  In fact what the subsection and the amendment are concerned with here is not the manner of payment by An tÚdarás but the manner of payment to An tÚdarás. It would not at all affect the position of An tÚdarás if the amendment were accepted.  The Minister seems to think that the only way in which one can ensure that An tÚdarás pays only to institutions of higher education is to make sure that only money which is earmarked for individual institutions shall be paid to An tÚdarás.  If it is necessary to make it clear that An tÚdarás can pass money on only to other institutions of higher education designated by the Minister, not to other institutions or to individuals, then I am quite sure Senator Horgan and the other Senators would have no objection to the recommittal of section 12 for the purpose of making that clear either in subsection (1) or in subsection (2) or in the new subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister appears to take the <Col N="1769" /> view that, in order to ensure the payments made by An tÚdarás should be to institutions, which is a matter for common agreement, it is necessary that these funds should be earmarked all along the line.  It is against this earmarking by the Oireachtas that the amendment is directed and it appears to me that what the Minister has said does not meet the case in any sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Horgan's amendment for a slightly different reason from those which he himself has given, uncontentious, I hope.  There are institutions which are unlikely ever to be designated as institutions of higher education in which research at an advanced level is carried on.  Two which I have in mind are geographically very near this building, one being the National Museum and the other being the National Gallery.  I wonder if the Minister would consider that Senator Horgan's amendment has the additional virtue that it would make it possible for the Authority, if this amendment or something like it were adopted, to allocate from its general funds grants to people of graduate status working either in the Museum or in the Gallery who needed financial support for the completion of particular projects.</P>
      <P>The Gallery has been splendidly restored and anybody who follows the way in which the Government has been working in cultural matters will have to acknowledge that.  In other regards the Government's record has not been so good, and the Museum, as the Minister well knows, is in a state of continuing neglect.  Part of the complaint which has been made on behalf of the people who work in the Museum is that their facilities for research are so limited, and they are limited for financial reasons.  It would be an additional virtue in Senator Horgan's amendment, one to which he himself may not attach much importance, if it were made possible for An tÚdarás um Ard Oideachas to dip into its pocket also in order to assist individual research projects, notwithstanding the fact that they are not being carried out within the walls of recognised institutions of higher education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support very strongly the amendment put forward by Senator Horgan.  The section as it stands is a most ambiguous one; in other words, it is capable of the legal interpretation that the Minister must approve of the individual amounts for the institutions of higher education concerned.  The Minister has stated again and again that that is not his intention and we accept that, but in ten years' time if a new Minister for Education were, under this section, to take it that not alone had he to approve the totals but also the individuals amounts, there is nothing in this Bill that would in any way prevent that action being taken.</P>
      <P>We are all familiar with the court cases in recent years on the constitutionality of various Acts and in none of these cases was there any reference made to the pious aspirations of the then Minister as the Bill was being piloted through the Houses, nor indeed to any statement from either the Government or the Opposition benches during the passage of the Bill.  All that remains of this Bill when it leaves the House is the printed word and the interpretation that lawyers can put on that word.  After it has left the House my interpretation of it, Senator Ó Maoláin's interpretation of it or the Minister's interpretation of it, will all count for nought.  It is amazing that after three weeks' debate we are still unable to get satisfactory statements of what the Minister actually intends to do under section 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Horgan's amendment would remove that.  It would mean that the amount related only to the totals for higher education not for institutions of higher education.  I think that is a very positive and definite step forward and one that would make it much harder for a Minister in the future to revert to what has been the practice up to this of the Minister for Education deciding, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, on the grants being made to the individual institutions.  If the Minister wishes to ensure that that position does not obtain again, and if he wishes to see to the requests from all quarters that that position should not obtain again, then he has an opportunity here in Senator Horgan's <Col N="1771" /> amendment to do so.  It is a very poor tribute to Seanad Éireann and to its power of discussion and deliberation if, at the end of three weeks' talk, we are still awaiting our first change in the most perfect Bill that was ever drafted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment very strongly. As I said on the Committee Stage, section 12 is perhaps the most important section in the Bill.  In the light of the attitude of the Minister and in spite of numerous arguments put forward he appears to be very unwilling to accept my amendment.  Now the demand has been cut down to the minimum, by omitting the word &ldquo;institutions&rdquo; here for the reasons given.  I would add to the reasons given by other Senators by just pointing to section 10, to the recommendations of State financial provision for higher education and research, and to the wording of that section.  Subsections (1) and (2) of that section read:</P>
      <P>(1) An tÚdarás shall assess amounts of State financial provision, both current and capital, which it recommends for higher education and research or for any part thereof, either in relation to current or future periods.</P>
      <P>(2) In making assessments under this section in respect of institutions of higher education, An tÚdarás shall have regard to the accommodation capacity for students of each institution...</P>
      <P>Is it not logical to continue that in section 12 by having, in subsection (1):</P>
      <P>There shall be paid to An tÚdarás out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas such amounts for higher education and research as may be approved by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Then in subsection (2) you have</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...any payment to an institution which An tÚdarás makes under the amounts received under the foregoing subsection shall be made in <Col N="1772" /> such manner and subject to such conditions as An tÚdarás thinks fit.</P>
    <P>This does not go the whole way to meet the many points that have been made on section 12 but it does make the point that the Minister can provide the amounts for current and the amounts for capital expenditure, that these amounts will be for higher education and it will be An tÚdarás that will decide in what way these amounts will be distributed to the institutions of higher education.  This meets what the Minister has said on the Committee Stage in this House, and he ought to be willing to accept this amendment, even if he might not consider it necessary, he might consider that the arguments being put forward were inherent in the Bill.  When the university Senators and other Senators have so forcefully argued it, he might concede this point and accept the amendment for the deletion of the word &ldquo;institutions&rdquo; from section 12.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, the Official Report of the discussion on this section on last Thursday is not available so I have only my notes.  Senators seem to be confusing this issue.  As I recollect it, it was explained that the intention here was to work on two global amounts, one for current expenditure on higher education and one for capital expenditure.  The term &ldquo;institutions&rdquo; refers to all of those institutions which would be approved by An tÚdarás.  It is not one institution and it is not higher education; it is institutions which would come within the ambit of higher education.  Unless I am misreading this amendment, to accept &ldquo;higher education&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;institutions of higher education&rdquo; would alter the entire situation.  You have got to have the word &ldquo;institutions&rdquo; here bearing in mind that what was proposed was the setting out of two global amounts for higher education, one current and the other capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This type of institution does not apply in Great Britain in relation to the allocation of grants by the University Grants Committee.  The universities in Great Britain are just as concerned with their autonomy as the universities here.  What is intended here is that all <Col N="1773" /> the institutions of higher education should be included.  The amendment would upset this whole situation and would eliminate the institutions.</P>

      <P>There are two global amounts, one for capital and one for current expenditure, but if this amendment was accepted An tÚdarás would not have to account to the Minister for the way in which the money was spent. It is important that the section should remain as it is so that An tÚdarás can report back with regard to the amount of money each institution will have received from the two global amounts. This amendment would provide An tÚdarás with a means of withholding from the Minister the actual amount that each institution received.  The Minister for Education, the Minister for Finance and ourselves are entitled to know where the money is going. For that reason I oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>I find myself in a difficulty in considering this amendment in relation to the mechanics of the <Col N="1774" /> operation.  An tÚdarás will consult with institutions of higher education and research concerning the amounts they need.  Before An tÚdarás consults with any of those institutions it must recognise them as institutions within its sphere of influence.  Having recognised them, it then consults with the institutions, make up its mind about the total global sum required by all these bodies for capital and current expenditure, and then presents the bill to the Minister who then consults with the Minister for Finance and decides how much of this sum can be made available.  The sum decided upon must be distributed, in turn, by An tÚdarás for the purposes of supporting higher education and research, but surely it can only do this by giving it to institutions. I cannot see any other way.  If Senator Horgan can explain that mechanical difficulty to me I would be in a better position to make up my mind on the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to be able to clear up the mechanical difficulty for Senator Jessop.  It seems to me we are looking at the same problem from different ends of the telescope.  Before clearing up the mechanical difficulty I should like to isolate what has been said in terms of three issues.  There are three issues involved here.  First of all, do we need the word &ldquo;amount&rdquo; or &ldquo;amounts&rdquo;?  Secondly, do we need the words &ldquo;and research&rdquo; and thirdly do we need the word &ldquo;institutions&rdquo;?  We have conceded the Minister's argument, and this is what I believe debate is about, on the first two points.  However, we are sticking to the third.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For several reasons I am astonished by the worries on the other side about the possible disappearance of the word &ldquo;institutions&rdquo;.  As Senator Dooge pointed out very adequately, this section is in two subsections.  The first subsection talks about the transfer of money from the Oireachtas to An tÚdarás and the second subsection talks about the transfer of money from An tÚdarás to the institutions.  A certain amount of alarm has been expressed about the possibility of An tÚdarás finding themselves with all this money for higher education and not <Col N="1775" /> having any institutions to which to give it.  If Senator Brugha or Senator Jessop can find a way of establishing a system of higher education which dispenses with institutions we shall all be in his debt, not the least of whom would be the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I find it impossible to conceive that the money could be spent in any other way.  There is, on the other hand, the point which was made by Senator Kelly.  It is not a point which had occurred to me but it is one which I am delighted to be able to underwrite.  I see this as a major possibility for the Authority in its work of supporting and financing higher education and research generally.</P>
    <P>What saddened me most was the Minister's argument in an attempted rebuttal of my amendment.  Having spent three-quarters of the afternoon <Col N="1776" /> defending the reasonableness of the members of An tÚdarás the Minister now replies to the amendment by suggesting that if the word &ldquo;institutions&rdquo; was removed from the subsection An tÚdarás would spend their £15 million like a sailor on a drunken spree. He cannot have it both ways.  We had discussion earlier on the question of the reasonableness of An tÚdarás in asking for certain information from institutions.  Whatever about the reasonableness of An tÚdarás in that connection, I would say that the kind of situation which the Minister described, in his attempt to rebut my amendment, is a one-in-a-million situation which would probably never arise.  It is a reflection on An tÚdarás and quite abhorrent.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1778" /> In page 3, line 48, after &ldquo;and&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;new developments shall be&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If the Minister will see the logic in the amendments we are proposing it will shorten the proceedings very much. We return to section 12 and to the very dangerous type of earmarking or attachment of conditions that is allowed to An tÚdarás under section 12, subsection (2).  This is something that is not accepted under the university grants committee in England.  It is accepted that it is legitimate to attach conditions to new developments.  However, if we are going on the theory that all men are reasonable and that all institutions are reasonable, we do not need conditions attached to anything.  To be a little more down to earth than that, it is reasonable enough that conditions can be attached to new developments.  The Minister has gone on record as saying that An tÚdarás would not attach conditions except where these were reasonable, in other words, indicate new developments.</P>
    <P>We are particularly worried about the fact that the Minister did not commit himself, and neither does the Bill commit itself, on the question of whether sanctions under section 12 would be applied to an institution if it did not comply with a request from An tÚdarás under section 11 which it probably thought unreasonable.  It is now doubly necessary that this safeguard should be put in.  All we ask is that we should insert the words: &ldquo;and new developments shall be subject to such conditions as An tÚdarás think fit,&rdquo; limiting the attachment of conditions to new developments.</P>
    <P>That is reasonable and the Minister would agree that that is what he has in mind.  At no time in the past has the Minister's Department sought to attach conditions to what was already going on.  It would be a very retrograde step to allow An tÚdarás even the possibility of doing this.  Consequently, in order to facilitate the Leader of the House, in his anxiety to finish this, I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment.  It could not be more reasonable or more self-explanatory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I cannot accept that this amendment is <Col N="1779" /> reasonable.  The amendment would deny An tÚdarás the authority to make conditions in connection with payments to institutions, except in relation to new developments.  In the administration of grants to institutions, An tÚdarás must of course have regard to the general and to the specific functions assigned to them under this Bill.  In the matter of attaching conditions to payments of grants to institutions regard must be had in particular to the general function of assisting in the co-ordination of State investment in higher education.  An tÚdarás must also have regard to the duty laid on them in section 10 in regard to the maintenance of a reasonable balance in the distribution of the total number of students as between institutions.  In other words, it must in general take a global view of the development of higher education and relate the general demand and need for higher education to the demands and proposals of the individual institutions.</P>
      <P>One wonders, in connection with this amendment, what would be understood by new developments.  If, for instance, an institution decided to substantially increase its intake of students into a particular faculty without regard to the fact that the existing output of graduates from that faculty was greater than what the economy could absorb, would this be classed as a new development?  I should be inclined to say that it would not.  Therefore, in making grants to the institution in question, An tÚdarás, if the section were amended as suggested, would have no authority to specify any condition in relation to the expansion of a particular faculty beyond what would be reasonable.</P>
      <P>In other words, An tÚdarás would be inhibited in such an instance in fulfilling their function of assisting in the co-ordination of State investment in higher education.  The same argument would hold for the running down of a particular faculty beyond what would be desirable.  Again, in regard to capital grants, An tÚdarás, though they would assess the grants on the basis of certain specific projects, would be inhibited from requiring that the grants should be spent on such projects.  I went into this particular matter in some detail on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1780" /> It would be normal for An tÚdarás to make a condition in relation to recurrent grants for an institution that certain sums within the total grant should be spent on, for example, the necessary renewal of equipment, repairs, adaptations and so on and that payments for these items would be made only on receipt of vouchers for the expenditure incurred on them.  This amendment would not allow for this, although it is a practice which has long existed in the administration of recurrent grants to the university colleges and has generally been accepted as reasonable. For these reasons I cannot accept this amendment.  I regard it as another bid to weaken the status of An tÚdarás.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry we have not got what the Minister set out before us because it contains many frightening suggestions as to how An tÚdarás might interfere with what are regarded as an autonomous body.  I take it that what the Minister said about the running down of a certain faculty below a prescribed level could be attached to the condition.  In other words, the Minister is now saying that An tÚdarás can attach a condition that instruction in such a subject should be discontinued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not argue that particular point with the Senator, but that is not what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The opposite is that if the running down of a faculty below a prescribed level occurred, An tÚdarás could put in a condition that such a department shall not go below a prescribed level.  Surely, if this is allowed, it is equally admissible that the corresponding requirements of a faculty should be eliminated altogether?  That opens up some frightening possibilities of real interference with the right of universities to decide on their courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No outside body should have the right to remove faculties.  One of the cardinal points in the NUI/TCD agreement was that the universities concerned were not prepared to grant that right to anybody.  They regarded it as a key factor in maintaining university autonomy.  The more we go into this, <Col N="1781" /> the more dangerous it becomes.  All we have is the assurance that An tÚdarás will be composed of reasonable men. That is a very weak safeguard.  However, since Senator Dooge's amendment No. 7 is more explicit, I will withdraw amendment No. 6 and later support amendment No. 7.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to add to section 12 the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  No condition may be attached to a payment by An tÚdarás under subsection (2) of this section which would have the effect of forcing an institution of higher education to undertake any activity which was not the subject of a request for State subvention by that institution under section 8 of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment would have the effect that An tÚdarás could not attach such conditions to any grant of money which would have the effect of forcing an institution of higher education to do something which, in their own academic opinion, was an activity which it was not desirable for them to undertake. We suffer from the disadvantage of not having available the printed proceedings of the debate on Committee Stage. However, it is my recollection on that occasion the Minister stated quite categorically that no institution of higher education would be forced to undertake any activity against their will.  This amendment aims to write that opinion expressed by the Minister into the Statute.  There appears to be no difference of opinion between us.  It may well be that the difference between us is that my degree of anxiety in regard to this matter is greater than the Minister's.  My estimate of the probability of something undesirable happening in this regard is higher than the Minister's estimate of that probability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is the very minimum that can be asked if the autonomy of the institutions of higher education has any real meaning&mdash;that conditions may only be attached to those matters for <Col N="1782" /> which they have sought State support. The argument has been continuously made that because there is a degree of State support there must be very close control.  This argument is made on the basis that this is democratic.  If we take heed, not of the forms of democracy but of the inner purpose of democracy, we may well find that to exercise close control over institutions of higher education is a very undemocratic thing.</P>
    <P>The basis of our western parliamentary democracy, as we practice it, is that men living in freedom will live fuller lives and will be more productive, economically, socially and intellectually, than if they live lives under close control.  That is the basis of our western parliamentary democracy.  It is the application of that principle to our democratic institutions, to institutions of higher education, that gives rise to the whole principle of the autonomy of such bodies.  It is a principle which, of course, is limited and circumscribed; but it is in danger of being circumscribed out of existence.  If we look not to the forms of democracy, not to the particular political institutions that are set up in regard to political matters, but at the fundamental beliefs that we have that freedom is a proper habitat of man, then we might see the matter in a different light.</P>
    <P>I feel that any suggestion, such as was implicit in an intervention by Senator Eoin Ryan on the Committee Stage, that conditions could be attached to grants for certain purposes in order to make the universities do something else or make other institutions of higher education do something which they felt was not proper for them to do, is highly undesirable and this is the reason why this amendment has been put down.  The force of the amendment is clear.  There is no need for me to debate the matter at great length, except to say that this amendment is an embodiment of an opinion expressed by the Minister on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Dooge has said, we both suffer from the disadvantage of not having before us the printed debate.  Nevertheless I do not differ from him in what he has stated. What I said was that I could not <Col N="1783" /> visualise An tÚdarás withholding grants in order to force an institution of higher education to do something they did not want to do.  This amendment would restrain An tÚdarás from attaching any condition to a payment to a particular institution, whether in the form of capital or current grant, which would force the institution to undertake an activity which it did not wish to undertake and in respect of which it had made no application for State financial aid through An tÚdarás.</P>
      <P>I do not mean this in any disparaging way, but this appears to me to be a manifestation of the bogey man complex which some people seem to have in relation to An tÚdarás.  No reasonable person could envisage An tÚdarás threatening to withhold grants from an institution because that institution was unwilling to take on some activity which An tÚdarás might wish it to take on.  Here again I am being asked to accept an amendment which is based on the assumption that An tÚdarás would be unreasonable, irresponsible and dictatorial.  I refuse to accept this and if I were to accept it I do not think it would be possible to ensure by legislation that a body which was fundamentally unreasonable and irresponsible could be got to act in a rational and satisfactory manner.  I am convinced that An tÚdarás could not function except in an atmosphere of consultation and mutual respect.  If anything were calculated to ensure that this particular type of atmosphere would not exist, it is proposed in an amendment such as this.  For those reasons I regret that I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the distinguished father of the present Cathaoirleach who said in this House that nobody had the right, whether in a fit of absentmindedness or to flatter fanatics, to forge an instrument of tyranny and say that it would never be used.  It seems to me that that thought is a similar one to that which we, on this side of the House, have been trying for three weeks to get across to the Minister and his advisers, namely, no one has the right in a fit of absentmindedness <Col N="1784" /> or otherwise to forge a legal instrument, which is what a Bill will be, of entirely erratic and unpredictable application and simply say that it will never be abused.  We have not got that right in this House and the Minister ought not to put the thing forward on that basis.</P>
      <P>The Minister has behaved in this House on this occasion and on other occasions&mdash;I hope he will not mind my saying this&mdash;with complete politeness towards everybody.  He has not annoyed anybody and he has not been responsible for angry words, and that is something which does not occur with every Minister.  I do not like speaking hard words to him for that reason, but he has failed&mdash;whether because his officials have advised him in that direction or because of an innate disinclination to take advice from the other side&mdash;to meet the point, which in one form or other has been put forward from this side of the House on many sections, that the Bill as it stands will work quite well if it is operated by reasonable people such as the Minister envisages in the first instance, but will work very badly if its operation is entrusted in the future to unreasonable people, and we cannot foresee what the future holds.  Our job, as legislators is to make sure, so far as we can do it, that the legislation we pass is watertight and leaves no room for abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he could not visualise a situation arising in which the powers of the Authority under section 12 would be used in order to force a university or other institution of higher education to do something which it did not want to do.  If he cannot visualise that situation arising, what does he visualise in the words &ldquo;subject to such conditions&rdquo;?  Surely the word &ldquo;conditions&rdquo; automatically implies and calls to mind that there may be a conflict between the university or other institution and the Authority?  There may be a situation in which the university states: &ldquo;We do not want to do this thing; we do not feel we are able to do it; we are not equipped to do it; we do not think it has an educational value.&rdquo;  The Authority says: &ldquo;Well, you are damn well going to have to do it and if you will not do it <Col N="1785" /> you are not going to get the money.&rdquo; I can see no other way of reading the words &ldquo;subject to such conditions as An tÚdarás thinks fit&rdquo; other than to understand them as contemplating a possible conflict, maybe not an illtempered conflict but a potential or incipient conflict of opinion between an institution and the Authority.</P>
    <P>I cannot therefore see the reasonableness of the Minister's inability to visualise the section being used to force an institution to do something which they do not wish to do when the section seems to me patently to be designed for that very purpose.  I do not say it is designed for the purpose of bullying an institution, but it is clearly designed for the purpose of making it necessary for institutions to apply funds in a certain way and subject to certain conditions, and that necessarily implies that their freedom to spend the money as they think best themselves is to be limited.</P>
    <P>I have never put forward in this House or elsewhere the idea that a university should be an absolutely independent island and that it should spend the people's money as it thinks fit.  I do not believe in absolute university autonomy and I have never put forward that point, but the university will not be any good to the nation unless it has a sphere of independent judgment within its own proper area which is the area of deciding what is an appropriate standard, what were appropriate subjects, what was an appropriate discipline, what would make a good degree course and what would not, what are the appropriate admission standards and so on.  These are the proper subjects for university autonomy.</P>
    <P>This subsection, and it is not the only subsection in this Bill which is open to abuse, makes it possible for the Authority to impose on the paying of money some such condition as: &ldquo;We will pay you this money but on condition that you devote a proportion of it to the provision of, let us say, degrees, courses or diplomas, perhaps night classes or part-time courses&rdquo;, <Col N="1786" /> which the institution does not think educationally worthwhile.</P>
    <P>This is what I believe Senator Dooge had in mind when he spoke some time ago, although he did not use quite the same words.  It is an important point and while I might not have drafted Senator Dooge's amendment in quite the same way&mdash;we can all differ as regards draftsmanship&mdash;the point which is implicit in Senator Dooge's and Senator Belton's amendment is a solid point and I am disappointed if the Minister brushes it aside as being of no importance, as he has brushed aside every amendment put forward from this side of the House since these debates began.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see it, this is just another of those amendments, first, to take power away from the Minister and give it to An tÚdarás, than to take the power from An tÚdarás and give it to the faculties themselves.  This would be a very bad thing.  The faculties could say what they wanted to do and not An tÚdarás, which is the body responsible for higher education.</P>
      <P>If An tÚdarás feels the faculty should do something, it should have the power to request the faculty to do it. If this amendment were implemented and the faculty got their money, they could say, &ldquo;There is one project we do not want money for&rdquo;&mdash;for example, as Senator Kelly has said, a night class&mdash;&ldquo;We feel that we should not carry out that&rdquo;, although An tÚdarás, which is responsible for higher education, feel that it should be done.</P>
      <P>In that way this section would be taking away power from An tÚdarás. Even though the intentions may be the best, a situation could arise in the future which would have a detrimental effect and would cause quite an amount of friction where the faculty could say to An tÚdarás: &ldquo;We do not want to do this&rdquo; and An tÚdarás would have no power to insist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason I suggest that this amendment should not be accepted. The second as written is explicit enough. It gives sufficient power to An tÚdarás. The Minister has given an undertaking that he feels nobody will try to force anything through.  It has always been an accepted thing in our legislation that <Col N="1787" /> you take the power, you take the big stick, but you do not use it.  This type of legislation has worked very well over the years.  If the amendment were accepted it would give too much power to the faculties themselves and take it away from An tÚdarás, which would be a dangerous situation and could lead to friction if a certain situation arose. For that reason I would support rejecting this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Crinion really summed it up when he said: &ldquo;The Minister has given an undertaking that he feels this would not be used to force anything on anybody&rdquo;. What kind of a kindergarten are we turning into as a Legislature?  This has been the approach against the very reasonable amendments that we have advocated all through.  We are not prepared to accept undertakings from a Minister about his feelings.  The Supreme Court is not going to consider the undertakings given by a Minister in the Seanad much less the undertakings that he gives us about his feelings, which must be the lowest form of undertaking one can give.  Such an inconsequential statement is beyond me. We are told to accept that nobody will abuse a section, that a section will not be used outside its normal use.  The most glaring example of this was five years ago when, as a result of agitation by farming organisations, the Government eventually conceded an extra payment on milk.</P>

      <P>It shall be nameless as to what they wished to do but the fact is that legislation was used, has been used, and will be used again for purposes that are not in keeping with the original intentions of it but for purposes that come within a cold, legal analysis of what the Bill says.  We are trying to prevent this.  All we are left with is the Bill.  The proceedings of the Seanad stay behind.  In any case nobody ever reads them.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> has decided to put a ban on those.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to meet us at least some part of the way on this.  Let us feel that we have done some good here by devoting study and time to the problems at hand and that at least we can claim that there must be some value in the ideas we have come up with, having debated this Bill for three weeks.  This Bill is headed to set a record as the first major Bill on a non-political issue that has come before the Seanad, and it is about to leave it unchanged in any way.  I do not know whether that is a tribute to the Minister and his infallible advisers or if it means that we on this side have not been cogent enough in advocating our amendments. In any case it is a poor show by any standards.</P>

      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with this amendment. We cannot accept the undertakings which have been given by the Minister because, as Senator Quinlan has rightly pointed out, these will not be accepted by the Supreme Court. The mere fact that the Minister is reduced to giving undertakings that the section does not mean what we think it is intended to mean is, in itself, an argument in favour of changing the section so that there will be no need for <Col N="1789" /> this Minister or any other Minister to have to give this type of undertaking in relation to any section in the Bill.  It should be copperfastened in such a way as to eliminate any doubt as to how the section may be used or abused by An tÚdarás or by anybody else.</P>

      <P>How does the mover of this amendment reconcile it with section 3 of the Bill?  Surely An tÚdarás has obligations not merely to say they do not approve of certain things but also that they have obligations to take a positive attitude in suggesting to institutions that they do certain things? If An tÚdarás is merely to have what amounts to a kind of veto on certain things it cannot properly fulfil its functions.  It must be in a position from time to time, in my view, to suggest to institutions that they should consider doing certain things.  It must be in a position, if necessary, to say that unless an institution undertakes to do something which An tÚdarás feels is necessary to be done if they are to fulfil their functions, then An tÚdarás will have no power to ensure that its functions are in fact fulfilled.  So it seems to me that this amendment would prevent An tÚdarás from properly fulfilling its positive functions.</P>

      <P>Firstly, I should like to refer to some of the Minister's comments.  The Minister said that the Authority set up under this Bill will only make the contribution to the welfare of the country that it is capable of if it has mutual respect.  He went on to say that he thought nothing could be more harmful to mutual respect than the adoption of an amendment of this type.  Mutual respect?  We are talking here about mutual respect: we are talking about a job that has got to be done by a number of people working in co-operation, and if the universities have continually to depend on the forbearance of An tÚdarás for a modicum and a residium of what has been the traditional freedom of universities, then it will be extremely difficult for this mutual respect to have any real meaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the position in this country that has been true in many countries. <Col N="1790" /> It was considered that, once certain principles had been determined, the public advantage was best served by leaving it to institutions of higher education themselves to determine what should be done and how it should be done.  There are powers in this Bill for An tÚdarás to say to every institution of higher education what it should do and how it should do it.  This is undesirable.  The Minister in his comment said that the members of An tÚdarás will be reasonable people.  He finds it difficult to imagine that they will at any time attach conditions to a function which would force any institution of higher education to do something against its will.  His view is not shared by Senator Crinion.  His view is not shared by Senator Ryan.  They have no difficulty in imagining this happening. So far from having difficulty in imagining that an institution of higher education would be forced to do something against its will, they would like to see it forced to do something against its will.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the persons whom we will appoint to An tÚdarás will be reasonable people and I agree that when the Government appointed Senator Ryan, a Member of the Seanad, to the National University, they appointed a reasonable person to that body.  But we find this reasonable person who we might think, since he has already been nominated by the Government to an academic body, is perhaps a prototype of those who but for a certain section in this Bill would be nominated to An tÚdarás.  Yet Senator Ryan has said here today, as he said the last day, that he does not feel An tÚdarás can carry out its duties under section 3 unless it can exercise a sanction so that institutions of higher education are not merely left in the position of refusing money if they do not think the conditions are right, not asking for money if they do not think the activity is appropriate, but leaving these institutions in the position that they will carry out all of their activities to the ruling and in accordance with the writ of the Higher Education Authority or they will not be allowed to carry them out at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1791" /> As I say, we have on the one hand the assurance of the Minister that this amendment would do harm to mutual respect and be unnecessary because these things cannot be envisaged.  We had Senator Ryan saying that these things are needed, that these things are an integral part of the Bill and are called for by section 3.  We have the revealing phrase from Senator Crinion who says that we have in most legislation &ldquo;the big stick&rdquo;&mdash;and Senator Crinion wants the big stick in this Bill. He does not want this amendment passed because it would remove one of the cudgels which are being placed in the hands of An tÚdarás by this particular Bill.  It may be that there is a genuine divergence of opinion between the Minister and Government Senators in this House in this regard but there are certainly two points of view.  How are we to be sure which point of view is to prevail among the nominees of the Government who become members of An tÚdarás?</P>

      <P>Would the Senator agree to take amendments Nos. 8 and 9 together?  They seem to relate to similar topics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I moved amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 5 to delete lines 50 to 52 inclusive and substitute:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) The Chairman of An tÚdarás may at any time resign his office as <Col N="1792" /> chairman by letter sent to the Minister, and the resignation shall, unless it is previously withdrawn in writing, take effect at the commencement of the meeting of An tÚdarás held next after An tÚdarás has been informed by the Minister of the resignation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 is concerned with the manner of resignation from An tÚdarás.  Amendment No. 9 is concerned with the manner of resignation of an ordinary member of An tÚdarás.  I raised on Committee Stage the question of the difficulties which might be created by leaving the provision for resignation in the form in which it is in the Bill at the moment.</P>
    <P>At the moment the provision in regard to the resignation of both the chairman and an ordinary member is the same.  They may resign by a letter addressed to the Minister and the resignation shall take effect when the letter is received.  I take it that this means&mdash;recall the Ministers and Secretaries Act&mdash;that when this letter is stamped in the registry of the Department of Education the position then is that the resignation is effective There is not even a guarantee here that the resignation must be received by the Minister in his personal capacity before the resignation becomes effective.  This is undesirable.  Firstly, if somebody who has been appointed to a post as a result of a Government decision is to resign from this post, the resignation should be in concordance with the manner of his appointment.</P>
    <P>At the very least these resignations should reach the Minister and, as I said the last day, I think it reasonable to allow a certain time so that the Minister could, if he so wished, discuss with an individual the reasons for the resignation and, in the event of a resignation being on a point of principle, to see if some accord could not be reached which might make this resignation unnecessary.  This is particularly true in the case of the chairman and accordingly I have in amendment No. 8 put down the resignation procedure which was embodied in the Nuclear Energy Bill.  It allows for the fact that a chairman's resignation would be notified <Col N="1793" /> to the board and would become effective following its notification to the board by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the case of an ordinary member the difficulty about resignations becoming absolutely operative in what might be a premature fashion was met in the Nuclear Energy Bill by the form which is here in amendment No. 9.  It may well be that nine out of ten resignations will be for genuine ill health.  Nevertheless, if there are to be resignations on points of principle, or even resignations on such grounds as overwork or something of this type, they should be allowed time for reconsideration, time for discussion.  That is what is being provided for in these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The sections as they stand in the Bill are much superior to the amendments.  I have already discussed this on Committee Stage with Senator Dooge.  If the chairman should for any reason wish to resign it may be assumed that he would have given the matter serious consideration before committing his decision to writing and sending it to the Minister.  If his reasons for resigning were such that he might withdraw his resignation after discussion with the Minister or with someone else, during the interim period which the adoption of this amendment would allow him a man of the calibre of the chairman of An tÚdarás would surely have discussions before writing out his resignation and sending it to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Senators have allowed themselves the luxury of proposing amendments to guard against ill-intentioned Ministers and irresponsible members of An tÚdarás.  I could perhaps suggest that we could have a type of chairman&mdash;I am not suggesting that we will&mdash;who might send in his resignation immediately after each meeting and withdraw it before the commencement of the next meeting.  This is not any more fanciful than some of the things that have been said on amendments to guard against this type of thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not.  Might I <Col N="1794" /> add that if a chairman were a person who would hand in his resignation in a fit of pique it is very doubtful if he would be a suitable person to continue in office as chairman.  Surely a man possessing the balance and the judgement needed for the office of chairman would not lightly tender his resignation.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 9, while in amendment No. 8 there was mention of when the resignation of the chairman would take effect, in this section as it stands, there is provision as to when the resignation of an ordinary member would take effect. The proposed amendment avoids all mention of when the resignation would take place.  If I could follow what Senator Dooge mentioned, would it be the time of the writing of the letter, or the time of posting, or the time when the Minister receives the letter?  Would it be at the commencement of the next meeting?  The section as it stands is very much more definite and much more satisfactory.  The section in its prese form provides for the manner in which an ordinary member may resign and for the time when that resignation comes into effect.  All this amendment proposes to do is to omit the reference to the resignations taking effect at a particular time.  I do not think that this would in any sense improve the Bill.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister's criticism of amendment No. 9.  It is not in the form in which I proposed it in the Nuclear Energy Bill. It is the form which the Minister adopted in the Nuclear Energy Bill.  It is the form the parliamentary draftsman produced for the Nuclear Energy Bill. I heartily agree with the Minister that it would be a much better amendment if in fact it said that the resignation took place at the commencement of the meeting next following of the body. Here, the Minister has shown throughout this Bill a great respect for the artifice of the parliamentary draftsmen. I think it would be a pity if he lost it on the last amendment because it is not my handiwork.  I think that these provisions would be better if they were in the form they are in in amendment No. 8 and amendment No. 9 rather than if they were as in the Bill.  Having <Col N="1795" /> said that, if the Minister is not willing to accept them, I only hope that the differences between the two will not arise in the course of the operations of An tÚdarás.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is now going to leave this House, as Senator Quinlan said a moment ago, probably making a record in that it is a politically uncontroversial Bill in which the combined efforts of the Opposition have not succeeded in persuading the Government side that a single amendment put forward deserves either incorporation as it stood or deserves the consideration of the Minister's advisers for the purposes of drawing up a Government amendment.  That fact speaks for itself. Somewhere, in the Minister or in his advisers or the people behind him who cannot be seen or who are not responsible to this House or anybody, there is a stubborn mind at work.  It may be a well-intentioned mind and a mind with the interests of the people of Ireland at heart, but it is a stubborn and inflexible mind, and that is the last kind of mind that should be brought to bear on educational problems.  It is absolutely the last kind of mind that should have a determining say in problems of higher education.  I hope that we in this House and the Deputies in the other House are not going to live to regret the day that we allowed ourselves to be dictated to by this mind, whoever it may belong to, in the way in which we obviously have been over the last three weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a Bill with serious defects.  I do not want to raise the banner of alarm or to alarm the public in any way, but it has serious defects and they are defects which are patent on the face <Col N="1796" /> of the Bill.  The defects of the 1908 Irish Universities Act, under which we are still functioning, were not patent on the face of the Bill.  The defects which that Bill contained became evident over the course of years with the independence of this part of the country, with the changing of social conditions and of social perspectives, and with the broadening of opportunities arising for ordinary people who had not previously had them.</P>
    <P>These natural, social and economic developments lay bare the defects of the 1908 Irish Universities Act.  At the time that Act was passed it was hard to see, looking at it now, that it had any serious defects or that any serious room for abuse was left by it.  That is not the case with the Bill to which we are now saying &ldquo;goodbye&rdquo; in this House.  Let anybody in the future who finds himself at loggerheads with the Authority or the Minister go back to the debates of this House and he will find that the deficiencies of this Bill have been unremittingly pointed out with varying degrees of eloquency and efficiency by people on this side of the House on all the occasions in which it has been debated here.</P>
    <P>I am not going to give the House a resumé of all the various arguments which we have put forward.  The whole thing can be condensed very simply. We are being asked to make, as Senator Quinlan said, an act of faith in the persistence of a reasonable frame of mind in people who are as yet unborn, people who are not yet in power, people who have not yet come into formal political life or into formal official life.  We are being asked to make an act of faith in a Bill which patently gives too much discretion to the wrong people.  It gives too much discretion to the Minister, in regard to the designation of institutions.  It gives too much discretion to the Minister and the Government in regard to the hiring and firing of the members of the Authority. It gives too much discretion to the Authority in regard to the requiring of information from institutions of higher education and it gives too much discretion to the Authority in regard to the imposition of conditions.  It gives a most dangerous discretion to the <Col N="1797" /> Authority in regard to allowing the Authority's functions to be performed on its behalf by one of its officers or servants.</P>
    <P>The Authority is composed of people not one of whom is required to be a full-time academic.  Not one of the members of the Authority is required to be a person whose main commitment in life is to the very ideal this Bill and this Authority is supposed to be promoting. These are very serious defects and it would be a matter of surprise to me&mdash;I do not say that in any sense of gloating because it may be that we on this side of the House will be the people who will have to deal with those difficulties when they arise&mdash;if the defects which this Bill contains and the abuses to which it opens the door do not become a matter of public knowledge and public grievance within a period of five to ten years.</P>
    <P>I am extremely disappointed at the way the Government have approached this Bill.  I am extremely disappointed with the way in which a reasonable human being, like this Minister, has approached non-politically intended amendments advanced from this side. I am extremely disappointed that this Bill should have been dictated and run through both Houses by a mind obviously stubborn and inflexible to the last degree and the kind of mind, therefore, which should be kept far away from anything to do with education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise more in sorrow than in anger on this Fifth Stage of the Higher Education Authority Bill.  We find that all our efforts to improve this Bill have been frustrated. The Bill contains what could well be a prescription for the totalitarian control, at some future stage, of our institutions of higher education.  The absolute powers that the Minister has over An tÚdarás and that An tÚdarás has over the universities are completely incompatible with any liberal or democratic ideal of higher education.  The prescription, as set out here, is little different from that in respect of the corresponding Soviet bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a Bill which we will have to amend drastically when the next stage in the development of the university <Col N="1798" /> system is before us.  I share Senator Kelly's frustration at the way we have been treated in regard to this Bill.  It was, obviously, a completely nonpolitical affair.  We can claim that we have served many years on this system that we have learned something from it and I hope we have made contributions of some value to the university system both on the teaching level and on the administrative level.  We have learned throughout the years that the inflexible and anti-democratic approach conveyed in this Bill is totally wrong.  We have learned also that the pious aspirations of the Minister are not worth recording on the record of Seanad Éireann because they carry no compulsion whatsoever for the future.  Consequently, I regret what we have done.</P>
    <P>I hope that the reasonable actions of quite outstanding men on the present Authority will be able, by precedent, to establish the guidelines.  That is no safeguard whatsoever against a completely arrogant Minister in the future who may be determined to ride roughshod over the universities.  If we ever have such a Minister he will find the instrument to enable him to do so in this Bill.  By doing so he will be able to achieve what the Department of Education would dearly wish to have achieved in the past: the bringing of all education completely under the most inflexible and the least liberal of all our Departments of State.  I am sorry that we have to leave the Bill in this condition. We did our best to improve on it but we have been beaten by the inflexible advisers who flank the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with Senator Kelly and Senator Quinlan in expressing sorrow at the way in which this debate has taken place.  I express sorrow in two respects, first of all in relation to the substantive Bill itself and secondly in relation to the procedural aspects of it.  I would agree with the criticism made by Senator Kelly that this Bill is a bad Bill.  There is no disagreement in principle about setting up the Higher Education Authority and this makes it all the more regrettable that we could not have worked out a better Bill.  I am sure there are other Senators who feel that <Col N="1799" /> we have not legislated on this Bill: we have been steamrolled on it.  Our views have been listened to, but there has been a stonewall approach and none of the arguments put forward have been considered worth thinking about for the Report Stage.  None of the amendments we have put forward has been accepted.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been given too much power, both to designate the institutions and to hire and fire the members of the Authority, for the proper balance and control in a Bill of this nature.  An tÚdarás has been given an extraordinary power over the institutions so that they have to provide more information.  An tÚdarás has more control over their finances than any of the State-sponsored bodies or any of the public bodies which distribute far more of the wealth of the country.  Those institutions have nothing like the scrutiny or nothing like the interference with their autonomy that we have written into this Bill for our institutions of higher education.  I do not think we will be very proud of that fact in years to come.</P>
      <P>I am very disappointed to discover as one of the university professors&mdash; and I join with Senator Quinlan on this &mdash;that had this debate taken place in November, February, April or May some of the arguments made would have been accepted by the Minister. The fact must be clear to anybody on either side of the House.  Because we are now in July and the Minister does not want to bring the Bill back to the Dáil our function in relation to it is absolutely nugatory and no matter what arguments we put forward they will not be listened to.  I believe the Minister's attitude is that he would prefer to have a weaker Bill which would go through the House without having to go back to the Dáil than to accept some of the valid points made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that with great regret.  I consider it an abuse of the parliamentary process. It is part of the ill-timing and the fact that we seem to be in the situation where the Government are unable to put forward legislative plans to deal with it, and it is regrettable.  I should hope that people would realise at some <Col N="1800" /> stage that there is a great need to examine publicly how our Parliament is conducted, so that we do not have a rushed debate at the end of the year, with no time to consider fully the Bills, and with no hope on this side of the House that any of the arguments will be accepted, for the simple procedural reason that the Minister does not want to go back to the Dáil with the Bill.</P>

      <P>Sna díospóireachtaí ar na Céimeannaí éagsúla den Bhille seo sa tSeanad, rinneadh an Bille a scrúdú agus a mheá le cúram agus le dúthracht ó gach taobh.  Cé go ndubhrathas roint rudaí measra cruaidh le cúpia nóimeat anuas caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil mé buíoch de na Seanadóirí as ucht doimhne a machnaimh ar an mBille agus as ucht na tuairimí a nocht siad ina thaobh.  Comhartha é ar an tábhacht a thuigeann an Seanad a bheith leis an reachtaíocht seo gur chaith siad an oiread san ama agus dúthrachta á scrúdú agus á phlé.  Tá mé cinnte go mbeidh Acht an Udaráis um Árd Oideachas ina ghléas fíor-luachmhar chun árdoideachas sa tír seo a chomhoirdniú agus a fhorbairt agus á fheabhsú, agus ní gá dhom a rá leis an Seanad go dtéann chun leas na tíre, leas phobal na tíre aon ní a théann chun leas an oideachais.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that some hard things have been said in relation to my attitude in relation to this Bill, I found the discussions very informative.  I am grateful to the Seanad for the deep consideration that they have given to the Bill in all its aspects, and for the ideas and opinions which have been expressed in this House in relation to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Kelly said earlier on, I feel that it was a gratifying aspect of the discussions that they were in general marked by courtesy and an absence of rancour.  However, just in the final stages here, one or two Senators accused me of coming into the Seanad with a closed mind, determined not to accept any amendment, and intent on steamrolling the measure through the Seanad.  That is not so.  I want to put it on record that my anxiety with regard to this Bill from its beginning to its final stage here, in the Seanad, was to devise legislation which would serve in <Col N="1801" /> the best possible manner the purposes for which it was designed.</P>
    <P>It is natural and understandable that a Senator who proposes an amendment and argues about its adoption with sincerity and conviction should be disappointed that it was not accepted or passed.  I can accept that a Senator might not find the arguments against his amendment as convincing as his own arguments in favour of it, but I would expect that the Senator would appreciate that my approach to the suggested amendments was equally sincere, and that my judgement of their merits were unprejudiced and dispassionate.</P>
    <P>Many of the suggestions which were made during the passage of the Bill through the Seanad related to matters which received full attention and consideration when the Bill was being drafted.  Others dealt with matters which were fully discussed in the Dáil. There were suggestions made here as a result of representations made by outside bodies and organisations interested in the proposals contained in the Bill. I might add that representations also came direct to me, which I carefully examined.  My attitude towards every proposal made for the amendment of the Bill was simply this: will acceptance of the proposal improve the legislation and make it more suitable and effective in the achievement of the aims for which the Bill was designed?  When I considered that it would do so, I accepted the amendment.  As Senators know, the Bill which came before this House was amended in several respects during its passage through the Dáil.  That is not to say that, if I decided here that further amendments should be accepted, they should not be accepted in this House. Where I considered that a proposed amendment would add nothing to the Bill or, as was the case in a number of instances, would weaken it, I naturally declined to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>Senators ought to accept my integrity and my <i>bona fides</i> in relation to this matter.  Whatever misgivings there may be in relation to this legislation, I am convinced that it will be seen in the future as a landmark in Irish education.</P>

      <P>No.  The point the Senator is making is correct but not under this subsection.  It is under another section which allows the Central Bank to carry on the normal business of a bank.  Perhaps when we reach that I can explain why.  What it is intended to cover is such business as, say, dealing with changing of foreign currency and various activities of banking which do not come within the definition of accepting deposits payable on demand or on notice, which is the primary business of banking.  As the House knows, banks engage in various other types of business, such as investment banking, etc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could raise this under another section.  Again on section 2, it says on page 4, &ldquo;securities &lsquo;means&rsquo;&rdquo; and it goes on to enumerate them under subsection  (a) &ldquo;shares and the share capital of any body corporate&rdquo; etc.  Does that include rights to bonus shares that might be issued or rights issues that might be issued by a company?  Is that included in the rights?  In other words, if the bank accepts securities does it also, by accepting securities, obtain the right to any bonus shares issued to those securities or rights issues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be included in the definition of securities.  The question of whether the bank would acquire the right to them is a separate question, depending on the circumstances of a particular transaction.  But it would include such bonus shares or rights issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The rights issues or bonus issues are attached to the shares. It is only the shares themselves that are held as security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the bonus shares or rights issues which are extra to the shares could accrue to the individual and not be subject to the security?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that until they are issued they are not property.  But when they are issued, they could form property coming within the definition of securities in this section.  That does not mean that automatically the bonus shares would accrue to the bank if the bank were holding the shares on which the bonus shares were issued.  It does not mean that.  Such a question could only be decided in each individual case depending on the nature of the deposit with the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I frame it in another way?  In regard to the rights of bonus shares on foot of shares that the bank holds as security, could the individual who lodged those securities dispose of those bonus shares while the securities were lodged at the bank?  The <Col N="1805" /> securities were also lodged at the bank; that is the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We may be at cross purposes here in the sense that what the Senators are visualising is a deposit of securities with a bank, say, as security for an overdraft, and in respect of those securities the issue of a bonus share. That is a different situation.  I think it comes under section 34.  This definition is the same as that contained in the Unit Trust Bill and it covers all investments generally regarded as securities in business and commerce.  But the question of what constitutes security in the sense that the Senators mean is, I think, appropriate to section 34.</P>

      <P>There is a restriction on the carrying on of banking business.  We all recognise the necessity for this type of restriction but coupled with it are the promises that have been held out at various stages that the amalgamations of the banks were to ensure more efficient service with a consequent reduction in duplication and redundancies.  Has any progress been achieved or has the Minister hopes that the present Bill will speed up the rationalisation of our banking services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I could not say that is so, because the amalgamations to which the Senator refers have already taken place.  There is provision in a later section in the Bill which covers various contingencies, legal and otherwise, that can arise, in the event of a merger or amalgamation.  I cannot say, however, there is anything in this Bill which would effect what the Senator has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>But I take it that Government policy, as enunciated when the other banking legislation was going through, is that the Government desire to rationalise the banking service. At that stage it was held that there was an obvious need for rationalisation in small towns where there are two or three different banks represented.  It was a Government aim to try to do something about that.  My theory is that is still the Government's aim.  Is there any means of speeding it up or has the present Bill anything to offer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still the aim.  Under this Bill the Central Bank would be issuing licences to the various banking bodies and it can apply conditions to these licences.  I do not visualise the Central Bank applying conditions to licences for existing banks, assuming they are issued, say, on 1st January next, which would oblige banks to close down certain branches which now exist.  It may be that such would develop in the future.  This would be a consideration which the Central Bank would bear very much in mind in the event of an application from people who are not already carrying on banking in this country.  In other words, it is possible that the provisions of this Bill may in the future assist in that rationalisation, but I would not like the House to think there is likely to be an immediate change in the situation in that regard on the passing of this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1809" />
      <i>Subsection</i> (1) of this section shall not apply in relation to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Limited, the Industrial Credit Company, Limited, the Post Office Savings Bank, a trustee savings bank certified under the Trustee Savings Banks Acts, 1863 to 1965, a building society, an industrial and provident society, a friendly society, a credit union, an investment trust company or the manager under a unit trust scheme in respect of the carrying on of the business of the scheme.</P>
    <P>What would be the position with regard to co-operative societies or co-operative banks?  Is there any provision to add to this list?  This is a stated list, and I do not quite see where an agricultural or industrial co-operative bank would fit in under this section.  It is not unlikely that you might have a farmers' co-operative bank.  Are they covered in this section or are they required to take out a licence the same as any other bank?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Ordinary co-operative societies come under industrial and provident societies which is in the list of societies exempted.  The reasons for these exemptions is that all of these are controlled by separate legislation, apart from unit trusts where the legislation is in the process of being enacted at the moment.  In the case of a co-operative or farmers' bank on the enactment of this Bill, any body, be it co-operative or otherwise, which applies for registration as an industrial and provident society to carry on a banking business would probably&mdash;I am not speaking with certainty&mdash;be refused registration as such and told to obtain a licence under this provision because they would be carrying on a banking business.  If they were registered without a licence under this they would be subject to the statutory control that applies to industrial and provident societies.  In other words, any body carrying on something in the nature of a banking business that is not subject to the provisions of this Bill will be subject to other legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (4) to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) Where an application for a licence is refused the Bank shall forthwith notify the person who has applied for such licence of the refusal and the said applicant may, within thirty days after the date on which the notification is given to the applicant, appeal against the refusal to the High Court whose decision shall be final and unappealable.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I move this amendment because I think it is necessary in the granting of licences that there would be some appeal to the courts if there is a refusal to grant the licence.  I was astonished when I read the Bill as a lawyer&mdash;I read it very much as a lay person in relation to banking&mdash; that this provision was not inserted in the Bill.  The procedure under section 9 for the granting of a licence says:</P>
      <P>The Bank shall not refuse to grant a licence without the consent of the Minister and unless it is satisfied that the grant of the licence would not be in the interest of the orderly and proper regulation of banking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister not grant his consent unless he agrees on these terms?  If one concedes, as I am sure the Minister will concede, that the licence to carry on a banking business is very much a property right and that it is proper that the Central Bank should control the granting of licences, however in the event of a dispute about this rather subjective criteria &ldquo;unless it is satisfied that the grant of the licence would not be in the interest of the orderly and proper regulation of banking&rdquo; there should be an <Col N="1812" /> appeal to the courts on the lines I have set out in my amendment:</P>
    <P>Where an application for a licence is refused the Bank shall forthwith notify the person who has applied for such licence of the refusal and the said applicant may, within thirty days after the date on which the notification is given to the applicant, appeal against the refusal to the High Court whose decision shall be final and unappealable.</P>
    <P>I should imagine that, when this appeal to the High Court took place, the High Court would be slow to displace the judgement of the Central Bank; but there might be a case where a proper appeal would lie.  It is not sufficient to fall back on a possible challenge to the bank's action, or the Minister's action, on the grounds of constitutionality or on the grounds that a proper discretion was not exercised, and put the person being refused the licence in a very difficult legal position as to whether any action lay.  For the rare case where there might be a dispute about the granting of a licence there ought to be recourse to the courts.</P>
    <P>This was my view on reading the Bill, and I was confirmed in that view merely by looking at two other Bills, which I think are analogous to this Bill which passed through the Seanad in this session.  The first of these is the Employment Agency Bill.  Section 5 (2) of this Bill, in relation to the Minister granting licences, says:</P>
    <P>Where the Minister refuses to grant a licence under this Act to an applicant for such a licence he shall notify the applicant within 21 days of his decision and the applicant may appeal to the High Court against the Minister's decision.</P>
    <P>That is the facility I would grant to banking concerns that wish to apply for a licence under the Central Bank Act.</P>
    <P>The second provision&mdash;in honesty, the provision from which I borrowed the whole idea of inserting an appeal to the courts here&mdash;is the Unit Trust Bill. I refer to section 3, subsection (3) of the Unit Trust Bill, which relates to the registering of a unit trust scheme which states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1813" /> Where an application to register a unit trust scheme in the register is refused the registrar shall forthwith notify the manager and the trustee under the scheme of the refusal and the manager or trustee may, within 30 days after the date on which the notification is given to the manager, or the trustee, as the case may be, appeal against the refusal to the High Court whose decision shall be final and unappealable.</P>
    <P>If we are prepared and consider it proper to give this right of appeal to the courts in respect of unit trust schemes and of employment agencies and, I would submit, many other similar schemes&mdash;I am referring only to Bills which have gone through the Seanad&mdash;I cannot understand why, in relation to banking business, where the Central Bank have the discretion not only in respect of the granting of licences but in respect of imposing conditions on the granting of the licence, we would not provide in this Bill for an appeal to the courts.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a word in support of this amendment. It is eminently reasonable that, whenever the doing of anything, particularly the granting or refusal to grant, a licence, is dependent upon the opinion which is formed by the body that has authority to grant or withhold the grant of a licence, there should be some appeal from the opinion or the point of view formed by the granting authority. It is, after all, a question of an opinion of deciding whether or not the grant of the licence would be in the interest of orderly and proper regulation of banking.  There may be two points of view about that.  If a particular point of view is taken by the Central Bank, with the concurrence of the Minister, no licence will be granted.  If the other point of view is taken by the Central Bank, then a licence will be issued. Senator Robinson's amendment is to provide for the case where you have two points of view, either of which may be taken and that the one taken is the one against the applicant.  The suggestion is that in such circumstances there <Col N="1814" /> should be machinery for an appeal.</P>
      <P>Section 9 of the Bill sets out a very watery type of appeal in as much as it provides for the making of representations to the Minister.  The Minister is a politician&mdash;most people in this House are politicians&mdash;and we all know that it does not require a solemn section in a Bill to tell a person that he can make representations to a Minister.  If he does not make them himself he will get a Deputy or a Senator to make them.  I do not think anything is added to the rights of the person whose application has been refused by writing into section 9 of this Bill that within 21 days, or whatever the time is, he may make written representations to the Minister.</P>
      <P>If an amendment on the lines of that suggested by Senator Robinson is accepted by the Minister, then the position of the applicant would be genuinely safeguarded against the possibility of error.  I am not for a moment suggesting that the power vested in the Central Bank, with the concurrence of the Minister, to withhold the granting of a licence, would be used in a <i>mala fide</i> way by the licensing authority as it would be; it is open to error and there may be two different points of view taken in those circumstances.  It seems to me that it is reasonable that an appeal should lie and that the appeal should not lie to the Minister for Finance but should lie to some independent authority that can view the matter in a completely detached independent, judicial manner.</P>
      <P>The suggestion here is that it should be an appeal to the High Court.  I think that is an excellent idea.  If the Minister feels that this type of appeal machinery for one reason or another would not prove workable, that it might be too time consuming or that it might impose an unnecessary burden on the High Court, then the Minister should put forward some other suggestion of his own which would apply the principle of this amendment, that is that the appeal should be to an independent authority, independent of the Central Bank, independent of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to support Senator Robinson's amend-purchas <Col N="1815" /> ment, or a similar amendment, for several reasons, some of which have already been mentioned by Senator Robinson and some by Senator O'Higgins.  The phrase &ldquo;in the interests of orderly and proper regulation of banking&rdquo; is repeated several times in this and subsequent sections.  It is not a new phrase.  &ldquo;Orderly marketing&rdquo; is a phrase that one comes across from time to time in the commercial world. It generally means, in essence, that the most orderly type of marketing is a monopoly.  When big corporations want to regulate orderly marketing they generally buy up their smaller competitors or force them out of business. I am always a bit nervous of this expression in any legislation.  It has not been defined anywhere in this Bill, what &ldquo;orderly and proper regulation of banking&rdquo; means.  The Minister's Parliamentary Secretary, in his very comprehensive address to the Seanad before we discussed the Second Stage of the Bill, went to great pains to underline the fact that this Bill had been brought in in the interests of the welfare of the people and in the interests of proper banking arrangements.  I am not satisfied that the Central Bank, as I understand it, will be in competition with other banks.  I think there is provision in this Bill to permit the Central Bank to be not alone a banker's bank, but to be a bank for the public also and to make loans.  I think I am correct in that, and if that is so tremendous power is being given to the Central Bank to grant licences to its own competitors.</P>
      <P>That power is too great, even though the Minister will have the final say. The Minister, undoubtedly, will be influenced very greatly by what the Central Bank's advice will be.  I should like to think that there would be some other court to which a person or a corporation having an appeal on constitutional grounds could apply, such as the High Court.  There is a good deal of merit in this amendment and I would ask the Minister to consider it favourably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to support this amendment.  The board of <Col N="1816" /> the Central Bank will be made up of people who are expert in banking, but there may be, as Senator Russell has said, some clash of interests involved in this.  With all respect to various Ministers of any party in the present, the past or in the future, we will get Ministers for Finance whose expertise in finance may not be as good as that of members of the board of the Central Bank.  Therefore, the reliance of the Minister will be more or less on the advice given by the Central Bank.  It may be given by his own technical advisers in his Department, but the technical advisers in the Department, too, may not have any greater expertise than those in the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>Therefore, there should be some other resort, some other court, at which even those who plead the case may have recourse to documents and papers and the advice of experts.  It may not be the High Court, but the High Court seems to me to be the logical one from what I can see.  As Senator O'Higgins has said, if there is any other method or any other court of appeal, I think it should so be available because I feel, like Senator Russell, that too much reliance may be placed by any Minister for Finance on what the Central Bank would think.</P>
      <P>In effect, the judgement given by the Minister would nearly always coincide with the wishes of the Central Bank, not because he is doing anything which he considers wrong or not through any ignorance or lack of ability on his part, but because many Ministers for Finance have not been trained in such matters and may not have the expertise that the board of the Central Bank would have.  This amendment, if adopted, would be a safeguard.  There should be another court to which an appeal could be made, be it the High Court or something of that nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to make it clear, in regard to the point raised by Senator Russell, that although there is provision in a later section which would enable the Central Bank to carry on the normal business of banking, there is no intention whatsoever to have the Central Bank carry on commercial banking.  The <Col N="1817" /> main purpose of that provision is to allow for one of the things that is being done, which is the transfer to the Central Bank of the various Government accounts at present handled mainly in the Bank of Ireland.</P>
      <P>This is one of the functions of a Central Bank and it is one which we want to see the Central Bank carry on. I should like to make it clear that the Central Bank can by no means be regarded in the same light as any commercial bank.  It is the organ which controls, and after the enactment of this Bill will far more rigorously control, the whole operation of banking in this country, and in that role will act as trustees for the community.  That is the role of the Central Bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the first point that I wanted to make clear.  The second one is this: Senator Robinson referred to two other enactments, the Unit Trusts Bill and the Employment Agency Bill, In both of those cases the circumstances in which a licence may be granted or refused are either set out in the Bill or are to be specified by regulations.  The court, therefore, will be concerned on appeal only in satisfying itself as to whether or not the Minister concerned has complied with the statutory requirements.  This is the same, I think, under both those Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the importance of banking, the rapid changes which are taking place at present in the nature of banking business and the public considerations that are involved and that can arise, I do not consider that it is feasible to set criteria for licensing in a rigid statutory framework.  Senators have referred to the fact that we talk about the interests of &ldquo;the orderly and proper regulation of banking&rdquo;.  Accepting this amendment would in effect mean that the High Court would decide what constituted &ldquo;the orderly and proper regulation of banking&rdquo;, the whole point of this Bill is that we are placing on the Central Bank <Col N="1818" /> the responsibility for ensuring the &ldquo;orderly and proper regulation of banking&rdquo; in this country.  This is a responsibility which requires a great deal of expertise in the field of banking and this is a very wide field indeed.</P>
    <P>It is unrealistic to expect that any court, the High Court or otherwise, could possibly have the kind of expertise necessary to decide this in the interests of the community.  That is not to say that a person's right of recourse to the courts is being taken away.  In this connection I would say that what Senator O'Higgins said in relation to representations to the Minister would be true if that word &ldquo;representations&rdquo; was to be interpreted in the normal way. However, here, that word means a great deal more.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court has laid down in the Marts Act case that seemingly arbitrary powers must be exercised by a Minister fairly and judicially.  Under this section a refusal can only be grounded on the orderly and proper regulation of banking.  The applicant must be informed in writing of the reasons why the Central Bank wish to refuse a licence and must also be informed of his right to make representations to the Minister within 21 days.  The Minister must consider the case made only on the basis of the reasons put forward by the Central Bank and the representations made by the applicant.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court judgement makes it clear that the reasons for a refusal must be stated in such a way as to enable the applicant to challenge the decision in court.  For example, should it appear that the Minister has taken into account matters which he was not permitted under the section to take into account, the applicant could apply to the court to declare that there has been an unconstitutional use of a constitutional power under the Act.  The right of recourse to the court therefore remains under this section, but the onus of proof falls somewhat more heavily on the applicant.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this that has to be considered.  The reason for refusal could well be information of a very delicate kind.  It should be realised that in cases of this nature inquiries are <Col N="1819" /> made about the applicant both in this country and abroad.  A great deal of information is obtained frequently through other central banks who, by the nature of their business, have a great deal of knowledge and expertise in this field.  There is no doubt that if it were thought that information of this kind would be likely to be produced in court by our Central Bank the availability of this information would cease. Other central banks, and similar bodies from which information could be obtained, would not co-operate in giving that information if that was the case.</P>
    <P>In the event of an application to the court by an applicant who claimed that the power provided in this section had not been constitutionally used it would probably be possible for the Central Bank, by cross-examination, to produce the kind of evidence I am talking about. As long as it was not our Central Bank who were disclosing the sources of the information obtained I do not think any great harm would be done.  We must remember that the whole object of this licensing system&mdash;it is the keystone of this Bill&mdash;is to protect the public.  That is the role of the Central Bank.  We must not hamstring the Central Bank in carrying out that function.</P>
    <P>To accept this amendment would be leaving it to the High Court to decide what constituted the orderly and proper regulation of banking and it would seriously diminish the Central Bank's discretion.  The onus of proof, if the amendment were accepted, justifying its position, would be shifted significantly on to the Central Bank.  As I have indicated, there could be considerable practical difficulties involved if we were to do this.  A licence to carry on a banking business is not comparable to a certificate of suitability or personal fitness.  More than personal good character and financial solvency are involved. In some cases quite delicate and confidential inquiries have to be made into the background of the promoters as to their financial standing, their expertise and the nature of their business operations both here and abroad.</P>
    <P>It is very important to realise if we <Col N="1820" /> were to accept this amendment, with the consequence I have outlined, almost certainly the kind of information which at present can be obtained by the Central Bank, particularly abroad, in the interests of protecting the community would cease to be available. This is far too high a price to pay.</P>
    <P>I would also like to point out that there could be cases of a refusal to grant a licence on grounds related to economic and financial judgements.  For instance, there could be the view by the Central Bank, which might be confirmed by the Minister on representations being made to him, that there were too many banks or that there were too many banks of a particular class, having regard to the volume of business available. I do not think that kind of decision is one on which we should ask the courts to adjudicate.</P>
    <P>In all these circumstances we would be losing much of the protection which we want to provide for the public in this Bill if we were to accept this amendment. At the same time my not accepting the amendment does not take away the right of recourse to the courts by an applicant in the circumstances which I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his reasoned reply. However, I do not think he has dealt with some of the reasons why this amendment has been introduced.  First of all, he referred to the two Bills I mentioned; the Unit Trusts Bill and the Employment Agency Bill.  I think the Unit Trusts Bill is a closer analogy to this.  Despite what the Minister said in regard to regulations, the terminology in the Unit Trusts Bill is extremely similar to the criteria for the granting of a banking licence.  It is noticeable that in the Unit Trusts Bill we are dealing with the Minister, whereas in the Central Bank Bill we are dealing with the bank &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister.&rdquo;  Apart from that procedural difference, I think, they are quite similar.</P>
      <P>Section 3 (1) of the Unit Trusts Bill states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Upon application to the registrar in accordance with this Act by the manager and trustee under a unit trust scheme, the registrar shall register <Col N="1821" /> the scheme in the register if, but only if&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the Minister is satisfied, after consultation with the Central Bank of Ireland and after consideration with that Bank of the relevant information in the application, that the competence in respect of matters of the kind with which they would be concerned in relation to a unit trust scheme and probity of the manager and trustee are such as to render them suitable to act as manager and trustee respectively, under the scheme.</P>
    <P>It then provides that the manager of a scheme is a body corporate and there are various other procedural provisions. The main thing is that it lays down the same type of test as for banking.  They have to be suitable persons for carrying on such a business. There is a very close analogy to banking in that Bill.  This is the test when an appeal is made to the High Court.</P>
    <P>There is no question under the Unit Trusts Bill, which we have passed in the Seanad, that the High Court would be unable to cope with this type of criteria.  The circumstances of a licence being granted or refused, under this Bill are analogous to the registering or non-registering under the unit trust scheme.  In that case we thought it necessary in particular circumstances to allow an appeal to the High Court. The Minister will accept that an appeal to the High Court would be very rare, that there would have to be very good reason for it; it is an expensive exercise in anybody's business and to be refused by the High Court is something that a banking concern would not welcome. If there was any ground at all for refusing the licence, then it would not be disputed in the High Court.  It would be in very exceptional circumstances that their right would be tested in it.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister did not find it feasible to set out the requirements for granting a licence.  On the next amendment I shall have something to say about the requirements for revoking a licence.  That will be very relevant to some of the points that we have made.  However, in relation to his point that the object and the keystone of the Central Bank Bill is to protect <Col N="1822" /> the public, I accept that this is one of the important ones and one with which I have great sympathy.</P>
    <P>Surely the object of a Central Bank Bill is also to promote a climate of commercial stability and commercial openness in this country, in both Irish banks and other banks set up here? I know that this may be something surprising coming from me: it is not a line that I normally take.  However, in a Central Bank Bill we must think in terms of creating a climate of commercial stability.  One of the ways of doing it is to guarantee to those who are applying for banking licences that, if they feel they have been unjustly refused a licence, they will know they will have a statutory recourse to the courts.</P>
    <P>In the last analysis, a manager of a unit trust scheme comes into the country to set up a unit trust scheme. This is just as personal and important as banking and will involve investment by the community which requires the protection of the public, and this was emphasised during the debate on the Unit Trust Bill.  The protection of the public is at least as important in the case of unit trusts as it is in the case of banking, and yet the argument does not seem to have been sufficiently persuasive to allow this appeal to the court.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider the possibility of accepting this amendment on the grounds that it would obviously be a rare line of action by somebody who had been refused a licence.  As he said himself, it would normally be the proper role of the Central Bank to refuse them.  It would be on very rare occasions only that there would be an appeal to the court, but it would benefit commercial stability in the country and would not be contrary to the protection of the public, as we saw in the Unit Trusts Bill.  It would be a very fair opening to somebody who had been refused a licence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am right in suspecting that the real argument the Minister has against acceptance of this amendment is the possibility that the sources of information to which he has referred might dry up, if there was any possibility of the information, or the sources, being bandied about in open <Col N="1823" /> court.  I may be wrong; perhaps the Minister thinks that the other reasons which he gave are equally strong. Personally, I do not.  That is the one point which the Minister is seeking to guard against by his refusal to accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>I should like to suggest to him that that situation could be dealt with very simply by providing that an appeal to the High Court would be held <i>in camera,</i> that there would be no question of the public being admitted in the same way as relates to income tax appeals at present, or to revenue appeals in the Circuit Court.  It would be heard <i>in camera</i> and there would be no question of publishing the proceedings or the evidence given before the court.  If that were adopted as a modification to the amendment which has been proposed, it would obviate completely any possibility of the ill-effects which the Minister foresees, that is the drying up of the sources of information.</P>
      <P>That is the only strong point he made when he was refusing this amendment. For example, he spoke of the High Court not having the kind of expertise which would be required to decide on questions of orderly and proper regulation of banking.  What is the alternative the Minister is giving?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Robinson suggests that a judge of the High Court, a person experienced in many matters, should be asked to adjudicate in the event of an appeal.  The Minister's alternative is that he&mdash;or whoever happens to be Minister for Finance&mdash; should be in the position which this amendment suggests should be given to a judge of the High Court.  What is a Minister for Finance?  I am not talking personally: I am quite sure that the Minister realises that.  Essentially, a Minister for Finance is a political figure.  He is a person who finds himself as the political head of the Department of Finance because he is in politics and is a member of a political party that has been successful at the polls.  He may have no qualifications, good, bad or indifferent, to give any decision one <Col N="1824" /> way or the other on questions affecting banking, or on matters affecting finance generally.</P>
      <P>The present Minister for Finance was a member of my profession before he became Minister.  His predecessor was a member of a profession once removed from mine.  Before he became Minister for Finance his predecessor was a member of the medical profession. There have been medical doctors who find themselves in the position of Minister for Finance.  What particular expertise have any of these to decide on questions of the orderly and proper regulation of banking?  Surely a qualified judge of the High Court who, by his training, is practised in weighing up the evidence that is put before him, both on behalf of the Central Bank and on behalf of the applicant, is in a much better position to give a reasoned and a balanced view and judgement on the question than is the political head of the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make it absolutely clear again that I am not talking personally, and I am not talking about either present or past Ministers for Finance, when I say this.  I have made the point that the Minister for Finance is the political head of the Department of Finance.  As political head of the Department of Finance, a future Minister for Finance may find himself pulled politically with regard to a decision which he might be required to take under section 9 of the Central Bank Bill in relation to an application. He may find himself pushed politically by his own party as regards the decision he should come to.  At least that danger would be eliminated if the say was taken away from the politician and given to the judge on the bench.  The danger to which the Minister has adverted, that is, the sources of information drying up, can be guarded against completely by the simple device of making it known in the Bill that any hearing of an appeal before a judge of the High Court will be <i>in camera,</i> and that none of the evidence will be published, and that no member of the public who is not concerned in the case will be allowed into court to hear the evidence.  If that were known and the Central Bank were in a position so to <Col N="1825" /> inform their sources of information there would not be any question of the sources of information drying up.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Minister is in an unfortunate position on this amendment. He probably recognises that there is a very good and a very strong case for the amendment, but he does not want to alter his Central Bank Bill at this stage and so bring it back to the other House.  I am sure the Members there would not welcome the Bill being returned to them at this stage, even if it were only for the purpose of acquiescing in an amendment made by this House.  Nevertheless, we would not be facing up to our responsibilities as Members of the Oireachtas, and the Minister would not be facing up to his responsibility as Minister for Finance, if we or he were to allow considerations such as that to affect our judgement on the question posed on this amendment.</P>
    <P>I feel that there is a very strong case to be made and I feel that a very strong case has been made for this amendment perhaps not in the identical terms in which it is moved but at least in principle.  I strongly urge the Minister to reconsider his attitude to it.</P>

      <P>We are opposing this amendment.  While I respect the Leader of the Opposition, I must say that we must oppose this because of several factors.  There must be a realisation of one fact, which is that the Minister for Finance does not just legislate on a party political basis.  A Minister for Finance must legislate for years to come.  To say that we have had several Ministers for Finance of different categories and then at the same time to ask a High Court judge who is also a solicitor to legislate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Senator says a High Court judge has the ability to legislate and he has the ability to decide, and because our Minister for Finance is a solicitor he says that he has not this ability.  This is not very sensible.  I shall just discount it and <Col N="1826" /> leave it at that.  For the Senator to say that he would let a High Court judge decide, and object to the Minister for Finance, who is a solicitor, is ridiculous.</P>

      <P>I should like to say to Senator Gallanagh that, if his point is valid, why did he not raise it on the Unit Trusts Bill.  The procedure that I have brought forward here is precisely the procedure that exists in relation to unit trusts, which involve community money and which involve people investing in them and which involve registering, which is the same as granting a banking licence.  The Minister is the operative person in it.  In a rare case there is an appeal to the court.  This is not a slander on the Minister or it is not denigrating the position of solicitors in comparison with High Court judges. It is purely an offering of this facility in the rare case where a statutory appeal to the High Court might be justified. If this is valid in relation to unit trusts I do not see why it is not valid in relation to banking business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has almost convinced me in his arguments about the transfer of information which may be confidential.  I quite see his point that the element of confidence enters into this.  The more publicity that will be given about an application to the Central Bank for the establishment of a bank the less likely such relevant and important information will be given by sources from which such information of a confidential nature might normally be expected to be had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After considering the point of the Minister's argument in attempting to reject Senator Robinson's amendment, Senator O'Higgins produced a method of doing it, which is to appeal to the High Court <i>in camera.</i>  That may not be satisfactory to the sources of information which the Minister referred to but if the Minister will insist on this he should then let it go the full way and cut out any appeal to the Minister at all, because an appeal to the Minister involves not alone a Minister's knowledge but the knowledge of officials of his Department.  Therefore, that means the confidential information goes beyond the Central Bank.  If he wants to <Col N="1827" /> be completely logical in the rebuttal of Senator Robinson's argument, the information should not even go to the Minister, because by going to him he and his officials will know of it.  The difference between the Minister plus his officials knowing it and the difference between it being held in High Court <i>in camera</i> is another consideration.  If he wants to be really logical about keeping this confidential information sacrosanct, he should remove this appeal to the Minister completely.</P>

      <P>First of all, what is involved here is not a matter of law. If the question were, should there be more investment banks, for example, this is not a matter of law.  This is a matter of policy.  A Minister for Finance, whatever his background or profession, is involved in the formulation of policy.  It is not the business of a High Court judge to formulate policy. It is not a function of a High Court judge to make a decision on such a matter, because it is not a matter of law, it is a matter of judgement in relation to policy.</P>
      <P>Point number two is that Senator O'Higgins was substantially correct in surmising that I attach very great importance to this question of obtaining information about applicants, probably from abroad, in a confidential way from the various sources I have mentioned and to the danger of this source of information drying up.  I do attach very great importance to that.</P>
      <P>The remedy which he suggests by having an appeal heard <i>in camera</i> does not meet the difficulty.  I thought that when Senator Belton was speaking he had realised that it did not meet the difficulty, but then I found that he was right for what seemed to me to be the wrong reasons.  The reason I say that it does not meet the difficulty is this: as I pointed out, acceptance of this amendment changes the onus of proof, which means that whether the case is heard <i>in camera</i> or not the onus of proof is transferred to the Central Bank who, in order to prove the grounds for their objection, have to produce the evidence which is available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1828" /> Even if it is <i>in camera</i> it is not suggested that the hearing should be in the absence of the applicant.  This is the kernel of the point.  The evidence and the sources of it have to be produced in the presence of the applicant.</P>
    <P>Senators will probably recall that when I was speaking about this earlier, I talked about the Central Bank producing this kind of information in court by cross-examination.  What I had in mind was that they would not thereby have to disclose the sources of their information.  But hearing the case <i>in camera</i> does not overcome the difficulty I have outlined.  I should like to make it clear to Senator O'Higgins and any other Senators who may have the same view as he expressed that my opposition to this amendment has nothing whatever to do with the possible recess of this House or the other House.  It is based on the fact that I think it would be a grave disadvantage to the operation of the Central Bank and possibly a serious blow to the kind of protection we are trying to get for the public.</P>
    <P>I understand Senator Robinson's concern in the matter.  Indeed, in another Bill which was before either this or the other House, I accepted an amendment on the lines which she has in mind.  I am predisposed in favour of what she has in mind.  I would suggest that in this case, having regard to the great importance of banking in our system, to the changes which are taking place in systems of banking, to the influx and potential influx of people wanting to get banking licences from all parts of the world, it is essential that we be in a position, through the Central Bank, to vet these applications carefully, to get any information that is relevant to the standing, financial and otherwise, and the banking expertise of these applicants.  Anything which would hinder this cannot be in the interests of the community.  It may appear to be a conflict between the rights of the individual applicant and the rights of the community.  I do not think it boils down to that, though if it did, I think that in this case the rights of the community would outweigh the rights of the applicant.</P>
    <P>Assuming that an applicant was to be turned down because of lack of probity, <Col N="1829" /> for example, all of us would like to see him turned down.  He would have nothing to gain by this amendment.  A <i>bona fide</i> applicant has nothing to fear from this section, but the community needs the protection of this section as outlined.  I know it was not the intention of Senator Robinson or those who supported this amendment to lessen in any way the protection for the public, but I would suggest to them that if they think about what I have said they will agree that the reasons for not accepting this amendment are quite substantial and I would ask them, having considered it, to agree with me that this should not be pushed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to push the Minister too far but I should like to make one point.  It would be quite outrageous if the position were intended to obtain under this section an applicant should not be told of the reasons for the refusal.  The Minister seemed to be going near to that when he spoke of the difficulty about the sources being disclosed to the applicant. But the section makes it quite clear that, if the Central Bank are refusing an application, they must notify the applicant of the grounds of refusal.  What is lost then by discussion of it in court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But they do not have to notify the sources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The grounds for refusal may be varied.  They may be contrary to the banking policy of the particular Government of the day. Possibly that would be a good ground for refusal.  If there are other grounds which come from confidential sources, at least the grounds must be stated, and if the grounds are correct and valid, the near certainty is that the applicant will know from which source those grounds came.  So I do not think this question of preserving from the applicant the identity of the source is of any importance at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made the point that a <Col N="1830" /> person who lacked probity and was refused a licence on that ground would have nothing to gain from this amendment. I agree with that.  He then went on to say that a <i>bona fide</i> applicant would have nothing to fear from the section.  I agree to some extent with that, but not entirely.  A <i>bona fide</i> applicant would have nothing to fear from the section except the making of a mistake. In order to remedy the situation if a mistake were made, the machinery set out in this amendment would be valuable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Higgins has made the point I was about to make and that was the question of confidence. I take the Minister's point in that regard.  We all accept the fact that information of a confidential nature must be protected, especially its sources. I do not see the necessity for going outside the country if the applicant happens to be an Irish national.  The procedures laid down in this section are quite simple.  If the bank proposed to refuse to grant a licence, they write to the applicant telling him that they propose to apply to the Minister for permission to refuse an application. They then write to the individual and state the reasons.  Whether they are prepared to state all the reasons is a moot point.  I would say no.  The only recourse the applicant then has is to write to the Minister.  According to the section the only representation he can make is in writing to the Minister.  I imagine if he is serious in his intention of trying to obtain a licence, he would refute the grounds on which the licence was refused.  The Minister would then have to adjudicate on the question. The applicant would have no other recourse open to him and that seems to be one of the reasons why Senator Robinson's amendment is valid.  This seems to end the case too abruptly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's point about the question of confidence.  Of course the applicant is also entitled to have his confidence respected and he may not wish to state in a letter to the Minister certain reasons why he feels he is being refused.  He might wish to make personal representations to the Minister.  He might like to be repre <Col N="1831" /> sented by his solicitor or lawyer in court <i>in camera.</i>  He is refused all these courses and the only thing he is allowed do is to write a letter to the Minister saying: &ldquo;I should not have been turned down because the facts as stated are not correct.&rdquo;  That is my reading of the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly accept what the Minister said about the importance of the confidential nature of a lot of the information in relation to the decision to grant a licence or not. At this stage I should like to ask this question which I do not think has been answered so far: what is the difference between granting a licence to an applicant in relation to a bank or refusing to grant it and having the possibility of appeal to the Minister, and the registering of a unit trust scheme?  In section 3 (1) (a), of the Unit Trusts Bill the Minister must be satisfied &ldquo;after consultation with the Central Bank of Ireland and after consideration with that Bank of the relevant information in the application, that the competence in respect of matters of the kind with which they would be concerned in relation to a unit trust scheme and probity of the manager and trustee are such as to render them suitable to act as manager and trustee.&rdquo;  I would say that this is information of the most confidential nature.  It could come from sources outside the country if the unit trust scheme were a foreign unit trust scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand the logic behind allowing an appeal to the court in the case of granting of a licence in that case and the refusal to do so in the case of banking purely on the basis of confidentiality, accepting the point made by Senator O'Higgins which I am glad to accept.  In fact, I will bring in an amendment on Report Stage that the hearing will be <i>in camera</i> to safeguard the confidential nature of the sources of information.  I cannot see the difference, in relation to the protection of the community and the need for confidentiality, in the nature of the information which would be forthcoming in relation to the probity of a <Col N="1832" /> banking concern and that in relation to the probity of a manager of a unit trust scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I repeat that I do not think the hearing <i>in camera</i> is an answer to the problem at all for the reasons I have given.  Secondly, when one is thinking of the protection of the public one should remember that in the case of a unit trust there are trustees.  I am speaking without certainty on this, but I think under the unit trust scheme it would have to be a bank.  The protection of the public is not solely dependent on the confidence and probity of the manager.  In addition, and very important, what is involved in the unit trust situation is what is set out in the section.  In the case of the present Bill, as I have indicated, matters of banking policy can come into play. This is not a matter for the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but I would think that banking policy is a matter that can be pleaded before the court as a reason for refusing the licence.  If the judge accepts that the policy reasons are very strong then he will support the refusal to grant the licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point I should like to ask the Minister. Subsection (5) reads:</P>
      <P>The grant of a licence to a person shall not constitute a warranty as to the solvency of the person to whom it is granted and the bank shall not be liable in respect of any losses incurred through the insolvency or default of a person to whom a licence is granted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsection says &ldquo;shall not constitute a warranty as to the solvency of the person to whom it is granted&rdquo;.  Surely a licence would not be granted unless the bank were satisfied that at the time of the granting the licence the person or corporate body was solvent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not read that way.  It says &ldquo;the grant of a licence to a person shall not constitute a warranty as to the solvency of the person to whom it is granted&rdquo;.  That is at the time it is granted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There must be a distinction.  Senator Russell was correct in what he said that the granting of a licence indicates that the Central Bank is satisfied as to the solvency of the licensee.</P>

      <P>Yes.  But there is a difference between the Central Bank being satisfied as to the solvency of a licensee and a warranty that the person is solvent at that time.  The bank could be wrong.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point. I wonder have the same procedures been followed in regard to the power of the bank to alter conditions?</P>
      <P>Section 10, subsection (2) states :</P>
      <P>The conditions of a licence may be amended, revoked or added to and conditions may be imposed in relation to a licence from time to time by the bank if in the opinion of the bank the amendment, revocation, addition or imposition is calcualated to promote the orderly and proper regulation of banking.</P>
      <P>Should the same procedure as in section 9 not be followed here before taking such a very drastic step?  The imposing of new conditions might be tantamount to putting a licensed banker out of business if he could not comply with them.  The Minister should at least be advised that it was proposed to take such a step and the same procedure followed again.  What is good for the goose in section 9 should be good for the gander in section 10&mdash;to put it rather crudely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the matter of conditions pertaining to the licence, I also view this provision with some hesitation.  I looked at the judgement of the Supreme Court in the Livestock Marts Act case to which the Minister has already referred.  I take some consolation from the judgement of the Supreme Court in that although conditions may be attached to individual licences, the attaching of conditions must be done in a justified way and must be for good reasons.  Can I just quote briefly from the judgement of the Supreme Court in this case, East Donegal Co-op and others v. the Attorney General, page 95 of the <i>Irish Law Times Reports:</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true that conditions may not be uniform for all licences for the reasons already given in this judgement and are by their nature in many cases necessarily peculiar to an individual applicant.  It is not, however, a valid inference that because the legislation made provision for such a scheme of administration or imposition of conditions that it authorised the exercise of that function in a matter amounting to a <Col N="1835" /> breach of a constitutionally guaranteed right.  The conditions must be of the character already indicated in this judgment and must be related to the objects of the Act in the way already indicated.  Any condition which did not conform with these tests would be <i>ultra vires</i> the Act. Also for the reasons already given it is not a valid inference that because a specified procedure is prescribed for one type of situation, namely the revocation or refusal of a licence, the Minister is not bound to act in accordance with the principles of constitutional justice in respect of the imposition, amendment or revocation of conditions attached to a licence.  In the opinion of the court the Act cannot be construed as unequivocably demonstrating that such was the will of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I take it from that that the conditions which would be imposed on individual licences under this Bill would have to be in conformity with constitutional justice, would have to be reasoned conditions and that these conditions, if they were proposed for unsound reasons, could be challenged in the courts?  For that reason, I did not introduce any amendment in regard to the possibility of challenging the imposition of conditions.  This is not inconsistent with putting in an appeal in the case of either the refusal to grant a licence or even more so, as I shall be arguing on the next amendment, in the case of revocation of a licence.  I would accept the position that there is not an absolute discretion, that there is a judicial discretion which can be challenged and if necessary the Minister or the Central Bank would have to justify the conditions imposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that two meanings can be taken from subsection (2) if it is in isolation, but following on subsection (1) I take it only one meaning can be taken from it.  It means that the conditions of a licence may be amended when an application for a licence by a particular body or person is before the Bank.  But it could mean that the conditions of a licence may be amended, revoked or added to without <Col N="1836" /> any application before the Bank.  I presume, in the context of subsection (1) that, if the Bank intends to grant a licence, it may append certain conditions &mdash;that the licence may be amended, revoked or added to.  I presume that is what it means in that case and that Senator Robinson is right.  Does the Minister understand what I am getting at here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Senator have in mind that it could only be done in relation to an original application for a licence and not thereafter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, the Central Bank itself may draw up rules or amend without any application before it.  That is one way of interpreting it. But in the context in which it is here I do not think that is the interpretation that can be put on it.  It can, with an application before it, grant, revoke or amend a licence or do certain things to the licence that is before it.  I think that is the meaning to be taken out of this in the context of the subsection (1).  If that is so, Senator Robinson may have a point in that.  Does the Minister understand the points I am making on this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank may decide on certain rules in regard to the granting of licences, imposing conditions, and so on.  In any case I am in agreement with Senator Robinson that there should be recourse to the courts. I do not know whether Senator Russell's point is valid.  He may be more or less looking for information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, what Senator Robinson has stated is correct.  Indeed, the section was drafted with an eye to the Supreme Court judgment in the Marts case.  Listening to the Senator express an off-the-cuff opinion, what she has said is correct.  Certainly, the position is that any non-judicial exercise of the powers of this section would be grounds for an application to the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Russell will notice that the section provides that, in the event of the bank deciding that it proposed to <Col N="1837" /> amend or add to the conditions of a licence, notice in writing is given to the licensee who may make representations in writing to the Bank in relation to the proposals; and the bank, before deciding to impose the condition or to amend or add to the conditions, must consider these representations.  The point arose on the previous section, although I did not deal with it.  The point of making these representations in writing is that this makes it quite clear as to what are the terms of reference so that one can judge whether or not the Central Bank has acted in a judicial way.  If the Central Bank acts in a non-judicial way then it is open to the courts to intervene and because the representations are in writing the court can determine whether the Central Bank acted judicially or not, and acted within the terms of the section.  In these circumstances I do not think any question of an appeal to the Minister need arise.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before subsection (3) to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() (a) Where a licence is to be revoked under this section the Bank shall notify the holder not less than sixty days before the day on which such revocation is intended to take effect and the holder may, within thirty days after the date on which the notification is given to the holder, appeal against the revocation to the High Court whose decision shall be final and unappealable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) The High Court may, if it <Col N="1838" /> thinks it proper to do so, provide by order that a revocation under this section to which an appeal under this subsection relates shall not have effect during the period, or such part of it as it may specify by order, prior to the determination of the appeal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I urge the acceptance of this amendment in view of the points raised by the Minister in relation to the granting of a licence.  As he said, in many areas this is largely a policy matter, and is subject to the problem of the confidentiality of information&mdash;the problem of having sources available abroad in relation to banking concerns coming from abroad to operate here&mdash;and considerations of that sort.  The Minister will accept that these considerations are not as relevant, if they are relevant at all, in relation to the revocation of a licence.  The statutory reasons for revocation are set out in section 11.  I give my opinion with a certain diffidence, but in my view the section as it stands would hardly withstand constitutional scrutiny.  I say this because the operation of a banking licence is a property right and the revocation of a banking licence is a deprivation of property.  The deprivation of property for the reason set out in section 11, which I propose to go through, amounts to a deprivation of property without recourse to the courts. It would be unfortunate to pass the Central Bank Bill at this late stage in the parliamentary session and then find that it was challenged when an attempt was made to revoke a licence.  Section 11 states: &ldquo;The Bank may, with the consent of the Minister, revoke a licence&mdash;&rdquo; for the following reasons and the reasons are set out as follows:</P>
    <P>(a) if the holder of the licence so requests,</P>
    <P>(b) if the holder fails or ceases to carry on banking business,</P>
    <P>There would have to be a finding that he was either failing or ceasing to carry on a banking business.</P>
    <P>(c) if the holder is adjudicated bankrupt,</P>
    <P>Again there would have to be evidence that the holder was adjudicated bankrupt.</P>
    <P>(d) if the holder is a partnership and <Col N="1839" /> the partnership is dissolved by the death or bankruptcy of any partner, or otherwise under the law of partnership,</P>
    <P>(e) if the holder, being a company, is being wound up,</P>
    <P>(f) if the holder becomes unable to meet his obligations to his creditors or suspends payments lawfully due by him,</P>
    <P>Again, I would say a very judicial determination as to whether the holder becomes unable to meet his obligations to his creditors or suspends payments lawfully due by him.  Paragraph (g) states:</P>
    <P>if the holder fails to maintain a deposit in the Bank of an amount determined in accordance with section 13 of this Act.</P>
    <P>In relation to the deposit, there might be an argument based on the desire to promote a climate of commercial stability and commercial confidence here.  It might be thought that the bank could, under these terms, to some extent bully the particular person who had a licence, but if he did not maintain his deposit&mdash;and this could be a matter of a couple of days&mdash;his licence would be revoked.  It is certainly something that the Bank might need in order to ensure that deposits were maintained under section 13.  It is also something that might possibly be abused and it would restore the confidence of commercial concerns if there was recourse to the courts in relation to it.  Paragraph (h):</P>
    <P>if the holder is convicted on indictment of an offence under any provision of this Act or an offence involving fraud, dishonesty or breach of trust,</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister would agree with me that this is very much a determination which might be disputed and which might require to come before the courts on appeal&mdash;a judicial determination, a matter of evidence, a matter of argument. Finally, we have paragraph (i):</P>
    <P>if, since the grant of the licence, the circumstances relevant to the grant have changed and are such <Col N="1840" /> that, if an application for a licence were made in the changed circumstances, it would be refused.</P>
    <P>Again, a matter under which a person might like to have recourse to the courts if the licence was revoked.  The Minister's argument in relation to the granting of a licence&mdash;that the reasons for granting a licence were not set out in the Act, in other words there were no statutory grounds for granting a licence &mdash;does not apply here. There are definitely clearly set-out statutory grounds for revoking a licence and most of these involve in some way or another a judicial determination.  They involve a determination as to whether a person will continue to carry out a property right or will be deprived of that property right with no recourse to the courts.  That seems to me to raise a constitutional issue.  Again, I say this with a certain diffidence and I would welcome the views of other lawyers in the House in relation to this.</P>
    <P>As to the amendment which I have proposed, it is to give recourse to the courts.  It states at (a)</P>
    <P>Where a licence is to be revoked under this section the Bank shall notify the holder not less than sixty days before the day on which such revocation is intended to take effect and the holder may, within thirty days after the date on which the notification is given to the holder, appeal against the revocation to the High Court whose decision shall be final and unappealable.</P>
    <P>Then there is in (b) a provision for a stay of the situation pending the appeal:</P>
    <P>The High Court may, if it thinks it proper to do so, provide by order that a revocation under this section to which an appeal under this subsection relates shall not have effect during the period, or such part of it as it may specify by order, prior to the determination of the appeal.</P>
    <P>I say again, with honesty, that the provisions are borrowed or adapted from the unit trusts scheme, from the cancellation of the registration of a unit trust under the Unit Trusts Bill which was passed in this House.  I would <Col N="1841" /> refer the Minister to section 4, subsection (4) of that Bill, which provides:</P>
    <P>(a) Where a direction in relation to a unit trust scheme is given under the section&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is a direction to cancel registration of a unit trust scheme&mdash;</P>
    <P>the registrar shall notify the manager and the trustee under the scheme of the direction not less than 60 days before the day on which it is intended to take effect, and the manager or trustee may, within 30 days after the date on which the notification is given to the manager or the trustee as the case may be, appeal against the direction of the High Court.  This decision should be final and unappealable.</P>
    <P>Then (b) is a repeat of the section that I read.  In the meantime the High Court may put a stay on the cancellation of the registration of the unit trust scheme.</P>
    <P>I feel that in this case another great weighty argument put forward by the Minister in relation to the granting of licences is not present, and that is the element of confidentiality.  Whatever the importance of the confidential sources of information in relation to the granting of licences there is no value in relation to the revocation of licences of this element of confidentiality because there are statutory grounds for the revocation.  We would be passing a Bill in which the Central Bank, with the consent of the Minister, would have the power to make these important determinations and the total power to revoke licences, and there would be no appeal to the courts in this matter.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the Unit Trusts Bill.  I could refer to other Bills such as the Employment Agency Bill or I could refer to the Livestock Marts Act which has been referred to as a case relating to that.  I think the Minister would accept that the reasons for either granting or revoking a livestock marts licence are nothing like as serious or subjective or important to the community as the reasons for granting or revoking a banking licence.  There is much greater need for us to protect the community, to protect the public, in <Col N="1842" /> relation to a banking licence and the Minister has already stated this in relation to the granting of the licence, and also in connection with the revocation of the licence.  Very serious matters, as I read them, are set forth in the section for revoking the licence.  They show that this is an important determination.</P>
    <P>In the Livestock Marts Act there was at least a procedure for inquiry into the revocation of a licence and this procedure was referred to very strongly by the Supreme Court.  I, at least, in reading the Supreme Court judgement, quite honestly get the impression that if this procedure for inquiry had not existed the Supreme Court would have come down on the side of the President of the High Court and upheld his findings that this part of the Act was unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>If I might refer again to the judgement of Mr. Justice Walsh of the Supreme Court in that case.  In page 94 of <i>The Irish Law Times Reports</i> he says:</P>
    <P>Where the Minister proposes to revoke a licence because of a contravention of regulations, that is to say because the licensee has been convicted of a breach of the regulations, the Minister shall notify the licensee of his proposal to revoke the licence and if within seven days after receiving such notification the licensee makes a request to the Minister for the holding of an inquiry in relation to the matter the Minister shall cause an inquiry to be held unless he has already decided not to revoke the licence as a result of consideration of representations made to him.  Even if no such representations are made the Minister shall not revoke the licence until the expiration of one month after giving the notification.</P>
    <P>That paragraph clearly contemplates the Minister receiving representations and being prepared perhaps to act upon them by deciding not to revoke the licence and also for the giving of a formal request for the holding of an inquiry.  Paragraph (c) makes it clear that where an inquiry is asked for and where the Minister has not decided not to revoke the licence then he shall not revoke it until he has considered the report of the person holding the inquiry.  An <Col N="1843" /> inquiry, where held, is to be held by a practising barrister of at least ten years' standing and he is given power by paragraph (d) to take evidence on oath, which he is, by that provision, authorised to administer and then shall make a report to the Minister of his findings at the inquiry.  At the inquiry naturally one of the proofs would have to be the fact of the conviction for breach of the regulation but in addition the person holding the inquiry must consider for the purpose of making findings of fact all the matters put forward by the licensee in support of his plea that his licence should not be revoked by the Minister.  The function of the barrister holding the inquiry is to make his findings of fact in respect of these matters and in view of the statutory provision it is clearly not open to the Minister to arrive at any different findings when he comes to consider the report.  The Minister's duty is then to consider whether, in view of the findings and of the conviction, he will revoke the licence.</P>
    <P>The expression in paragraph (e) entitling the licensee to appear in person at the inquiry or by counsel or solicitor and to adduce evidence, coupled with the fact that by virtue of the statutory provision already referred to the Minister is bound by the findings of fact of the barrister holding the inquiry and, having regard also to the express statutory provision in subsection (7) of section 3 that when the Minister revokes a licence he shall cause a statement of his reasons for so doing to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, gives this particular procedure a very special character.  It has very many characteristics of judicial proceedings and the provision whereby the Minister must state his reasons by laying them before each House of the Oireachtas is in effect an appeal procedure in as much as the reasons may then be compared with the proceedings themselves and with the findings of fact made by the inquiring barrister, and the matter may be litigated in the courts if it should appear that the Minister's reasons <Col N="1844" /> disclose a disregard of the findings of fact made at the inquiry or that the Minister has taken into account considerations which he is not permitted to take into account.</P>
    <P>I read that judgment of Mr. Justice Walsh at some length because it illustrates the importance laid by the Supreme Court in the case of the Livestock Marts Act on the inquiry into the revocation of a licence for a livestock mart.  The inquiry would be held by a barrister of ten years' standing. There would be the possibility of legal representation at this inquiry, and the Minister would be bound by the findings of fact of that inquiry.</P>
    <P>The grounds for doing this would be that the holders of the livestock mart had been in contravention of regulations under the section.  The reasons for revoking a banking licence under this Bill are much more nebulous and much more dangerous than the contravention or non-contravention of regulations under that Act.  I have referred to them and I do not want to delay the House on it.  If the holder becomes unable to meet his obligations to a creditor or suspends payment lawfully due by him, who is going to determine that?  If the holder is convicted on indictment of an offence under any provision of this Bill, an offence involving fraud, dishonesty or breach of trust, we may ask what sort of fraud, dishonesty or breach of trust. These are matters, surely, on which there ought to be an ultimate appeal to the courts.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, and the basic grounds that I should not like to stand over the constitutionality of the provision as it stands, I would ask the Minister in this case, which I think is much stronger than the case of granting a licence, to allow this amendment granting an appeal to the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, I should like to support Senator Robinson's amendment or some similar amendment. The Minister will appreciate that we have in the Bill three distinct processes.  First of all, there is the granting of the licence, and the Minister has given reasons for not accepting Senator Robinson's previous amendment, which included recourse to the <Col N="1845" /> High Court.  The second is an amendment of an existing licence, and both the Minister and Senator Robinson pointed out that the licensee can have recourse to the courts.  The third is the most serious one, which includes the provision whereby the Central Bank, after consultation with the Minister, can revoke what has been given, in other words the livelihood of a person or a corporation.  That is far and away the most serious step which the Central Bank could take.  I do not pretend to be a lawyer, but some of the reasons set out here seem to be rather dubious. Subsection (1) (g) states:</P>
      <P>If the holder fails to maintain a deposit in the bank of an amount determined in accordance with section 13 of this Act,</P>
      <P>Included in the deposit are Government securities.  If Government securities were to reduce in value, and they have been known to reduce in value, does that mean that the holder would automatically lose his licence?</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) (h) states:</P>
      <P>if the holder is convicted on indictment of an offence under any provision of this Act or an offence involving fraud, dishonesty or breach of trust,</P>
      <P>Who is the holder?  If a member of his staff is convicted under this provision does that mean that the holder, who may be a person or a corporation, loses his licence if the bank appeals to the Minister to support the abolition of the licence?</P>
      <P>I think Senator Robinson made a very good case for this.  If the wording of her amendment is not acceptable to the Minister, something along the lines of her amendment should be accepted in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the main argument which the Minister has for refusing the last amendment proposed by Senator Robinson does not apply at all to this amendment, that is the question of the sources of information. Here that does not arise at all.  There is no question of having to protect any source of information.  The question <Col N="1846" /> here is one of revocation on specific grounds which are set out in section 11 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It seems to me, therefore, that the arguments which were made for an appeal to the High Court in relation to the grant of a licence, which I believed were very strong, are all the stronger in the case of a licence already granted being revoked.  That is so if for no other reason than the wording of section 11 (1) (i) which entitles the bank, with the consent of the Minister, to revoke a licence:</P>
      <P>if, since the grant of the licence, the circumstances relevant to the grant have changed and are such that, if an application for a licence were made in the changed circumstances, it would be refused.</P>
      <P>We have to consider this in the context of the remarks made by the Minister in relation to section 9 when he pointed out that one of the considerations which could apply, in relation to the grant of a licence, would be the question of Government policy.  So long as section 11 (1) (i) remains without any protection by way of appeal the situation will be extremely fluid so far as the holders of licences are concerned. It means, in effect, that so long as the danger of change in Government policy exists, and it might change from day to day or year to year or it might change from one Minister for Finance to another, no one or no body, who has been granted a licence, can feel safe or sure that the licence will not be revoked merely at the whim of a Minister for Finance or a whimsical change of Government policy in relation to banking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I am exaggerating the picture here.  The Minister made it quite clear this evening that one of the grounds on which a licence might be refused would be the question of Government policy.  His justification as to why the reins should remain in the hands of the Minister for Finance, rather than be given to a High Court judge, was that matters of Government policy in relation to banking existed. Having regard to the existence of this paragraph it is essential in relation to the revocation of a licence that some <Col N="1847" /> independent review body should be available.  The suggestion has been made of a High Court judge.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept that suggestion perhaps he will put forward some alternative.  Some appeal tribunal is necessary as regards the revocation of a licence.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House on this point or to speak later on this section.  While I am on my feet I want to put this point to the Minister also. While this section is worded in the permissive sense rather than the mandatory sense, it would be thought by anyone reading the Bill that these are the grounds on which a licence will be revoked.  In that context I want to ask the Minister if he would explain paragraph (e) in more detail than it is set out in the Bill.  One of the grounds for revocation of a licence is &ldquo;if the holder, being a company, is being wound up&rdquo;.  Normally, when that kind of provision is made, certainly in legal arrangements&mdash;I am sure Senator Nash and Senator Eoin Ryan will agree with me on this&mdash;there is usually a saver put in in the case of companies being wound up &ldquo;in the course of reconstruction&rdquo; or &ldquo;for the purposes of reconstruction&rdquo;. It would seem to me that the same kind of exception should be made here. Obviously, it would not be the intention of the Minister or of the Central Bank to revoke the licence of a holder which is a company if, by agreement all round, including agreement with the Central Bank, the company is being wound up purely for the purpose of reconstruction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may deal with the last point made by Senator O'Higgins; as he pointed out, the section is permissive rather than mandatory.  I do not think it is realistic to visualise a banking company which is being wound up for the purpose of reconstruction finding itself in the position where the Central Bank rushes in immediately and revokes its licence.  Obviously that is not what happens.  It is simply that the Central Bank may, where a company is being wound up for purposes other than that envisaged by Senator O'Higgins, revoke a licence, for example, because the <Col N="1848" /> company is insolvent.  That is the kind of case that would be covered by this provision.  In a case which would involve reconstruction there could be no question of the Central Bank moving in and revoking the licence.</P>
      <P>I want to make this point about this section in relation to the amendment. There are nine grounds set out here on which a licence may be revoked.  The first eight of them are factual.  Indeed, some of them even envisage a judicial finding.  For instance, paragraph (f) envisages a judicial determination because the expressions &ldquo;unable to meet his obligations to his creditors&rdquo; and &ldquo;suspends payments&rdquo; are known to banking law and could only arise on judicial determination taking place.  If all of those eight grounds are examined one will find that each one of them involves a determination of fact.  Therefore, if the Central Bank acting on one of those eight grounds revokes a licence, it is open to the licence-holder to apply to the court and to establish that the fact is not as alleged by the Central Bank.  I do not think that there is any problem at all about those eight grounds.  There is automatically&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister is on that point, supposing the licence is revoked, and then the situation envisaged by the Minister comes about, an application is made to the court and the applicant is found to be justified, what happens in the interim?  If the licence has been revoked and he is not able to carry on the banking business, it might be 12 months before the court determination is given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision for what happens at the time of a revocation of a licence, allowing the business to be carried on for the purpose of dealing with creditors, and so on.  I think it is quite clear that in a case such as is envisaged by Senator O'Higgins the courts could be asked, and would in such a case ensure, that the revocation of the licence be held up pending the full hearing of the action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is what I should envisage.  Therefore, in regard to those eight grounds it appears that precisely what is being sought is available, that is an appeal to the court.</P>
      <P>With regard to the last&mdash;the ninth&mdash; ground, what is envisaged there is a situation where there is, say, a takeover of an existing bank which is licensed. That immediately brings up the whole question that we already debated on the previous amendment.  What it amounts to is the granting of a new licence.  If one could not control this, then somebody who would not get, or perhaps had been refused, a licence in the first instance, could by a takeover get a licence.  Clearly, we cannot allow that loophole.  What we are dealing with here is, in effect, the granting of a new licence, and all the arguments which arose in relation to the previous amendment arise in relation to that ground, and I do not propose to go over them again.  As regards the other grounds, because in each case there is a question of fact involved, there is clearly a right of appeal to the court, which can control very rigidly whether or not the Central Bank is complying with the grounds set out in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister's reply to this point is an argument in favour of accepting the amendment.  If the Minister suggests that this is a question of finding a fact on which there would be an appeal to the court, then if the Minister would accept the amendment and give a statutory appeal, with the safeguards that I have put in, that in the interim the revocation would not take effect, or if the court so thought fit, pending the hearing of the point disputing the revocation of the licence, this is an argument for inserting the amendment. The Minister must know from the very fact of his practice as a solicitor that when you say to somebody that he would have an appeal, if a wrong finding was made the question arises how soon could he bring an appeal outside the terms of the Act?  In the meantime, his licence has been revoked ...it could be a matter of months, or even years, before that appeal comes before the court for appeal.  What <Col N="1850" /> happens in the interim?  Not only is that very bad for commercial stability but is most unfair in the sense of mere justice under the Bill.  To me, it is impossible to distinguish this from the position of a revocation of a cancellation of the registration of a unit trust scheme, where an appeal is allowed to the court for an analogous reason set out under the Act which I have quoted to the Minister, where again there is the facility for a stay in proceedings.</P>
      <P>I am at some disadvantage here because I have a fairly limited experience in law to be putting forward the extremely serious points I am putting forward in favour of this amendment. I should be interested to hear what lawyers on the Opposition benches, such as Senator Nash and Senator Ryan, have to say on whether they would consider it desirable to have an appeal to the court under this provision. Further, I should like to hear their comments on the points that I made and did not fully argue.  I had hoped that the Minister would be more ready to accept the argument about the constitutionality of allowing a revocation of a licence for the statutory grounds given, with no appeal to the courts.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer&mdash;without notes on this occasion&mdash;to cases which have been heard, such as the case in relation to the Solicitors Act, 1954.  There was a case heard in 1960, where the practice of solicitors was revoked and it was found to be unconstitutional because it was exercising a judicial power, and the Incorporated Law Society were not a court in that sense, and it did not qualify under Article 37 of the Constitution as being a limited power of a judicial nature in matters other than criminal matters.  It was not a limited power of a judicial nature because the power involved the removal of the means of livelihood of these solicitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly this is not a limited power because it is removing the right to carry on a banking business in Ireland. That is not a limited power: it is an important power in deprivation of property right and on the lines of the argument put forward in the solicitors case.  I do not honestly think that, if the bank were to exercise its power, it would stand up to constitutional <Col N="1851" /> challenge.  If the Minister's answer to me putting forward this amendment is that if this was exercised in a wrong way there would be an appeal to the court, but without the safeguard that I have put in the second half of the amendment, that in the interim, if the court saw fit, the revocation would be suspended pending the hearing.  The Minister must accept that there is a great difference between giving a statutory right within a certain limit of appeal to the High Court and saying that the citizen would have the right of appeal if there was total abuse.  I should be hard put myself to know how to frame that right; it would be an indirect right and there would be a delay of many months in the exercise of that right.  If that is the Minister's argument, I find it very unconvincing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not pursue the point made by Senator Robinson when she quoted the judgement of Mr. Justice Walsh.  However, just in summary, in relation to the inquiry provision in the Marts Act, what his judgment amounted to was to say that this could produce a finding of fact by which the Minister would be bound.</P>
      <P>What I am pointing out is&mdash;and the reason that I did not pursue it is that I thought it was obvious from what I was saying&mdash;that in the case of the first eight grounds, there can only be a question of fact involved.  In relation to those, there is no advantage whatever in providing for an appeal to the courts, which exits anyway.  If it is there, what is the use of adding it in?  We are not improving&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I should think this would be normal procedure which I should expect to happen.  I see no advantage whatever being given to the licensee from the point of view of the Constitution by providing something which already exists, except in relation to the final point and which I have indicated earlier could not be subject to the amendment proposed. Since it cannot be applied to that and since it is not necessary in the other cases, I see no reason at all for accepting this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I must pursue this because I do not follow the Minister's logic.  He is telling me the remedy for a person whose bank licence has been revoked is to have recourse to the courts.  He is telling me that an injunction could be applied for in relation to stopping the revocation of the licence.  In other words, a most cumbersome and most difficult procedure, instead of granting the very simple procedure in the amendment which is precisely the right to apply to <Col N="1853" /> the court and the possibility that the court may direct that the revocation would be suspended pending the hearing of it.  The Minister is replying to me in terms of my amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>If it exists already in the terms of what we are talking about, then why would it have been introduced in the Unit Trust Bill in an identical way?  Why would it have been introduced in other Bills such as the Employment Agency Bill in similar circumstances?  If I might quote the provisions in the Unit Trust Bill for the cancellation of the registration of the unit trust scheme section 4:</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of this section if in relation to a registered unit trust scheme there is a contravention of a provision of this Act or of an order thereunder.</P>
      <P>If that is not a question of fact, find me a question of fact.  The Minister has described the provisions under section 11 as questions of fact.  That is one of the reasons for cancelling the registration of a unit trust scheme and there is a right of appeal to the courts in the identical terms that I am trying to introduce into the Central Bank Bill. There is no feeling that this is unnecessary or undesirable.  Is it not necessary and desirable that a fair hearing be given to a person who will be deprived of a very important property right, deprived of a banking licence? The Minister is saying to them: &ldquo;We will give you no statutory right of appeal under this section of the Bill, but we do not argue that you might have a right of going to the courts and pleading the circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not precisely the Senator's own argument in relation to section 10 concerning the alteration of conditions?  The Senator made the case that it was not necessary to provide the right of appeal because it already existed under the Supreme Court judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 10 my argument was that the Central Bank would be entitled to attach conditions <Col N="1854" /> to individual licences.  This worried me. I went to the judgement of the Supreme Court in Livestock Marts Act and found that they had upheld a similar provision of attaching individual conditions and had stated that there must be a reason for these conditions, there must be constitutional justice and that, if it were arbitrary, there would be an appeal.</P>
      <P>This has nothing to do with the question of revoking a licence and the procedure available, in justice, to the person whose licence has been revoked if they want to contest it.  I am saying that, in relation to banking licences as in relation to unit trust schemes, we must build this right of appeal into the Act. I think that my argument is reinforced by the Minister's own reaction of saying that this would be the proper course of action, but that they will not have a statutory right to do it, with a safeguard within a certain period and that the revocation is suspended in the meanwhile. The Minister says they can seek a declaration.  Senator Ryan will know that that might be a very delaying procedure.  They can seek an injunction. This seems to me to be an extraordinary way of going about the remedy if it is the only remedy and the Minister, I think, is agreeing to that.  I was to some extent persuaded by the Minister when he said that the question of granting a licence to carry on a banking business here could be very much a policy matter, a matter of how many banking concerns one could have, and very much a matter of great confidentiality, for which the sources of the information would have to be protected.  It might be different from a unit trust scheme. But I cannot see, in relation to the operation of banking licences and unit trust schemes, why banks should be discriminated against.  I cannot see why they should not have the same statutory right of appeal to the court written into the Bill since the Minister is saying that this would be their only recourse anyway. It is something which would be very hard to deal with if it were not written in.  I do not see the logic in not accepting this amendment.</P>

      <P>May I make one other brief point, because it is something that has caused considerable confusion to Members on all sides of the House today?  Last summer we were seriously discommoded because of the fact that there was a complete rewiring of the warning bells being carried out throughout the House and its environs.  Every morning when either the Dáil or Seanad is sitting those of us who arrive here early are seriously discommoded by the ringing of the Division Bells.</P>

      <P>Surely it is in order to ensure that the Division Bells operate properly?  Any morning, when those of us who come early arrive, the Division Bells are being checked for an hour at a time&mdash;physically checked by the method of the bells being rung and inspected to make sure that they are ringing and that the bulbs are lighting. One would have thought that, considering they were completely rewired last year, these bells would have been able to operate less than 12 months later.  Surely when the Clerk of the <Col N="1857" /> Seanad presses the switch he is doing no more than ensuring that an electrical circuit exists to light the bulbs?</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 11 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section I wish to make two short points.  In case it <Col N="1858" /> should be misunderstood, seeing that I spoke strongly in favour of the amendment to this section, the reason I did not vote was simply because I was paired and was not permitted to vote. It was not a case of boycotting the vote in any sense.</P>
      <P>On the other point, the Minister has been good enough to give me the explanation.  It might be pinpointed because it is not clear at this stage in the Bill.  The attaching of conditions to licences in section 10 does not in section 11 appear as a ground of revocation&mdash;that the holder failed to comply with a condition attaching to the licence.  I understand that the reason for that is that one of the later sections makes it an offence not to comply with a condition&mdash;that is section 58&mdash;and that section 11 will require a conviction for an offence under the Bill.  Consequently, the position is that, if a person fails to comply with a condition attached to a licence under section 10, it will not <i>ipso facto</i> be grounds for revocation of a licence under section 11; but if a person is convicted of failure to comply with a condition as an offence under the Bill then the power of revocation under section 11 will exist. I believe that is a correct summary of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

This phrase refers to the manner in which the publication would take place.</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) of section 12 states:</P>
      <P>The bank shall as soon as may be after the revocation of a licence publish notice of the revocation in such manner as it thinks fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I refer to the comments made by the Minister in relation to the last amendment, which he did not deem fit to accept?  The Minister was asked about the fact that, if a licence was revoked, the revocation would take effect immediately.  Here we have a provision that as soon as may be notice will be published of this revocation. This would create one of the problems that the amendment was introduced to obviate.  The amendment sought the possibility of suspending the revocation pending a hearing in the court.  If the person who held the licence being revoked wished to dispute that and wished to go to the court, either to test the constitutionality of the Act or the evocation, and if the bank has already <Col N="1860" /> publicised the revocation of the notice, this could cause great hardship.  Even if the court finds in his favour, this will not redeem the fact that the revocation has already been publicised.  I would ask for clarification as to whether there is any way of delaying the notice of the revocation if it is known that the person would seek to dispute either the constitutionality of the section under which the revocation was made or would seek in some indirect way to have recourse to the courts, since there is no recourse under the section itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Senator, under section 11, subsection (2), there is a procedure laid down that whenever the Bank proposes to revoke a licence it is obliged to give notice in writing to the holder of the licence that it intends to seek the consent of the Minister to the revocation and of the reasons for the revocation; that the holder has 21 days thereafter in which to make representations in writing to the Minister and that the Minister must consider such representations before deciding on the revocation.  Therefore, the holder has notice of the Bank's intention to revoke the licence.  The notice is such that the holder has ample time, if he wishes to apply to the court either at that stage or immediately after the determination by the Minister, for an injunction.  I would think that such an application would certainly receive considerable publicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to subsection (3), would it not be necessary to impose an obligation on the Bank to notify the various registrars and officers of the revocation of a licence?  I am thinking of the kind of situation where the Bank publishes in a way which, for some reason or other, does not come to the notice of these officers.  Does it not seem to be necessary to provide that the Registrar of the Supreme Court will in fact be informed of the revocation of licences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I would agree with he Senator.  The wording in subsection 3) implies that, I think, because there an obligation to inform them of the the names of licence holders.  Therefore, <Col N="1861" /> if the information has been furnished to the Registrar previously in relation to the holder of a licence whose licence is then revoked, it seems to me to imply the obligation to inform the Registrar of the revocation of the licence because that person is no longer a holder of a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to assume a judicial mantle here but I doubt if I would agree with the Minister here.  It would seem to me that the obligation under subsection (3) is discharged when the notification is given of the holders.  If there is a subsequent withdrawal, unless there is a definite obligation on the Bank to notify these officers of the withdrawal, a situation could arise where there is an incorrect list of holders in the possession of the Registrar of the Supreme Court and the other officers concerned.  It is a thing that should be looked at anyhow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator is correct in his interpretation of subsection (3). In any event the purpose of notifying the Registrar is to ensure that the courts will be in a position to notify the Central Bank of any judgements or decrees issued against a licence holder. Even if the Senator's interpretation of subsection (3) is correct I do not think there is any damage done by reason of the fact that there is a decree obtained against the person who was a licence holder and whose licence is revoked, this will not be of any significance in relation to the operations of the Central Bank under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am not quite satisfied with the Minister's reply to the question I raised on section 12, subsection (2).  The Minister will accept that when the Bank proposes to revoke a licence under section 11 subsection (2), and the person is notified and wishes to make representations to the Minister, there is a period there and the Minister said that at that stage the person could have recourse to the court.  He will accept that no court would take jurisdiction; it is a matter for the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister has come to a decision on that the wording of section 12, subsection (2), is that the bank then revokes the licence and publicises the revocation.  Unless somebody was extremely swift in instituting proceedings in some way there would be a publicised revocation of their licence and no leeway in appealing to the court, as I tried to provide in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should think all that would be required there would be for the licence holder to inform the Bank that he intended to apply to the court in the event of an unfavourable decision by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put it further than that.  It should be realised that the question of the revocation of a licence is so serious that it is unlikely ever to arise; but in the event of its arising it would be a very serious case in which one could be almost certain that the licence holder could not have a hope <Col N="1863" /> of succeeding by any appeal to the court.  It would be a very rare occurrence. The Central Bank would be very loathe to take this action, but the remedy must be there.  The concern which is being expressed here, while perhaps justifiable, is concern in respect of a situation that, almost certainly, will not arise.  The House may take it that the approach of the Central Bank in this matter will certainly be one of regard to the rights of a licence holder. I could not conceive of a situation in which, if a licence holder, having got notice of intention to revoke the licence, notified the Central Bank of his intention to apply to the courts, the Central Bank would rush ahead to publish notice of the revocation in such circumstances. It is quite inconceivable to me that that would happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly that does nullify the meaning of the words &ldquo;shall as soon as may be&rdquo; if there is this leeway.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3) to add after &ldquo;increase&rdquo; in line 38 the following:&mdash;&ldquo;If the amount of the deposit exceeds the amount required under subsection (2) of this section the Bank shall pay out the surplus at the request of the holder of such licence in the Bank not later than seven days after the date of the receipt by the Bank of such request.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have moved this amendment in a spirit of justice to the banks as well as realising that it is proper the Central Bank should have the power to require that the deposit be maintained at a certain percentage and should have the power to call upon the banks to do this. Subsection (3) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of the deposit shall, where necessary, be increased to the appropriate amount re-calculated under subsection (2) of this section <Col N="1864" /> by the holder of the licence concerned not later than seven days after the date of the receipt by him of notification from the Bank of the amount required to effect the increase.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes to add:</P>
    <P>If the amount of the deposit exceeds the amount required under subsection (2) of this section the Bank shall pay out the surplus at the request of the holder of such licence in the Bank not later than seven days after the date of the receipt by the Bank of such request.</P>
    <P>It may be an unlikely circumstance, but it is certainly not one that is beyond our powers to imagine, and if the amount deposited exceeds the amount required under subsection (2) of this section then I think in justice that the Bank should be required, if requested to do so, to pay out the surplus amount. In relation to large banking concerns that might be quite a substantial amount and might make a difference to their fluidity.  Surely, on the basis of reciprocity and fairness, if they are required to bring up the amount of the deposit within seven days to a fixed figure, if the amount when the calculation is made exceeds that figure, then I cannot see why, at their request, payment should not be made.  This is my reason for inserting the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not think this amendment is necessary, because the kernel of the provision is that if a bank has an excess deposit, that excess ceases to be part of the statutorily required deposit under the section and becomes an ordinary deposit, which can be drawn down on demand by the bank. Therefore, I do not think this is necessary.  In practice, a fair rate of interest is paid on money deposited by banks with the Central Bank, whether part of the statutory deposit or otherwise. Also, most banks maintain deposits with the Central Bank in the ordinary course.  As a practical matter I think we can assume that many licence holders would prefer to leave the excess with the Central Bank, earning interest to cover possible future deficiencies, rather than to be put to <Col N="1865" /> the trouble of making regular adjustments in line with short-term fluctuations in their businesses.  Therefore, in practice most licence holders would not require this; but, if they do, they already have it, as the position is that they can withdraw the money if they want to.</P>

      <P>In view of the Minister's explanation of this, and in view of the fact that any amount exceeding the deposit required would no longer form part of the deposit under this section and could be withdrawn, I withdraw this amendment.</P>

      <P>How is the maximum figure of £500,000 in subsection (1) arrived at?  That would be quite a small proportion of the reserves and net assets of either of the two big banking groups; but it might be a very substantial proportion of the assets of a smaller banking group.  Should there not be some relationship between the deposit and the reserves and assets?</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of these deposits is the protection of deposit holders with the commercial banks.  In the case of the maximum deposit of £500,000, this is quite substantial to meet the normal claims that would arise.  On the other hand, the larger the banking group, the bigger the spread of the corporations, the less risk there is to the depositor.  Proportionately, the degree of protection required by the depositor is not as great in dealing with a very large bank as in dealing with a small bank, in modern circumstances in this country.  That is the reason behind it.  It does not follow that the deposit has to be in proportion all the way, but the figures are arrived on the basis of trying to be fair both to the public, who require protection, and to the commercial banks themselves.  I think the figures reach a reasonable level of compromise between these two requirements.</P>
