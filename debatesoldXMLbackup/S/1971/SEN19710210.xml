      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That in relation to motions other than Government motions the following provisions shall apply&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  one full sitting day in each month shall, unless the Seanad otherwise orders, be devoted to such motions,</P>
      <P>(b)  the time allowed for the debate on a motion shall, unless the Seanad otherwise orders, not exceed a period of six hours in the aggregate and at the expiration of this period, if the proceedings on the motion have not previously concluded, the Cathaoirleach shall put forthwith the question or questions necessary to bring them to a conclusion,</P>
      <P>(c)  the speech of a Senator proposing a motion shall not exceed 30 minutes, and the Senator proposing, or such other Senator who has not already spoken as he may authorise in that behalf, shall be entitled to not more than 20 minutes for a speech in reply; the speech of any other Senator in the course of the debate shall not exceed 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remind the House that this motion is moved on behalf of the Committee of Procedure and Privileges which are representative of the three parties in the House and of the Independent group.  The decision to put it forward was the unanimous decision of <Col N="584" /> the Committee and expresses the views of the whole Committee of Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it is necessary to second this motion.  If it is I do so.  There is one point I should like to make.  There was a general understanding at the Committee of Procedure and Privileges meeting that this motion would be operated by the House, if it is accepted in the general sense of taking one month with another.  There should be a certain amount of freedom allowed to the Leader of the House in making arrangements for Ministers to attend here in connection with Seanad motions.  A situation might arise where more than one day in a particular month, where two days, for example, might be devoted to motions in lieu of a day in the following month, if it happened to fall in with the arrangements of the House and of Ministers that that should be done.</P>
      <P>I simply want to record my understanding that the intention was that, while the motion is in particular terms, the House would be understanding if it were necessary, in order to convenience the House and at the same time to convenience Ministers, for the Leader of the House to ask us that in one particular month we should devote, say, a day at the beginning of the month and at the end of the month to motions and that none would be taken the next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask if the Leader of the House can give us any indication of which of the motions we can accept to have taken first and how soon, in his estimation, that will be?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly have no intention of opposing this motion and, like other Senators, I welcome the guarantee that a sitting day in each month will be devoted to the many motions on the list.  I should like to have some clarification of what is meant by one full sitting day in each month and some assurance that the Seanad cannot be adjourned <i>sine die</i> for a long period.  Even if there is <Col N="585" /> not Government business created by Bills or motions, the Seanad should meet regularly during term for the purpose of taking these motions.  I am sure the Senators would welcome an undertaking to this effect by the Leader of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Robinson, I think this a motion which is deserving of our support and I am grateful for the efforts of the Leader of the House on our behalf.  There is one small point I should like to make in connection with paragraph (b), relating to the time allowed for a motion of this kind.  Although I appreciate that demands on people and Ministers in the legislation of the House are reasonably heavy, it has often occurred to me that we might take a leaf out of a book written in another place.  Perhaps, especially on days like this when motions are being discussed, we might increase, by our own consent, the time devoted to this motion by sitting through a time normally devoted to meals.  It is not the practice to rise for meals in the other House and I think it is one we might take on here as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is provided for in the motion unless the Seanad otherwise orders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Leader of the House concludes this debate there are just two points I should like to advert to.  Firstly, I should like to dissent from Senator Horgan's anxiety to follow the digestive habits of another place.  This House should adhere to the custom which we have had.  We can, with goodwill, manage to arrange our business without the invasion of the time for eating at a reasonable rate, as has been our custom.  The second point is that Senator O'Higgins has placed on record his understanding of the saving clause in paragraph (a) whereby the Seanad might by order vary from a strict one day a month rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to place on record my understanding of the saving phrase in paragraph (b) which is to the effect that the time allowed shall be six hours, unless the Seanad otherwise <Col N="586" /> orders, and to place on record my understanding that this is operable in both directions.  By agreement, a sitting day which was being devoted to motions might be devoted to two motions on which the sponsors in the House were both agreed that each of these should not occupy more than a few hours.  Secondly, in regard to motions some of which we have on the Order Paper&mdash;motions in regard to such wide-ranging topics as the EEC, the Buchanan Report, <i>et cetera</i>&mdash;the House would order more than one sitting day for the discussion of these motions.  It is on the understanding that this phrase &ldquo;unless the Seanad otherwise orders&rdquo; would be interpreted as operating in both directions I supported this proposition in the Committee and support it here in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that that was not my interpretation. My interpretation was that the six hours would be devoted to a motion or motions, as the House so desired, and that the question would then be put and that there was no question of adjourning to a second day.  I would be totally against that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that we should take this as it is on the Order Paper and, as I understand it, that leaves the power of decision with the House: if the House should decide that a motion was of such importance or likely to be of such length that it would require more than the six hours, it is open to the House to make an order to that effect in accordance with this motion as it stands.  I do not think the House is necessarily obliged to devote the entire six hours to a motion.  Senator Ó Maoláin's reading of the motion would involve, whether the House liked it or not, that six hours must be devoted to the motion; I do not think that that is intended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Relative to Senator O'Higgins' statement, if extra time were desired I see no reason why Senator Horgan's proposition could not then be adopted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we take up consideration of the Report Stage of this Bill, I should like to indicate that I have ruled amendments Nos. 7 and 9, in the names of Senators Alexis FitzGerald and Boland, out of order as they involve new matters of substance which were not effectively before the Committee on the Bill.  The Senators have been notified accordingly. Amendments Nos. 1, 2, 5 and 6 may be taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 28, to delete &ldquo;if he thinks fit,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;whenever he determines that it is expedient to do so, by order,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purposes of these amendments are well known to the House.  The reasons for them were discussed on Committee Stage and the Minister was asked to consider introducing them himself on Report Stage.  However, as he did not do that Senator FitzGerald and I felt it incumbent on us to introduce them.</P>
      <P>What in effect is happening as the Bill now stands is that in section 3 the Minister may make an establishment order to set up a body corporate to provide services for local authorities and for health boards.  At some future date he can then designate to that body the power to provide those services for some other organisation which is not a local authority and which is not a health board.  Quite surprisingly, considering the procedure which the Minister has to go through to set up a body corporate in the first place, it entails laying an order before both Houses of the Oireachtas and allowing them seven days within which they may enter a motion for annulment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We discover that the Minister does not have to make an order if he decides to adopt this rather strange procedure of extending the services which the body corporate are providing to organisations other than local authorities or health boards.  We felt that this would be a strange step for the Minister to want to take.  Obviously, organisations set up in the local government field would in the main be providing <Col N="588" /> services for local authorities and, to a much lesser extent, for health boards.  Any move to provide those services for some other organisation ought at least to be brought to the notice of the House of the Oireachtas, and the Members of each House of the Oireachtas should be given the opportunity to enter a motion for annulment in the same way as they would get an opportunity to enter a motion for annulment in the first instance.</P>
    <P>That is why we have tabled amendment No. 1, which would merely oblige the Minister to make an order if he so desired to extend those services in the same way as he himself has made it obligatory upon himself to make an order in the first instance, if he wants to set up a body corporate.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 2, 5 and 6 are merely consequential on amendment No. 1 and allow, of course, for the eradication or amendment of the order which the Minister might make.  For this reason these amendments were entered.  We feel that they are worthwhile and that they do not in any way affect the intent of the Bill; they merely make it a little bit more democratic and perhaps a little bit more palatable to those few Members in this House who expressed reservations about various aspects of it.  Probably what we are trying to do now is to correct a little bit of loose draftsmanship that initially crept into the Bill.  It would also be helpful to enter this amendment and have it accepted, because then the Minister would be sure as to where his powers lay.  I got the distinct impression the last day, when the Minister was asked by what power he was going to designate, that he seemed to be rather unsure as to whether his power lay under this Bill.  He had said at first that it did and then he felt that even if his power lay under this Bill it did not oblige him to lay an order before the House which this Bill clearly does. Then he decided that his power lay in the Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries Act.  We felt that rather than have this sort of confusion existing and this uncertainty carrying on, and perhaps giving rise to long and detailed discussion when this Bill goes to the <Col N="589" /> other House, the easiest thing would be to clarify it at this stage and to help the Minister by entering this amendment for him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a word in support of this set of amendments to be moved by Senators Boland and FitzGerald.  It seems to me that there is not any great difference between what the Minister has in mind and what is provided for in the amendments. The difference is, if you like, one of approach.  Under subsection (1) of section 3 the Minister may make an establishment order which will provide for the establishment of a body.  That body can provide services for the Minister or for specified authorities, or for both.</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) the Minister clearly envisages that, having established the body by means of his establishment order and having got them into being, it may prove useful if, instead of limiting the scope of the services which the body may provide either to the Minister or to some specified authority, some other authority could, under this section, be a body designated for the purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that Senators Boland and FitzGerald are advocating is that the Minister should be consistent in the operation of this section, that if he is required by the section, as he is required by the section, to bring the body into being by means of an order, it should not then be open to him simply as he thinks fit to designate another body for which the established body shall perform services.  The only difference lies in whether the Minister is being consistent in saying by means of this section that he should have the authority as he thinks fit to designate any other body or whether he should <Col N="590" /> not be required, when designating that other body, to do it by order.  If he does it by order, there are certain consequences which are laid down in the Bill which flow from that and which will give the Houses of the Oireachtas an opportunity one way or another of considering it.  That, I think, is the only difference.</P>
    <P>I would plead with the Minister to have consistency going through the Bill as a whole and going through the particular subsections of section 3 of the Bill.  It is not weakening his powers; it is not weakening the Bill in any way.  All it requires is that, instead of the Minister making up his mind&mdash;thinking fit, to go back to the phrase used in the section&mdash;he should be required to make a formal order in the matter.  That will not put any great pressure on him or on his officials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  I think it is important from the point of view of administrative law and from the point of view of control over Ministers in making statutory instruments that this type of designation of a body ought to be made by an order which will eventually be laid before the House so that the Houses of the Oireachtas will know what is happening.  As Senator O'Higgins has said, it will not place any great burden on the Minister.  It is the type of control which the Houses of the Oireachtas ought to require of a Minister so that the Committee on Statutory Instruments or the Houses themselves can view the order and can know, because of the value of the publicity, exactly what is happening and exactly which bodies have been designated.  From the point of view of the mechanics of it, I would agree that the amendment does no more than formalise the procedure, but it is important from the point of view of parliamentary control and for this reason I strongly support this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little dubious on this because I have got to confess to the House that I have left all my files behind me&mdash;I do not know where, which is still more worrying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="591" /> I have not therefore got with me the Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries Act but I did check it subsequent to the Minister's speech on the Committee Stage.  It did seem that, as I expected, he was advised to say what was right and said what was right with regard to the legal position.</P>
    <P>What is proposed in these amendments seems to me merely to write into this Bill, when enacted, what you have to look through another Bill to find is the true position.  If lawyers find if difficult to construe an Act it is a bit hard on other people.  It is even hard on lawyers who should not be asked to run around in circles getting things. The civil servants who are advising the Minister have all this stuff, presumably nicely tabulated together, for their own convenience and the proper and efficient working of their Department, and that makes it easy for them to give good advice to the Minister.  It makes it jolly hard, however, for another person who is trying to give good advice to an ordinary client if he has got to race through a whole series of statutes to find wherein is the power of the Minister to do this.  The matter may arise.  It may arise because of court proceedings or rights and liabilities and so on.</P>
    <P>However, where my doubt lies is because&mdash;I think you rely on the designation, for the purposes of subsection (3), in the Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries Act, though I have not got that Act here, unfortunately&mdash;there is a conflict then between section 7 of this Bill and the section in the Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries Act which deals with the question of laying orders made by a Minister before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I think the period specified, in whichever is the relevant section there, is 21 days whereas the period specified in section 7 is seven days.  You may be curing a defect in your Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to emphasise what I said last week that the only effect of designation will be to enable a corporate body to make available services that they were set up to provide, or services of a similar <Col N="592" /> nature, to the designated body.  The terms on which these services will be made available will be agreed between the corporate body and the designated body.  The designation procedure was really decided on just to give the Minister general control over the scope of the activities of the corporate body.  I gave examples last week of the kind of bodies which might be designated under this Bill.  They include vocational education committees, country committees of agriculture, boards of conservators of fisheries, harbour authorities and corporate bodies established under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961.</P>
      <P>I also explained last week that the power to designate would be used only if the bodies in question sought the services which the corporate body were providing.  I think it should be clear from what I said that all that is involved in subsections (2), (3) and (4) of section 3 is that a procedure is being established by which one public body may provide services for another public body.  The decision to seek the services in this way is not a matter of sufficient importance to warrant a statutory order, as such, being made.  On the contrary, it could be argued that this would really be a matter of day to day administration within the Department. The only reason for involving the Minister is that he should retain some general control of the activities of the corporate bodies.  Even though I am not fully convinced that it is appropriate to elevate such a simple procedure as the designation of a body to obtain certain services to the status of a statutory order, at the same time I am prepared to accept amendment No.1 in deference to the views of the Senators and the points which they have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accepting amendment No. 1 I would mention that it is not really unusual that the Bill did not specify the manner in which the designation should be made.  As I said last week, and I do not mind repeating it again, it is not very difficult to cite examples of statutes under which Ministers are given powers, to be exercised in an unspecified way such as to sanction, to consent, to approve, to designate, to certify, to grant or to determine.  All <Col N="593" /> these terms have been used in various statutes down through the years.  But, where the statutes do not prescribe how powers are to be exercised, the practice, certainly in my own Department, is that the decision is recorded by way of a formal instrument.  Generally it is made under seal in accordance with the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  This kind of document is generally but loosely referred to as an order.</P>
    <P>Some of the discussion last week centred around designating.  The Bill itself does not say &ldquo;designated by order&rdquo;; it merely says &ldquo;designate&rdquo;. The Minister could use his powers under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, to record a designation by &ldquo;order&rdquo; purely for the purpose of recording his decision, but it would not be necessary.  However, that was the kind of document that I had in mind when I referred to that Act last week.</P>
    <P>I am accepting amendment No. 1. I believe that amendment No. 2 does not therefore arise.  I do not propose to accept it, as it is unnecessary.  It is really just repeating the word &ldquo;order&rdquo; in the Bill.  Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are designed to give power to amend or revoke a designation order.  I do not consider that such power will be required because the designation will, in itself, simply enable the bodies concerned to make agreements between each other for the provision of whichever services are being provided by the corporate body.</P>
    <P>If, after a designation, the bodies do not make such an agreement or terminate an existing agreement, then it could be assumed that that ends the matter.  Where agreements are reached between two such bodies, they could agree between themselves as to various terms which would be necessary for the successful operation of whichever services are to be provided, and they could include an agreement indicating circumstances under which the corporate body would terminate or would cease to provide the services that the designated body were seeking.  I do not think it is necessary to include a power of amendment or revocation in the <Col N="594" /> Bill.  I take it the House will accept my efforts to meet, in some way, the reasonable points made by some Senators. I propose accepting amendment No. 1. No. 2 is unnecessary and I do not propose to accept Nos. 5 and 6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I, of course, thank the Minister for having accepted amendment No. 1, which I honestly feel improves the Bill and clarifies the whole position in relation to the extension of the powers or the activities of bodies corporate after they have been established. I would indeed be in agreement with him that amendment No. 2 is really superfluous.  Not being a legal gentleman and having neither the defects nor merits of those people, I felt it was safer to insert amendment No. 2 lest it might be felt by some of the parliamentary draftsmen to be a necessary one.</P>
      <P>I am rather taken aback that the Minister would accept amendment No. 1 and not amendment No. 5 which I should have thought would be necessary if the Minister is, by order, to designate a body for whom services may be provided.  My feeling was that at some stage during the provision of those services the body corporate or the body for whom the services were being provided might want the type of services or the extent of the services changed to such a material degree that the order by which the procedure had started might not allow for that change, and that consequently an amendment to the order would be necessary so as to enable the new services or the change in the provision of services to take place easily.  However, if the Minister is quite convinced that amendment No. 5 is not necessary in conjunction with amendment No. 1, we should be prepared to accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other thing might be that, all of us being fallible, it could happen that an order would be made allowing the body corporate to provide services for another body and the title of that other body could be wrongly named in that order.  Where would the Minister find himself if he discovered that the actual drafting of the order had been faulty in its nature or had accidentally excluded one very <Col N="595" /> essential part of the services which that body wanted to be provided for by the body corporate.  My feeling would be that the power to amend was not there and consequently the fault in the order might exclude the provision of those services.  The order would have to stand, because the Minister has pointed out that he does not feel amendment No. 6 to be necessary. Amendment No. 6 would give the Minister power to revoke the order.  If he discovered that he had made a faulty order and had not got the power to amend it or to revoke it, then surely both the Minister and the body corporate and the body for whom services are being provided will feel pretty silly.</P>
    <P>Having made those points I would again thank the Minister for having accepted amendment No. 1, which is the amendment which gives real effect to the argument that we made here last week and which we again presented today.  The other amendments were, we felt, consequential upon it. I am just a little surprised that the Minister has been advised that amendment No. 5 is not necessary but I suppose we must accept this.  I would again thank the Minister.</P>

      <P>There is a real difficulty here.  The original ruling of the Chair was that amendments Nos. 5 and 6 were consequential on amendment No. 1 and they were in fact debated, though not in detail, with it. I think if points are now being raised, as they have been by Senator Boland's concluding speech and by Senator Jessop's intervention in regard to the purport of amendments Nos. 5 and 6, the Chair would be prepared to <Col N="596" /> be indulgent and allow a separate debate on these narrow specific points when these amendments are called.

      <P>I should like to give some clarification as to my reasons for accepting them, because during the Committee Stage I defended the inclusion of both of these subsections, (7) and (8), mainly on the grounds that such provisions are normally included <Col N="598" /> in legislation relating to semi-State bodies and have been so included for a number of years.  Another point was that the principle of separating the Legislature from the Executive is a good one and that it should be followed or adhered to in most cases if possible.  A further point I made was that if the Members of the Dáil or Seanad were members of certain types of corporate bodies, there could be a conflict of interest.  Indeed, I am clearly of the opinion that in the kind of cases where I can envisage a corporate body being established, it would be inappropriate to have a Member of the Dáil or the Seanad acting as a member of such bodies.  However, as the Bill is widely drawn and in deference to the view expressed by the Senators, as I have indicated I am prepared to accept the deletion of subsections (7) and (8).</P>

I again thank the Minister for appreciating the validity of the case that was put to him on Committee Stage and indeed for coming in here and accepting amendments which he had more or less indicated he would not accept on Committee Stage.  The House will probably agree with me that it is a very good thing to see a Minister on reflection agreeing to do something which he originally was not disposed to accept. Indeed, if we had Ministers doing this more often the passage of Bills would surely be speedier and the eventual result would probably be far better.</P>

      <Col N="599" /> Perhaps it is hopelessly out of order for me to say that I think a Minister's stature is increased by welcoming amendments that people have worked upon.  This is a point to be remembered in relation to legislation on Committee and Report Stages.  That is all I will say on that, irrespective of the Minister's attitude to this particular amendment. All I will say with regard to it is that it is in order to facilitate proof, if proof is required, of the orders to be made under this Act.  The language, incidentally, is that taken from a Bill which was debated in the Seanad in July last and is the language of the Minister for Health's advisers.  It relates to precisely this point and was proposed by the Minister for Health as a substitute for a very inadequate amendment that I had put down.</P>

      <P>Every order made under this section shall, as soon as may be after it is made, be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>

This requirement applies to an establishment order, an order under section 3, subsection (10), amending an establishment order, or an order under section 5 revoking an establishment order.  With the acceptance of amendment No. 1, it will also apply to a designation order under section 3, subsection (2).  Because of the requirement to lay the orders in question before each House of the Oireachtas the orders will be statutory instruments to which the Statutory Instruments Act, 1947, primarily applies. Accordingly, under section 3 of that <Col N="600" /> Act, copies of the order must be sent to the National Library, the Law Library and certain other bodies and must be printed under the superintendence of the Stationery Office. Notice of the making of the order and the place where the copies thereof may be obtained must be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  Therefore, I see no reason for publishing any of these orders in full in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, when they are available freely to members of the public and Oireachtas Members generally.

      <P>I did not put down an amendment but I should like to refer at this point to the definition of &ldquo;direction&rdquo; in this section so that I will be able to put down an amendment on Report Stage.  Despite <Col N="601" /> what the Minister said on Second Reading, I think it wholly wrong that anything that could give rise to an offence could depend on an oral direction given by the Minister or an authorised officer of the Minister.  The Minister may be able to tell me some such instances.  If I may say here it seems to be ministerial practice to justify&mdash;I do not mean the present Minister, but Ministers generally&mdash; the retention of sections in Bills because they have appeared in other Bills.  This is a quite invalid mental process.  Either the section in question is a good one or it is not.  The fact that the section is in ten other Bills only means that ten other Bills should be amended, if it is a bad section.  In relation to this, I should like the Minister&mdash;I am not going to ask him to talk about it at this point of time, but between now and Report Stage&mdash; to give consideration to the real necessity of having an oral direction under this Bill, an oral direction which gives rise to, or could give rise to, a criminal offence.  I know it would be more convenient for the Minister and for those in his Department to administer, in the event of this Bill becoming one which would be operable, to be able to rely on an oral direction; but, administratively, anything which has not to be confirmed in writing is bad. It is very much worse if the matter involved is likely to give rise to a charge in the courts where you are going to depend upon a civil servant's word as to whether he gave an oral direction. It is very bad for the Civil Service reputation to have their word questioned in court in the most desperate way that accused persons must, necessarily, question them if they are trying to protect themselves against offences.  I am not going to press the Minister to comment on this at this point of time.  I am merely referring to it so that I may be able, perhaps, to debate an amendment that I intend to put down on this, with consequential amendments, throughout the Bill. I hope that this is a sufficient reference on Committee Stage to enable me to put down amendments that are consequential, without having to get up every time there is a reference to a direction in some section of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to make one or two remarks on the comments of Senator FitzGerald.  I want to emphasise that this Bill is purely a precautionary measure. We hope we will never have to invoke it.  I say that just to put the matter into perspective.  We hope by voluntary measures, which we are already pursuing, to enable sufficient stocks to be arranged in storage tanks owned by oil companies, for instance.  We are always hoping, of course, that what we fear will not arise.  This is a precautionary measure we would like to see on the Statute Book to enable the Government to act swiftly in an emergency situation.  It is in that context that the word &ldquo;orally&rdquo; should be read.  It should be read in the context where a phone call may stop an oil tanker from leaving a port, or not.  I am just quoting that as an illustration.  A phone call may ensure that a coal boat arrives, or that it does not arrive. It is about that type of situation I am talking and I would agree that in the case of normal permanent legislation that would affect the people day in, day out, month in, month out, year in, year out, that the principles enshrined in what the Senator has said are correct and that an oral direction would be highly undesirable in that type of normal permanent legislation.  The Seanad should look at this matter realistically. The word &ldquo;orally&rdquo; is in there as part of this emergency legislation which we, as the Government, are conscientiously introducing as a precautionary measure in the event of a serious fuel shortage where we may have to take immediate and drastic action to corner what fuels we can get hold of as quickly as possible so as to conserve a fuel situation for our benefit through any period of crisis which may arise. It should be read in that context and only in that context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care what context the Minister reads in it.  This may be a precautionary measure and <Col N="603" /> the Minister expresses the hope that it may never be necessary to invoke it, but the point made by Senator Alexis FitzGerald still remains good.  The mere fact that this is a precautionary measure does not answer the point at all.  Either it is right in emergency conditions, to give Ministers the power to give oral directions and to allow those oral directions to have the force of law and amend existing legislation, as is provided for in this Bill, or it is not right.  To my mind it is not right that any Minister should have the power to give a direction which has the force of law and which is capable of amending existing law merely by word of mouth from the Minister.  No hardship would be imposed if the Minister was required to give his directions in writing.  Most of us know how to read and write these days and the Minister is as good a pensman as any of us.  All we would ask him to do is to take a pen in his hand and write out his direction.  This would preserve some semblance of order in legislation of this sort.  The Minister should go further and, in addition to requiring orders to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> as soon as possible after they are made, he should require also that directions be in writing and be published.  If the Minister would accept the need for written directions I would be prepared, in advance, to say &ldquo;All right, if you give us that we will not even ask you to publish them if you do not want to.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If that was what the Senator intended I would agree, but I appreciate fully the necessity of giving a direction orally in certain limited circumstances.  To completely eliminate the power to do that would, to a certain extent, lessen the force and usefulness of this Bill.  I suggest to the Minister that, subsequent to giving an oral direction, that that should be reduced to writing and should be <Col N="604" /> recorded in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> or whatever is appropriate in the circumstances; and that this should be done, if possible, within a certain number of days, say, seven days.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Eoin Ryan on that.  As I understand the Minister, it is a question of timing. An oral communication can be carried out in two or three minutes if the telephone system is working.  Postal communications can be, in my experience in recent times, anything from two to five days.  This is possibly what is worrying Senator O'Higgins.  I would agree with Senator Ryan that the Minister should, perhaps, follow up an oral direction with an instruction in writing. It is important, if there is this sort of emergency which we discussed when this Bill was introduced, that the Minister should have the power to issue an immediate order or instruction in order to preserve fuel supplies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Ryan's suggestion was very helpful indeed.  The implications of what he is suggesting would be that this would be an essential preliminary for example, to a prosecution: that there should have been a recording in writing made authoritatively within a certain period of time after the direction. I remain unconvinced, in modern circumstances, that an oral direction is necessary to deal with any situation. There are a number of State representatives around the country who can be authorised by the Minister to speak on his behalf, to write on his behalf and to deliver a communication on his behalf.  Subject to correction, I think the signature on a telegram is in fact written.  I think I am correct in that under the interpretation of a couple of the major Acts.  A telex communication, which would probably be used by the Department in dealing with large operators, would also be in writing. It might be desirable to extend the definition of what is written.  As a compromise I would be prepared to accept what Senator Eoin Ryan has suggested, but I should prefer if the oral direction system was not operated at all.  You will be transmitting an oral communication to whom, for example?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="605" /> To what person, at what level in the company? Will the manager or the directors be responsible and guilty of offences? A body corporate can be prosecuted.  The telephonist may be the person who receives the oral direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is written the office have to make their arrangements to deal with such communications and it is they who must take all responsibility if they do not make such arrangements.  An oral direction may come through any sort of person and may, if not complied with, be rendering people liable for offences.  I agree that Senator Ryan's suggestion here does provide a defence for people if the direction has to be confirmed in writing within a particular period of time.  Apart from defences against criminal prosecutions, there is the whole question of the loss that may be suffered by a body placing an order, or acting in good faith unaware of the advice the Minister is getting and the decisions he has got to make.</P>

      <P>Would it not meet the situation in a state of emergency if a direction is made by the Minister that fuel cannot be exported from any port, Kenmare or wherever it may be? He has not had time to communicate this order.  Once the direction is made, it can be communicated by telephone, on television or on radio and no injustice is done to anyone.  I can readily visualise situations so urgent that the Minister would have to make an order immediately.  He would have to communicate it within ten minutes afterwards. He would have no opportunity of communicating it in writing.  He could not tell a local garda to write it out for him and deliver it despite all the agencies throughout the country. I think that might meet the objections that are raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This might give the Minister something to think about anyhow.  I do appreciate the difficulties of a situation of the type envisaged by the Minister and which was referred to by him when he was replying to the Second Reading debate.  Senators Ryan <Col N="606" /> and Nash referred to the types of emergencies which might arise.  I feel very strongly that Senator Alexis FitzGerald is right in his approach to this and I am wondering if it might not be possible to combine both points of view by at least inserting into the Bill some guideline as to what would constitute an emergency in which the Minister would feel justified in giving an oral direction.  If the Bill is accepted in its present form, with the definition of direction as meaning oral or written, it would apply to conditions which might not be regarded as a real live emergency.  The Minister would be justified, with the sanction of this Bill, in giving oral directions even where every Member of this House would feel that the situation was such that he could very well have written directions instead and that there was no immediate emergency which required instant action on his part.  The Minister should write into the Bill some guideline as to what conditions would justify the giving of an oral direction.  There are going to be very considerable difficulties of proof with regard to oral directions.  There is no limit at all to what the Minister could do.  I am not for a moment suggesting <i>mala fides</i> on the part of any Minister, present or future.  If we take this piece of legislation, as proposed, there is no limit or restriction&mdash;good, bad or indifferent&mdash;as to what a Minister may be entitled to do by means of oral order or oral direction. I do not think that is good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that under Emergency Powers Orders a Minister is entitled to make oral orders, but there is no publication required for directions. That is one thing that we have to bear in mind.  There is publication required for orders but there is no publication required for directions.  If a Minister, while alone, decides to make an oral order and to sing it aloud in his bath, under this Bill it would still be an oral direction given by the Minister.  If the Minister came along afterwards and said: &ldquo;Well, I did give an oral direction&rdquo; who is to contradict him? Where is the proof? As was pointed out on the Second Reading, the consequence of the Minister's singing aloud in his <Col N="607" /> bath could be that someone finds himself guilty of a criminal offence, because the Minister says &ldquo;I did give an oral direction, and that oral direction was not complied with&rdquo;.  There is no obligation on the Minister to bring the oral direction to the notice of the person who is going to be affected by it.  I feel that the Minister must think a lot more deeply on this question.  I do not want to be an obstructionist in any way in dealing with this but there are very weighty reasons against accepting the Bill in its present form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Higgins' objections are met by subsection (2) of section 3.  Directions can be given only in an order, according to that.  The only power in this Bill at all in the giving of directions is under that subsection:</P>
      <P>An order made by the Minister under this section may contain all such incidental or ancillary provisions, including the power to grant or issue such authorisations or licences and give such directions as shall appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient for giving full effect to any provision inserted in such order...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is by order the Minister gives directions. I can visualise the situation where a Minister must make his order and give his directions immediately and within an hours time he may have to communicate with somebody.  Therefore, the Minister should have power to communicate the orders only.  There is full written authority for the direction and the order has been made.  The Minister will make the order incorporated in the direction.  Having done so, he tells his civil servant or somebody else to telephone such-and-such a boat in Bantry Bay and tell them &ldquo;I have made an order, including a direction, that they shall not remove their boat of fuel oil from Bantry Bay&rdquo;. It is absolutely essential to have it that way and he must be entitled to communicate it verbally.  However, it is ambiguous in the wording of direction, because it appears to conflict with subsection (2) of section 3.  The direction means a direction given, whether orally or in writing.  Perhaps if you treat the word &ldquo;given&rdquo; as different from the <Col N="608" /> word &ldquo;made&rdquo; it is all right, because the direction is already made.  Once it is made it can be given either orally or in writing, but it must be made in writing and it must be made antecedent to its being given.</P>

      <P>As the Minister has explained, since this is legislation which is only to be brought in in an emergency, I think there is justification for being able to act very quickly under this Bill.  I am wondering if it might be possible to allow the word &ldquo;direction&rdquo; to include an oral or written direction with a proviso that, if there is an oral direction, this will be confirmed in writing as soon as possible. This will allow the exercise of the immediate oral direction and yet allow the confirmation in writing, so that the person would know and that there would be proof that the order had been given.  In other words, there would not be the justifiable apprehension that a person might be guilty of a criminal offence for contravention of an oral command.  If the direction made under the authority of the original order of the Minister was confirmed in writing as soon as possible afterwards, perhaps within a short period afterwards, then this would take away some of the objections to the meaning of the word &ldquo;direction&rdquo;.  I have not put down an exact amendment but I propose an amendment of that sort.</P>

      <P>I shall not reiterate the fact that this is emergency legislation and that the purpose is to act quickly in a situation.  I wish to emphasise in connection with it that there is the protection built into it that it is only after a Government order, followed by a ministerial order, that the Minister can make the direction envisaged in section 1.  I shall stick to my first point that an oral direction in certain circumstances is essential.  However, what has been said by Senators and, in particular by Senator Mrs. Robinson and Senator Ryan in regard to haphazard oral direction, particularly with the possibility of prosecution or some form of criminal involvement or civil proceedings, will be met by an amendment which I shall introduce on Report Stage.  This will be an amendment on the lines of a confirmation in <Col N="609" /> writing of any such oral direction within X hours.  I think it would meet the concern of the Seanad if I wrote into that section that any oral direction must be confirmed by written direction by the Minister within X hours of the oral direction having been given.  I shall draft something of that kind between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I wish to repeat a suggestion I did not make on the Second Reading but which was made by Senator Russell who is not here for this debate.  I know that the Minister will, in fact, be consulting with interested bodies in relation to the import of necessary fuel.  It is desirable. If you look over our legislation you will find that some Departments more than others&mdash;I am not going to say which&mdash; tend to consult on a formal basis with bodies established to advise them. Departments that do this are operating our democratic procedures rather better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I knew anything about fuel, which I do not, other than what I might read in the newspapers or be told about by somebody in the business, I am sure I could reach the Minister if I had some brilliant idea with regard to the importation of oil from somewhere. But I would not feel that I necessarily had a duty to do so.  One of the advantages of having an advisory committee selected from among the people who might be expected to know where you could get fuel, what you should do if you run short of it and what are the problems caused by running short of it people who have information about these problems because of their industrial experience, for example, or their knowledge of the planning of industry over the period of years that lie to be covered by this contingency&mdash;is that <Col N="610" /> you will have people who have a sense of responsibility with regard to it.  Among the things they will have to think about when they get up in the morning will be: how do I think this ought to be dealt with by the Minister? Quite frankly, I think that, not only should there be such a body established but it should be established long before any emergency.  I envy the Minister's buoyant optimism&mdash;temperamental optimism&mdash;which I do not share.  It must be splendid to have this. As I said on the Second Reading, the Bill is not too late, thank God, but later than it ought to be.  We should be thinking well ahead about the problems of a scarcity of fuel.</P>
    <P>Like an army ought not to be, we should be in no way surprised at suddenly discovering that, as a result of another Libyan nationalisation or Syrian blowing-up, we have an acute shortage threatening us.  We should then have our plans laid.  There should be a body so constituted that it is entitled to get information that the Department have or would be supplied with by the Minister on his direction, having thought about all of this before it happens and being able to advise the Minister on it.  I should like to say at this point that I intend to put down an amendment on Report Stage for the establishment of such an advisory body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I should like to say in regard to that is that, in fact, the Department of Transport and Power are very much in this custodian capacity on behalf of of the community and hold regular consultations with the oil companies, and the ESB and Bord na Móna on this particular problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not just today or yesterday but it is some months now since the first clouds on the horizon in regard to this whole fuel matter arose both on the coal and the oil side.  Very regular discussions have taken place between the interests concerned not just at official level but by myself personally with them, with a view to ensuring that a strategic storage of fundamental basic fuels, oil and coal in particular, be available to us in the event of an emergency. These discussions are continuing <Col N="611" /> and I am fairly confident they will work out in a satisfactory way, in fact in such a satisfactory way that I hope the use of this statute may not arise.</P>
    <P>I might add that this is very important because there is, in regard to oil particularly, enormous costs involved in the storage of oil and if the State itself was to go into this directly to provide such storage for a strategic eventuality, it would involve quite a substantial capital investment.  It is much better for us to have practical across-the-table discussions with the oil companies and the fuel organisations concerned with a view to ensuring that there is a strategic complement of basic fuels available to the community in such an emergency.  We are achieving some success in these discussions already.  The Bill is designed to ensure that we have as a back-up strong legislation but we are proceeding with the practical discussions which Senator FitzGerald mentioned and I do not really see the need for an advisory council here.  It is a straightforward bargaining situation where we say to these people: &ldquo;You are getting X concessions to come in here, we want X storage capacity from you to be permanently here in the event of any such emergency.&rdquo; We are negotiating on that basis at the moment and I want this legislation as something strong at my back in the event of real trouble occurring.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt that the Minister will try to reach the right decision on this on the basis of the advice he gets from his own advisers and the information he and they get from these consultations that have no doubt proceeded.  Nor was I proposing in any way a transfer of power from the Minister to a commission or to any other body which would be given functions to discharge with regard to this matter.  The circumstances which would give rise to the utilisation of this legislation would be such, in my view, as to make it desirable and right that the Executive should have all the power requisite to do the job of getting what had to be <Col N="612" /> got, and distributing it as it ought to be distributed.  First of all, I want to repeat what I said.  People who come into oil companies have their own interests to look after and so on; they come in probably separately from the coal merchants.  There is a degree of self-interest here which may even be conflicting.</P>
      <P>It seems to me to be desirable that people informed on the different levels the Minister mentioned, and on other levels he did not mention, should have a duty of advising the Minister.  I cannot see that the additional advice he would get on a formal basis could in any way be harmful to him or would do anything more than make the people most concerned with this more cooperative with him in the implementation of the measure.  He did not mention certain people who are affected very much by this.  He did not mention people in industry and in farming.  It may be that that was a verbal omission.  But I should like to think that there was a little bit more than this in it because, let us face it, if there is a real shortage of fuel oil here there is going to be a selection process necessary.  Who in industry has a formal duty of advising the Minister on this? It is not sufficient to tell me that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is there to assist him, with respect to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, because I find the Minister for Transport and Power's advisers take a different view on what should be in a Bill, with regard to an order made under the Bill, to the view taken by the advisers to the Minister we had here before the Minister arrived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words I proposed to be inserted as an amendment to the earlier Bill appear in this Bill and were rejected by the Minister's advisers from the other Bill.  I am not satisfied that the arrangements from the departmental viewpoint, are adequate on this.  We should have people advising the Minister who know what the plan is for industry over the next few years, who know what will be the effect of denying a particular industry fuel at one stage and, likewise, in agriculture.  I would ask the Minister to consider this when he sees the amendment I am going to <Col N="613" /> put down on this and to ask himself if it can possibly do any harm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (3), lines 21 to 25.</P>
      <P>I feel fairly strongly about this matter, withwithstanding the fact that I know we are dealing with legislation which it is intended to invoke only in case of an emergency.  I also put down the amendment because I should like to hear the Minister's views on this question and the views of other Members of the House.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) of section 3 specifically provides that a ministerial order or a direction given by the Minister, on foot of a ministerial order which he has made, will have not merely the force of law but an overriding force in that it can override existing law in any Act of Parliament other than this Act.  Subsection (3) reads:</P>
      <P>Every order under this Act and every authorisation and direction shall have the force of law and shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent with the order, authorisation or direction contained in any Act other than this Act or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any Act other than this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have already some discussion on the fact that it is open to the Minister, by the definition section of this Bill, to give oral directions.  We then have the situation arising, by virtue of this particular subsection, that an oral direction given by the Minister will <Col N="614" /> have not merely the force of law but will be sufficiently potent to override existing written legislation.  The Minister may argue that I may be over-painting the picture; that what is involved here is that if there is anything inconsistent with existing legislation the order or direction made under this measure will prevail.  That is true but it really amounts to the same thing: it is sufficiently potent to override existing legislation.  That is not good. As a lawyer, looking at this from a defence point of view rather than from a prosecution point of view, I can imagine a number of situations likely to arise if this measure were ever invoked.  A person might do something in the knowledge that what he is doing has the sanction of some existing legislation but he is confronted by the fact that here under section 3 (3), it is said to him that that is all well and good, that the Act, whatever may be in question, does say that in black and white, but unfortunately the Minister gave a verbal direction the effect of which is inconsistent with what is in the Act the person was relying on and, because it is inconsistent with the Act he was relying on, the verbal direction given by the Minister must be regarded as what counts: it overrides what is written into the legislation.  I do not like this.  If we can do without this subsection completely, as I am suggesting by means of my amendment, we ought to do without it.  If the Minister feels that some sort of power to buttress the effect of any orders or directions he may give is required, I suggest he should look at this matter again, between now and Report Stage, to see if there is not some other way by which the necessary support for his orders or directions might be given rather than by putting them in the position of completely overriding, in the event of an inconsistency, formal written legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to look at this subsection again not so much because I object to what the subsection contains but because I object to the draftsmanship.  It seems to me that the draftsman was taking a rather easy way out, a lazy way out. If there are other Acts which are likely <Col N="615" /> to be affected by this section then these Acts should be specified.  To have a blanket subsection such as this which merely says &ldquo;notwithstanding any Act&rdquo; is too wide and unsatisfactory particularly from the point of view of anybody looking at it from a professional point of view.  Only a relatively limited number of Acts can be affected by this.  If the subsection specified &ldquo;notwithstanding the provisions of the following Acts&rdquo; I think I should not then object to it.  Some effort should be made, if possible, to state the Acts likely to be affected and to say that &ldquo;notwithstanding the provisions of these Acts&rdquo; this subsection would still apply.</P>

      <P>I should like to support this amendment by Senator O'Higgins for the reasons he has given and also because it is just possible, on the present wording of subsection (3), that it is unconstitutional.  Article 15, paragraph 2 of the Constitution provides that the sole lawmaking authority shall rest in the Oireachtas.  Yet the first sentence of section 3 here reads:</P>
      <P>Every order under this Act and every authorisation and direction shall have the force of law&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>and it goes on to say that it shall have the force of law despite other existing Acts of the Parliament.  Under the terms of Article 15, paragraph 2 of the Constitution, I think it is not possible for the Minister to make an order or give a direction having the force of law and amending or bypassing earlier statutes because, in so doing, he will be taking the law-making function which is reserved to Parliament.  I put this forward subject to correction. However, it does occur to me.  For that, and for the other reasons, I also should like to support this amendment.</P>

      <P>First of all, in the interests of national survival&mdash;which is the type of situation envisaged by the legislation, a near-war situation which would be existing in western Europe&mdash; in my view to talk about professional purposes or the Constitution, to put it candidly, is irrelevant, dealing with this type of legislation.  The French say <i>plus ca change plus c'est la même <Col N="616" /> chose.</i>  The former Taoiseach then Deputy Seán Lemass, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, had to deal with precisely this situation in introducing the Supplies and Services Bill in the Oireachtas in 1946.  What I am going to say now more or less paraphrases what he said then.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Seanad to bring their minds away from academic discussions as to the propriety of this or that section in the context of the Constitution or as to professional investigation into the rights or wrongs on behalf of clients as to particular sections and subsections.  I shall be meeting other amendments later on and I have met amendments earlier on. I do go as far as possible but there are certain basic tenets in this matter which I regard as fundamental in order to enable the Executive to operate, to act swiftly on behalf of the community in an emergency.  I mentioned oral directions as being essential and, as I say, I have modified it by making it incumbent on the Executive to issue a written directive following on that&mdash; and we shall do this on Report Stage. I regard this order subsection as equally fundamental.  The Irish people would not thank me if, as Senator Ryan suggests, I listed here a number of statutes in a schedule relevant to the order and, by some oversight, a statute was omitted that was basic in a certain emergency situation.  These sorts of things can happen.  Everyone here knows how difficult it is to cover all loopholes in any legal measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation envisages a situation where lives would be involved.  People whose lives were dependent on swift Executive action in an emergency or war situation would not thank the Government Minister or Government concerned at the time if they found themselves circumscribed by over-definition in legislation which prevented action being taken.  That is the sort of situation that I envisage.  Let me quote one example.  Assuming a drastic rationing of electricity had to be operated straight away.  At the present time, the only basis on which the ESB can cut off electricity is for non-payment of the bill.  That is the position under section 99 of the basic Electricity Supply Act, 1927.  The <Col N="617" /> board cannot discontinue the supply of electricity to any such person unless the charge or sum demanded by the board for the supply of electricity is not paid.  That is a fair and proper section to govern ordinary circumstances. If we proceeded in an emergency situation to ration electricity I should have to direct or whoever is in my position might have to direct the ESB to have, say, no neon lighting.  All neon lighting must be cut out&mdash;I just mention neon lighting&mdash;or any form of superfluous electricity consumption of that kind.  In order to protect employment, only basic current be discharged for basic employment purposes. Current, for all other purposes, must be discontinued and cut off.  That is the type of direction I have in mind That, straight away, means a Government order that supersedes a specific section in the Electricity Supply Act, 1927.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan asks: Why not list all these statutes? My fear in doing that is the fear of omission.  One might omit a basic statute and one might find oneself, in an emergency situation, where the Government could not act.  The overall community interests in this type of legislation, while modifying as much as possible in the interests of people who may be harmed, and so on&mdash;I have already accepted one amendment and propose to accept others&mdash;while going as far as one can to protect people who may be harmed by such legislation, there are certain basic tenets that must be held in mind when discussing legislation of this kind that is not in any way in the normal sphere of legislation.  Many of the views put forward are views that would appeal to me personally in discussing ordinary legislation.  We are not discussing ordinary legislation here; we are discussing extraordinary legislation dealing with a real emergency or war situation. There is no doubt about it, to put it mildly, that, if the middle-eastern countries and the north-African countries decided to discontinue oil supplies to Europe, we should be in a war situation.  It is as blunt and straightforward as that.  That is the type of situation in which we and other European parliaments are introducing this legislation.  I should like the Seanad to <Col N="618" /> address its mind to the legislation in the context of that type of possible situation which we trust will not occur.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  I am encouraged to do so by the Minister's reply to the debate.  He has ignored, the considerable embarrassment of the Executive in having a Constitution that deprives it of powers and which cannot be taken by the Executive from the Legislature.  I wholly support what Senator Robinson said with regard to this.</P>
      <P>The Minister is able to produce an illustration of the kind of case where an existing law would require to be amended by a ministerial order.  It shows the difficulty of this subsection. If I understand Senator Robinson's argument&mdash;she is well able to make it &mdash;correctly, the very order the Minister proposes to make to amend that Act might be invalidated by the terms of this subsection which go farther than an Act of Parliament ought to go in the powers it confers on the Executive. As I understand the Minister's argument, they could equally well have been put up in defence of a single-line Bill which would justify the Greek colonels, a single-line Bill which would remove from the Legislature all the power it has got and confer it on the Executive.  That would be, however, an invalid Act of Parliament here&mdash; anything of the kind.  State of war or not a state of war, we must operate through our Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Seanad, which is accused by people for not working because it is not asked to work often enough, is well aware of a request by the Executive to pass a Bill quickly and has got through measures within 24 hours: both Houses have combined to deal with an emergency.  To support Senator Ryan with regard to the laziness of the draftsman or those who instructed him.  I consider that the homework ought to be done completely by the Department as to the range of legislation the Minister should have power to amend and the sections thereof so that he will, in fact, have power to do what he says it will be necessary for him to do but which he may find, in a <Col N="619" /> situation of war, he cannot do because he has sought to take more power than he validly can get by the terms of our Constitution.  The Minister ought to give a good deal more thought to the terms of this subsection. I wholly support the speeches made against it.</P>

      <P>I think it does.  It was Senator Nash who raised this point on Second Reading.  I felt it was a very valid point.  In subsection (6) the words appear&mdash;this is in relation to the power of the court to order forfeiture of goods or chattels&mdash;&ldquo;in relation to, or by means of which, the offence was committed&rdquo;. The point was made, I think, perfectly validly on Second Reading that the inclusion of the words &ldquo;or by means of which&rdquo; certainly extend this thing very largely and probably go beyond what was contemplated by the Minister.  I imagine that what is intended here concerns an offence in relation to certain goods&mdash;like the question of smuggling or it might be a question of a person, in an unauthorised way, hoarding goods&mdash;and prosecution ensures.  The intention is to give the court power to order that those goods be forfeited in addition to whatever penalties, by way of fine or imprisonment, are imposed in the Act. The section goes a lot further than that.  Take, for example, hoarding which may be unauthorised under a ministerial order.  The Minister may make an order in relation, say, to coal or fuel of some sort that it shall be unlawful for a private individual to have more than a ton of coal at any one time.  Supposing a person, in his <Col N="622" /> house, in contravention of that order, stores two tons of coal.  What is to happen under section 6? It will not be merely a question of forfeiting the coal&mdash;that is, the goods in relation to which the offence was committed&mdash;but it will also be one of forfeiting the goods by means of which is the person's private residence.  I think that is the kind of point Senator Nash had in mind when he referred to this on Second Reading.  I think it is a good point.</P>

      <P>There would be some validity in the point if this could be done by ministerial directive, or something of that kind.  However, the courts will have charge of such a prosecution. I do not envisage the courts taking that extreme type of view mentioned by Senator O'Higgins.  It is a confiscation provision which is usual in revenue offences and emergency offences of this kind.  It pinpoints it to a greater degree, by means of which, I feel it is more positive, more definite. We are really in the draftsman's area here.  I shall have a look at it between now and Report Stage but, certainly, as it reads now, I think it reads better from the point of view of the individual. It is better draftsmanship, in my view, as it is now, and it is better grammar.  It specifies &ldquo;by means of which&rdquo; which is sufficiently definite that forfeiture or confiscation can take place only in regard to any goods or chattels by means of which the offence was committed.  I think that makes better language than &ldquo;by which the offence was committed&rdquo;.  It pins it down more directly to the actual means by which the offence was committed whether it was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think that would direct the courts sufficiently to <Col N="623" /> what is meant by the provision.  The provision is a confiscation provision. It is designed to ensure that, for example, any truck used in the illegal transportation of oil&mdash;it is by means of the truck that the illegal transportation took place&mdash;it should be confiscated. Surely the phraseology &ldquo;by means of which&rdquo; specifies precisely that what is meant here is that the court can impound any chattel used in the commission of an offence against the section.  From the point of view of natural justice and, generally, I feel that this is better.  From the point of view of the court and the defendant, it should be specific that it must be a chattel or vehicle, or anything you like that was used in the commission of the offence.  It is only such chattel by means of which the offence was committed that may be confiscated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that enabling it to be confiscated is rather draconian?  The goods themselves&mdash;fuel oil or whatever it is &mdash;can be confiscated.  The person guilty of the offence can be fined.  He can also get a severe sentence of imprisonment. If, in addition, because he is carrying a relatively trivial amount or committing an offence of a relatively trivial nature, he finds himself in the position that a vehicle or goods or chattels to the value of many thousands of pounds can be forfeited, it seems ultra severe. Many of these prosecutions will be coming before district justices.  On occasion, some district justices are inclined to take the bit between their teeth and to fling the whole book at a defendant.</P>

      <P>I know it is a draconian provision.  In fact, the whole measure is draconian.  We hope it will not arise.  That is going to the root of the Bill, as it were.  I am thinking here in terms of the eventuality of a court dealing with a situation.  In that type of situation, the court should be empowered to deal with the lorry, the ship, or whatever means was used in <Col N="624" /> the commission of the offences.  It is a forfeiture provision involving confiscation. I agree it is draconian.  If one accepts the principle which goes through the whole subsection, the most effective way to implement that principle, and retain natural justice at the same time, is to specify that the only goods or chattels that can be forfeited in those circumstances are goods or chattels by means of which the offence was committed.  This shows that no other goods or chattels&mdash;other than the goods or chattels used in the commission of the offence&mdash;can be forfeited. I think this is fair and proper.</P>

      <P>It would be well if we had some definition of what is intended by &ldquo;goods and chattels&rdquo; in this sense.  Normally, when a person refers to &ldquo;goods and chattels&rdquo;, he means a person's property.  If he refers to all of a person's goods or chattels he means all of a person's property.  I am a bit afraid that &ldquo;goods and chattels&rdquo; used in this section may extend even to personalty in the form of, for example, of leasehold property.  We may end up by giving the power to the courts&mdash; unduly wide powers to the court&mdash; to order forfeiture of a person's property, in the sense of leasehold properties, if a person in a cell, yard, barn, or some such place, stored quantities of fuel in excess of an amount authorised by a ministerial order.</P>

      <P>By leaving out the words <Col N="625" />&ldquo;goods or&rdquo; and confining it to &ldquo;chattels&rdquo; even you are leaving it very strong.  However, I think that if those two words are omitted it will avoid the possibility of seizing a leasehold premises which, of course, can be seized by a sheriff, even, in execution of a decree.  If a man stores goods illegally in a premises, or hides them there, he has them by means of using that premises. I feel it is over-severe that a man can forfeit a ship or forfeit all chattels.  It would make the penalty go far in excess of the crime if a leasehold premises could be seized.  If the words &ldquo;goods or&rdquo; are omitted and we confine it to &ldquo;chattels&rdquo;, I do not think a leasehold premises would come under the definition of &ldquo;chattel&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This amendment is designed to meet the point of view put forward by Senator Dooge on the Second Stage.  It is a valid point in this connection.  The purpose is to define &ldquo;fissile fuel&rdquo;.  Fissile fuel means a material capable of acting as a source of energy because of its ability to propagate a neutron chain reaction. Subsequent amendments, being taken with this amendment, flow from this specific definition of &ldquo;fissile fuel&rdquo; that Senator Dooge suggested should be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the definition of &ldquo;fissile fuel&rdquo;, there is only one difficulty in regard to the definition proposed here.  It is a difficulty that I would raise later on in the section in regard to the definition of &ldquo;nuclear reactor&rdquo;.  The general point is that we only define &ldquo;fissile fuel&rdquo; here; we only define a &ldquo;nuclear reactor&rdquo; in the section as being a reactor in which fission takes place.  While it is true that the development of nuclear power by other than fission is still at the experimental stage, nevertheless it might be appropriate at this particular stage to include a definition of &ldquo;nuclear fuel&rdquo;, a definition of &ldquo;nuclear reactor&rdquo;, <Col N="628" /> which would include fusion processes as well as fission processes.</P>
      <P>In the world of destruction, we have both the H-bomb and the A-bomb In spite of the great hopes, the thermonuclear fusion process, which is at the basis of the H-bomb, has not yet been harnessed and contained for peaceful use.  Even within the last few weeks, news items have appeared that scientists in Japan and in the United States have announced discoveries which indicate that they may be achieving the technological break through which would enable them to harness nuclear fusion for power purposes.</P>
      <P>It may be that this hope is as unfounded as were the hopes some ten years ago of the Zeta reaction in Britain.  On the other hand, if they are well-founded, there is no doubt that the nuclear fusion processes&mdash;which, with fuel demands, are so immensely cheaper than the fuels required in nuclear fission&mdash;would soon replace nuclear fission as a source for power. What would worry me in regard to this Bill is that if somebody commenced to experiment here on nuclear fusion the danger would be that his operations would not be controlled by this Bill.  The control of nuclear fusion for peaceful purposes, for the production of power, is not yet a technological reality.  Accordingly, there would be adequate time for the board which is being set up under this Bill to recommend an amendment of the Bill to the Minister to cover it.  In the meantime, it would appear that any research work in our universities or under this new nuclear board in regard to nuclear fusion development might fall outside the control of this legislation because the only type of fuel we would be talking about would be fissile fuel and the only type of reactor we would be talking about would be one in which nuclear fission can occur. This may well be a serious gap in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt about what Senator Dooge says with regard to the future.  We hope that in ten or 15 years time the nuclear fusion process will be the great source of power supply, and will be the unending <Col N="629" /> source of power supply as far as the board is concerned.  Technologists and scientists are working towards this.  However, it is very much in the future, as the Senator will agree.  This Bill is designed to deal with a very specific and immediate situation where we require a board immediately to deal with the matter, in view of the imminence of the erection of a nuclear power station by the ESB based on the nuclear fission process, the present known process for creating nuclear energy.  The training and education of technicians, technologists and scientists in connection with this nuclear fission process needs to be standardised. Overall safety precautions have to be devised.  Advice can be given to the Minister for Transport and Power and the Government by such a board concerned with the immediate prospect relating to nuclear energy from the process of nuclear fission.</P>
      <P>From the long-term point of view, as far as mankind is concerned, nuclear fusion, although very much in the early stages of development, will offer the great opportunity of immediate power availability.  However, we will have time when that comes about to devise the appropriate statutory measures.  We will have a board set up under this legislation and they will be able to keep the Minister and Government advised as to the future of developments in the whole nuclear field.  Undoubtedly, these developments will in the future move into the nuclear fusion field as well as the nuclear fission field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I agree with a lot of what Senator Dooge has said, I do not think it is quite appropriate at this stage.  We are dealing with the immediate problem of establishing a board to deal with an immediate situation which would be very much our concern over the next ten years.  I feel we will have enough on our plates in that regard and there will be no problem about bringing in legislation within that period to deal with any developments that may arise in the nuclear fusion field.  However, if the Bill can be amended easily to incorporate dealing with nuclear fusion&mdash; I will have the Bill examined with a <Col N="630" /> view to doing this between now and the Report Stage&mdash;I see no reason why it should not be done.  I will look at the Bill with a view to doing that.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for undertaking to look into this particular point.  If I might say, at the risk of being slightly irrelevant, but with the advantage of saving perhaps a second discussion on the section, I think the anxieties that I have expressed in regard to the scope of the Bill are much more important in regard to the definition of what is a nuclear reactor rather than to the particular definition of fuel types with which the amendment is concerned.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>

      <P>Again this amendment arises out of a point made by Senator Dooge on the Second Stage debate.  It concerns his desire to have &ldquo;radioactive substance&rdquo; defined.  We have it defined here that it means a substance which consists of, or contains, any radioactive chemical element, whether natural or artificial.  I am <Col N="631" /> putting that amendment to the Seanad to define precisely what radioactive substance is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for having met this point and I am sorry if I appear churlish having got an amendment inserted, to go on to object to the amendment which has been inserted.  The definition which is now being inserted is a very broad, general definition.  The radioactive substance is one that contains any radioactive chemical element, whether natural or artificial.  As I indicated the last day, the substance of the Minister's body, the substance of my body, contains radioactive material. If we take a broad definition of radioactive material such as we have here then, in fact, we are defining everything to be radioactive.  We might end up by finding out that our Nuclear Energy Board has got control over the transportation of the Minister or control over the transportation of every Member of this House, because the board has control over the transportation of all radioactive material.</P>
      <P>Might I put the point in this particular way.  We can look on radioactive materials, radioactive substances as being, as it were in the natural sense, eccentric substances.  They may behave in a peculiar fashion.  In regard to these substances as in regard to human individuals a certain degree of eccentricity is tolerable, a certain degree of eccentricity calls for no control. If, indeed, one called for the control of the slightest degree of eccentricity I think our mental health services would be even more overburdened than they are at the moment. As in the case of the eccentricity of human individuals, it is when they go beyond certain bounds that control is necessary, and similarly, too, with the question of radioactive elements and radioactive materials.  It is when their radioactivity is in excess of a certain level that the need for control arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of legislation in other countries has been that they have started their legislation in terms of broad general definitions such as we have here.  They have gone on then in later legislation, having found this unworkable, to define more tightly, to <Col N="632" /> define in terms of levels of radioactivity. I do not know what the quantitative measure in regard to the eccentricity of humans is.  Perhaps our colleague, Senator Jessop, might help us on this point.  In regard to radioactive elements their eccentricity in behaviour in this particular regard is measured in something like micro-curies per gramme or measures of this sort. Recent legislation in Britain prints, in the Schedule to the Act, the level of radiation in a particular element which brings it within the scope of the Act, which brings it within the definition of being a radioactive substance.  It may well be that it is sufficient for us to take a general definition such as we have here now.  It may well be that we can take a broad general definition and then in the application of the Act we can only apply the orders that are made, the regulations that are made, to certain classes of radioactive substances and define these classes in terms of the level of radioactive activity. This may be difficult to do, may cause difficulties, and may be the reason why legislation in other countries has changed.  It is probable that we need a body, such as the board that is proposed, to tell us exactly how we should schedule this but I think there is a very real difficulty here.  The definition as drawn here is better than having no definition at all but it is so wide a definition that it may well be unsatisfactory.</P>

      <P>The amendment which I have introduced, and which has been partially welcomed by Senator Dooge, is in line with legislation which we have examined in Norway, Sweden and in the early British legislation. I appreciate that in the British Act of 1960 they went into greater detail in their Schedule, specifying the various solid, liquid, gas or vapour ingredients involved, like actinium, lead, polonium, protoactinium, radium, radon, thorium and uranium.  These type of definitions are variables in my view and this is precisely why the board has been established to advise the Minister for Transport and Power on the up-to-date situation in regard to these variables so that when it comes down, in future legislation, to making <Col N="633" /> a precise definition of radioactive substance we will be in a position to make such a definition that is appropriate to the most up-to-date and recent advice given by such a board.</P>
      <P>I feel at this stage, that as this is our first legislation in this field, it is better to leave the definition reasonably broad while bringing in a definition, as we are doing in this amendment, and have the board then advise the Minister as to what would be the appropriate further definitions or limitations within this whole field of nuclear energy that should be adopted for future legislation. I indicated on Second Stage that I regarded this Bill primarily to get this board moving, to get this whole investigation proceeding and this whole area of nuclear energy to be investigated having regard to the immediate power generation requirements of the community and the safety and training requirements.</P>
      <P>I am quite certain that the investigations of this board will throw up the need for more detailed, possibly different legislation in detail than what is contained here.  It is important for the initial legislation to be as broad as possible.  I agree with Senator Dooge that if one had the precise information it would be desirable to do what he suggests.  I would say that this precise information would be coming from the board to the Minister in the years ahead when legislation on more precise lines and lines more appropriate to the requirements of the particular time can be brought before the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I do not entirely agree with Senator Dooge when he says that this amendment is better than no amendment at all.  I think it would be better to have no amendment at all than to have this one because it leaves the field completely open and, as he says, nearly anybody can be radioactive at any time and there is the question of the amount of radioactivity and how he gets it.  Of course radioactive substances vary in the length of time which their radioactivity persists.  This is a very important consideration which is not mentioned at all in this amendment. From what the Minister has said I think it would be improved greatly <Col N="634" /> if some phrase were added, such as admitting radiation above a level to be decided by the Minister on the advice of the board from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Jessop in this particular regard. While we can appreciate the Minister's point of view, his anxiety to get the board established and afterwards to listen to what the board have to say, nevertheless this is legislation.  This legislation will leave our hands.  We should make the legislation as good as we can and anticipate as many difficulties as we can.  We can take the definition which is in the Minister's amendment and look forward, for example, to section 6 (1), where the Minister can make certain orders in regard to the custody, use, manufacture, importation, distribution, transportation, exportation or other disposal of radioactive substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it is possible to get over the difficulty which Senator Jessop mentioned of materials having markedly different half-lives and therefore being dangerous for varying lengths of time.  This might be got over if in these orders certain chemical elements or certain chemical isotopes were specified.  I think it would be difficult, looking at section 6 (1), to draft an order which would not only distinguish between various isotopes which would have different effects on persons who were exposed to them but on the different levels of radioactivity in different substances.  Either we should broaden the definition, as Senator Jessop has said, to define radioactive substances as being above a certain level or else we should, in section 6 and elsewhere, where control comes in, put in an additional subsection which says that such orders, such regulations, such control may take account of the varying radioactivity of the elements specified in them.  I think with Senator Jessop that the Bill needs amendment in some regard.  To talk about radioactivity in the absolute is, I think, not realistic.  It is, perhaps, salutary that we should do so because the indications are that some of the greatest dangers of radioactivity, some of the genetic affects of it do not appear to <Col N="635" /> have a threshhold value.  Nevertheless, any realistic approach to the problem of regulation must take into account the level of radioactivity of the particular substance, the particular isotope being controlled, and I think this must be written into the Bill either in the definition of radioactive substances as Senator Jessop has suggested or else in the individual sections to make it clear that these distinctions can be made in the orders and in the regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The sort of discussion we have been having highlights the need for this particular board because in my view the correct way to approach a highly technical matter of this kind is to establish a board, have a highly professional board, staff and so on, and have the board advise the Minister in the immediate years ahead as to what needs to be done administratively along the various lines I have mentioned and also advise the Minister as to what needs to be done legislatively along the lines suggested by Senator Dooge and Senator Jessop, if the board so consider.  It would be dangerous at this stage for a deliberative assembly to take on itself the more precise definitions in this particular field.  In view of the fact that we are setting up this board to advise on this precise field we are the body to advise on the drafting of legislation. That is the purpose of any parliamentary assembly.  But when it comes down to scientific definition of this kind I would prefer that we have the definitions by all means but keep them as broad as possible, establish the board and then take the advice from the board of experts that we will establish (a) as to what sort of administrative decisions are needed and (b) what legislative provisions are required to make the Bill more precise in this or that aspect and taking into account the type of view put forward here both by Senator Dooge and Senator Jessop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the more commonsense approach.  I certainly would not be fully competent&mdash;very few people in either House would be&mdash;to advise <Col N="636" /> otherwise.  This is the sensible approach.  In saying that, I appreciate fully the views that have been put forward both by Senator Dooge and Senator Jessop, but I feel that we should adopt this approach first to get our board going, have it deal with the immediate problems I have mentioned which will arise from the administration point of view.  Then the board having had a look, as I am sure they will, at the particular statute governing their operations, would come back to the Government and say: &ldquo;This Bill is deficient in these aspects.&rdquo;  Then we will be drafting legislation in some years time that will be based on the very best advice available, based on advice that has arisen out of, we hope, the administration by that time of power station development, the administration of the other developments I envisage taking place in the immediate years ahead in regard to nuclear development here in Ireland.  On the basis of that advice we can then bring forward legislation which is appropriate to the requirements of the particular time in which that advice is given.  From a commonsense point of view I consider that is the better approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to rise again but I am concerned about the anxieties of people who use radioactive materials and ionising radiations in various ways as part of their ordinary daily work in medicine and in science one way or another.  I had the misfortune about 12 or 14 years ago to the the honorary secretary of a board, body or council trying to control radioactive materials in this country.  They were set up by the Medical Research Council when we first started using isotopes for medicine and for experimental purposes and it was realised these were dangerous materials if not handled properly. This body was asked by the Medical Research Council to supervise the importation, use and disposal of these materials.  We had a very frustrating five or six years because we were the target for all sorts of people who felt they knew more about these materials than we did.  Why should they not use them?  Why should they be controlled in this way by us?  We <Col N="637" /> eventually, of course, ceased to try to operate in these circumstances.</P>
      <P>If there was something put into this definition on the lines I suggested it would reassure people that the decision as to what level of radiation was to be regarded as within the meaning of this control should be decided by the board, or by the Minister on the advice of the board.  I am thinking of the people who use these things, who have been using them for years, who have a lot of expertise in this matter and are a little bit irked by the idea that their activities are to be controlled. If they knew that there was this safeguard, even a vague safeguard, it would reassure them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel the Minister is misunderstanding what has been urged in regard to this particular point. If the Minister is saying: surely this board is more competent than Members of the Oireachtas to deal with this particular point, and if the Minister is saying that the board is more competent to say what should be the particular level allowed in regard to a particular isotope of actinium in either its solid, its liquid or its gaseous forms, then he is perfectly and absolutely correct. Even though I have mentioned that it was done in the latest British Act, we are not seeking here to put in a Schedule which will list all isotopes and list particular levels.  What is being sought here is to ensure that there is sufficient flexibility in this Bill to ensure that regulations can take account of the varying levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it would be very nice if the advice which the Minister had to get from his board was not advice about the particular levels of isotopes, which are permissible, but advice about the drafting of legislation and advice about how to draft a Bill in order to make it flexible.  Certainly, I, as a Member of this House, would not like to be instructed on the way in which legislation should be drafted by a board consisting of nuclear engineers and health physicists, however eminent. There is a need for some flexibility here.  It must be clear beyond any doubt that the level of radioactivity can be taken account of, whether it be in definition or whether it be in <Col N="638" /> regulation.  I would urge the Minister to look at this point between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>This amendment flows from what has already been decided and defines &ldquo;substance&rdquo;. Again it was suggested by Senator Dooge on the Second Stage debate. The purpose of it is to define &ldquo;substance&rdquo; as meaning a natural or artificial substance whether in solid or liquid form or in the form of a gas or a vapour and includes a preparation or manufactured article, or article which has been subjected to any artificial treatment or process.  It is following out the same line of reasoning put forward by Senator Dooge in regard to defining &ldquo;fissile fuel&rdquo; and &ldquo;radioactive substances&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned when we were discussing amendment No. 1 that there would be some difficulty in regard to the definition of nuclear reactor but if the decision is made to expand the Bill to cover fusion processes a definition is necessary here. There is another point, however, in regard to the definition of nuclear reactor that I should like to draw attention to.  The definition as it stands is:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Nuclear reactor&rdquo; means a structure containing nuclear fuel and in which a self-sustaining and controlled process of nuclear fission can occur;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> Now it is quite certain that, unless we have a self-sustaining and controlled process of nuclear fission we are not going to have a very economic power plant.</P>
    <P>However, this Bill covers more than nuclear power plants.  The Minister is perhaps misdirecting himself a little at times in thinking completely in terms of the application of the Bill to nuclear power plants.  If we look at section 5, subsection (1), the Bill here talks of this board advising the Government on the acquisition of nuclear reactors for training or research purposes.  In fact, there existed, and as far as I know still exists, nuclear reactors for training purposes which would not be covered by the definition in section 1.</P>
    <P>Section 1 talks of a reactor in which there is a self-sustaining and controlled process of nuclear fission.  Many research reactors are of such a nature that they can be moderated so that they operate at a sub-critical level. They will then never become dangerous. In these particular circumstances they need the presence of an active source all the time in order for them to operate at all.  Such a reactor is probably covered by the definition, if it is possible at all for these moderating elements to be withdrawn, so that the training reactor could possibly reach a critical and self-sustaining reaction. However, there are also training reactors which could never become critical, sub-critical reactors which are always sub-critical and can never be anything else.  If this is so I do not see how such a reactor could come within this definition because it is, by its very design, incapable of maintaining a self-sustaining reaction.  If I am correct in this, then the new nuclear board would have no control over the acquisition or the operation of such sub-critical training reactors.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the Minister would be satisfied with this position. It may well be that he would feel that, if such nuclear reactors are incapable of being modified so as to sustain a critical reaction, and therefore of being dangerous, there is no need to control them.  However, it might be wiser if all nuclear reactors, all training reactors, even the very safest type&mdash;what the <Col N="641" /> modern exponent of nuclear engineering might consider now as merely being a toy&mdash;did come under the scope of this particular legislation and under the control of the board.  For this reason it might be as well if the Minister would take advice on the question of whether all sub-critical training reactors are covered by the definition, and if the definition could be easily modified to cover them.</P>

I had been directing my attention, in what I said a few <Col N="642" /> moments ago, more on the effect of section 1 on section 5 (1) (a), where we are concerned with the question of the acquisition of these reactors.  I may have things to say later on about the relation of the Nuclear Energy Board to the Higher Education Authority in regard to the acquisition of research reactors. I would hate that anything I should say at any stage of this Bill would indicate that the Government, or any of its agencies other than the Higher Education Authority, might interfere with the direction of development of research in university departments.

      <P>On this section I have merely a small comment to make and that is to congratulate the Minister on the fact that, even though he is talking here in our first language of An Bord Fuinnimh Núicléigh, he has talked throughout this Bill on nuclear power.  I had feared that we would never get away from the term atomic power which, of course, was essentially a misnomer because in all our fuel it is the chemical reaction between the atoms which give rise to the energy.  It is in fact the great difference between atomic energy and nuclear energy as such, the energy released in the nucleus of the atom that makes nuclear power such a terrible and wonderful thing.  Indeed, it looked as if the day was lost in regard to this nomenclature and I am glad the Minister has taken the more correct term here.</P>

      <P>Could I just mention a small point on that?  It is quite a simple point.  As I read sections 2 and 3, this Bill does not, in fact, establish the body that is to be established by virtue of it.  This Bill will come into operation and this body will be established when the Minister makes an order establishing it.  If I am correct <Col N="643" /> in that, then I think, it will not be a body within the list of persons who are qualified to acquire land under section 45 of the Land Act, 1965, and the Nuclear Energy Board would have to be added to that list by this Bill.

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 deals with the general functions of the board. Indeed it is the very heart of the Bill. I hasten to assure the Minister that I do not intend to indulge in another Second Stage excursion in regard to it.  However, I should like to make one comment.  It is very welcome, very salutory, to find highlighted here in the general powers that not only is this a board which is being set up to advise the Government but, in paragraph (b), it is being told that it is not just to give any old advice it happens to have lying around but that this board is given the general function and the specific duty to keep itself informed of developments in nuclear energy.</P>
      <P>This is welcome and I trust that when the Minister, under a later section, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, is providing the necessary funds for this particular board, he will keep in mind that this board requires not only sufficient funds to enable it to advise the Minister but sufficient funds to keep itself informed of developments in regard to nuclear energy, so that this advice is the best possible and the most up-to-date advice that is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like, also arising under this section, to ask the Minister a question. It is a general question which could be asked on many Bills in which the phrase occurs.  What is the particular force of subsection (2): &ldquo;...such other things as arise out of or are consequential on...&rdquo;?  One can, perhaps, accept that to give a person power to <Col N="644" /> do something and not to do something which is a natural invariable and inescapable consequence of what they have been authorised to do already is perhaps admissable.  I do not know if consequential is interpreted as being an inescapable consequence.</P>
    <P>Certainly such other matters as arise seem to broaden the scope.  We have in subsection (1) given this board very wide powers.  We give them further specific powers in subsection (5).  We also say they can do all such other things as arise by trying to do something and finding that this something cannot be classed as advising the Minister or as keeping themselves informed, but is something the board would like to do.  Shall we say a temptation which arises out of their other activities? Does subsection (2) authorise them to yield to that temptation or how, in fact, is the scope of subsection (2) governed by the scope of subsection (1)?  Is our only defence here the Statutory Instruments Committee?  If they operate other than through statutory instruments is this an open-ended subsection?</P>

      <P>As the Senator has stated, it is a usual provision in Bills of this kind where we are seeking to give powers to a new authority.  One must make sure that they can function. It is an omnibus global provision, if you like.  It is designed to cover mundane matters like renting offices and matters of that kind which may not be covered by some strict reading of sections 4 (1) (a) and (b) as to what the board are empowered to do under the subsections.  As the House are well aware, it is a usual provision in Bills of this kind, where you are giving new functions and new powers, to make sure that a too tight legal definition of the powers which you give cannot be taken and it is quite clear that other practical matters can be dealt with which may be consequential on the major functions assigned to them.</P>

In section 5 the functions of the board are set out in great detail. <Col N="645" /> I raised this on Second Reading last week.  No mention is made in section 5 of the very complex problem of liability in the event of some nuclear catastrophy. Presumably the Minister intends this question to be dealt with by the board.

It may be introduced in another context, as an amendment to the Insurance Acts to ensure that this authority is clearly incorporated into the third party liability insurance scheme.  It will involve an amendment of the existing insurance legislation rather than an amendment to this Bill.  This is a matter involving international conventions as well.  Third party liability in this field has been the subject matter of an International Convention, 1960, by members of the OECD and ratified by a number of countries.  We will have to bring in legislation which will attach ourselves to that convention. It will be some kind of a separate Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already discussed this matter as being related to a point raised by Senator Dooge on section 1, which is the definition section. He went a long way.  He made particular points in his contribution to the debate on section 1 which may be relevant to possible improvement of the amendment between now and Report Stage.  The inclusion of &ldquo;or devices&rdquo; does enlarge the definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the amendment which the Minister has produced does improve the section but, as usual, I have my doubts if it does fully the job it set out to do. The question turns on how broad a term &ldquo;devices&rdquo; is.  One can certainly say that if we have such things as nuclear hair dryers in the future, one might refer to them as devices. Whether one could take the very substantial sub-critical reactor, which is what I was talking about earlier, as being a device is, I think, doubtful. The word &ldquo;device&rdquo; is not defined in the definition section so I take it we are driven back on other legislation or on the common meaning of the word &ldquo;device&rdquo;.  I would still be worried about whether &ldquo;device&rdquo; would include all of the things which should properly be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also a bit worried about whether the insertion here of the word &ldquo;device&rdquo; on its own, or the word &ldquo;devices&rdquo; on its own, is really sufficient. The section would read now: &ldquo;Dealing with fissile fuel or other radioactive substances or devices and irradiating apparatus.&rdquo;  I think we have a problem in construction here which will be quite as difficult as is the <Col N="648" /> mathematical problem of removing brackets in an appropriate order.  The word &ldquo;device&rdquo; indeed might in a certain sense here become too broad. Whether the word &ldquo;device&rdquo; being preceded by an &ldquo;or&rdquo; and followed by an &ldquo;and&rdquo; is sufficient to tie it into radioactive substances and make sure it is governed by &ldquo;radioactive&rdquo;, is a matter, I think, of the legal construction. I wonder if it would not be safer to put in here &ldquo;radioactive substances or radioactive devices&rdquo; to make sure that no manner of construction here would in fact give to the word &ldquo;device&rdquo; such a meaning that it would include non-radioactive devices.  I am not an expert on legal construction but when I do insert the words in the Minister's amendment this certainly comes to my mind.</P>
    <P>The other point in regard to the amendment is the one which I mentioned earlier: the specific case of whether a sub-critical nuclear reactor, which is a most substantial thing&mdash; something which would need to be heavily shielded, something which is potentially dangerous but which cannot of its nature produce a self-sustaining reaction, cannot of itself produce isotopes, breed isotopes&mdash;whether in fact this is of such a nature that it would be covered by the term &ldquo;devices&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole purpose of the use of &ldquo;devices&rdquo; is designed to cover precisely what Senator Dooge was talking about, because after he spoke on the Second Stage in this context, in which he recommended the incorporation of sub-critical nuclear reactors within the scope of the Bill, we took advice from a leading physicist and also from the draftsman and we married the views of the two, as it were&mdash;the scientific and the legal view. The joint view was that as it is now drafted in the amendment the phrase &ldquo;or devices&rdquo; does cover a sub-critical nuclear reactor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern is not with the Minister's intentions, which are of the best, or with reckoning that he has not done well in marrying a nuclear physicist and a parliamentary draftsman.  However, there are diriment <Col N="649" /> impediments against certain marriages. The ability of the nuclear physicist and the parliamentary draftsman to communicate with one another might well constitute a diriment impediment against the production of meaningful legislation.  Consequently, I find myself still with some doubts in this regard.  I would just ask the Minister if he would perhaps have the question examined, whether it might not be better to make this doubly sure by examining once again this amendment in conjunction with the definition of &ldquo;nuclear reactor&rdquo; in section 1, because what I intended to do during the Second Stage was to suggest the broadening of the definition of &ldquo;nuclear reactor&rdquo;.  It may well be that this marriage is indeed one which can take place and it may well be one which in this case has been fully consummated and the fruit of the marriage may well be a meaningful sentence in this particular subsection.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to ask the Minister which section takes precedence, 4 or 5.  As I read section 4, the board are given complete power to advise the Government, the Minister and any other Ministers, not only on <Col N="650" /> nuclear energy but on matters connected therewith, whereas in section 5 (1), on two or three occasions this advice is only to be tendered on request. I am wondering what the Minister's argument is that if the board are given full powers to advise on everything connected with nuclear energy, what happens if they start giving this advice without being requested by the Minister under paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 5.  Under paragraph (c), suppose they start advising some other Ministers of State about safety codes under section 4, and the Minister says: &ldquo;I did not ask you.&rdquo; The two sections appear to me to contradict one another somewhat in that full wide powers are given.</P>
      <P>I know section 5 begins to say &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality&rdquo;, but that does not necessarily mean very much.  If you have the generality then why make these other things subject to request by various Ministers?  I would have thought that the board would have power under section 4 to do these things without waiting for a ministerial request and I would have thought that that was the wise way to have it.  It does not prevent a Minister asking them to look into some matter that they may have overlooked or in something where he has not come across it, but I think it is particularly dangerous when you come to paragraph 5 (e).  I would have thought it should be very much a function of the board to have relation to international agreements on nuclear energy and so on without waiting for the Minister for External Affairs to ask them would they have a look at it.  Just what the precise intention behind this is I would be glad to hear from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, section 4 is the general functions section of course, giving overall status and power to the authority without any request or permission to advise the Government in paragraph (a), and to keep themselves informed of developments in nuclear energy and so on, in paragraph (b) of subsection (1).  The point made by Senator Sheldon is that he has already anticipated it.  I think he has not noted the start of section 5, <Col N="651" />&ldquo;without prejudice to the generality of section 4&rdquo;.  Apart from section 4, which gives the overall authority, there are specific functions given to the authority under paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of subsection (1) of section 5.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (a) concerns the Minister for Transport and Power and in that there is no &ldquo;at the request of the Minister&rdquo; clause to advise the Government. Paragraph (b) is &ldquo;if so requested&rdquo;, because here, under the provision for the construction of nuclear power stations and all aspects of the installation, operation, and supervision of such stations, the ESB come into play for consideration and consultation. In paragraph (c), in regard to the preparation of safety codes and regulations, the Minister for Local Government is concerned.  There is no request aspect written into paragraph (d); it is to promote knowledge, proficiency and research in nuclear science.  That is absolutely their field.  Paragraph (e) is, again, to advise the Minister for External Affairs and the Minister for Transport and Power regarding representation of the State on international bodies.  The point I am making is that anywhere the phrase &ldquo;if so requested&rdquo; arises in regard to dealing with other bodies and other Departments already established who have a major or sole interest in this particular field, the differentiation is that we are giving in certain aspects complete power to the board to put forward to the Government any other aspects where they impinge on the functions of existing authorities and administrations. This can only arise on request.  That is the purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what I was afraid of.  I was hoping the Minister would say that this is merely to draw attention to particular aspects but he is now going to say that these functions which are discharged on request under section 5 supersede the wide power given in paragraph (a) subsection (1) of section 4.  This is what bothered me. I took it that once this wide power exists to advise the Government, the Minister and any other Minister of State, on nuclear energy and matters <Col N="652" /> connected therewith, this is full power to advise without being requested at all and that what all this long tarradiddle in section 5 really meant was the sort of pious things you frequently get in Bills and Acts.  They always begin &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality&rdquo; and then you find that none of them ever operates because they always rely on the generality anyway.  I was hoping the Minister would say that it was drawing attention to certain aspects where other bodies would be interested and might nudge the board's elbow.  If he is to take the stand that these supersede in some way the powers given under&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not say that. They do not supersede.  It is desirable that where there are other authorities already established within the State there would be consultation between the board that would be established under this legislation and the existing authorities concerned, such as the Department of Local Government on the safety aspect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy with section 5 at all.  As I said on the <Col N="653" /> Second Reading of the Bill, I think there are several contradictory features in this section.  I should like to take them one by one.  The most important is the fact that the board will be drawing up regulations for the safe running of the nuclear power station and also, of course, of other radioactive materials used in science or industry, but especially this deals with a nuclear power station.  The board will be drawing up safety regulations and at the same time will be very much involved in advising the Minister on the actual running, the actual location, the actual installation and also, under subsection (2) (a), the supply of fuel for the station.</P>
      <P>There are several incompatibilities that can arise.  For example, the board will be interested in the cheapest possible fuel.  It may not be the safest. What line do they take in this sort of case?  I feel that these two items, in particular the safety function, should be the function of drawing up rules and making a code for the safe running of the nuclear station.  It should be completely independent from the other functions of the board.</P>
      <P>In the United Kingdom the bodies that make safety regulations are completely separate from the bodies involved in the actual running and installation of a nuclear station.  This is very important not only for the board but because people naturally have a psychological fear of the unknown, in this case the problems associated with disaster if such a terrible thing should occur in a nuclear power station.  It is very much a public relations exercise to see that not only the station is safe but that it should be seen to be safe. It will not be seen to be safe if the nuclear energy board are involved in these two incompatible functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various other ways in which the drawing up of a safety code can be regarded as incompatible with the functions of the board under subsection (1) (a), (b) and (c).  One does not have to go into them all.  The board are so much involved in the actual advice to the Minister on proposals of installation, location, supervision <i>et cetera,</i> that it will be very difficult to give advice on the two <Col N="654" /> things which in some sense does not conflict.  That is the first of the difficulties I see as far as section 5 is concerned.</P>
    <P>The second is a less difficult one.  It is the fact that the board will be operating on two completely different scales. They will be dealing with the macro scale involving large radiation units, terrific expenditure of money in a nuclear power station.  They will be also involved in drawing up a completely different set of regulations for the small radioactive sources that one can carry around virtually in one's hand.  They are used in science in universities, perhaps they will be used in schools shortly, certainly they are used in hospitals and in industry.  These are two completely different things.  We want to be clear that the board will have two completely different functions with respect to drawing up the codes to deal with large and small quantities of radioactive substances.</P>
    <P>Also, I should like to mention subsection (2) (a).  Because the board will be involved in the supply of fuel, they will presumably make some arrangement with the ESB.  Whether it will be in the form of a contract or whether it will be some other arrangement, the board will be responsible for obtaining the fuel from outside this country. There may be political problems here. At the moment the United Kingdom obtains the bulk of its fuel from South Africa and this could cause a considerable political problem.  Therefore, this is a difficulty which the board must face.  I should like also to mention that the board are interested in the running of sub-critical reactors for training purposes. Again we want to keep this completely separate from the running of a reactor for commercial purposes. There is absolutely no possibility of combining these two functions in the same installation.  In the first place the cost would be prohibitive, and in the second, safety regulations could not be drawn up to cover such an installation, so that the board must keep this very firmly in mind.  There are two separate functions: the running of reactors for commercial purposes, for the production of power, and the running of sub-critical <Col N="655" /> reactors for teaching or training purposes.</P>
    <P>I should particularly like to hear the Minister's views on these points and especially on the safety one.  Can this board be responsible for drawing up safety codes as well as advising the Minister on the running and installation of a station?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichealCranitch" hpid="Mícheál Cranitch Mícheál Cranitch">

      <P>Níl ach cupla focal le rádh agamsa.  Ní fisicí mé ach táim fada imbun na ndaoine ins na cúrsaí sin.  I am particularly pleased with paragraphs (a) and (d) of subsection (1).  They are of primary importance and indicate a very sensible approach to the whole question.  The board shall have the following particular functions:</P>
      <P>to advise the Government on the acquisition of nuclear reactors for training or for research purposes...</P>
      <P>That is of paramount importance because we have many excellent budding physicists in this country and what they badly need is a chance, on the spot so to speak, on the site, to get the know-how and do the research that is necessary if they are to blossom forth as first-class men.  The same idea is continued in paragraph (d):</P>
      <P>to promote knowledge, proficiency and research in nuclear science and technology and to act as an agency for the collection and dissemination of information on matters relating to nuclear science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is of the greatest importance because so many people are confused if one mentions nuclear energy at the moment.  They look at one and say &ldquo;Has that something to do with the atomic bomb?&rdquo;  That is what is in people's minds.  They seem never to advert to the fact that, if our coal and turf and oil supplies are in danger of disappearing within the foreseeable future, the Almighty has given us another source of energy.  Therefore, these two paragraphs are very important and show much foresight on the part of those who framed them.  Maybe it is not so strange that I find almost the identical wording here in this book published by the European Information Service, <i>Europe and Energy,</i> in <Col N="656" /> connection with the European Economic Community and the six nations involved there.  I quote:</P>
    <P>With regard to nuclear energy the government are prepared to promote and intensify research and experimental work and foster the industrial development of nuclear energy in the Community in order that this new energy source may make its full contribution as soon as possible at economic cost to the coverage of the Community's energy requirements.</P>
    <P>That is very enlightening indeed, especially in view of the fact that we have been knocking at the door and hope to be admitted to the European Economic Community.  I commend the Minister and I commend the framers of these paragraphs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator West raised a very valid point concerning the differentiation between the various categories of utilisation, as it were, to which nuclear energy can be put.  You have the generation aspect, the health aspect, the teacher training aspect for which the sub-critical reactors are so important, you have the whole research aspect as well as the safety aspect. Therefore, you have a number of categories. The British have got around to making a separation between the safety aspect and the rest, as it were, in the form of two separate public authorities.  It was only last year, 1970, that they set up a public authority called the National Radiological Protection Board to deal with protection and safety in regard to the effects of radiation and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has come a long number of years after they established their own Atomic Energy Authority.  While I agree we may reach the stage here where we may have to do this, I think, at this early stage it would be putting the cart before the horse to start setting up separate authorities to cover the various fields involved.  That we may develop into that situation in years to come is very likely, because there is an obvious separation, particularly between the medical safety side and the power generating side and the separation between each of these and the <Col N="657" /> whole training, research and education side.  For the present it is important that we realise precisely where we are. We are starting out on this field; we are bringing in initial legislation to cover the whole field and to set up a board of people who will be able to advise in an expert fashion on what should be done.</P>
    <P>There is a certain urgency in the matter in so far as the ESB have already advanced considerably in developing positive plans for the erection of a nuclear power station.  They have researched the matter and have had a team of people working on it. Therefore, this is going to become of practical importance next year.  The medical side is already with us; the safety side will become of growing importance as we move further and further into this field.  All of this will be within the compass of the board itself as they examine in the years ahead the progress of events in the various directions I have mentioned. But at this stage it would be rather fruitless to set up separate authorities, although I do agree with Senator West that we will arrive at a stage when this will be necessary.  It is a question of timing.  It will probably arise in five or ten years time but the immediate matter is to get this authority going, get the expert board appointed, get the personnel appointed and get the whole structure established.  We can go from there on the lines of what has been said here by both Senator Dooge and Senator West.  Undoubtedly the two Senators concerned have a very substantial knowledge in this particular field.  They are raising points that I am certain will be considered by the board when we establish the board.  There is no question about that.  However, first things first.  Let us get the board going first and then these matters will come up for consideration.  Certainly, there will be legislation in the years to come along the lines mentioned by Senators.</P>
    <P>What Senator Cranitch said is very true: that the particular phraseology here is in line with the general international phraseology in this particular field.  I am concerned about the whole field of knowledge and training aspects. <Col N="658" /> You might notice from the phraseology of this section that on this particular aspect the board have absolute power. There is no question of their being requested by any Minister in this particular field.  So far as promoting knowledge or proficiency in research in this field of nuclear science is concerned, the board will be the agency for the collection and dissemination of information on matters relating to nuclear science.  It is very important that this should be so because, in my view, it will be the great issue of the future. This particular form of energy that started off in a destructive manner will&mdash;if we organise it properly&mdash; emerge as the great constructive way to help mankind in the future.</P>

      <P>The Minister has again adduced the argument that we might, perhaps, relax our scrutiny of this particular measure to some degree on the grounds that this is the first of a number of Bills.  As soon as the board are operating, an amending Bill will be introduced.  Perhaps I should explain to the Minister, in case he thinks we are being discourteous to him in continuing to scrutinise the Bill carefully, that we are conscious of the very severe limitations that a Member of the House is under when an amending Bill comes to the House. If, after two years, the board consider that, say, section 17 of this Bill&mdash; if it has a section 17&mdash;should be amended, we will have a Bill brought into this House to amend section 17. The Cathaoirleach, myself or whoever may be in the chair will use the Rules of the House to prevent Senator West from discussing section 5 under the amending Bill.  We cannot assume that because an amending Bill is liable to come forward on some aspects of this &mdash;and what aspects it comes forward on are unknown; this is the very argument made by the Minister: that we cannot tell what recommendations the board would make with regard to amendment.  If we cannot tell it then the only thing this House can do, at the first passage of a Bill, when every section is before it, and may not be before it again, is to scrutinise every section carefully.  I just make this point now and I will leave it at that for the <Col N="659" /> moment although I am not finished with section 5.</P>

      <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister make the point that in the question of training and research the board would really have the authority and initiative to act independently of any Government request.  In this regard I should like to refer to a point I made on the Second Stage discussion. I raised the question as to what relationship was envisaged, at this stage, in the research area between the board and the National Science Council which also have responsibilities in this area. I would be interested to hear any view the Minister may have in this matter because it seems to me to be important, particularly at a time when our investment resources in most fields are limited, that we should not have machinery handling requests in a particular area&mdash;in this case the area of scientific research&mdash;divided at the very start.  It seems to me that there must be some argument for having the distribution of resources for scientific research under one body or, particularly if there is more than one body in one field, that we should be reasonably clear about the relationship between those bodies.</P>
      <P>The other point I should like to make also relates to this business of the independence of the new board.  On many occasions when we establish boards the Departments which will work most closely with the boards often seem very anxious to hold some control over areas which are to be vested in the new boards.  Where subsection (3) is concerned, what exactly has the Minister in mind here?  I noted that in subsection (2) &ldquo;the Minister may from time to time by order assign to the Board&rdquo; a series of functions. Again, in subsection (3):</P>
      <P>Where in an order under this section the Minister prescribes conditions, the Board shall comply with such conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not quite clear what the idea is behind subsection (3).  It seems to me that, if the functions listed in subsection (2) are within the Minister's province to request the Board to deal <Col N="660" /> with, surely that is all the control he needs in that area, without having conditions for dealing with particular functions?  I may not be getting the point on this but I would be interested, from the point of view of clarity, in hearing the Minister's views on this point also.</P>

      <P>I am glad it is the Minister's opinion that safety regulations may eventually be split off from the other functions of the board.  As he said, this has just happened in Britain and I believe it is about to happen in the US; the Atomic Energy Commission are going to split.  I would like to raise a further point in connection with the safety regulations.  It is one of the things that the board will have to get on with straight away because I know that in placing the contract, which will obviously be placed with a firm outside this country, the regulations are needed as a stick to beat the contractor with.  Regulations must be set down by a Government body so that the contractor can be forced to fit into these regulations, to fit into this code and to obey the rules that we set up to satisfy ourselves, giving the board, the ESB, or whoever is actually the body signing the contract, some control over the firm actually building the installation.</P>

      <P>I doubt if anyone in the Seanad feels less possessed of nuclear energy than myself this evening.  However, I thought that it might be no harm if I did express a view on this section.  We are making law and it is true that, as the law stands, the judge cannot look, professionally at least, at what is said in Parliament as to what was intended. Therefore, the Minister says &ldquo;is intended&rdquo; with regard to sections 4 and 5 but this cannot be looked at by any judge who comes to construe what this Bill, when enacted, means.  I would express the view, and invite other people who are affected, whether positively or negatively, by our qualifications, to consider how you construe the two sections together.  I do not think that you can assume that the legislation was intended to have no meaning when it introduced the words &ldquo;if so requested by a Minister of <Col N="661" /> State&rdquo; or &ldquo;if requested by the Minister&rdquo; and so on.  In other words, it is probable if someone wanted to tabulate my view at the moment, that the words &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality&rdquo; should not, in fact, prevent the Minister in question from saying, if he got a piece of advice that he did not want to listen to, that, despite the generality of the powers of the board, he had to listen to it because the Legislature had gone on to particularise certain functions of the board, but had gone on to restrict the performance of these functions as being only possible to the board if requested by the Minister. We cannot here depend on what I am sure is a sincere ministerial assurance.  We have to look at this piece of proposed legislation and see how it would be construed.  I think it would be construed in relation to those paragraphs of subsection (1) of section 5, that in fact they would be prevented from doing the things which are allocated to them unless they were requested by the Minister in question, despite the fact that these particular functions are allocated to them without prejudice to the generality of section 4.</P>

      <P>Might I, in supporting the general point made by Senator Sheldon and Senator Alexis FitzGerald, suggest that the Minister's intentions in this regard might possibly be better met if the drafting were somewhat along the lines that the board &ldquo;may and if requested by the Minister shall&rdquo;, advise the Minister. This would leave it perfectly clear that the board may of their own volition, tender advice and also leave it that the board have no option but to tender advice which the Minister thinks it is necessary to have.</P>

      <P>There is a little difficulty here in that there are specific functions residing in the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Health, and the Minister for Labour. These are the three Ministers involved, apart from the ESB.  The laws are there by virtue of statutory authority so we cannot breach the legislation that has established these particular Departments and State-sponsored organisations. That is the difficulty we are in <Col N="662" /> and that is why I feel that the phrase &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality&rdquo; is open to enable the board, under section 4, to do pretty well the whole range of objectives set out in section 4, subsection (1) and subsection (2). Between these two subsections there is a total permission as far as the board is concerned, irrespective of what is said in section 5.  This is, in effect, what I said in reply to Senator Sheldon.  It has to be spelled out in section 5 in that manner by reason of the existing statutory functions residing in the particular Ministries and the State-sponsored organisations concerned.</P>

      <P>I wish to come in again on this net point.  The Minister has certainly clarified the issue, but clarified it to an extent which has almost horrified me.  I had not realised what the Minister was going to do in regard the control of standards under the Bill.  I had the impression that, with the possible exception of health, he was going to consolidate all of the controlling regulations in regard to radioactive substances.  It would appear from what the Minister has just said that, whereas he said earlier to Senator West that we should have one body dealing with both nuclear installations and radioactive substances, we are going to have one body which deals with nuclear installations and part of the control of radioactive substances. We are to have three other bodies in the persons of the Ministers for Health, Labour and Local Government also controlling.</P>

      <P>Let us be practical about it.  We are now setting up a new organisation.  At the moment there are no staff, no personnel, no finance.  This <Col N="663" /> is all to flow from statutory authority which the Oireachtas will give to the establishment of such an organisation. At the present time there are existing Departments who have personnel, finance and statutory authority and who have division in their own fields.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned this in my Second Reading speech and I should again like to emphasise that this is a new measure.  We are starting out on a new endeavour.  We are setting up a new organisation.  There are existing organisations within the State who are impinging on this field already and have the staff, finance and statutory authority.  We just cannot, by a single legislative stroke of the pen, wipe out these organisations and set up a new authority.  This new authority must first be set up, got under way, and then we can have what has been mentioned by Senator Dooge just now and what has been mentioned in other contexts. Within the next few years, I, or whoever is in my place, will be here before the Oireachtas bringing forward a measure dealing in a more comprehensive way with this whole matter.  There is no point in setting up legislation for the sake of setting up legislation unless there is a practical apparatus at hand. There is no practical apparatus at hand here.  We are setting up legislation and from the legislation will flow the practical apparatus.  From that will develop the ideas from which will germinate a new legislative measure comprehending many of the points put forward here by the Senators.  There is no point in setting up automatically an organisation which, in fact, cannot work because you have existing statutory powers, existing Departments and existing organisations who are already advanced in various areas of this particular field.  What I am proposing in this Bill is no more and no less than the establishment of an authority that can advise me and advise the Government and set about the whole co-ordination of this field.  We can then co-ordinate the work that is being carried out by the ESB at present; the work that is being done by the Department <Col N="664" /> of Labour on the safety side, the Department of Local Government on the same side, the Department of Health on the health side and by the various universities as well, on the research and clinical side.</P>
      <P>So we have set up an organisation to advise me on how best all of this can be co-ordinated&mdash;how to organise it.  This is a matter that must be approached step by step and I should like the Seanad to see it in that perspective. That is in answer to Senator Dooge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, that is no answer to what Senator Dooge has said.  It is true, as the Minister has said, that in his Second Reading speech he had regard to the fact that these things were dealt with at the moment by the Minister for Local Government in certain aspects, by the Minister for Health in other aspects and by the Minister for Labour in yet other aspects.  I took it that the Minister was describing the mess he was going to clear up and not a mess he was going to perpetuate.  The whole point in having special legislation in regard to radioactive substances is that they are peculiar substances needing special treatment.  At the moment, because there is no legislation of this type it is necessary for health inspectors to be charged with certain additional duties. Because there is no legislation of this type, the Minister for Labour has to use powers and authority that were designed for other purposes to cover the unloading of radioactive materials at the docks&mdash;the transport of radioactive materials.  I said somewhat facetiously on the Second Stage that I was sure we would meet our friend, the alkali inspector, before the debates were over.  Here we are now meeting him apparently as someone whom the Minister thinks is expert enough to still carry on the monitoring of possible radioactivity after we have a nuclear reactor and a nuclear power plant installed in the country.  The Minister says that there is already statutory authority and that there are already staffs dealing with it.  There are persons dealing with it as part of far greater responsibilities.  There are persons dealing with it because there was nobody <Col N="665" /> else to deal with it and it was tacked on to their work.  These people have the authority but, as I have interjected, they have not the expertise.  If a proper job is to be made of the control of radioactive material from the day it is landed at our ports or airports until the day when the spent fuel is reexported, it is necessary that this be done under a single authority.</P>
      <P>If one reads the debates which took place in the House of Commons on several Bills in connection with the control of radioactive substances in Britain, there was one point on which all members there were united, and quite a number of these members were speaking with special knowledge.  It was this: there was a welcome for the present dispensation in Britain whereby the principle is adopted of one single national authority to deal with radioactive substances.  The Minister says that it is hardly possible to do it under this Bill.  Surely it is possible to do it under the Bill?  Surely it is possible to state that the Minister may make an order at any time which will transfer to the new nuclear board and to its inspectorial staff along with their other functions the functions now performed as an appendage to their other functions by inspectors in the Department of Local Government, in the Department of Health and in the Department of Labour?  From the point of view of the control of radioactive substances, this Bill will be a bad one if the Minister only uses it to fill in certain gaps in regard to the control of radioactive substances.  Therefore, I would urge the Minister that he should, if necessary, discuss with his colleagues the question of putting in a section here which would allow him, even at some future date, to transfer these functions to where they belong within the expert organisation&mdash;the organisation that will have the expert knowledge on the monitoring and control of these substances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to strongly back Senator Dooge in what he says about this single authority.  It is absolutely vital.  Obviously, changes and amendments will have to be made to this Bill, but we do want the Nuclear Energy Board to get off to a really <Col N="666" /> good start; there is no point in doing it if it does not get off to a good start. Otherwise, our work is going to be wasted.  This means that the Minister has to give this board teeth; he has to give them the control over the radioactive substances during the passage of these substances through this country. If the board are set up and are hamstrung by relations with other bodies, the whole point of having a nuclear energy board vanishes.  If there was an amount of inter-play between the Nuclear Energy Board and other authorities, the only person who would be fit to sit on the board would be the legitimate offspring of the draftsmen and physicists who were discussed earlier in the debate.  I would make a very strong plea to give the board the teeth and the authority to deal with the whole of the nuclear problem, when it arises.  This is apart from the radioactive substances which are in the country at the moment.  With the problem of a nuclear generating station it is necessary to give the board the authority to deal with the problem in its entirety.  This is absolutely vital if we are going to have a nuclear energy board that is to function at all well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are often accused in the Government of bringing in legislation without consultation, that is, legislation that is too directive and too regulatory.  I am in the situation where I am bringing in a Bill that is designed to ensure that we ease into a situation where we will have a single authority to deal with nuclear energy generally, and all its facets that have been discussed here in the Seanad, by a gradual process of consultation and fusion of the various interests and agencies already concerned with it.  This is a sensible approach. If you set up, by legislation, a nuclear energy board, <i>per se,</i> I do not see what particular purpose can be achieved by it.  The logical thing to do is to set up the board, give them the sort of functions that we have under section 4, where, as their general function, they would advise the Government, the Minister and any other Minister of State, on nuclear energy and matters concerned with it; under (b) of the same subsection they would have <Col N="667" /> to keep themselves informed of developments; and under subsection (2) to do anything consequential on that.  There is a wide-ranging general power vested in the board under that section.</P>
      <P>Then, under section 5, subsection (1) there are absolute powers vested in the board, without the request of any Government Minister, to advise the Government on the acquisition of nuclear reactors for training or research purposes&mdash;that is under (a) of subsection (1).  Under paragraph (b) they have the function to advise the Minister, if requested, and rightly so, on the construction of nuclear power stations. Again, the ESB are involved here in a very active way, and there has to be co-ordination between the ESB and the nuclear energy board and the Minister in regard to such construction. Paragraph (c) is very properly a link up between the board and the Departments of Local Government and Labour, who are concerned with safety codes and regulations.  Under (d) they have total and absolute power themselves in a field which would be particular to themselves to promote knowledge of efficiency and research, nuclear science and technology; then under (e) they are linked up again with the Minister for External Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This all makes sense to me.  They are all existing agencies where they have to co-ordinate; where they do not have to co-ordinate with an existing agency, they have absolute powers to go ahead. Then under section 4 they have the overall general power to proceed. Furthermore, under subsection (2) of section 5 you have very strong power&mdash; Senator West talked about teeth&mdash; where &ldquo;The Minister may, from time to time, by order, assign to the board the following functions&rdquo;.  The Minister may, under subsection (2) (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e), assign absolutely basic arrangements and responsibilities for the operation of supply of fissile fuel or such other radioactive substances or devices, the responsibility for the safe custody of such fuel and disposal of radioactive waste products, responsibility for the safe operation of nuclear power reactors, the safety of the public, responsibility for the safe operation of <Col N="668" /> nuclear training reactors and performance of functions mentioned in paragraph (b) ranging from control, custody, use, manufacture and importation <i>et cetera</i> of radioactive substances and/or devices.  If you want teeth I cannot see what more teeth you can give to the board or give to the Bill than you see incorporated under subsection (2) of section 5.  I should like to say again to the Seanad that there is no point in passing legislation that cannot be effective.</P>
    <P>We have fully discussed this whole matter with all the people already in the country who are concerned with nuclear energy.  This Bill has been the result of mature deliberation with all interests concerned, both academic and professional.  It has been done after consultation with the International Atomic Energy Agency who approved fully of the Bill as the right way to approach the matter and they are the leading people in the world on the matter. We have had full discussion with the National Science Council on the matter.  They are quite happy about the position.  One must get down to a sense of reality about these matters.  What the Bill is designed to do is to make a start on this matter.  You do not make a start on a matter of this kind by sitting on top of interests; you make a start on a matter of this kind by consulting with interests internally and taking the advice of people externally who have experience of it.  As I have said, we have discussed with the International Atomic Energy Agency, discussed with and examined the various types of organisation and types of administration that have been established elsewhere throughout the world. We feel that in our circumstances this is the way to go about it for a start.  It is nothing more and nothing less than that.  We cannot make a wrong start. It is designed to make a right start.</P>

      <P>I simply would not like to ask the Minister to comment, as he has not done, on the point I have made that in terms of law the courts must give some meaning to the words &ldquo;if so requested&rdquo; and that the meaning which the courts are likely to give to these words is that the only reason for these words being there is <Col N="669" /> that they cut down the ability of the board to do things thereby particularised.</P>
      <P>That would be my view of what the law would be on this but I am speaking simply as a Senator and I can be very wrong on that.  In practice if the Minister receives representations from the board of the views of international bodies on paragraph (e) dealing with nuclear energy, is not his obvious response, the advised response, going to be &ldquo;But you have not been so requested by me&rdquo;?  If this is not his response, not likely to be or intended to be his response, may I suggest the deletion of the words&mdash;or, in due course acceptance of the amendment proposed by Senator Dooge&mdash;&ldquo;if so requested&rdquo;.

There is merit in what Senator FitzGerald says on &ldquo;if so requested by a Minister of State&rdquo; as it arises in subsection (1) (b), (c) and (e). It would make for cleaner drafting and cleaner administration under the board.</P>
      <P>I go a certain bit of the way with the Senator in this respect.  Subsection (e), as regards the Minister for External Affairs, must remain: we are dealing there with external arrangements. Similarly, under subsection (2) (a): that would apply as well.  In each case, we are dealing with external arrangements and the Minister for External Affairs would have to stay there.  I do think a reasonably valid case has been made by the Seanad in regard to subsection (1) (b) and (c) and if a deletion can be made in both of these cases I would feel I should be going some of the way.  I will examine whether or not we can delete these.</P>

      <P>Still on section 5, subsection (1) (a), I should like the Minister, in the light of this paragraph, to inform us whether, firstly, the intention and, secondly, the effect, of this paragraph, would be to restrict advice, in regard to reactors for training and research purposes to advice tendered to the Government.  It seems to me that, in the matter of research reactors, a body such as the Higher Education Authority, now being born, in another place, might well be very thankful, for advice from a body, such as the Nuclear Energy Board, on questions of the purchase of research reactors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would seem to me, on a first reading of this paragraph, that the board can advise the Government.  Furthermore, it would appear that it can advise the Government on whether or not the Government should acquire a research reactor.  This might well be construed as indicating that they could not advise anybody else on the acquisition of a research reactor.  In the report, published in 1958, by the Atomic Energy Committee here on the purchase of a research reactor, the majority of the members suggested that a research reactor should be operated within a particular university department; certain other members signed a minority report that it should be operated by the Nuclear Energy Board itself.  However, it would appear, on a first reading of this paragraph, that there is a <Col N="671" /> possibility of the Government itself acquiring, operating and supervising such a reactor because, under this paragraph, the Government can seek the advice of the Nuclear Energy Board.</P>

      <P>That is global.  It covers the acquisition of such reactors for training and research purposes, in my reading of it, by any body such as the Higher Education Authority, such as any university or other academic institution or any type of scientific or other institution or firm, or any body, any agents, you like to think of.  The acquisition by the Government of such reactors and all aspects of their location, installation, operation and supervision are, I think, two separate matters.</P>

      <P>It is a point that might well be looked at.  In conclusion, I might say that in particular the function of the Higher Education Authority, the function of the National Science Council mentioned earlier by Senator Keery are very much concerned with the question of fostering centres of excellence in different spheres of research. This council and the Higher Education Authority would be concerned. Rather than have advice coming to the Government, who might then have to turn to the other bodies for further advice on this, it might be well if this Nuclear Energy Board plus the National Science Council plus the Higher Education Authority were to come together at an early stage and either jointly or separately advise the Government.</P>

      <P>Section 5 (1) (c). This, I think, can be read with section 6.  I revive my anxiety which arose when we were discussing this question of requesting by Ministers in regard to the question of regulation.  I understand from the Minister that he intends to delete, if there are no serious objections, &ldquo;if so requested by a Minister of State&rdquo; from paragraph (c) but I would urge him to go further: I would express the hope that it is not too late to examine the question of having one authority controlling.  I would particularly direct the Minister's attention to the radioactive substances Bill in the House of Commons in 1969 and in particular the report of the working party which formed the major part of the White Paper on which that Bill was based.  Both in that working party report and in the discussions in the House the principle of one single authority was taken as a paramount principle for the efficient operation.  Let us learn by Britain's mistake.  It is not enough to say that Britain only did this after ten years of experience.  Britain did it after ten years of experience, acknowledging that a mistake had been made in not doing this at an earlier stage.  I would ask the Minister to look carefully at that between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I see a situation in which we move into the sort of sole authority field mentioned by Senator Dooge.  At this stage I will meet the views expressed by the Seanad by making the deletions which I think are valid&mdash;the various requests by anybody else.  I will delete these on Report Stage so as to give more clear power and more authority.  On the practical aspects of launching straight away into taking over all personnel and functions and statutory operations at the moment carried on by other personnel and sections of other Departments and organisations in this field, I do not think the time is ripe yet.  We have sufficient power under sections 4 and 5 to lead to a situation where this will happen.  It will undoubtedly happen when we start developing in this field to a greater extent, as we will be very shortly.  I feel that that is the best way to go about it.  There is no point in setting up an absolute authority in the present time incorporating everybody engaged in this field unless there is something to do.  What I want to do is to set up an authority that can advise me on what it can do and how it should be constituted to do what needs to be done.  It is a pragmatic approach, but I think it is the most practical way to go about it.</P>

      <P>Might I clarify what I said in asking the Minister to look at this.  I am not necessarily asking him, though I might think it the proper thing to do, that this board should, from the very first day, deal with everything.  Rather I am asking him to consider something that I mentioned earlier: that he might provide in this Bill for the transfer of functions by order at a particular time.  The Minister seems to think that the present position is adequate.  I might ask him what are the safety codes and regulations which now deal with radioactive substances?  What are these codes that the Minister is content to rely on and leave to be operated by his colleagues?</P>

I am giving this board <Col N="674" /> sufficient power under sections 4 and 5 to advise me as to their inadequacy or otherwise.  This is what the whole purpose behind the establishment of this board is.  I am not competent at this stage to advise the House on their adequacy.  I am quite certain there are many faults and flaws.  It is up to such a board as this, with full authority, full expertise, to deliberate, make decisions, come forward with the appropriate recommendations, and they have the authority to do that under sections 4 and 5.  Then, after a period, having ascertained that in the whole field, we can examine the situation and incorporate into legislation the type of authority which the Senator is recommending.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's view here but I cannot help thinking when I look at the particular document in my hand at the moment: the report of the Radioactivity Consultative Council established by the Minister for Health.  This council reported in February, 1959, which was 12 years ago.  I mentioned on the Second Stage that as far as I was aware the draft health regulations have not yet been enacted by the Department of Health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>But why do you want this Bill?  My argument is that a Department which 12 years ago, received from an expert committee draft regulations which covered all that required to be covered but has not yet made an order putting these regulations into force does not give a high priority to the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>It highlights the need for removing the Department of Health from the control of radioactive substances.  A Department which has waited 12 years may wait another 12 years.  I suggest that neither the Department of Local Government nor the Department of Labour have shown <Col N="675" /> concern.  To give them their due, they have made certain efforts.  They have done certain things.  They have assigned certain duties as a very small part of larger duties.  They have not shown themselves concerned: they have not shown themselves competent.  The Department of Health got expert advice. Not merely was there a recommendation that regulations be made but there were 35 specific regulations.  To leave those without bringing them into force for 12 years would at least justify in this Bill a section which would allow the transfer to the new board of the powers the Minister for Health has under the 1953 Act in regard to radioactive substances. These were put into the 1953 Act, as can be seen from the debate, because these substances were becoming important and there was no other way of controlling them.  The Minister now has a way of control.</P>

      <P>It is rare that Members of the Opposition should urge the Minister to operate by regulation instead of coming back for fresh legislation. The Minister is being extremely foolish in this regard in not inserting here, in the fundamental statute, the power to transfer, step by step if he likes&mdash;rapid step by step, I would hope &mdash;the powers from those authorities to whom they are a nuisance and a burden at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Under subsection (1) (d) the Minister proposes that the board should have the particular function without prejudice to its function to keep itself informed.  Under section 4 (1) (b) it has the particular function to promote knowledge, proficiency and research in nuclear science and technology and to act as an agency for the collection and dissemination of information on matters relating to nuclear science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How does the Minister see this being operated?  There are many ways in which it could operate.  One way would be that the Nuclear Energy Board <Col N="676" /> should advise the Minister, unrequested or requested, to the effect that all nuclear research should be carried out directly under the board's own agency. It might well be able to produce arguments to show that this would be marginally more economic, marginally less costly to the Government, than if this were perhaps spread among two or three other centres of research.  Nevertheless, as Senator Cranitch said earlier and as has been said on the Second Stage of this debate, one of the benefits of the development under this Bill is that the knowledge gained should be diffused among the whole of our scientific and technological community.  If we look at the paragraph a little closely we shall see it is one of the ones in which they do not advise: they go ahead and do it rather than just advise the Minister that it should be done.</P>
    <P>There may perhaps be a danger that the board would in its enthusiasm&mdash; let us hope its members and its officers are enthusiastic about their job&mdash;push forward with research under its own direct aegis and might tend to weaken the research efforts, the educational efforts, of the physics and engineering departments in our other institutions of higher learning and research.  There may be a difficulty in this regard.  I do not know if the Minister has any views as to the extent to which&mdash;in acting under this paragraph for promoting knowledge, proficiency and research&mdash; it should be carried out.  If it is interpreted not as direct action, not as direct research, not as a direct search for knowledge, but rather that it should promote research by giving financial support, if necessary, to research workers in other institutions, then I think the need for co-ordination with the National Science Council may well become a very difficult problem and the point made by Senator Keery is highly relevant to this paragraph.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister to give us the benefit of his views on this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I make a small point in relation to the dissemination of information?  I would underline that it will be of extreme importance that information be disseminated as quickly <Col N="677" /> as possible among academic institutions. Let me give an example of something which I think has happened already: I could not find the reference to the title of the body in my notes.  I understand that recently, in connection with our developments in this field, Ireland became a member of the International Atomic Energy Commission. This is an example of something where, immediately, scholarships may be available for the training of Irish scientists, and so on, through this agency.  This is an example of what may occur more and more as the Nuclear Energy Board makes contacts with other institutions and other countries. It is particularly important, in this matter of scientific research and scientific awards, that people should get as early notice as possible of what is available.  Often, it takes a lot of time to draw up a research programme for submission for an award.  In other fields, other agencies handling news of scholarships and matters of this kind available in other countries, are often rather slow in passing on the message to our academic institutions.  Often, because of this, I fear opportunities are lost which might otherwise be available. It is important that the board should make sure that its officers act quickly and effectively in the quick dissemination of information, particularly the type of information to which I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsection is designed precisely to deal with the problem raised by Senator Keery.  We would hope the board would act as an overall co-ordinator in this whole field and in so doing would not impinge on the activities, referred to by Senator Dooge, already being carried on in the various university colleges in Dublin, Cork and Galway. Indeed, in the Agricultural Institute, considerable work has been done on the various techniques in which radioactive tracers are used in the development of progress of nutrients in soils and plants.  This is a very widespread work, so far as the whole biological area is concerned, in regard to the control of disease and pests.  The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards is also involved in this field and, of <Col N="678" /> course, as has been mentioned already, the National Science Council.</P>
      <P>The whole purpose of setting up this board and, in particular, the purpose of subsection (1) (d) is to ensure that knowledge is promoted, research is promoted, in nuclear science and technology and that you have an overall agency for the collection and dissemination of information on matters relating to nuclear science.  This matter has been discussed with all the bodies I have just mentioned, all the university bodies and the non-university bodies who are already concerned with this field.  They feel there is a lack of back-up information on the whole field of nuclear science.  They welcome, in particular, this subsection as providing them, as it were, with the basic library of information and basic research to which all of these bodies, in their varying interests, can go for the information required or the basic research required.  That is why this section has been put in here.  There is no question of taking over the various institutions concerned.  It is a question of coordinating their work and providing a basic source of research and information from which they can draw.  This is the primary purpose of this subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has shown in his reply here that his attitude towards how the board might operate under this is, indeed, a proper one.  There is a function which it can discharge very well in regard to co-ordination and in regard to being the link between scientists and technologists working in this country and those working in this particular field in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the specific problem mentioned by Senator Keery about the availability of scholarships, I think this underlines, once again, the need for co-operation, particularly with the National Science Council.  I might mention, with approval, the publication recently circulated by the National Science Council which draws together, under one cover, the various postgraduate scholarships available to Irish students.  This will be, from now on, the standard reference for students and <Col N="679" /> their advisers in this regard.  The essential thing is that any scholarships of which the Nuclear Energy Board becomes aware should be included in this standard compilation rather than be the subject of a second circular which might well not reach as wide a body as would be reached by this particular publication of the National Science Council which I think will be the authoritative reference for those who wish to investigate what financial support is available for research work in different fields.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (1) (e), the Minister has mentioned that we have become members of the International Atomic Energy Agency.  Is this the only agency?  What are our relations with the European Nuclear Energy Association?  Have we any relations with what was Euratom, the branch of the EEC concerned with atomic energy?</P>

      <P>There is no question about this.  Again, the Senator has touched on one of the purposes of the Bill which is to do precisely just this. Heretofore, it has been done on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by External Affairs and Transport and Power utilising the ESB because the priority was to get a nuclear generating station off the ground.  The whole purpose of the Bill is to ensure that this wider view will be taken of the whole situation, within the ambit of authority such as this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>On subsection (2) (a), in regard to the question of supply of fissile fuel, which was mentioned by Senator West earlier, this is a problem that might well have political implications.  This paragraph suggests that the Minister, in regard to this, should make decisions only in agreement with the Minister for External <Col N="681" /> Affairs.  This is proper in regard to any importation of this nature.  However, the political implications of uranium have tremendously influenced the world.  The existence of uranium in Czechoslovakia has been cited as a very formative factor in the recent political history of that country.  As Senator West has mentioned, many of Britain's actions may well be explicable only in terms of the fact that the vast proportion of her uranium supplies are to come from South Africa.</P>
      <P>This problem of fissile fuel is so fraught with complications that this might be a matter which would require Government decision.  One could say that, under ordinary circumstances, it would be sufficient to consult the Minister for External Affairs and that he would have the good sense to know when the matter should go for Government decision.  However, there is a point in this regard.  If we adhere to the European Economic Community, have the members of the Community a common policy for the purchase of fissile fuel?  Would we be constrained, as members of the EEC, in regard to the markets in which we might purchase fissile fuel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a defence link-up here as well so far as the EEC is concerned but they have a common policy in this regard.  It is envisaged that the board, or the ESB as licensed by the board, or the Minister would acquire fissile fuel.  Only safeguarding arrangements need to be agreed with the International Atomic Energy Agency.  This point was raised again on the Second Stage.  It touches on the point just raised by Senator Dooge.</P>
      <P>There are difficulties in regard to the supply situation of fissile fuel.  One of the attractions of nuclear fusion is that the dependence will be much less when we get into the area of nuclear fusion. There is a certain dependence at present but it is not as uncertain as the dependence which exists at the moment in western Europe on oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke of the fuel as being bought by the board or of the ESB licensed by the board.  I do not see anything about licensing in <Col N="682" /> paragraph (a).  What will be the legal position?  It seems, from paragraph (a), that the Nuclear Energy Board must buy the fuel.</P>

The function of acquiring fissile fuel would be delegated if necessary.  Obviously, the ESB would require it for power purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>In paragraph (b) there is a point I should like to raise concerning responsibility for the safe custody of fissile fuel.  It may well be, arising from what has emerged from discussing the last paragraph, that, in fact, the fissile fuel would be purchased, imported, under licence by the ESB.  How would the Nuclear Energy Board discharge its responsibility for the safe custody?  What steps would it take?  Certain amounts of fissile fuel may be imported by the ESB under licence.  Other radioactive substances may be imported directly by the Nuclear Energy Board.  How will the Nuclear Energy Board discharge its liabilities under paragraph (b) in regard to fuel directly imported and to fuel imported under licence?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is set out under section 5 (2) (b).  The responsibility for the safe operation of nuclear power reactors, in so far as the safety of the public, whether in the State or elsewhere, is likely to be affected by such operation: this is what I can assign to the board by way of order.  Much of this is in the process of being done, on an international basis, by the International Atomic Energy Commission. Our adherence to any conventions they may prepare will mean that the international safety regulations that will be agreed to by us, by way of convention, <Col N="683" /> will be world-wide safety regulations. They will apply here as elsewhere and will be enforced by the board.</P>

If we find the Nuclear Energy Board importing such materials, transporting them&mdash; which may well be the critical point of the operation &mdash; to the places where they are to be used, we have the difficulty here that we may find the board monitoring itself.

      <P>The British have just done this &mdash; only last year.  Let us face it, the British have been doing this for some years now.  It is only last year that they have brought in this separation of powers as it were.  I am certain that, as we develop in this field, similar legislation will be necessary.  It is a little premature, until we get the situation moving properly, to start setting up separate boards, and so on.  If we get this board established, get it moving; have its advice available, then, at a certain stage, when we are more in the nuclear energy field, as it were, the aspect of setting up a separate safety authority will certainly arise.</P>

      <P>I take it the Minister's point is that these matters will crop up in the future.  On one reading, it seems to me that, as an alternative possibility, particularly should we enter the EEC, these problems may, in a sense, be taken out of our hands.  As I understand the White Paper on Membership <Col N="684" /> of the European Community, and Chapter 13 dealing with membership of Euratom, pages 94 and 95, it seems that, by virtue of membership of Euratom, we would, in effect, be subject to the Euratom regulations regarding safety and monitoring.  Paragraph 13.5 of the White Paper also covers the supply of the fuel and indicates that the Euratom Supply Agency would have the exclusive right to conclude contracts for such materials originating within the Community or outside it. Many of the problems in which Senators on all sides of the House are interested may, in fact, largely be taken out of our hands and dealt with on an international basis.</P>

      <P>I have already said that we are members of the International Atomic Energy Commission. This is the world-wide agency concerned with safety regulations in regard to the use of nuclear energy reactors and so on.  Their regulations are on all fours with the Euratom regulations. Therefore, there will be no change, as far as we are concerned.  On entering Europe, we will be according with safety regulations that are now generalised throughout the world and international organisations to which we now belong have these regulations.  This board will ensure that these safety regulations of international obligation status will operate here.  There will be no difference between these same regulations and Euratom regulations which will operate when we enter EEC.</P>

      <P>When I asked about the possibility of licensing the ESB to purchase fuel in a situation in which we are not in Europe, the Minister said this was covered under section 6.  I have in mind here section 5 (2) (a). The Minister referred to section 6 (1). The actual language used there is not quite clear, but I shall raise that when section 6 comes up.  Going on to section 10, there is a problem about any company with which the board makes a contract.  Is the agreement the board will make with the ESB in any sense a contract?  It would certainly cause problems if it was.</P>

      <P>I take it that the House will not disagree if I propose to discuss paragraphs (c) and (d) together.  The Minister mentioned earlier that the question of indemnity in the event of a nuclear incident or a nuclear disaster will be the subject of special legislation.  Accordingly, much of what we might say in regard to that is perhaps best left until that legislation comes before us.  Nevertheless, the liability under such legislation might well be affected by the wording of paragraphs (c) and (d) because here it is said that the responsibility for the safe operation of a nuclear power plant and for the safe operation of a nuclear training reactor may be assigned to the Nuclear Energy Board.  Would this mean that, in the event of the necessity to pay an indemnity in the case of a nuclear incident or a nuclear disaster, payments which would have to be made once we adhere to the OECD conventions, would, by placing this responsibility firmly on the Nuclear Energy Board, become the responsibility of the board rather than the responsibility of the Electricity Supply Board, or of the institution that was operating the nuclear training reactor?</P>

It may well be, as my colleague, Senator Alexis FitzGerald, has pointed out, that under subsection (3) the Minister might be able to impose certain conditions here.  If, in fact, this difficulty arose under paragraphs (c) and (d) of subsection (2), which led to the position that the Minister was unable to operate these particular paragraphs, because of this danger it might well be appropriate at this stage to replace &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo; with some word such as &ldquo;supervision&rdquo; or something of that nature which would have not have the connotation of accepting the responsibility for the consequences of what is going on.</P>

      <P>Indeed it does but that comes back to section 4.  I said on section 4 that we had sufficient power under subsection (2) and in the regulation functions which I can assign to the board under subsection (2) of section 5.  I said that we had more than sufficient statutory power there to deal with any misgivings Senators might have as to what we were giving away under subsection (1) of section 5.

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a further point arising on subsection (2). It refers back to something that was talked about on subsection (1), paragraph (a).  Subsection 2 (d) talks of the possible assignment to the board of the responsibility for the safe operation of nuclear training reactors by anybody to which their operation has been delegated. When we were talking about subsection (1) the Minister indicated that he did not consider that the acquisition of a nuclear training reactor would necessarily be confined to the Government or confined to the Nuclear Energy Board.  Yet it would appear, when we come to read paragraph (d), that this does not envisage any nuclear training reactors being owned by anybody other than the Nuclear Energy Board.  Otherwise, if we had the position that any institution, such as the theoretical physics school in the Institute for Advanced Studies, suddenly went all experimental, or if one of the physics departments in our universities purchased, with Government consent and on the recommendation of the HEA, a nuclear reactor, apparently it would not be covered here.  This covers only nuclear reactors the operation of which has been delegated.  Is there a difficulty here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that in the drafting the intention was to cover critical reactors and that there would not be any need to cover anything but a nuclear power station for a very long time.  Possibly, if we were breeding isotopes, there would be one central critical reactor.  I may be arguing against my earlier urging, but once we extend this Bill we should cover sub-critical reactors.  If we wish to, it may be necessary to put in &ldquo;devices&rdquo; here, because there may well be experimental rig-outs used in schools of experimental physics, the safe operation of which should be controlled along with those of the more potentially dangerous reactors.</P>

    <P>The Minister would seem here to be proposing to the Oireachtas to have power only to prescribe conditions in relation to the assignment of functions under subsection (2).  I wonder is that wise?  Should he not have the ability to prescribe conditions for the working of the board, which is to be established under section 3 and which is given general functions under section 4, some of which are without prejudice to these particularised in subsection (1) of section 5?  The only power to make an <Col N="689" /> order under section 5 is under subsection (2).  It is only under this subsection that he has the ability to prescribe conditions for the operation.  If I understand the matter correctly, he then has no power to prescribe conditions for the general operation of the board which it might be wise for him to have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite prepared to agree to section 5 yet, but I am willing to turn the page.  There is one point under subsections (4) and (5) which I think arises from the general tenor of the discussion on the earlier subsections of this section.  I think we were all agreed that it was highly desirable there should be the utmost co-operation with such bodies as the National Science Council, the Higher Education Authority, our research institutes, our university and other higher institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under subsections (4) and (5) there <Col N="690" /> is the necessity for the Minister to consult with various other Ministers.  The National Science Council is, I think, responsible to the Minister for Finance directly; Industrial Research and Standards come under the Minister for Industry and Commerce; and An Foras Talúntais come under the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. There is the point, I think, both in regard to the operation of the Higher Education Authority and of the research centres in our academic institutions, that it might be proper to have the Minister for Education included there in the listing so that before making an order in regard to, for example, the promotion of knowledge and research in nuclear science there may well be educational considerations, academic considerations, which would make it proper that the Minister should have the benefit of the views of his colleague, the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>I mentioned before that in a decision in regard to how a particular piece of the research might be carried out there might be economic arguments which would neglect the argument for the dissemination of knowledge and the growth of expertise.  These would be considerations which would certainly be present in the mind of the Minister for Education and which might inadvertently be overlooked by the Minister who might feel, having consulted quite a battery of his colleagues, that he had all the views on the particular subject that it was possible to have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I say something on this?  It is impossible to construe subsections (4) and (5) without reaching the conclusion that the board does not have the functions which are specified in subsection (2) of section 5 until the Minister makes an order.  Now, if that be correct, the order is an essential legal document in the establishment of the powers of the body establishment when the section comes into operation by virtue of an order made under subsection (2).  A technical point here which has arisen under the Industrial Provident Societies Act, the Friendly Societies Act and the Companies Act is that the order itself should be regarded, when made, as conclusive evidence of due compliance <Col N="691" /> with regard to the Act.  I do not think you will find anything in this Bill which makes it such and you might be faced with legal proceedings.</P>
      <P>We are talking about vast projects here, big sums of money and so on.  I always think of a wintry morning when people are in a court, proofs are required and questions are raised by people, I think I said in relation to some other measure earlier, desperate arguments are raised which sometimes are successful when they are finally determined. If you are in a position to say that the order made under the section is conclusive evidence, that all conditions precedent to the establishment of the body and to the conferring of the particular power are established for the production of the order, then you get rid of a lot of trouble.  For example, without such a provision you will have a problem proving the Minister has made the order: pieces of paper are not proof, and we all know the dangers of hearsay evidence.  The Minister may, after consultation with the Ministers for Finance, Industry and Commerce, Agriculture and Fisheries, Labour, External Affairs, Health and so on, make this order.  It would be very nice if you did not have to bring a lot of these people down to court to prove that the order was made properly and that all the conditions of this section have been complied with.  There would be no difficulty getting an amendment drafted because the provision is in all well-drafted Acts dealing with the establishment of bodies corporate.</P>

      <P>The Chair might be entitled to say that section 6 has already been debated.  The question of the control of radioactive substances came up repeatedly during the discussion of section 5.  I do not think there is any more to be said on the general point.  We have all taken our particular stands on this.  It may be possible to explore it further on Report Stage.  I would like, however, to speak for a moment on it in case a strict ruling might indicate that anything said under section 5 on Committee Stage would not qualify the putting down of an amendment to section 6 on Report Stage.  I would, therefore, like to say that I consider that the failure to consolidate the regulatory control of fissile fuel or radioactive substances, devices <Col N="693" /> and irradiating apparatus is a distinct weakness in section 6 and that section 6 could well be improved by making provision, not necessarily for the immediate consolidation, but for the possible step by step consolidation by order.</P>

      <P>Still on subsection (1), it is just a matter here of the actual way in which the phrasing is put.  I am looking now at lines 13, 14 and 15 of subsection (1).  It appears to me that the term which is included in brackets, &ldquo;including radioactive waste products&rdquo; lies rather far from the class <Col N="694" /> in which it would be included.  It is very hard to include radioactive waste products as being a sub-group of apparatus, though it is possible to include it as being a sub-group of both fissile fuel, as it now reads, or other radioactive substances.  If we take the section, as we have amended it, it would now read &ldquo;the disposal of fissile fuel or of such other radioactive substances or devices and irradiating apparatus (including radioactive waste products)&rdquo;.  Here we have a list of four groups and an indication that these include waste products whereas only the first two of them include them.  I do not understand the ways of the draftsmen, but it does seem to me here that perhaps in this case action at a distance is not quite as effective as action from closer at hand.</P>

      <P>Under subsection (2) we begin to see the difficulties of failure to consolidate into one code operated by one staff.  This authorises an officer or servant of the Minister or an officer of the servant to the board to enter on to premises and to carry out such inspections as may be reasonably necessary.  We may have difficulties here if we still have a number of authorities responsible for inspection. Are we going to get the situation where we will have three inspections of the one location because three people are concerned with different aspects of the possibility of undesirable levels of radioactivity?  On the other hand, are we going to be sensible and say that one person can do the job?  If we take the latter view there may be a difficulty that a person, if he were the person authorised by the Minister or the board in writing under this Bill, who did the job might not be authorised to inspect for the other aspects which would still be the concern of the Minister for Labour, the Minister for Health or some other Minister.  I wonder if subsection (2), as drafted, is sufficient to ensure that there are no difficulties in that regard?</P>

      <P>Let us take it that we have some radioactive material.  As I understand it from the Minister, following the passage of this Bill, the Nuclear Energy Board will have certain functions, the Minister for Health will have certain functions, the Minister for Labour may have certain functions, all in regard to the question of whether this level of radioactivity is a level which should not be permitted.  Since no levels have been specified by any of them it will all be a matter that the agent of each of the Ministers will have to consider what is a reasonable level.</P>
      <P>Supposing one person is sent to report on the situation and, for example, he is obstructed in the exercise of this, I wonder are we in any difficulty here that in fact the obstruction, the penalty which might be involved, would be different in regard to the obstruction of this person as an agent for the Nuclear Energy Board, his obstruction as an agent for the Minister for Health, or his obstruction as an agent for the Minister for Labour?</P>

      <P>We can check on that.  But my information is that it is on all fours with such penalty provisions in legislation dealing with the other authorities mentioned.  We will certainly check on it.  It would obviously be desirable to have every one of them on the same basis.</P>

      <P>No.  This subsection obviously only deals with myself or a <Col N="696" /> servant or officer of the board who is concerned to enter upon a premises with a view to ascertaining whether or not an order has not been complied with, and nobody can obstruct such an officer from entering upon these premises.  If such obstruction takes place in regard to inspection an offence occurs and there is liability to conviction and penalty.  It relates solely to my functions and the functions of the board.  It does not relate to anything else.</P>

      <P>This is my difficulty. For example, supposing someone duly authorised by the Minister or by the board enters on a particular location and then decides that, in fact, the situation is unsatisfactory, not from the point of view of the regulations made by his own board, but he considers that in fact this situation is one which would be unsatisfactory to the Minister for Health under the 1953 Act.  Is he entitled to report to the Department of Health that the situation is unsatisfactory or is he, when he enters a premises on the authorisation of the Nuclear Energy Board or of the Minister for Transport and Power, confined then to examining the situation from the point of view of the powers of the Minister and the powers of the Nuclear Energy Board and not in regard to those of any other Minister?</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might answer that point.  Obviously, the subsection is confined to an ascertainment of whether an order under this section is being complied with?  That is the relevant confinement of the section. The inspector or officer authorised by the board or the Minister is obviously confined to that, so that the investigation into whether or not an offence is <Col N="697" /> committed under any other statute relating to any other Department, organisation or agency does not arise. I hope fairly shortly to have all these other powers and functions correlated and organised under the one section. This is the way it should be.</P>
