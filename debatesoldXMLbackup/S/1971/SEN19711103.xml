      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete section 6, lines 16 to 20, and substitute therefor the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) Notwithstanding sections 3 and 38 (2) of the Act of 1936 and section 48 of the Act of 1961, every appeal from a judgment of the Circuit Court in an action tried by a judge and jury, or from any other judgment of the Circuit Court founded on the verdict of a jury in a civil case, shall be made by way of motion before the High Court for a new trial, and the allegations on which such motion may be grounded shall include the <Col N="1002" /> allegation that the verdict of the jury was against the weight of the evidence or was otherwise perverse; and in any such appeal, the High Court may, in lieu of ordering a new trial, set aside the verdict, findings, and judgment appealed against and enter such judgment as the Court considers proper.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Last Wednesday the Minister defended section 6 of this Bill which proposes to do away with jury trials in civil issues in the Circuit Court by relying on the argument that he thought it anomalous that an issue which had been decided by a jury of 12 citizens should be subject as it is to an appeal by way of rehearing before a single judge of the High Court on circuit.  I agreed with the Minister, in commenting on his speech, that this was an anomaly; and although we pressed to a vote our amendment which proposed to delete this section, I indicated that I would put down an amendment seeking to remove this anomaly which I thought was the correct way to deal with it rather than by doing away with the right of the litigant to trial of a civil issue by jury in the Circuit Court, however seldom that right has been exercised in recent years.</P>
    <P>I have tried to do that by means of the first amendment here to day.  I do not claim that it is a perfect piece of drafting but I copied it as well as I could from the provision in the 1934 Courts of Justice Act, which provided for the original kind of appeal taken against findings of the Circuit Court, whether in jury matters or otherwise.  That section in the old Act was repealed; and the way I have drafted this amendment, whether effectively or not, seeks to except from the effect of those appeals such judgments of the Circuit Court as are founded on the finding of a jury.</P>
    <P>There is no issue between this side of the House and the other side on the question the Minister here emphasised, namely that civil actions have been very rarely tried in recent years before juries.  We are agreed about that.  But what we said here the last day was that we could see no reason why the mere rarity of such appeals should provide a reason for doing away with them altogether.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1003" /> Let me point out while I am on the subject that the old Courts of Justice Act of 1924 speaks in terms similar to those that we use&mdash;the right of trial by jury of an issue of tort, even in a civil case.  We feel that this right, even though it may be used very seldom, is being taken away unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he felt his position would be misrepresented. Everybody on this side, I think, was careful not to misrepresent it.  We have accepted that he does not intend what I thought originally he might have intended&mdash;a frontal attack at some later date on the jury system in civil actions in the High Court.  Of course there was no question of the jury system in criminal cases being under attack.  We have accepted that unreservedly.  We still see no reason why having a civil issue tried by a jury in the Circuit Court should be taken away.  We do not see that the mere infrequency of such cases is any reason for doing away with it.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments which we advanced the last day in favour of deleting this section was that the new jurisdiction of the Circuit Court going up from £600 to £2,500 in cases of contract and tort meant that litigants would be having fairly serious matters of perhaps personal injury decided by a judge sitting by himself, whereas heretofore for the same money they would have them decided by a jury in the High Court.  That, I think, is a substantial argument and nothing the Minister subsequently said persuaded me that we were wrong in our point of view.</P>
    <P>Since we met here last week I looked at the Third and Fourth Interim Reports of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure in which the suggestion was originally made, I think, that the jurisdiction of the lower courts should be increased and also, as the Minister himself said, that the trial of a civil issue by jury in the Circuit Court should be abolished.  It is true, that as the committee say on page 22, the recommendation that the right to jury trial should be taken away takes into account consideration the committee have already given to the question of <Col N="1004" /> increasing the jurisdiction of both the District Court and the Circuit Court. That does not seem to me to add up to a reason why in cases of a kind where a litigant might particularly wish to have a jury, the entire right should be destroyed.</P>
    <P>The amendment which Senator O'Higgins and I have put down seeks to restore so far as concerns jury trials of civil issues in the Circuit Court the old position whereby appeals against such findings will not be by way of rehearing of the whole thing from start to finish by a judge of the High Court but on a criterion similar to that used today in appeals to the Supreme Court from a finding of a High Court jury: it will be an appeal by way of motion before the High Court for a new trial and grounded on allegations of the same kind as, so far as I understand the position, appeals to the Supreme Court against High Court jury findings are now based, including the allegation that the jury finding was perverse.</P>
    <P>This will mean that, if the Minister will accept this amendment, of if there is something imperfect in this amendment if he accepts the principle of it and produces something of the same kind himself in the Dáil, the anomaly will be removed, litigants will still be able in the rare cases where it is desired, to have a civil issue tried by juries in the Circuit Court and to have an appeal against the jury finding not by way of rehearing but on a criterion similar to that which now obtains in appeals to the Supreme Court against a finding of the High Court jury.  In other words, the appeal judge will not just substitute his own views for the jury's view&mdash;he will have a note of the proceedings in the court below in front of him for which, of course, rules will have to provide, and he will decide then not whether the jury were right in awarding £2,000 or £2,500, but that their award, whatever it was, was within the limits of what a jury might reasonably have come to the decision to make.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be arrogant about this, but it seems to me that the case we have made is nearly unanswerable.  I cannot see the necessity for doing away with this right, little use though there may have been made of it, and certainly <Col N="1005" /> no reason for doing away with it simply on the grounds that it is an anomaly merely because of the appeal system.  I think it would be far more reasonable to reform the appeal system so far as these jury trials are concerned.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say on this section is to draw the attention of the House to the last sentence which the Minister, I think, did not refer to.  I do not say it was disingenuous of him not to do so but I should like to draw the attention of the House to the last sentence in the paragraph in which this committee said that their recommendation that civil juries should be done away with in the Circuit Court was based on the assumption that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court would be increased.  The committee said this:</P>
    <P>In actions other than negligence actions, such as actions of defamation, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution and assault, we feel that, as the importance and seriousness of this type of case is not necessarily reflected in the damages, proceedings in the High Court with a jury should be available on the basis of the present limited jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, namely, £600.</P>
    <P>I did not know the committee had recommended that&mdash;I admit it frankly &mdash;and I should have liked to have heard the Minister's comments and the feelings of his Department on it before this, because this is the very point I was trying to make the last day.  You could have a case&mdash;and I gave the instance of the case where a citizen sued a police officer who had loosed a savage dog on him&mdash;in which not a negligent action but an action based on some deliberate fault was taken in which the plaintiff might want to have the feelings of 12 citizens and their adjudication on his case rather than that of a judge, without having to go to the expense of bringing his action in the High Court.</P>
    <P>Unless I have misunderstood what this committee mean&mdash;and admittedly their language in the last part of the sentence is not too clear&mdash;it seems to me to amount to a recommendation that, even if the right of trial of a civil issue by jury is taken away in the Circuit Court, something as good as it <Col N="1006" /> should be left behind in the High Court. What I take that to mean is that there should be a special scale of costs of Circuit Court dimensions applicable in the High Court to cases of this kind in which the damages will not be very large, and that an unsuccessful plaintiff who sues in the High Court and recovers damages of less than the Circuit Court ceiling should not be stuck with having to pay costs on the High Court scale to his adversary.</P>
    <P>I concede that I have been allowed to go somewhat far from my amendment. I put this amendment to the House on its own feet.  Even if the House rejects it I urge on the Minister to bear in mind what seems to me to be the substance of what the committee suggested when they reported some years ago, and that, if he does insist on doing away with civil juries in the Circuit Court, he will make some special provision whereby citizens can still have actions of the kind I have outlined&mdash;deliberate torts&mdash; litigated in the High Court with a special provision as to costs in case they do not recover damages above the ceiling of the Circuit Court jurisdiction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>In ordinary civil cases there is nothing whatsoever sacrosanct about the jury case, if we are having a jury trial.  In criminal cases the circumstances are completely different.  In criminal proceedings the case is by the State against the accused because the accused is alleged to have committed a crime against the State.  Therefore, the power, or the absence of power as the case may be, reflected in the minds of the people as shown or evidenced by the views of the 12 jurors is most important. Furthermore, in a criminal case before a person can be convicted the decision of the jurors must be unanimous. Therefore, there can be no doubt whatsoever as to a man's guilt if 12 ordinary citizens find he is guilty and it leaves the people in no doubt that he is guilty.  For that reason a jury in a criminal case is most important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A jury in a civil case is a completely different matter altogether.  Litigation in a civil case is between two private citizens to ascertain certain rights.  Those rights depend on fact and on law.  If any two ordinary individuals have a dispute and wish to have justice done between <Col N="1007" /> them and if they were appointing an arbitrator, would they appoint a jury of arbitrators or would they appoint one individual?  Let us forget the courts for the moment and put that question to ourselves.  Would any two people who reasonably want to come to a fair decision between them put the matter to an independent arbitrator or would they put it to a group of ten or 12 people?  I think there is very little doubt about the answer to that question.</P>
    <P>There is nothing whatsoever sacrosanct about juries in civil cases.  Among lawyers themselves I should say a very large percentage deprecate that it is necessary to have juries in civil cases, for many reasons&mdash;in the interests of justice, because with a judge you are dealing with a man who is trained to evaluate, who is trained to form an opinion as to whether a person is, or is not, telling the truth, how he stands up to cross-examination or how he falls down in his evidence.  You are dealing with a man who is skilled in such matters.  A very high percentage of lawyers believe that it is better to have a case decided by a man who is skilled in those matters than by a jury who have no legal training, who have never before had to evaluate evidence and who, perhaps, never again will have to do so.</P>
    <P>However, there are a certain number of lawyers who would admit that it would be better to have juries in civil cases because in such cases sympathy is very important.  But sympathy might be the very opposite of justice.  If you have juries in civil cases why not offer the same arguments and have juries in contract cases?  Up to some years ago there were juries in contract cases but it was found that such juries were not doing justice between the citizens of the State so the use of juries in contract cases was abolished.  In England, today, the use of juries in cases of tort is, to a great extent, abolished and it has been found that the abolition of such juries has led to a situation where a person can have his rights decided at less expense, that he can have greater certitude in advance as to what the result will be and that his case will not drag on so long.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly has referred to the fact <Col N="1008" /> that juries in the Circuit Court heretofore were not much used.  That is so and there is no doubt about it.  It was a very exceptional matter to have a jury in a civil case in the Circuit Court and there was more than one reason for that situation.  There was the reason that the Circuit Court judges frowned on them but, in my view, there was a more important reason.  That more important reason was that the speculative litigant who did not have justice on his side felt: &ldquo;My case will not necessarily be decided on emotive principles because if I get a decision which is not justified by the law and the facts the other side have a right of appeal to the High Court where a judge will decide, in accordance with the law and the facts, and therefore I do not gain anything&rdquo;.  But if you had a system, such as is set out here, where on appeal all the judge decides is the question &ldquo;Is there any scintilla of evidence whatsoever on which a jury could so hold?&rdquo;; and, if he finds that there was a scintilla of evidence on which the jury could so hold and that, therefore, their verdict is not perverse, he must confirm their decision.</P>
    <P>That is the position on an appeal from a jury in the High Court and that is the position which we are asked to have on an appeal from the Circuit Court.  To my mind this would be, in the interests of justice, a most retrograde step.  In doing justice between man, between citizen and citizen, it will mean an increase in expense and it will result in delay in the ordinary running of the courts.  There are no jury cases which can be disposed of in one day.</P>
    <P>At the outset the jury are called, they are empanelled and objections are stated and so on.  That can take up to half an hour.  That done, the plaintiff's counsel addresses them in an emotive manner and that will take another half hour or an hour.  It is only at the end of that hour that you get down to the business of giving evidence and having cross-examination. At the close of the plaintiff's case and again at the close of the defendant's case the jury are addressed for half an hour or an hour by each side.</P>
    <P>If one realises that our courts sit only for four hours each day one will realise that it will cost one or the other of the unfortunate litigants in a case in the <Col N="1009" /> Circuit Court before a jury involving, say, £300, about £480 for the four hours and the whole matter becomes utterly absurd.  I calculate that between witnesses, counsels' fees and solicitors' fees it will cost something in the region of £2 per minute at the very least and I would say that is a conservative calculation. I am also taking into account in that figure the loss to the State of 12 jurors having to leave their work for the entire day and their expenses for travelling and so on.  I think it would be a most retrograde step and I sincerely hope the Minister will not accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to understand the definition of a retrograde step when one is merely trying to preserve the status quo.  I do not know whether Senator Nash fully appreciates that there was, and has been for a considerable length of time, a committee sitting, studying and making recommendations, namely, the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure. It might have been an interesting experience for that committee had Senator Nash opted to give evidence before them.  On my reading of the observations of that committee in relation to the matters which Senator Nash has just spoken of, their views do not seem to bear out in any way the arguments which Senator Nash made.</P>
      <P>These were questions which were considered by the committee.  In the sections dealing with jury matters, on page 17 of the Third and Fourth Interim Reports&mdash;I do not intend going into the reports in detail&mdash;I want to call Senator Nash's attention to some passages which seem to be particularly relevant and appropriate to the kind of argument he made a few minutes ago.</P>
      <P>Dealing with the question of length and the expense occasioned by having juries, the committee say that they are satisfied that trial by jury is inherently likely to be longer and for that reason to be more costly than trial by judge alone on the same case.  However, they go on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not, however, possible to state with any accuracy, nor has any evidence been shown to be available on the point, the degree by which the <Col N="1010" /> trial is lengthened when it is a trial by jury instead of by a judge alone.</P>
    <P>Senator Nash apparently feels that he is in a position to break down into fractions the costs of a trial by jury and to decide exactly what percentage increase is occasioned by reason of the fact that a trial takes place before a jury.  But according to this report they say:</P>
    <P>It is not, however, possible to state with any accuracy, nor has any evidence been shown to be available on the point, the degree by which the trial is lengthened when it is trial by jury instead of by a judge alone.</P>
    <P>Later on in this particular section they also say:</P>
    <P>There is also no evidence that the system by trial is in any way disproportionately longer.</P>
    <P>They go on:</P>
    <P>It is, however, important to bear in mind...</P>
    <P>And I think that this is the important thing in relation to Senator Nash's remarks:</P>
    <P>It is, however, important to bear in mind that while a litigant desires to have his case tried as cheaply as is consistent with a proper hearing and examination of the case, his first requirement is a satisfactory trial rather than a speedy or cheap trial. Few litigants have more than one lawsuit in a lifetime.  It becomes a matter of close personal concern to the litigant to have his case painstakingly examined and tried and to feel that he is being treated as an individual rather than a statistical digit in litigation.  The outcome may affect his health, fortune or reputation for the rest of his life.  To the judge and the counsel who are professionally engaged in litigation every day of their working lives, one case may appear to be not dissimilar to another but to the litigant his case is the only one which matters.</P>
    <P>Then they go on to say:</P>
    <P>The trial, which on occasion may <Col N="1011" /> appear to be unduly long to the professional observer, does not appear so to the person whose fortune or reputation is at stake. Whether a case be tried before a judge alone or by a judge and jury, every practitioner knows that the most frustrating experience a litigant can have is the experience of not having his case fully examined, and the most bitter feeling of injustice, and one which may rankle with a litigant for a lifetime, is the feeling, whether justified or not, that his case had not been fully heard.</P>
    <P>And this is the relevant portion:</P>
    <P>Jury trial is inherently less likely to give this feeling to the average litigant than trial by a judge alone.</P>
    <P>That is what this committee had to say about it.  That is what this committee had to say in effect about the arguments that Senator Nash has been putting up here.</P>
    <P>So far as I am personally concerned, I should prefer to consider this amendment in the context of the arguments which were used by the Minister on the Second Stage and Committee Stage discussions of this Bill.  Those are the only relevant arguments to the action which the Minister is taking in this Bill by disallowing jury trial in civil cases in the Circuit Court.  As I understood his arguments, the Minister made a simple and what might appear to be a logical case: (1) the simple case that the right to trial by jury in civil matters in the Circuit Court was very seldom availed of; (2) that an anomaly existed in that, while a right to trial by jury existed if an appeal was taken from that to the High Court, it was to a judge sitting alone in the High Court.</P>
    <P>As regards the first argument&mdash;and I think these were the only relevant arguments&mdash;certainly we cannot consider this in the context of a tirade against the conception of jury trial in civil cases at any time: that simply is not in question.  It may be fair to argue on another occasion the merits or demerits of the jury system; that is being considered by the committee whose report I have quoted.  However, <Col N="1012" /> it does not seem to me that that is relevant here, because all that we are concerned with is the question of the abolition of the right to trial by jury in civil cases in the Circuit Court for the reasons that the Minister gave, that is, that the right is seldom exercised and that in any event an anomaly exists.</P>
    <P>As regards the argument that the right is seldom exercised, I cannot for the life of me&mdash;and I considered this&mdash;persuade myself that the fact that a right is seldom exercised is adequate justification for confiscating that right and for taking it away altogether, as the Minister is now doing.  I could give various examples, and I am sure that the Minister would be shocked to think that in other cases, because people do not insist on their rights, those rights should be taken away.</P>
    <P>For example, the Minister is entitled to stand for election at a general election&mdash;and, please God, he may do so before long.  The fact that he may choose not to do so, and that he may only once in his life decide that he will stand for election, does not give anyone the right to take away from the Minister his right to stand as a candidate at a general election.  Any Minister would feel very shaken at the idea that because he prefers not to stand at the next election he should be deprived of his right to stand thereafter.  The Minister and myself and others who hold a driving licence, for example, have the right to drive cars.  If we choose not to drive a car during the currency of our licence, is that any reason why our right to drive the car should be taken away from us.  That is the kind of thing that is being done in this Bill under that argument of the Minister.  Because the right has not been exercised to any great extent, therefore, the way to deal with it is to withdraw the right altogether, even though for all we know, because of the increased jurisdiction or for any other reason, people in the immediate future may wish to exercise what has heretofore been a right.  The quotation Senator John Kelly gave of the committee's report in relation to an alternative being provided if what the Minister seeks to do is in fact done, if the right to a trial by jury in the Circuit Court were taken away, is, I think, very important.  It shows that the committee <Col N="1013" /> appreciated fully that, whatever might be said about some types of actions, there were other types of actions where the right to trial by jury in civil matters in the Circuit Court was of such importance that if there was to be any interference with that right something should be put in its place.  The suggestion of the committee was that, in effect, the High Court should be entitled to deal with these cases, even though they were within the Circuit Court jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I do not think that in any sense can the report of the committee be relied on as giving <i>carte blanche</i> to any Minister or any Government to take away the right of trial by jury in all civil cases in the Circuit Court.  To my mind, the recommendation made by the committee in this matter not only shows how seriously they regard that right in certain cases and are concerned to see that it would be preserved in some shape or form.  But it emphasises the case that has been made on this side of the House both on the Second Reading and on the Committee Stage.  Their recommendation might, in itself, create something of an anomaly in that, if it were adopted, you would have cases proper to the Circuit Court being heard in the High Court.  Once we recognise, as the Minister recognises, that there is an anomaly in the present situation, the right approach to this is to try to get rid of the anomaly.</P>
    <P>I strongly suggest that the method being proposed in this amendment would be preferable to the method suggested by the committee because it would retain the right of trial by jury in the Circuit Court and, at the same time, would remove the anomaly of an appeal being taken to a judge sitting alone in the High Court against the Circuit Court verdict arrived at by a jury.  While the Minister is probably committed to the course on which he has embarked, I think it is a wrong course.  It is not a course which is likely to help the administration of justice. There might be different arguments for and against the whole concept of trial by jury, but that is a different matter. It does not arise in relation to this amendment.</P>
    <P>The reason I dealt at some length with Senator Nash's contribution was <Col N="1014" /> that the Third and Fourth Interim Reports of the committee contained the answers to the arguments he was making.  Were it not for that reason I would have felt that in relation to this amendment and in relation to this Bill, Senator Nash's arguments were totally irrelevant.  We should consider this Bill and we should consider this amendment in the context of the arguments the Minister has put up for taking away the present right of trial by jury in civil cases in the Circuit Court, and this amendment provides the Minister with an answer to the argument based on the anomaly which exists.  I hope that on reflection the Minister will be convinced that there is little to be said, either by way of logic or otherwise, for his other argument that, because the right is not exercised, it should be taken away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether Senator O'Higgins is not pushing his point too far when he presses that, merely because a right is not used very much, this is not a good reason for abolishing it.  Surely the history of the evolution of the legal system is a history of rights, of causes of action, of legal procedure, of rules and regulations which have fallen into disuse.  Again and again on looking at textbooks you will find that such and such used to be the way in which this problem was approached but this particular procedure fell into disuse and eventually was abolished.  Surely this is the history of the evolution of the legal system. You could get hundreds, even thousands of causes of action, of rules, of procedures and laws which have fallen into disuse and been abolished and you could say about all of them, if you wanted to use Senator O'Higgins's argument, that there is no reason why a particular right of the citizen should be abolished merely because it is seldom, if ever, used.  If you did accept that argument over the years, you would have a vast complex of law, procedures, 90 per cent of which were never used, but kept there on the basis which Senator O'Higgins has argued that they should not be abolished merely because they were seldom, if ever, used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that, over the years, the jury system has seldom, if ever, been used in the Circuit Court is a good <Col N="1015" /> argument for saying that the public have had the opportunity of using it but obviously do not use it and in the interests of bringing our legal system up to date and consolidating it, it should be abolished.  One of the arguments used by Senator O'Higgins in favour of the jury system was that litigants liked the jury system because it gave them the appearance, the illusion, in many cases that they were getting justice and to that extent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is true that justice must not only be done but also appear to be done, and Senator O'Higgins was quoting with approval this argument in favour of juries, that litigants would have the feeling because the cases went on so long and because there were speeches to the jury and so on, that they were obtaining justice, which in many cases was possibly an illusion. The important thing in considering whether or not we should have juries is to consider what is the most effective, the most efficient and the fairest way to ensure that litigants get a fair hearing and that they get a just verdict. To say that we should have a system which, in my submission, very often merely gives the illusion that they are getting justice, when in fact they are not, is not a good argument in favour of juries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other arguments which have been put forward both on the last Stage and today were on the basis that juries were more sympathetic and more generous from the plaintiff's point of view.  These are improper arguments, because juries have no right to be sympathetic and no right to be generous.  They are human <Col N="1016" /> beings and are entitled to be sympathetic with one or other of the parties but they must not allow that sympathy to interfere with their verdict.  If they do allow their sympathy to interfere with their verdict, they are not acting in accordance with the oath which they have taken, which is to hear the evidence and to make a finding in accordance with the evidence.  Secondly, if they are allowing their generosity to run riot, if they are being generous with somebody else's money, again they may be acting in a very human way, but they are not acting in accordance with their oath and they are not acting in the interests of justice.</P>
    <P>Some of the arguments put forward in favour of juries are not arguments in favour of a better legal system.  They are irrelevant to a proper legal system and, in fact, show that the jury system is often distorted.  The only thing I have to say about this amendment is that, if the Minister and the House was disposed to allow juries to continue in the Circuit Court, then this is a logical and consistent amendment and one which has a lot to recommend it, but I do not think we should have juries in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like briefly to support this amendment for the reasons which have been given, many of which have been re-stated from the Second Reading and the Committee Stage.  There is one argument which has not been raised in support of the retention of the jury in civil cases in the Circuit Court and that is the practical reality of the circuit.  I discussed this with a number of what are called circuit lawyers in the Law Library who go out on circuit every week and they emphasised that by the nature of the circuit it is the same circuit judge over a period of a long number of years who goes round and that in the type of case to which Senator Kelly has referred or perhaps a more political type of case or in a defamation case, a circuit judge might have rather fixed ideas.  A judge is human and he would be applying a lay person's judgment to the assessment of the facts as well as being a judge of the law and this might be very much to the disadvantage of the litigants in the circuit.  Certainly, the lawyers were of <Col N="1017" /> the firm opinion that, if the option was left open, the litigants would have the option of applying to have a jury try the case.</P>
      <P>It was admitted that this is not done very often but that it is an important safeguard.  Once again it was emphasised that because we are increasing the jurisdiction to the larger sum it is not sufficient to look at the present practice in the Circuit Court.  We ought to look also at the practice in the High Court at that level when juries are quite often asked for.  Therefore, I wish to raise this argument in favour of the present amendment which meets the only cogent argument of the Minister: that the position as it at present exists is an anomaly, that you can have an appeal from a trial in the Circuit Court with a jury to a judge sitting alone.  This amendment will very adequately meet that argument.  Very strong and substantial reasons have been given by the Senators on this side to retain the present system and I add to them the rigid nature of the circuit, the fact that a judge may over a period of 20 years be the circuit judge and be the arbiter of the position and that this could give rise to problems on the circuit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>For a variety of reasons I would ask the House not to accept this amendment. First of all, I should like to say that I do not want to enter into a general discussion on the merits or demerits of civil trial by jury.  I made my position with regard to that clear the last day. I accept the committee's recommendation for the reasons that they give. I have no intention of abolishing or seeking to limit the right to trial by jury in a civil action in the High Court, notwithstanding the fact that I am well aware of what Senator Nash has said with regard to the situation in England where civil juries in the High Court are comparatively rare.  Indeed, I might almost say very rare.  One has to go to some lengths to get a jury.  A special application must be made.  No injustice has been complained of there.  Indeed, the alleged benefits of not having a jury have often been commented on.  Fairly substantial High Court actions in England can be disposed of within a day in contrast to our position.  However, <Col N="1018" /> from the point of view of this amendment to this section that whole argument is somewhat academic and, having made my position clear, I do not propose to go into it any further.</P>
      <P>In order to examine properly the amendment that is before the House it is necessary to deal in some slight way with the historical development of the present situation with regard to appeals. Under the 1924 Act and until the passage of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, all appeals from the Circuit Court in civil cases, whether jury or non-jury, were heard by two judges of the High Court sitting together in Dublin.  That was irrespective of where the case was heard.  If the two judges were in agreement their decision was final, unless they certified an important question of law was involved when an appeal lay to the Supreme Court.  If they differed in their decision they were required to affirm the decision appealed against, but an appeal lay to the Supreme Court at the instance of either party.  That appeal was heard on the official stenographer's report; but there was power to admit additional evidence, oral or on affidavit, and to re-hear evidence contained in the report.  There was also power to order a new trial.</P>
      <P>That system clearly was a ponderous, long-winded one and very unsatisfactory, because it meant that in most cases where there was any doubt at all you had to have two appeals and you ended up in the Supreme Court in any event.  The expense of it was considerable and litigants were also faced with the situation that, while their case was perhaps heard in Killarney or Letter-kenny and possibly involved only some very moderate amount of money like £50 or so, they had to go to Dublin for their appeal.  In many cases they had in practice to appeal to two courts in Dublin&mdash;a court of appeal of two judges and a Supreme Court of three or five.  That situation was changed in 1936 because it was obviously very unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present situation was achieved by part IV of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936.  In the case of civil actions in the Circuit Court, where no oral evidence was given at the hearing, an appeal lies to the High Court sitting in Dublin with a single judge, and this arrangement also <Col N="1019" /> applies to appeals in civil actions with oral evidence heard in Dublin.  In the case of actions heard in the provincial circuits, whether they are jury or non-jury actions, the appeal lies to the High Court on circuit in accordance with the machinery in part IV of the Act and falls to be heard and determined by a single judge.</P>
    <P>This amendment was not discussed in any great detail on the debate today.  It was not scrutinised to any great extent. Most of the speeches were directed in more general terms to the value, or otherwise, of juries.  The amendment itself does not stand up to very great scrutiny.  Notwithstanding that, even if it were drafted in a way that did, I still could not accept the principle underlying it for reasons I will go on to later.</P>
    <P>The effect of this amendment would be to introduce a new form of appeal in the case of jury actions in the Circuit Court and that appeal, under this proposed amendment, would be to the High Court in Dublin regardless of what circuit is involved.  I know this probably was not the proposer's intention, but it has been discovered on a careful reading of the amendment that this is the effect of it.  Part of the reason for this may be due to the fact that at least one of the sections which are referred to in the amendment has in fact been repealed.  That is section 3 of the 1936 Act.  There would, therefore, in consequence of this, be two appeal systems running together.  One would be for non-jury appeals from the Circuit Court to the High Court, and they would be to the High Court on circuit or the High Court in Dublin, as the case might be, with a full re-hearing in each case.  The second appeal system which would arise under this amendment, if it were accepted, would arise only in the case of appeals from the decision in jury actions.  In this latter type of case&mdash;the appeal from jury actions&mdash;the transcript would be required, which would involve the attendance of an offical stenographer at a civil jury trial, wherever it might be held in any of the circuits in the country.  Apart from the difficulty that is experienced at the moment, has been for some time and no doubt will be to <Col N="1020" /> an even greater extent in the future, of getting official stenographers, this also involves the appellant in very heavy expense for the transcript.  As a matter of general policy I have always sought, as have the Government, to try to reduce as much as possible the undoubtedly heavy costs of litigation.  I have experience myself, in appeals from the High Court to the Supreme Court, of paying several hundred pounds for a transcript.  The top copy, which is the first one, the appellant must lodge in the court to which he is appealing, is extremely expensive.  In a case of some length the cost of it runs regularly to several hundred pounds.  This money must be paid and the transcript put down before any steps can be taken by the appellant.</P>

      <P>The cost of the workmen's compensation was very different.  There was a special way of doing it.  What I am saying, and I cannot be contradicted on it, is that in any sort of a heavy High Court case the cost of a top copy of a transcript can run to several hundred pounds.  That is an appalling burden on a litigant and may very often be a deciding factor as to whether or not he appeals.  It should not be a bar in any way and it would be one of the consequences of the acceptance of this amendment.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Senator.  He has a right of reply which I have not got.  I have waited for almost an hour to speak.  If the Senator found it possible to restrain himself it would be a help.  In effect, this amendment is a return in part at least to the pre-1936 system of appeal from the Circuit Court, which was deliberately abandoned in favour of the present system, which has proved to be much more efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kelly and Senator O'Higgins mentioned in the course of their speeches on the amendment that I referred on the last occasion to the rehearing by a single judge of an appeal from the decision of a jury in the <Col N="1021" /> Circuit Court as an anomaly.  I made a close examination of the Official Report on the last day which shows that I did not refer to it as an anomaly.  It was referred to a number of times by Senator Kelly and Senator O'Higgins as such, and in one sense it could be regarded as that.  But I do not think that an anomaly is a correct description of it, because an anomaly, as I understand it, would be something which came about through the drafting of a section but which was not intended by the drafters of the section&mdash;something which came about in a limited number of cases through inadvertence.</P>
    <P>This right of appeal to a judge sitting alone was established in 1936 and was intended quite clearly by the Legislators at that time to apply to appeals from civil juries.  It is not correct to say therefore that the situation which we have at the moment and which I am seeking to rectify is an anomaly.  It is a fact of the existing procedure.  I am not saying in any way that it is wrong.  I am just saying it is a fact and that, because it is a fact, it is a bit pointless having a jury system that is not used for the very reason that the appeal is by way of full rehearing.</P>
    <P>One of the consequences of Senator Kelly's amendment here today would be to give one type of appeal to those who are appealing from a non-jury decision of the Circuit Court but to give a different type of appeal to those who are appealing a jury decision. That, to my mind, would be the creation of a very definite anomaly, because I cannot see why a man who has not had a jury should be entitled to what must be the superior type of appeal, or the preferable type of appeal&mdash;an appeal by way of full re-hearing&mdash;whereas a man who has had a jury in the Circuit Court is limited solely to a motion for a new trial.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the amendment in Senator Kelly's name is broadly analagous to the type of appeal by way of motion for a new trial from the High Court to the Supreme Court, but it seems to be somewhat broader than that because it gives the High Court, unlike the Supreme Court, the right, in lieu of ordering a new trial, to set aside the verdict findings and <Col N="1022" /> judgment appeal against and to enter such judgment as the court considers proper.  The Supreme Court except by consent, as I understand it, has no right to do that.  In the absence of consent on an appeal it must remit for a new trial if it decides to upset the verdict of the jury or the judge in the High Court.  Quite clearly there would be at least one, if not two, very serious anomalies as a result of this amendment. You would have the extraordinary position that a man who did not ask for a jury could have his case retried, whereas a man who did ask for a jury could end up with a new trial, but would be by no means certain of getting one.  If he appealed by way of motion for a new trial he might or might not get that under the amendment.</P>
    <P>Unlike the Supreme Court powers, the High Court would be given power to decide without sending it back for a new trial.  This would give rise to such a serious anomaly that it could, for one thing, cause great resentment among litigants.  They would find it very hard to understand why one type of appellant should be entitled to a full rehearing, which is generally what they want and what suits them better, and another type of appellant should be confined to an appeal by way of motion for a new trial based on a transcript which costs him a great deal of money.</P>
    <P>In that type of appeal to the Supreme Court the litigant is usually never there, because he cannot follow what is going on in any event.  He finds it very confusing and very difficult.  The sort of appeal that they want and like is an appeal by way of full rehearing.  Quite clearly that is not feasible in the Supreme Court, but it has been found to be feasible in the High Court on circuit.  It would be anomalous in the proper sense of that word to deprive such an appellant of that right which he has enjoyed, in not just the technical but also the literal sense of the word, since 1936.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to reiterate that, unfortunately by virtue of the way this matter was drafted&mdash;by quoting a section that is repealed and because of the way it is worded&mdash;there is the further anomaly that an appeal of this nature, <Col N="1023" /> as proposed here in the amendment by Senator Kelly and Senator O'Higgins, without that intention on their part, would in fact have the result of having all those appeals heard in Dublin.  I have said enough to convince the House of the fact that this amendment of Senator Kelly's would create serious anomalies where there really are none at the moment and would cause a lot more difficulty and hardship than exists under the present situation or under the situation as proposed by me in the Bill. For these reasons I would ask the House to reject this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is clearly determined to push this section through.  I do not like to speak in a severe tone about it because I want to acknowledge that, unlike the last occasion the Minister was here, he has come a good distance to meet us on several of the points we have raised.  I presume that his refusal to meet us on this point is based not on the political necessity of having to go back to the Dáil but on his sincere conviction.</P>
      <P>In regard to what Senators Nash and Eoin Ryan said, it was they, I think, who opened up the scope of this discussion, and almost everything they said amounted to an attack on the jury system as such.  I do not want to do either of these gentlemen an injustice, but neither of them dealt with the point at issue, namely whether the attempt being made by the Minister to remove juries from the Circuit Court for the reasons he had given was fair or not.  Senator Nash spoke about the waste of time taken up in swearing a jury and the length of time it took to explain issues to them.  All these matters are equally applicable to the existence of a jury in the High Court and to that extent Senator Nash's remarks were irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan joined him in attacking the entire jury system but he added a few footnotes based on what he supposes to be the history of the law, saying that it could very largely be described as the history of the disuse of various courses of action.  It is perfectly true that various legal forms fall into disuse but the process has been one, generally speaking, in which a <Col N="1024" /> legal form has fallen into disuse only because it has been replaced by a better one.</P>
    <P>The Senator must know perfectly well that, no matter where he looks, he will find that the history of various parts of the law has been a history of improvement, of greater sophistication and, in most areas, of greater liberalisation.  All he has to do is look at the history of criminal appeal, the history of the rights of an accused person to defend himself, to give evidence on his own behalf, to be represented by counsel.  These are matters, of course, in which there have been changes in procedure, in which old forms have gone by the board and new forms have replaced them, but these have been improvements.</P>
    <P>The reason why there was so much trouble in this country three years ago with Deputy Moran's Criminal Justice Bill was because that Bill proposed to take away from people rights, or something which could be nearly described as rights, which they had enjoyed for a long time, and to put nothing in their place.  That is the reason why there was an outcry about the Criminal Justice Bill and that is the reason&mdash;although I do not want to make an outcry about this, I recognise there is no such intention here&mdash;why we object to section 6 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan obviously dislikes juries either in the Circuit Court or in the High Court.  It is plain from his desire that they should be abolished&mdash;and from his coupling with that desire his remarks about their tendency to show sympathy&mdash;that he believes that, if they were abolished, the people who would benefit from it would be the defendants and the people who insure defendants, That, to me, is a poor reason for abolishing juries. It seems to me that we should drag that reason out into the open and look at it.  We should do that if the matter were strictly relevant here today, which it probably is not.  The question of whether a jury is a fit organ to decide issues of negligence is one which, I suppose, is relevant to the amendment here.  I cannot see that a jury, even if it may consist of 12 citizens who tend to sympathise with people who are injured, should be thought to take the wrong view of an <Col N="1025" /> issue of negligence, or an issue of the measure of damages.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside these questions, which mostly consider the kind of tort in which the defendant is either insured or insurable, I want to remind the House and Senator Ryan that my objection to section 6 is not so much based on the question of plaintiffs in actions of negligence being deprived of what formerly had been a right which was almost never exercised, but is connected with their rights in other kinds of tort which are not insurable.  Senator Ryan would have done better if he had concentrated on this argument, which is central to our case, that in matters of assault, defamation, of false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, conspiracy &mdash;things like that in which the defendant in the typical case is not insured and cannot be insured.  These are typical of the kind of case in which the plaintiff might wish to have a jury.  We see no good reason to take that right away from him.</P>
    <P>To come to what the Minister has said.  He did not explain&mdash;that may have been out of consideration, for my feelings&mdash;why it was that the High Court in my amendment necessarily meant the High Court in Dublin.  My understanding, which may be wrong, is that the High Court can exist in a number of places.  The intention certainly was that the appeal here should be taken to a single High Court judge travelling the circuit as High Court judges do twice a year.  That, however, is a small point.  If the Minister had been disposed to accept the principle behind this amendment it is a matter which could easily have been cured, and still could be cured, in the Dáil later on.</P>
    <P>So far as the other matters raised by the Minister are concerned, they fall basically under two headings: first of all, the question of anomaly; and, secondly, the question of expense.  I have looked quickly through the Seanad Report of the last day and I cannot find the word &ldquo;anomaly&rdquo; being used by the Minister; but, nonetheless, he spoke of what he called the right being illusory and illusory because, once exercised, it was subject to rehearing by a judge sitting by himself.  Probably I condensed that into the word &ldquo;anomaly&rdquo;, but I think that is <Col N="1026" /> an anomaly; and it should have never have been allowed to have come about that civil issues tried by a jury were subject to appeal by way of rehearing by a High Court judge sitting by himself.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that, were this amendment or something like it to be accepted, what he described as &ldquo;a real anomaly&rdquo; would then result, because one kind of person in the Circuit Court &mdash;namely, the man who had opted for trial by a judge alone&mdash;would be entitled to what he described as a better kind of appeal than the man who had opted for trial by jury.  That is entirely a matter of opinion&mdash;and a matter, perhaps, of the accident of the judge's temperament&mdash;whether of not it is going to be a better kind of appeal.</P>
    <P>It also depends on whether you are looking at it from the plaintiff's point of view or from the defendant's point of view.  If I were a plaintiff and had brought an action for assault of defamation in the Circuit Court with a jury, had recovered damages as a result of that jury's award, I know what kind of appeal I would think better.  I would far sooner have my appeal heard by a judge, who was limited to deciding whether or not the jury's finding had been perverse, than to have my appeal heard by a judge who could rehear the entire evidence from start to finish and replace the jury's point of view with his own.  I would not be in any doubt about which of these two appeals would be the better.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not only making a large assumption but, perhaps unintentionally, confusing and misleading the House when he says that an appeal by way of rehearing is better than an appeal of the kind which this amendment suggests.  It depends entirely on the point of view of which litigant you have in your mind.  A plaintiff who has got a jury award given, will not think that an appeal by way of rehearing is better.  He will think that it is worse.  Therefore, that argument is utterly without foundation. If it is true, it is only 50 per cent true.  It depends entirely on what side of the case you are looking at the question from.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister harped, loudly and long, on the question of expense.  I know this is something&mdash;I hope he will <Col N="1027" /> not mind my saying this&mdash;which is a favourite theme whenever legal matters are being discussed between these two sides of the House.  The Fianna Fáil Party like to create the impression that the Fine Gael Party consist of lawyers who are milking the public of their hard-earned money.  A simple head count will show that the front bench of the Fianna Fáil Party in both Houses contains more lawyers than the Fine Gael Party.  Even if that were not the case, to represent the matter as something&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister and myself know that perfectly well.  But the public, whom the Minister is hoping to reach through the Third Estate or the Fourth Estate, perhaps do not realise it. They may be in a situation where they say to themselves &ldquo;There is a Fine Gael man trying to bring in legal costs again. Even if it is not for himself, it is for his pals.&rdquo;  The Minister, of course, did not say that and perhaps he has not got it in his mind, but I want to knock it on the head.  That is the reason why I committed the discourtesy of interrupting the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question in my amendment of compelling litigants to use juries, and the Minister knows that perfectly well.  This is not a question of obliging litigants to resort to juries in civil cases in the Circuit Court.  All we are trying to do is to keep for them, if they see fit, their right of recourse to a jury which they have had up to now. Let them make their own minds up as to whether or not the expense is too great for them.  Let them make their own minds up as to whether they can bear the expenses of a transcript.  Let them make up their own minds about whether the issue is so important to <Col N="1028" /> them that they will put their hands in their pockets and pay for a transcript. I do not want to make that decision for them.  Let them make that decision for themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister, perhaps not intentionally, has conveyed the impression in what he said here a few minutes ago that the effect of this amendment would be to oblige the incurring of expense or to inflict the incurring of expense on litigants who, if the Minister is able to protect them, will not have to undergo that expense at all.  That is a completely false way of presenting the picture.</P>

      <P>If they do not want a jury they need not incur the expense.  I am trying to keep the right and the option open for a litigant to say: &ldquo;I want my action tried by a jury.  I have reasons of my own for thinking that a jury will give me a better day out than a judge, a fairer hearing and a more satisfactory trial, and I am going to incur the necessary expense as a result. I intend to make that free choice.&rdquo;  It is a free choice.  This amendment does not seek to oblige a litigant of any particular class to resort to a jury.  Even a defamation plaintiff or an assault, seduction or conspiracy plaintiff can still have his action tried by a judge if this amendment is accepted.  If he wants a jury and is ready to pay for them I think he should be allowed to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister harped for some time on the expense of a transcript.  Admittedly, a transcript is expensive; but in this country we operated from 1906 until five years ago in workmen's compensation cases with transcripts.  It is true that the average workmen's compensation case might not have taken very long but many of them took up half a day and sometimes a whole day in the Circuit Court.  Every word of the evidence about how he came to slip a disc or how he came to rap his knee went into the transcript and had to be written down before an appeal could be taken by either side.  That situation was tolerated for 60 years in this country, expensive though it was; and to represent this question of the transcript as being an insurmountable impediment to accepting <Col N="1029" /> what is only an option is not far from being disingenuous.  The Minister may not have meant it like that, but that is how I feel about it.</P>
    <P>I shall not waste any more time of the House.  The Minister is determined not to accept anything like this amendment. All I can do is appeal to him to think the matter over and to consider whether when this Bill reaches the Dáil he may be open to persuasion from somebody more persuasive than myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment prompted by the remarks of Senator Kelly on the Committee Stage.  The wording in this clause is a repeat of the wording in clause 4, paragraph A of section 77 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  This provision in the 1924 Act has not given rise to any problems.  However, in more recent legislation it has been the practice to refer simply to proceedings by a State authority and to define &ldquo;State authority&rdquo; in the legislation.  This was done in the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, and this amendment proposes a similar approach.  The 1961 Act defined &ldquo;State authority&rdquo; as being each of the following:</P>
      <P>(a)  A Minister of State,</P>
      <P>(b)  the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland,</P>
      <P>(c)  the Irish Land Commission,</P>
      <P>(d)  the Revenue Commissioners, and</P>
      <P>(e)  the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>The examples I gave on the last day of &ldquo;Government Department&rdquo; in the section as it originally stood were, in fact, correct.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1030" /> In page 4, after line 47, to insert the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(5)  An order under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either House within the next twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment provides for the laying before each House of the Oireachtas of any ministerial order under section 15 specifying summary offences for early trial in the District Court and for the annulment of the order should either House pass a resolution to that effect.  The amendment arises out of a suggestion by Senator O'Higgins on Committee Stage. It will achieve the same end result as the amendment of Senator Kelly on Committee Stage, which proposed that a draft of the order be first approved by the Oireachtas.  The Government amendment has the advantage that the involvement of the Oireachtas will not result in delay in bringing these urgent cases of summary jurisdiction before the court.  Any such delay would, of course, defeat the whole purpose of the section.</P>
      <P>The amendment provides also that any annulment of the ministerial order will be without prejudice to anything previously done thereunder.  This reservation is necessary as otherwise the annulment could cause severe upset in the judicial process.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(6)  In this section &lsquo;child of the husband and wife&rsquo; includes&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>(a)</i> a legitimate or illegitimate child of the husband or the wife, and</P>
    <P>

      <P>This amendment is designed to meet the point raised by Senator Kelly on Committee Stage that the section, as it stands, is restrictive as it refers only to a child of the husband and wife.  The amendment proposes that a deserting husband shall be liable for the support of a legitimate child, an adopted child or an illegitimate child of either himself or his wife provided that immediately before the desertion the child was being supported by the husband and wife.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, think the Minister has met the point raised by Senator Kelly.  However, I am still a little bit troubled as to whether the Minister's amendment covers adequately all the cases that may arise.  It deals with the position of an illegitimate child or a child who is the child by one or other of the spouses by a previous marriage.  But I can visualise a case where there might not have been a legal adoption&mdash;for example, where a family, through a tragedy, are bringing up the children of a brother or sister of one of the spouses, such as a nephew or a <Col N="1032" /> niece, and might have reared the children from the time they were infants.  Such a case does not seem to be covered even by the Minister's amendment.</P>
      <P>Supposing it was the nephew of the deserted wife who was in question the husband might possibly make a case&mdash; I do not think it would be a reasonable case&mdash;as follows: &ldquo;It was no concern of mine.  She opted, out of the goodness of her heart, to take on the burden of caring for and rearing this child and it is no concern of mine.&rdquo;  Supposing it was a case where a relative of the husband was in question, that the husband and wife when united agreed to rear a son of a brother of the husband who, with his wife, was killed in a car crash and supposing the husband, with his wife's agreement, took in the child and reared it and cared for it from babyhood onwards and then the husband deserts the wife leaving that child in the care of his wife?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Senator, but I think normally, in that situation, there would be an adoption order made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there should be, but I prefaced my remarks by referring to the case where there was not a legal adoption.  The Minister has done his best to meet it, but it occurs to me that there is still that possible weakness there.  The Minister might think of it between now and the time when he is considering it in the Dáil.  I suggested to him a phrase which seemed to me to cover even such a case as I am talking about now, that is, by making reference to a child to whom the husband or wife have been <i>in loco parentis</i>.  That kind of phrase would cover even the kind of case I am talking about now and the Minister might consider it when he is bringing this legislation before the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered the use of the phrase <i>in loco parentis</i> but we found that it was extremely wide.  It undoubtedly covered the sort of cases about which Senator O'Higgins is talking.  It also covered a large number of other cases that one could reasonably include.  One type of obverse case of which Senator O'Higgins has given an <Col N="1033" /> example is where, as often happens, a man takes over the care and custody of a child, say, of his brother who has perhaps fallen into bad habits.  However the brother, who is the father of the child, is liable for the legal maintenance of the child.  Notwithstanding that, the brother who now has custody of the child would be <i>in loco parentis</i> to the child.  I think that the Senator would agree it would be inequitable to make him liable for the upkeep of the child, even though he is <i>in loco parentis,</i> because that liability would remain on the natural father.</P>
      <P>That is only one example of where the use of the phrase <i>in loco parentis</i> would be too wide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that almost every possible case is covered.  I agree with Senator O'Higgins that the sort of example he gave may not be covered. However, in 95 per cent of this type of case there would be in practice an adoption order, because the adoption of nephews or nieces in those circumstances, say, after a tragedy in which both parents are killed, is frequent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Before he concludes, may I just put this idea into the Minister's mind?  I am wondering if it might not cover it if specific reference was not made to the Adoption Acts if it was a child adopted by the husband and wife or either of them.  The reason I am suggesting that is that the kind of case I have been talking about would probably be regarded as practical adoption, even though not adoption under the Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid we must draw the distinction between the sort of practical adoption of that kind and the formal adoption under the Acts.  One must highlight the adoption under the Acts, because it brings in its train certain rights to the child.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak on only one section at this Final Stage.  I hope that I shall not be straying too far from order in doing so.  I want to draw the attention of the House to section 17, which deals with the right of audience of solicitors and to draw the attention of the House again to the manner in which the Minister introduced this section, and defended it.  In addition, I should like to draw their attention to things which he has said outside either House which are closely relevant to this point.</P>
      <P>In his opening speech on this Bill in this House the Minister frankly put section 17 forward as being a step on the road towards the rationalisation&mdash;I am not sure if he used that word, but this is probably what he had in mind&mdash;of the legal profession by way of the merger of the barristers' profession with the solicitors' profession.  He supplemented this by saying that this was something which we would have to face up to increasingly because of the demands which the approaching membership of the European Economic Community would make on us.  This was a theme on which the Minister has spoken on a couple of occasions outside Parliament.</P>
      <P>On the Second Stage debate I asked him if he would indicate in his reply to that debate just what there was in the Treaty of Rome, or in the regulations made under it, which required or pointed towards an amalgamation of the professions here.  He did not deal with this point in replying to the Second Stage, nor has he dealt with it since. However as recently as last Friday, speaking in Cork, the Minister came back to this again and said that the Treaty of Rome contemplated a unified profession, and that a single practitioner would carry on a particular case before the Community's court from beginning to end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want this matter to stay hanging in the air.  If he speaks on this Stage the Minister should tell us exactly what he has in mind about this, because he has left the House under the <Col N="1035" /> impression that section 17 is the first step in a process which will be necessary if this country adheres to the European Economic Community.  I, myself, cannot see where the necessity lies.  So far as litigation within this jurisdiction is concerned, there is nothing in the Treaty of Rome, or any regulation made under it, as far as I know, which requires the amalgamation of the professions.  So far as litigation involving the Treaty of Rome or any instrument made under it or any instrument connected with it is concerned, there seems to me to be no reason whatever why litigation before our courts cannot be conducted in the same way as heretofore, namely, by counsel instructed by solicitor, or of course now by solicitors themselves, if they so wish, in the superior courts.</P>
    <P>However, so far as the court of the Community is concerned, the Minister seems to fear that, unless we amalgamate these professions, no Irish barrister or solicitor will be able to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to argue with your ruling on this.  However the Minister expressly puts section 17 forward in the close context of a necessity made urgent for us by approaching membership of the European Economic Community.  My understanding is that most litigation before the European Court is done by a small bar of virtually resident advocates at the court, and that the likelihood of Irish advocates, barristers or solicitors, being retained to plea there is virtually nil.  Even if that were otherwise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I must ask the Minister in connection with the argument which, so far as I can see, is the principal argument in favour of his promotion of section 17, what there is in this instrument to support his point of view.

      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not make any more demands on the conscience of the Chair but I appeal to the Minister when he is replying to be specific.  It is possible that I have overlooked something or that I have not understood him properly, but I should like to know just what he means by putting forward section 17 on this basis and in general what he means by saying in so many words that the approach of membership of the European Community virtually implies or requires a progressive fusion of these two professions, both of which seem to have a concensus that no such fusion is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1037" />
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point is that section 17 has nothing directly to do with the EEC.  If there was no question of EEC membership being imminent, as I sincerely hope it is, I would have section 17 in the Bill anyway.  It is highly desirable in its own right.  It is ridiculous that trivial applications in the High Court must be made by barristers.</P>
      <P>I referred to the provision in the Treaty of Rome.  I do not know what the rules of court of this European Court are, but the provisions of the Treaty set out the qualifications necessary to practise before the court.  There is no official translation into English yet of the Treaty of Rome but the phrase used as translated into English is &ldquo;Members of the Bar of member states&rdquo;. A solicitor is not a member of the Bar in the sense that we know either here or in England, but I think he is put in a stronger position by this section.  I am happy to state that one of the results of this section is that a solicitor's position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the European Court is strengthened, but it is not correct to say that this section is here simply because of the EEC.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Seanad to the recommendation of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure which has come to hand since the Bill was decided upon and which recommends by a majority of ten to two a step which we had already taken in section 17.  So far as the European side is concerned, if I had sent a copy of the speech which I made last Friday and which is fairly detailed, to Senator Kelly, he could satisfy himself on these points.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was much longer than that.  I take it that nobody objects to section 17.  So far as this vexed question of the fusion of the legal profession or, as they like to call themselves, the two legal professions, is concerned, it is probably as much outside the scope of the Bill as the question of the European Court.  I have my view and Senator Kelly is entitled to his.  There are conservatives and conservatives. Some are unnecessarily so.  We can have <Col N="1038" /> that out some other day.  What I did make clear on a number of occasions, and particularly on last Friday in Cork, was that I was not trying to enforce this on anybody and that I envisaged it as being a gradual evolution as a result of the amalgamation or fusion of the educational facilities.  In the light of the incredibly fragmented state of the educational facilities at the moment I do not think anybody could object to my efforts to try to bring them together and make them a good deal more effective.</P>

      <P>Section 25 of the Act of 1967 amends the Act of 1958 in relation to the time for serving notice of expiration of a building lease or proprietary lease.  Section 26 of the Act of 1967 amends the Act of 1958 in relation to the fraction of gross rent represented by the rent under a reversionary lease.  The provisions of those sections are irrelevant to the grant of a sporting lease.  The Bill already contains in section 3 (2) a provision dealing with the time for serving notice of expiration of a sports club's lease.  Again, the rent fixed under a reversionary lease granted under the Act of 1958 has no relevance to the rent under a sporting lease which, where fixed by the court, will be fixed in accordance with section 6 of the Bill.</P>

The purpose of the amendment is to make it clear that expenditure by the club on reconstructing, <i>et cetera,</i> permanent buildings or structures that were already on the land will also count towards satisfying the expenditure requirements. This amendment will bring the provision into line with the recommendations of the commission.  In other words, where, as happens in quite a number of these cases, a sort of mansion house is taken over with the land, working on that will satisfy the requirements.

      <P>If it is a marginal case I suppose it would be a matter for the court to decide in the particular circumstances of each case.  I am sure the court would take into account that nowadays a lot of building consists of structures of a type which ten or 20 years ago would have been regarded as temporary but which are expected to last a good period now.  This is so in relation to school building and matters of that kind.  It is very hard to lay down hard and fast rules.  In a Bill of this kind it is wrong to lay them down because you will exclude too many from it.  The court would take all the factors into account when the problem arose.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (7) to delete &ldquo;3rd day of March, 1970&rdquo; where it occurs and substitute &ldquo;10th day of August, 1971&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this amendment I noted the Minister's explanation for this date in his Second Reading speech.  My information is that this piece of legislation is designed to meet two or three isolated and individual cases in the country.  This would appear to me to be an extraordinary situation.  I have put in this <Col N="1042" /> amendment which substitutes for the date of 3rd March, which is the one proposed in the Bill, the date of 10th August, which was the date fixed by the House for a Second Reading of this Bill.  I do not think people with vested interests should be able to come along and order Bills to suit their own particular isolated cases.  For that reason I think it is perhaps setting a rather dangerous precedent.  I would prefer to see the date on which Bills usually become law, either from the date of the passing of the Act or from the date, as suggested here, that the Bill was given a Second Reading or ordered to be printed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>On 3rd March, 1970, the Government decided that the legislation concerning sports clubs should operate from that date.  An official news item to that effect was issued on that day.  As the news item explained, this decision was taken by the Government because of the inevitable lapse of time before the legislation could be enacted. The purpose of giving publicity to the Government's decision was to put all the parties concerned on notice so that any negotiations would be conducted in the knowledge of the proposed changes in the law.</P>
      <P>The kind of proposal contained in section 2 (7)&mdash;that an entitlement to a right given by an Act of the Oireachtas should operate from a date antecedent to either the introduction or the enactment of the legislation&mdash;is not an innovation in the field of landlord and tenant law.  Each of the Landlord and Tenant Acts of 1931, 1958 and 1967 contains provisions enabling lessees whose leases had expired up to five years before the date of the passing of each of the Acts, to exercise for limited periods some or all of the rights conferred by those Acts as though their leases had not expired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot accept Senator McDonald's statement that this Act was brought in to cover two or three isolated cases throughout the country.  That is not so. There are a great many sports clubs of one kind or another in difficulties of tenure and they are under increasing pressure, and have been for some years past.  It is not a question of just two or three or anything like it.  It is very much <Col N="1043" /> more than that.  I can only talk about the ones I know of, those who from time to time over the years made representations to my Department or to the commission about it.  I am sure there are a lot more who have not discovered as yet that they may be in difficulties or that they could be in difficulties because of this.</P>
    <P>One practical effect of Senator McDonald's amendment, although I do not like to talk about specific cases since he suggested that there were only two or three, would be that the two clubs in particular that I could name offhand, whose leases expired since 3rd March, 1970, would be wiped out overnight.  They are Abbeyleix and Lucan.  So far as I know Abbeyleix and Lucan will probably benefit under the Bill, assuming that they fulfil the conditions about expenditure and all the rest of it.  One assumes they do that and, assuming they do, if I were to accept this amendment it would mean closing Abbeyleix and Lucan golf clubs straight away.  That would be a case of picking out two individual sports organisations and making special laws for them which I would not do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not precisely what the Minister is doing?  He is bringing in a special Bill to safeguard the interests of a few people in these two communities.  This is something that certainly perturbs me quite a lot.  In one county with which I am quite familiar we have five golf clubs and two of them are presently experiencing extraordinary difficulties.  I believe I have seen everything when a special Act of Parliament comes into force, sugar-coated as this one is.  The first and latter sections of this Bill are two completely different points.  They seem, from my limited knowledge of the law, to be very far apart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one mentions the word &ldquo;landlord&rdquo; the immediate reaction is that some extraordinary names from either the 18th or 19th century spring to mind. But in the context of this Bill we find that the landlord is an ordinary farmer who, either by being misguided, or through being a little patriotic-minded if you like, afforded club facilities on his <Col N="1044" /> land and set it for over 20 years more or less on a conacre letting basis as it was then.  We now find that there is a Bill being put through to take this original letting from him.  I should like to ask the Minister if this Bill, when enacted will supersede or will take precedence over section 12 of the 1965 Land Act?  The 1965 Land Act did many things but one of the better points in that Act is the fact that it makes it difficult for the creation of any additional uneconomic holdings.</P>
    <P>In one of the cases the Minister mentioned this Bill will create an uneconomic farm holding by virtue of the fact that it will give a club an opportunity of taking this sporting lease.  Surely we have not reached the stage that we have all our laws up-to-date to such an extent that we can afford to give time to individual cases like this.  In one of the cases mentioned by the Minister the rent being paid by the golf club over the past ten to 15 years was not even sufficient to cover the rates.  This man was subsidising the better-off section of his locality by providing them with cheap golf.  This is going too far when the Government of the day see fit to carry on this indefinitely by facilitating these people with a 99-year lease.</P>
    <P>At the other end of the county we have the Minister affording full-time police protection to a similar club.  This is not funny.  On the contrary, it is most regretful that our laws should be seen to assist in dividing our community. This Bill will drive a wedge between the urban and rural communities.  No matter how many police the Minister sees fit to put on full-time patrol on the premises of the golf club the division will remain and will take generations to die out.  There are many more important tasks that the police force can undertake.</P>

It is an extraordinary thing that we can have legislation put through for two reasonably small clubs.</P>

      <P>It is a matter of some amazement to me that it should be the desire of the Senator that golf clubs, both the ones mentioned and any others which are affected by this difficulty, should be closed down.  The Senator referred to five clubs in his county; presumably that is County Laois.  He referred to five golf clubs there as if they were too many.  My only comment on that would be that I would like to see ten, 15 or 20 golf clubs in County Laois, and in every county for that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the difficulties at the moment is that it is very hard for any group of people to afford to raise the capital that is necessary to establish a golf club. We have had the fortunate development in County Dublin that the Dublin County Council showed their enlightenment in this matter by opening a municipal course.  That is a splendid development.  It is something that I hope to see more of not alone in Dublin but in other parts of the country.  The difficulties of providing new courses are immense.  Because of that the duty on the community to try to preserve such limited number of courses as we already have is very great and the duty devolves on the Government to promote legislation for the preservation of this limited number of clubs.  It appears from what he says that Senator McDonald is in profound disagreement with the principle underlying this Bill. I note that this is so, but it is in considerable contrast to the enthusiastic welcome which was given to the Bill by this House on Second Stage, and indeed, in contrast also to the very enthusiastic welcome that has been given to it by the general public.  I have had many letters saying that it was an excellent development.  I can recall only two or three people criticising it.  They were very much in the big landlord or tycoon category and I would not have expected a Member of the Oireachtas to have taken that approach to it.  His amendments are in line with some <Col N="1046" /> amendments that were suggested to me by a certain organisation but which I felt unable to adopt.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I cannot accept the Senator's suggestion that this subsection that he wants to delete, or, indeed, any part of the Bill, is unfair to the landlord or to the owners.  Section 6 fixes the rent to be paid at a fair rate.  It is a matter for the court, an independent judiciary, to fix it at what in all the circumstances they consider to be fair, taking into account not just the circumstances of the club alone but the circumstances of the men who owned the land and let it or leased it to the club.</P>
    <P>As well as that, in order to overcome any inequity to an owner which might be brought about by inflation, we have provided for periodic reviews that will enable the rent to be brought up to compensate for whatever fall there may be in the value of money.  Speaking personally, I am very glad to have been of assistance to the two clubs mentioned and indeed to a dozen or more other clubs.  I am very glad that they are in a position to continue their activities and I hope they will be able to extend still further and increase their membership.</P>

      <P>Just in case I might be misunderstood, I meant that we had five clubs in our county.  I do not say that it is too many.  I certainly feel that we should have adequate recreational facilities.  We have over 25 GAA clubs, but the difference between a golf club and a GAA club is that the golf clubs consist of people who are more richly endowed with the better things of life. I think the GAA clubs are more homogeneous.  They want to get something done and take off their coats and do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the problem that has been posed by Senator McDonald should not be associated with individual clubs, whether they be golf clubs or any other sporting clubs.  I think the point he has been making is that you may have a state of affairs where a sporting club has had a lease for a number of years at a rent which, so far as the landlord is concerned, is not worthwhile.  He gave the example of the rent not covering the rates.  The Minister was right in the point he made&mdash;even though it may have been by way of a disorderly interruption&mdash;that presumably the club <Col N="1049" /> are paying the rent that has been agreed to be paid over the years.  As I see it, what happens under this Bill, assuming such a club qualifies for benefit under it, is that there cannot in future be any question of the club getting the ground below value as regards rent, because the rent will have to be fixed in default of agreement under the provisions contained in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I could see that a very difficult and possibly unpleasant situation from the point of view of farmer landlords could arise if this Bill was going to allow a continuance of a situation where in respect of land which they might have in the past out of civic spirit allowed to be used for the purpose of any particular sport, whether it was football or golf or show jumping or anything else, a claim could be staked to that land continuing to be in the occupation of a club at a rent which was being unjust or unfair to the landlord.</P>
      <P>My approach to this Bill&mdash;and I hope it is the right one&mdash;is that the sections of the Bill dealing with the fixing of the terms of the sporting lease and fixing of the rent, either by agreement or by the court, will be such as to ensure that the landlord or lessor will get a reasonable and fair market rent for the occupancy by the sporting club of the land.  I recognise that you have a difficult position if you have cases where the lessor does not, for any amount of rent, no matter what it is, want the land to continue to be used and occupied by the club or sporting association.  I do not know how you can get over that kind of case and at the same time try to give some kind of reasonable security of tenure to sporting clubs and associations. It may be that that is a difficulty that may be encountered when this legislation gets under way.  But, so far as the income accruing from the land is concerned, I am hoping that what the sections of the Bill dealing with the terms of the sporting lease and dealing with the fixing of rent mean is that there will be a fair return to the owner who has, in the first instance, made the lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take up a point which Senator McDonald made about the members of golf clubs having financial status not equivalent to average members of other clubs.  I think that <Col N="1050" /> this reflects the fact that there are not enough golf clubs around the country. The demand for membership in the clubs is so high that clubs have to restrict their membership.  Surely we should be providing more facilities and better clubs.  Young people who play such sporting games as association football, gaelic football, hurling, or rugby tend to join golf clubs later on in life.  Perhaps they are more affluent at that stage but when the private means of members are compared one should take this into account.</P>
      <P>Also, I feel it is not our duty here to talk about one group of people playing one sport being more affluent than another.  A good cross-section of the community plays golf in this country. I should like to see more and more people play golf.  I myself have a very long handicap.  I am no authority on the game, but I support this Bill and I supported it on the Second Reading. To argue about clubs because one feels that certain clubs attract a certain type of people and certain other clubs attract people of less financial means is looking at the thing the wrong way round.  We should be setting up facilities to allow more people to play more games.  We should be widening the scope of the games involved.  This Bill helps to do that.  Although I do not like Senator McDonald's argument along this particular line, I do not know anything about the individual club he refers to.  I do think that golf clubs throughout the country are making an effort to recruit members from all sections of the community.  Anything we, as legislators, can do to help this on should be done and, as I did on the last stage, I welcome the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4.</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) to delete paragraph (a), lines 26 and 27, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) not earlier than two years before the expiration of the lease, and&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1051" /> While I agree that clubs should have an opportunity of making their plans well in advance, I feel that the 15 years which the Minister has inserted into this Bill is an inordinately long option to give to a particular club.  The two years that I have proposed in my amendment should be quite adequate. This is very important, especially when section 3 (5) is taken into account, where the sporting lease can be granted in default of agreement on the date of the application.  This is weighted altogether too heavily against the landlord.</P>
    <P>I again want to emphasise the fact that the landlord in the vast majority of cases throughout the country is an ordinary landowner or farmer.  From that point of view he will need to get a fair return for the land.  Many farmers throughout the country have met their neighbours in a very public-spirited way and have made available portions of their land, be it for a football pitch or a golf club.  If this Bill is to do anything it should be seen to encourage this type of development throughout the country. We should look towards the tourist potential of rural Ireland.  It is only by providing these recreational facilities that we will do that.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister seriously suggesting that by the provisions of this section and by loading the dice completely against the landlord or landowner these people will be encouraged to facilitate sporting clubs and organisations by making their land available for this type of development.  This is very important.  If any club has plans the two years I have suggested should be long enough to formulate their proposals to extend or apply for the sporting lease.</P>
    <P>In the past the system in the country has been that, where farmers were concerned, they gave the lease of the land for golf clubs and retained the grazing rights.  It is not clear in the terms of this Bill if the grazing rights will be left with the individual farmer. That is why I asked the Minister the question relative to section 12 of the Land Act to which he omitted to make reference.  I feel that the ordinary farmers need this Bill of protection if <Col N="1052" /> we are to foster the provision of additional recreational facilities throughout the country.  With the price of land mounting as it is and the fact that it would take about 40 or 50 acres of land to lay out a nine-hole golf course, the capital cost of a golf course in most parts of the country is something between £30,000 and £40,000, which is a large amount of money.  If we are to have more of these facilities in the country it will be necessary to depend on the goodwill of the landowner. I contend that section 3 (1) is unfair and I would sincerely ask the House to accept this amendment and reduce the 15 years to a two-year period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I, again, should like to oppose this amendment because I have had some experience of attempting to buy land for sporting purposes.  I have always felt that landlords in such a circumstance act as landlords do in other circumstances.  They get the maximum amount they can for their land and I do not think&mdash;this has been my experience of buying land for a sporting purpose&mdash;that there is a question of goodwill coming into it.  I think they try to get the highest price and you try to buy it for the lowest price.</P>
      <P>I cannot see Senator McDonald's question of goodwill coming into it at all.  It is not a bad thing, seeing that we spend quite some time in this House protecting the rights of landlords in various situations, to turn our attention to a tenant such as a sporting club, who I think have a particular claim, if they have been in occupation of the land for a sufficient length of time, to conditions. I am very pleased that they should have legislation such as this to help them in the situations which have been outlined.  For that reason I should like to oppose the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see any great cogency in Senator McDonald's argument. I do not think it makes a great deal of difference to a landlord when he gives a sporting lease because the sporting lease would normally run from the expiry of the existing lease and he is only affected after the existing lease has run out.  Indeed, it might be of some advantage to a landlord to be able to give the sporting lease at the <Col N="1053" /> earliest possible date because a fair rent would be fixed and the fair rent that would be fixed might be considerably more than the rent the club might be paying under its existing lease or tenancy.  I do not think there is any great advantage to landlords in having this figure reduced from 15 years to two years by the organisation concerned, as suggested by the Senator in his amendment.  I have no strong feelings one way or the other about this.  If I could see any validity in it I would accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">

      <P>Could I ask the Minister the origin of the 15 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The origin of the 15 years is that it is the appropriate figure in the 1958 Act.  It is the figure used in relation to reversionary leases and a sporting lease here is, in effect, a reversionary lease because it is subject to many of the usual types of covenant and the types of the terms which are contained in reversionary leases under the 1958 Act.  Fifteen years is the figure recommended by the commission but I am sure they have no strong feelings about it either one way or the other.  In the absence of any cogent argument for changing it one might as well leave it at 15 years.</P>
      <P>However, it does not seem to me to matter greatly.  Although the argument is made on behalf of landlords that it would suit them better to have it the other way I wonder if that is so, because very often in the granting of new leases under these Acts the landlord agrees and one of the terms on which he will agree to give the lease is that the tenant surrender the existing lease because the existing lease might be at a very nominal rent.  He is quite happy to do that.  He would say: &ldquo;Right, we will scrub the residue of your existing lease and start off your new lease as and from now.&rdquo; He may then get ten, 20 or 50 times more rent.</P>

I am, in no sense of the term, a lawyer but I think that is the sort of clause that lawyers dislike because it is obviously open to individual interpretations.

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is in the 1931 Act and it is in all the subsequent Acts because it is one of the conditions of the granting of any lease that it be reasonable.  It is defined and has been haggled and argued about in umpteen cases as to what is reasonable and what is not in a particular situation.  I would really be misleading Senator West by trying to tell him in ten words what is reasonable and what is not.  There is a lot of legislation about it.  It is a well-known word in landlord and tenant legislation and it was specifically recommended by the commission in page 25, paragraph 93, of their report that it should go in. <Col N="1055" /> The reason it is there is that it allows the court to weigh up all the circumstances to try to get over cases where particular hardship would be caused either on one side or the other by otherwise operating the Act if there were some very special circumstances.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (3), to delete paragraph <i>(a)</i>, lines 26 to 29, and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) that the amount of the rent shall, on the application of the lessor to the Court, be subject to review once at any time after the expiration of thirty-two years of the term granted by the sporting lease and once at any time after the expiration of thirty-three years from that review, and&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (a), as it stands, is needlessly restrictive since it would mean that the reviews of the rent, if they were to take place at all, must take place during the 33rd year or during the 66th year.  If, through inadvertence, a lessor failed to act in time he would de deprived of any chance to have his rent reviewed.  In order to overcome this defect the amendment provides that the amount of the rent shall, on the application of the lessor to the Court, be subject to review at any time after the expiration of the first 32 years of the term and thereafter be subject to a second review after an interval of not less than 33 years from the first review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say where these periods came from?  It <Col N="1056" /> seems to me that 33-year reviews are extremely long.  As regards ordinary business leases or industrial leases the normal review nowadays would probably be about seven years.  I can appreciate that something longer than that would be appropriate in cases of sporting leases.  Thirty-three years seems to be a very long interval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

The commission recommended that precise figure at paragraph 93 in the summary of their recommendations, where they say that the lessor should be entitled to apply for a review of the rent during the 33rd year and during the 66th year of the term granted by the reversionary lease the rent should remain unchanged until then.</P>

      <P>That is so, but if you take the ordinary commercial leases that are made of business or industrial premises, such as a lease on an industrial estate or shopping centre, the normal for rent reviews would be something in the region of five, seven or eight years.  I think seven is the usual.</P>

      <P>The Senator will agree that there is a very big difference because that is in no sense a building lease.  In those cases there may be a regular review at five or seven year intervals.  The landlord has erected the premises, such as office blocks or supermarkets.  These were all built not by the tenants but by a development company.  The tenant simply goes in and rents a portion of it.  Therefore, the whole cost of development has fallen on the landlord and I think that it can be regarded as more equitable that he can have reviews of the rent.</P>

The land would be just a few old fields were it not for the fact that the club spent money on developing it, and therefore the club should have the benefit of what they put into it.  The landlord should not be allowed unduly to reap the benefit of the hard work or the investment of the members of the club.  Do not forget that the commission recommended such lengthy reviews as 33-year reviews.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be with the Minister on the question of development. However, when one looks at this from the point of view of the erosion in money values which is going on all the time&mdash;we all know that it is going on by inflation, increases in cost of living and so on&mdash;and if you relate it to that only, it would be rather unfair to a lessor that he should be stuck for effectively something more than a generation with whatever rent is fixed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>He is, but that is a different case.  We are considering this legislation now; and this is a question of trying to be fair to a lessor who, up to now, had to bear the burden of a lease being capable of being renewed. We must try to be fair.  His income is going to be out of the land.  There are safeguards written into the Bill as to how that income is to be determined at the start&mdash;in other words, how the rent is to be fixed at the start.  However, as long as the period is left for such a length as 33 years, the value could be completely eroded.  The value of money over a period of 20 or 30 years might only be a fraction of what it is now. The landlord is not going to have anything to protect him in those cases. Let us accept the Minister's argument as regards commercial leases where the <Col N="1058" /> developer has incurred the cost of development and erecting the building. Even in those cases the developer probably gets his money back more by reason of the fact that the rent initially fixed is a large rent which is commensurate with the value of the building that has been occupied by the lessee.  It is fixed on a different basis from this case.  I am doubtful about the fairness of rent reviews at such long intervals, even in the case of sporting leases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but at least the lessor has subsection (3) to look at and when he is fixing it, if he does not agree when it is mandatory on the court to make it 33 years, it would be wrong to assume that in every case an agreement cannot be reached between the lessor and the lessee, and that subsection (3) will have to come into force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support strongly the case put forward by Senator O'Higgins.  Referring to the &ldquo;few old fields&rdquo; that the Minister so glibly talks about, I consider that the property of a golf club would, at the very minimum, from a farm value point of view, be worth at least £30,000. When we accede to the European Economic Community this figure will appreciate at least 100 per cent.  Therefore, the value of the property of the landlord or the farmer&mdash;whichever we prefer to call him&mdash;is something that cannot be considered lightly.  In addition, it would be much easier on the members of an organisation if they had smaller reviews at the seven or ten-year <Col N="1059" /> period.  It would mean that there would not need to be a huge increase in green fees and membership fees if it was left to the 33rd year.  With the present trend of galloping inflation it is ridiculous to suggest that rents can be fixed for such a long period.  Perhaps the Commission and the Minister are forecasting a long period of ultra-stability to which we can all look forward.</P>
      <P>Landlords affected by this legislation can be divided into two classes.  There will be a small number who might be termed the wealthier traditional type landlord around the capital city.  The remainder will be in rural Ireland and will invariably be a farmer who is prepared to rent 40 or 100 acres of his farm, excluding the grazing rights, to the local club.  This is the type of landlord I am interested in.  If we are to retain the amenities we enjoy now and if we are to increase the facilities available throughout the country, a landowner must be encouraged and it must be made appear that he will get some reasonable return for leasing portion of his property to a local organisation for the purpose of recreation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree, but if you leave them as they are, it will deter people from meeting an application from a local club to take the initial step and set up a new club.  If this Bill is passed in its present unamended form any man who would entertain an application or listen to a suggestion that he should lease some of his property to any sporting organisation would need to have his head examined unless he was a very wealthy person and could afford to make a present of some of his land. This is too harsh.  With the shorter term and the more frequent review it would be easier to reach agreement.  The present network of clubs has, in the main, been set up by agreement, by people talking together without any restrictions or regulations.  The simpler the thing is the more progress will be made.  The Minister is loading the dice too heavily, and it will have the opposite effect.  It will not foster more <Col N="1060" /> sporting facilities.  I cannot see many local authorities having £100,000 to spare for golf clubs or any other sporting facilities.  We have not got the money in the country to do this.  Any development must come in a cooperative or sportsmanlike way.  The regulations laid down in this section are detrimental to encouraging people to meet and establish a club as has been done in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hate to see the day arrive when I find myself in agreement with Senator O'Higgins, but I am afraid it has come today.  A review of every 33 years is an unreasonably long period with inflation as it is.  If there is a review in 1971, the next review will be in 2004.  Without going into sordid statistics, what would be a fair and equitable rent today would not be worth collecting in 2004.  The landlord is entitled to justice, as are the members of the club.  Where the lease is being forced on them, as it is under this section, 33 years is an unreasonably long period.  The landlord has a financial interest just as the developer of a shopping centre or any other block; and inflation will eat away his capital, whatever it is worth today.  Thirty-three years is not giving him a fair crack of the whip and the Minister might well reconsider his ideas on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the points raised by Senators O'Higgins, McDonald and Norton.  I have been a member of a cricket club for a good many years and the landlord, since the foundation of the club, about 100 years ago was a brewer who, even in the 1870s must have been generous because the rent for the very fine premises in which we played the game was 1s. per year. This did not change until about two or three years ago when the land was sold to a developer whose sole purpose was to make money.  Unfortunately, at that time there was no Bill like this on the Statute Books and so the club was forced to buy the land for an absolutely outrageous sum to prevent this character building skyscrapers or whatever he wished to build on the cricket ground and the club has been in serious financial difficulties since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced it will survive; but if <Col N="1061" /> there had not been this minimal rent, the game would not have survived in Cork where this ground is.  Although 33 years is a long time between reviews of the rent paid there is a special case for sporting clubs and this is what this Bill is setting out to deal with.  As time passes, recreation will become more and more important in this country and the spirit and most of the letter of the Bill should be supported.  Although there are inflationary problems, because of the special position in which sports clubs find themselves, I must support the Minister on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points which should not be lost sight of.  The term that must elapse before a new rent is fixed should be determined on the basis of these two points.  One is that, the shorter the term is, the lower the initial rent to the landlord will be. The longer the term before revision occurs, the larger the initial rent.</P>
      <P>The second point is that if we are leasing land for sporting facilities, the club, committee or whatever body is actually running this sporting facility and which will be providing this amenity must know beforehand what its outlay will be.  It must know what the rent will be for such period of years to enable it to provide amenities on the land which is leasable.  In other words, if the period of revision is too short, the proper amenities for the sport involved will not be provided.  This is a fear shared by Senators McDonald, O'Higgins and Norton&mdash;that the period of revision will be too short.  I, too, fear that the proper amenities for the sport will not be provided if a sufficient length of time is not given to the committee or whatever body is running this sporting facility. That is what I fear in this amendment. If we are going to provide facilities for sport we should not do it in a halfhearted way.  We should enable those people involved to know where they are going, to be able to foresee how they are doing and to provide proper facilities for the sport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator West.  This is a clause for the protection of existing sports grounds.  I listened to Senator <Col N="1062" /> McDonald and I thought it was very funny that he should talk about these 40 and 50 acre farms worth £30,000 or £50,000.  I cannot understand that these businesses are worth so much when we hear so much from farmers about the small income when they have such valuable holdings, holdings which if they did not work at all and let them out in conacre would bring them in far more than the salaries they maintain they get from working them.</P>
      <P>That is really not the point.  The point is that farmers are not going to let a sporting ground.  Farmers, particularly those without any legal knowledge, make sure that they are letting for 11 months in the year.  They do not even go the statutory 12 months.  They make sure they do not run to a three year lease or run the danger of having a 21 year lease.  They make sure they have it back in their hands after 11 months.  Where they allow a sports ground to be let for a period of a year they make sure that the goal posts are taken down for a month every year.  I do not wish to waste the time of the House on this but I support this amendment as a protection for existing sports grounds because, as Senator West has said, in many cases attempts are being made by people in a capitalistic way to take over the existing sports grounds and turn them into building sites.  We cannot blame them.</P>

I am not committed to a period of ten or 15 years, but I think the Minister should look at this period of 33 years again because it seems to be long when you want to give cothrom na féinne both to the lessor and to the sports club.</P>

      <P>I have mental reservations about the 33 year lease.  I do not want to go beyond asking the Minister to reconsider this.  As Senator O'Higgins has said, and as has been said by a number of Senators, we may well have difficulties in cases where a person is to give land to one or other sporting club. I foresee that a 33 year lease is likely to be very difficult.  I do not know whether it should be 12 or 15 years, as is suggested in the amendment, but it is quite obvious to me that, if I or anybody else here had property and rent was fixed on a 33-year basis, it would be asking us to do too much for the sporting activities of the country.  The Minister might reconsider the 33 years. It does not seem reasonable to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the many views expressed on this and it is probably fair to say that, although there has been a difference of opinion on certain points, the majority opinion seems to be in favour of shortening the 33-year review period.  I accept that as the view of the Seanad, but my difficulty about this is that at the moment a reversionary lease, of which this is only one type, is a 99 year lease without any review at any time.  The main Bill, which I have already introduced in the Dáil will deal with reversionary leases as well as other kinds of leases and the Bill will contain certain provisions for rent reviews.  The Bill has not yet been published because of the length and complexity of it and the difficulty of drafting.  When that Bill is enacted it will be a comprehensive Act repealing and re-enacting, with a good many amendments, all the modern Landlord and Tenant Acts, the 1931 Act, the 1958 <Col N="1064" /> Act, the 1967 Act and this Bill.  As a result this Bill, or Act as it will be then, will become absorbed into the new overall Act.</P>
      <P>I do not know what periods of review may be fixed in the main Bill, and the kind of lease comes into it also.  For that reason I am loath to prejudge the issue by departing from the recommendation of the commission on this particular point here and now.  What I will do is to give an undertaking to the Seanad that the 33-year review period would be reviewed when the comprehensive Bill comes to be dealt with.  It is possibly unfair to a landlord of property which is used for sporting purposes that he may be put at a disadvantage or at an unusually greater disadvantage than the landlord of another kind of property.</P>
      <P>At the moment, although I accept the need for a somewhat shorter period of review than the 33 years, I am also impressed by what Senator Belton has said on this point.  It is plain from what he has said&mdash;and I must say that it is an aspect of it that did not occur to me&mdash; that to some extent it cuts both ways. You have also to take into account that sporting clubs generally are not commercial organisations.  They are less geared to paying frequent increases of rent and you might find the position where you would tend to squeeze them out if you change it too quickly.  I feel that it would be wrong for me at this stage to change the recommendation of the commission until such time as a review period has been fixed for one or other kind of lease in the main legislation. I will review at that stage the 33-year period for the review of rents in sporting leases.  In the meantime I would ask the House to leave it at this figure in view of the fact that these different kinds of leases must all be reviewed shortly.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider the matter before Report Stage because there must be a very clear distinction between what this Bill proposes to do for sporting organisations and what the Landlord and Tenant Acts do for ordinary commercial undertakings.  It must be very clear to all who have studied this Bill that there is an urgency to ensure that the terms of the leases will be attractive to the land <Col N="1065" /> owners.  There would be no further leasing of land, unless these people see that they can&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I do not accept that.  I said that they will remain, but I said that we should divorce them from the general commercial run of things.  I think that the clubs and organisations throughout the country will not expect to be dealt with as commercial concerns. Therefore, I think that the people concerned would prefer to have the shorter period of review.  The ten years that I proposed is somewhat longer than the normal period for ordinary commercial and industrial purposes but it is much shorter than what is recommended by the commission.  There is not much point in bringing legislation before the House if the Minister is rigidly to stick to what a commission recommend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), line 45, before &ldquo;to&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to the rent payable for other lands in the locality and taking into consideration the use to which those other lands are put,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a very important section as far as clubs are concerned, in particular subsection (2).  We should all like to see these large outdoor sporting clubs and organisations supported and even subsidised. I think the House would agree with this.  If we want to do that we should do it from central funds and not rely on one or two landowners to foot the bill.  Again, I want to emphasise that in 95 per cent of the cases these landlords and sporting clubs will be in country areas.  The landlord will not be the traditional type, but will be an ordinary farmer who has by his good offices given facilities to a football club or a golf club, or given them the use of part of his farm.  I should like to ask the Minister whether the sporting lease covers all the uses of the land or whether grazing rights can be withheld by the landlord apart from that.  Subsection (2) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fixing the rent the Court shall have regard to the general intention of this Act in relation to sports clubs which is the advancement of outdoor sports, games and recreations and the preservation of open spaces for the common good and, without prejudice to such other considerations <Col N="1067" /> as it considers relevant, may take into account the rent or other sum previously paid for the property by the sports club and any convenants and conditions under which it was so paid, to the rent paid by other sports clubs of the same kind in the same or a comparable locality....</P>
    <P>I would propose to write into the Bill an obligation on the court to take into account the use, in addition to the portion of the subsection which I have read out, to which the land adjoining the property in question is put.  This is a very fair point.  This subsection is quite explicit but it does not go far enough to ensure that the landlord or the farmer will get a fair price and a fair rent.  I only want a fair rent for the farmer in respect of his property.</P>
    <P>In the long history of land agitation the three &ldquo;f's&rdquo; were what the farming community fought for most.  The one difficulty I see in this, looking at this Bill from the point of view of having a rural background, is that the older population are inclined to look on the landowner as a landlord.  In practice it will be found that this is not so throughout the country.  In every town and village in Ireland the sportsfield is situated in somebody's field who may or may not be receiving rent for it.  We should preserve this rather easy way of doing things.  Unless the landlord or the farmer is given reasonable rights to preserve his own right of private ownership, it may very well deter people from affording this type of facility to his neighbour.</P>
    <P>The amendment I am proposing is to put the onus on the court to take into consideration the land use in the adjoining area.  If it is in a rural area the price of conacre prevailing in that area should be taken into account.  In any county the number of similar sporting clubs will not be that numerous.  It is reasonable to assume that no two sporting clubs will have the same type of lease or acreage or the same type of property.  It is reasonable to ask that the court take into account the actual land use and the value of land on conacre letting in that area as a guide towards securing for the farmer a fair rent for the property that he proposes to lease to <Col N="1068" /> the club at the time of leasing and also at the review period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the spirit of the amendment.  What we are witnessing here is the difference between the rural and urban approach to this whole question.  As I understand the Bill, it seeks to preserve for existing sports clubs that already, for a certain length of time, have been the tenants on land, security of tenure in the future.  I do not see that the terms of this Bill will in any way deter anybody in the future from giving new lettings which are not already in existence because those people who might want to give new lettings will, of course, give them in such a way not to come within the scope and the ambit of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as it stands, is designed to protect certain sports clubs who are in danger of losing their properties, especially those which happen to be in the Dublin area.  Those sports clubs which happen to be in the Dublin area, because of their location usually happen to be one of the high islands of open space reservations in that area and if one were to suggest the idea that the rent for those open spaces ought to be reconciled with the rent for adjoining land, which would be in almost every case put to industrial or residential usage, then the rent for those clubs would immediately have to be fixed by the court at such a prohibitive level as effectively to close those sporting clubs down and to prevent them from continuing in existence.  The whole purpose and spirit of the Bill would have been defeated and the intention of so many members of political parties to achieve this very worthwhile object would have been lost.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate: Turnover Tax on Books.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice that I would raise the following matter in the Adjournment:</P>
      <P>The desirability of granting exemption by the Minister for Finance from turnover tax on all books purchased inside this country, or imported into this country by public, university and other non-profit making libraries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very pleased that the House has given me an opportunity to discuss the problem of tax on books.  I should like, briefly, to put the background to this problem.  Up to 1st June, 1971, all parcels coming into this country valued at less than £20 have been exempt from turnover tax purely as a matter of administrative convenience.  Following representations from the Irish Booksellers' Association, the Minister for <Col N="1072" /> Finance withdrew the exemption with respect to books but to no other items. The point that the booksellers made was that private individuals and public institutions were purchasing books from abroad and were thus getting off the 5 per cent turnover tax whereas books purchased in Ireland from Irish booksellers have this turnover tax imposed on them and, consequently, the booksellers were losing business.</P>
    <P>They had a valid point here and I suggest that, so far as public libraries, university libraries and other non profit-making libraries are concerned, the Minister for Finance should grant an exemption from turnover tax for all books purchased by these institutions both in this country and outside it. Like every other Member of this House I should like to see the institutions which buy books purchasing them through Irish booksellers but, as I can explain, this is not always possible.  I have been in touch with many of the public libraries&mdash;some of the larger ones and some of the smaller ones&mdash; and in fact most of them purchase the great majority of their books in this country.  However, certain specialist books are published abroad.  Journals have to be purchased direct from the publishers, otherwise there is a delay, and it is vital that they should appear in libraries immediately after publication.</P>
    <P>An example of an item covered by turnover tax would be a collection of rare Irish books on auction in England which might be purchased by the National library.  However, they would be liable to a turnover tax of 5 per cent which means that the National Library has to pay 5 per cent more than other buyers because, as most people are aware, very few countries except our own have a tax on books.  Also, I should point out that a tax on books is a tax on information which is contrary to the spirit of such organisations as UNESCO, of which we are a member. I suggest that the Minister for Finance should consider exempting from turnover tax all books bought by public libraries.</P>
    <P>Another category of books affected by the turnover tax are purchased by the smaller public libraries.  These libraries in the country work on a very <Col N="1073" /> small administrative budget.  Their purchasing budget is quite small and so they need to have the services which sometimes are not supplied by Irish booksellers, such as cataloguing services, special covers and so on.  To obtain these they must, on occasion, purchase books from abroad.</P>
    <P>Several cases have occurred recently, since the imposition of this tax, in which parcels of books have been purchased by public libraries.  When they arrived they had to be sent back because the library was unable to afford the extra money required by the Revenue Commissioners.  One of the chief difficulties about the present situation is that the administration of the tax, both from the Revenue Commissioners' end and from the libraries' end, is considerable.  Take the case of a book that costs £5.  It comes by post; the automatic charge of 5 per cent goes on it, which is 25p; then the Post Office add a handling charge of 8p; then there is the problem of dealing with the payment of the charge in the library.  I reckon that it would be at least another 8p; if the Post Office handling charge is 8p, the library's handling charge would be about the same, and this brings the cost up to approximately 40p, which is almost 10 per cent of the purchase price.  A 5 per cent turnover tax has, for administrative reasons added a 5 per cent hidden charge.  Therefore, libraries are paying roughly 10 per cent extra on books coming into the country by post.</P>
    <P>Surely this is contrary to the spirit of the Common Market, which we hope to enter soon, and surely it is contrary to the spirit with which this House has concurred, that is, the spirit of providing educational facilities, and library facilities, at the minimum possible cost to the public.  The argument that I am making on behalf of public libraries is especially valid since all the funds for these libraries come from the public. In the case of the county libraries they come from the ratepayers; in the case of the larger public libraries they come from the taxpayers.  My argument is that, if these books were exempt from tax, it would be a purely administrative matter and it would not involve a great loss of revenue.  In fact, the cost of the <Col N="1074" /> collection of the tax at present, since most of the items are small and come in small parcels, is very large and the cost to the libraries is enormous.</P>
    <P>Books obtained free of charge are, of course, also affected.  For example, last year the Royal Dublin Society spent £5,000 in purchasing books, but in exchange for its scientific proceedings it obtained 700 journals.  These come in exchange and therefore they would be free of charge in the normal course of events but now they are liable for turnover tax.  Because they are by exchange they cannot be purchased through an Irish bookseller; they must come directly from the publishing university or press and the total cost would be prohibitive.  Take for example the Proceedings of the Royal Society in London which costs £20 per annum. Perhaps that would be a rather high cost for a journal but it gives people an idea: if you multiply 700 by ten you get £7,000; then charge turnover tax on that.  These books are coming by exchange, so there was no question of finance until the turnover tax was imposed.  It will mean that the Royal Dublin Society will have to cease getting some of these journals, which they essentially get free and which are vitally important for research workers and for people in all walks of life.</P>
    <P>Today the librarian told me about a gift from the Friesian Cattle Society of books on Friesian cattle.  The books were valued nominally at £100.  He had to pay the turnover tax.  He fought the case; the Revenue Commissioners asked him if the books were soft-covered or hard-covered and after some deliberation he got back the tax.  However, the amount of time, trouble and administration on the part of the librarian was excessive.  By imposing this tax the Minister has caused chaos in our public libraries.</P>
    <P>He must also have caused an amount of trouble to the Revenue Commissioners who often have to deal with books without a price on them; then they stick on their own valuation.  For example, they put their own estimated prices on catalogues that come into this country in large numbers; they come into the libraries, which usually get large numbers of catalogues free.  The library then challenges the imposition of <Col N="1075" /> the tax because of the unrealistic value put on the catalogues by the Revenue Commissioners, and so it goes on.</P>
    <P>Another example would be a thesis coming into a university.  Supposing I have been sent a Ph. D. thesis to examine. These are becoming more common; and since a person who is doing a thesis produces very few copies and gets perhaps only one, two or three copies bound, these are extremely valuable.  So a valuation on a thesis might be £25 or it might be £50.  I would have to pay the tax on this until the book was sent back to the author or to the university library, and then I could reclaim the tax.  This causes tremendous trouble, and since theses come in large numbers to libraries on inter-library loan, or in other ways, a great deal of difficulty is experienced.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise another point, and that concerns the joint pool of books on fiction which is operated in the whole country, north and south of the Border.  The Irish Librarians Association is not affected by the Border. It is a society which has its members North and South and they have a fiction pool.  This means that when particular books are needed in the North, they are sent from here, and <i>vice versa</i>.  There is thus a large turnover of books going across the Border.  Each book that travels the two journeys could be taxed and the tax must be reclaimed.  The problems created by this in a library are tremendous.</P>
    <P>I have the figures for last year's inter-library loans from the library in TCD. Other libraries would have similar figures.  The total number of items on inter-library loan coming to or going from the Trinity library was 1,700.  Not all of these would be leaving the country or coming in from outside, but a considerable number would, all of these would have had to be taxed and the tax reclaimed.  This is a ridiculous situation.</P>
    <P>An even more ridiculous situation arises with regard to books published by the Irish University Press, which has its printing house at Shannon.  Shannon is regarded by some of the Revenue Commissioners as being outside this country. I have seen books come in from the Irish University Press with turnover tax <Col N="1076" /> charged on them by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>To be fair to the booksellers, when we consider exempting public libraries from this tax, they should be exempted not only in respect of their purchases from outside but also in respect of their purchases inside the country.  I should like to see the public libraries buying more and more books from the Irish booksellers We should encourage the Irish booksellers to provide services to deal with libraries, both big and small.  We should remember that in Ireland we have the lowest stock of books <i>per capita</i> of any of the western countries and we have the lowest <i>per capita</i> expenditure on books of any of the western countries.  So, an added 5 per cent as I have shown&mdash;and in many cases it amounts to 10 per cent because of the hidden charges&mdash;is an imposition of a totally unjustified nature.</P>
    <P>In the case in which I am arguing we are transferring money from one part of the public purse to another.  Since this transfer involves us buying 5 or perhaps 10 per cent less books than we would otherwise do, it is totally unjustified.  I hope the Minister for Finance will look into this problem and will treat the libraries with the consideration they deserve and will encourage the purchase of books, encourage our store of knowledge being increased in this essential way, and will look sympathetically on the great problems which his turnover tax has caused for all public and non-profit making libraries.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with Senator West in expressing anxiety about the position that has arisen following the recent change in regard to books which were imported singly and sent in by post to libraries or to individuals.  It is fair to say that the books which have been coming in to libraries and to individuals in this way are only a few per cent.  Our libraries, our university libraries, our non-profit libraries, our individuals who are concerned with the purchase of books for educational purposes, purchase the vast majority of their books through our booksellers.  Any justification of the recent change based on the position of <Col N="1077" /> the Irish booksellers is a small change in the volume of books which would be passing through their hands.</P>
      <P>Against this we must set the very great disruption which it has caused in regard to this small number of books. In 1963 on the Finance Bill, when turnover tax was going through, Senator John Ross moved a recommendation on the Committee Stage of the Bill that books be exempt from turnover tax.  He moved it from the seat that Senator West now occupies.  On this occasion the Minister for Finance pronounced himself extremely sympathetic to the idea that educational books of all types should be free.  He expressed himself in the debate at that time as being very sympathetic and ended up in column 1406 of the debate of the 24th July, 1963: &ldquo;I assure the Seanad that I am very sympathetic in this matter and I will see what can be done&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The exemption order which was brought in afterwards fulfilled that undertaking of the then Minister for Finance, Dr. Ryan.  Since this change that has now occurred I doubt if the present Minister for Finance derives substantial revenue, but certainly extreme inconvenience has been caused. The latest instance of this, which affects my own department, was in regard to a number of books which came in today from the British Standards Institute.  We make a subscription to this institute which enables us to get books which we, in turn, pass on to our students at a far lower rate than those students would have to pay if these books came in through a bookseller, since these booksellers would not be adhering members of the British Standards Institute.  The postman had to find his way to the office of my particular department and there collect the turnover tax and the handling charge, which will all have to be handed on to the students and undoubtedly will be put down at the end of their list of present grievances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The books which are coming in to individuals now are books on exchange such as Senator West has spoken of. Books coming in on approval for a ten-day review and return are subject to turnover tax.  If you do not happen to be in when the postman calls, it takes you <Col N="1078" /> more than ten days to recover them from the Post Office.  Books which come in as gifts are now subject to tax in this way and many of these gifts are, in fact, exchanges.  The disruption caused by this far outweighs any advantage to the Irish booksellers or to the Irish Exchequer and I do hope that the Minister, though not here to listen to this debate, will be able to read it and to reconsider this matter.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to echo some of the views expressed by Senator Dooge and I am in considerable sympathy with the points put by Senator West.  The general structure of taxation in the retail area at this time is that nothing is at zero level except what is exported.  There are some exemptions: books in parcels to a value of £2.60 coming through the post are not chargeable.</P>
      <P>It is not easy to argue that items such as food and medicine should be taxable and that books should not.  From the booksellers point of view it would not be easy within the State to distinguish between those who are customers and those who are not.  A general exemption in this area would automatically lead to pressures for similar exemptions in relation to books for what I might describe as similar purposes, that is, representations would be made in regard to books for educational purposes for schools and a very wide range of text books for students.  The situation at the present time concerns not merely the public libraries.  A general exemption would create other problems.  Some of the points that have been made have considerable appeal, and I have noted them and will pass them on; but the general principle at present is to avoid making specific exceptions.  There does not seem to be a very good reason for exempting libraries and yet charging in the other areas such as textbooks for students and so on.</P>
