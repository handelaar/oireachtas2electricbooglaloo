      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approve the following Order in draft&mdash;</P>
      <P>Redundancy Contributions (Variation of Rates) Order, 1971&mdash;</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Seanad Éireann on 12th January, 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Order is to fix the decimalised rates of weekly redundancy contributions which will be payable by employers and employees from 15th February, 1971&mdash;Decimal Day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Redundancy Payments <Col N="474" /> Act, 1967, employers pay weekly contributions to the Redundancy Fund at the rate of 8d for each male worker and 6d for each female worker.  A male worker pays 4d a week and a female worker 3d a week.  These rates were laid down in the 1967 Act but subsection (3) of section 28 of the Act provided that the rates could be varied by order of the Minister for Labour, subject, under section 5 of the Act, to affirmatory resolutions of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The need for the draft Order, which is now before the House for approval, arises from the fact that the rates in force up to now have no exact equivalents in decimal currency and new decimalised rates have, therefore, to be brought into operation from Decimal Day.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Order, if approved, will be that, as from 15th February, employers will pay weekly redundancy contributions at the rate of three new pence for each employee, whether male or female, whereas the workers' contributions will be two new pennies for each man and one new penny for each female.  The proposed new rates are in accordance with the conversion table in the Decimal Currency Act, 1970. Because there are no precise equivalents in decimal currency of the existing contribution rates, the proposed decimalised rates will, of necessity, have to reflect some variations in the rates of contributions payable by the different categories of contributors but these variations are very small.  The net effect, so far as income to the Redundancy Fund is concerned, will be very slight.</P>
    <P>I believe that the rates proposed in the draft Order represent an equitable conversion to decimal of the existing contribution rates.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I recommend to the House to approve the Order in draft.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is inevitable that some changes must be made in accordance with the decimalisation procedure and, as the Minister has indicated, difficulties naturally arise in regard to cases where exact equivalents do not apply.  We have been reassured continually that, following decimalisation <Col N="475" /> when rates are adjusted, by and large there will not be a greater burden on the public.  According to my reckoning, this Order may well prove to be an augury.  When it comes to decimalisation rounding, the Minister will have four categories with which to deal.  In one of the four he gets almost an exact equivalent.  In the other three, he does not and, on my reckoning, when the Minister comes to do his rounding where he has not got an exact equivalent, he round up in two cases and rounds down in one case.  Therefore, I think we are getting off to a very bad start in regard to this question of the rounding off of figures due to decimalisation. I hope in fact that this is not an augury of what is to come, either in regard to the various charges which the Government make in the particular form of taxation which takes the form of social welfare contributions, and that it is not an augury of what the public are to suffer also from private sources.</P>
      <P>It is not open to us to amend this Order in any way so I can do very little more on this occasion, but I can express anxiety in this particular regard. I am not quite sure whether I heard the Minister correctly, but I understood from him that the difference in regard to the original 8d and 6d was in regard to male and female workers. If I am right in this, these two rates have now been amalgamated at a common rate of three new pence.  If so, I hope that this is a good augury of the Minister's approach.  In other words, that in this particular regard the same rate now applies to male and female workers and that this is a prelude to the adoption of the principle of equal pay for work of equal value which I hope the Minister will proceed to put in force throughout the whole of the part of the economy which is under his control or under his persuasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous rate was 8d for employers of men and 4d for the worker, which was 1s.  According to the conversion table the nearest we can go to that is three new pence for the employer and two new pence for the worker.  That means that the employer is paying somewhat less in the case <Col N="476" /> of the employer of men and the worker is paying slightly more.  The opposite is the case for the employer of women. He paid sixpence and is now paying three new pence, which is a slight increase in the amount he was previously paying.  The female worker is paying one penny, which is somewhat less than what she previously paid.  It is the nearest that it is possible to go unless one runs downwards and at a loss to the Redundancy Fund.  As Senators are aware there will shortly be a Redundancy Bill here from the Dáil.  This Bill seeks to utilise the surplus in that fund to improve benefits generally.  In view of the uncertainty of the future, one cannot take a chance on diminishing the Redundancy Fund.</P>

    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Instead of having the roundabout provisions of subsections (2), (3) and (4) of section 3, would it not have been better to have had a paragraph (c) in section 2, which would allow the Minister the latitude which the other subsections are apparently designed to give him?</P>
      <P>Presumably, we shall be discussing this with the next section, but as I understood it, subsections (2), (3) and (4) of section 3 would allow the Minister to designate, for the purposes of the section, a body not being an authority to which the Act applies.  Would it not have been easier in the section which defines who the authorities are to which the Act applies to have put in a paragraph (c) in those general terms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Senator, <Col N="477" /> section 2 specifies the authorities for whom a corporate body may be established to provide the necessary services. A corporate body cannot be established to provide services for any body other than a local authority or a health board.  However, once a body is established for these authorities, other bodies benefit from the services of the corporate body if an Order designating such body is made.  It would be inappropriate to include these bodies in section 2 because a corporate body could not be established to provide services for any of these other bodies; it could only be established to provide services for the Minister, for local authorities and health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>So that anything that would be done after that would be ancillary to the main Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the section stands, certain committees, boards, joint committees and joint boards are in fact covered by that section.  It only specifies local authorities and sets them out as county councils, county boroughs and borough corporations, urban district councils, town commissioners and certain committees.  On Senator Boland's point, would it not be advisable to add a third section: joint committees, joint boards and any other form of authority that the Minister may deem desirable?  In other words, is that sufficiently omnibus to cover all the joint committees?  I cannot think of the type of joint committee the Minister has in mind but perhaps he would give an example or two.  But is he satisfied that that section does cover the explanation in the Explanatory Memorandum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The type of joint committee involved would be a library committee or other committees of a local authority.  Local authorities, for the purposes of the Local Government Acts, 1925 to 1968, as specified in section 2, subsection (2), of the Local Government Act, 1941, are county councils, county boroughs, borough corporations, urban district councils, town commissioners and certain committees, boards, joint committees and <Col N="478" /> joint boards formed by the authorities just mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would they include the regional development organisations in which the local authorities participate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the corporate body wishes to provide services for such boards, after the corporate body has been established, it could, if these boards were designated by the Minister, they could then provide services for them as well.  However, the Bill as worded, would not allow for the establishment of a body to provide services solely for a regional group.  Subsequently, it could provide services for other bodies which may be designated. A corporate body could not be established solely to provide services for any of the regional groups that have been mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>But the local authorities make up the regional organisations. They could designate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  They could be designated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, if the need arose at some future stage to establish a corporate body to provide services for a hospital board or a group of hospital boards, for example, the Minister or his successor would discover that he had not the powers to do so under this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has chosen a wrong example because there is power under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act to do such a thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I suggest that example is because it is the one that is given in the Minister's Explanatory Memorandum.  It says, for example, a hospital board,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>To make it quite clear, once this Bill is passed, I am empowered to establish a board which will give services to local authorities and to the health boards.  When that body is established they can then decide to make their services available to other bodies who would be involved in similar work, to the local authorities and the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="479" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that Senator Russell and I have been endeavouring to make is that if, in the future, the need became apparent for a type of corporate body to be set up to provide services for some organisation or group of organisations which were not local authorities within the meaning of the Local Government Acts, 1925 to 1968, this Bill would not empower the Minister to establish such a corporate body. The only corporate bodies which the Minister can establish are corporate bodies to service the needs of local authorities or health boards.  If, after they are established, it is discovered that their services can be availed of by other groups, then that is provided for in section 3.  But if the need, in the first instance, at some future time is for a corporate body to provide services for groups which are not covered under the definitions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 2, the Minister would not have the power under this section to establish such a corporate body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The instance I had in mind, in particular, is one that the Minister is probably aware of, and that is that the Limerick Corporation have, I think, proposed to the Minister the setting up of a joint company with a private enterprise firm to supply propane or butane gas to the city of Limerick.  I am just wondering if this Bill will cover that situation.  That is what I had in mind when I spoke of joint committees or joint boards not covered specifically by the Acts referred to in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing this Bill, I outlined the reason behind its introduction which was to set up a body which could provide services for local authorities which, at the moment, have not the power to act collectively and, in fact, have not the statutory authority to act as a collective group.  It is not the purpose of the Bill that local authorities should be empowered individually to carry out the type of function which the Senator has mentioned. I am sure there are other provisions which might enable them to do just that.  I do not know whether there are any great difficulties in the way of Limerick Corporation doing what they <Col N="480" /> propose to do regarding this question of the supply of gas to the city of Limerick.</P>
      <P>The general purpose of this Bill is to set up a body which could provide services to all the local authorities and health boards, services which they otherwise could not have provided for them because they, themselves, did not have the power to act collectively under any other legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, could the Minister clarify the point which I made a moment ago.  If, in the future, the need becomes apparent to establish a corporate body to provide research facilities for organisations which are not local authorities or health boards, as defined by this section, this Bill does not, in fact, empower the Minister to set up that corporate body.  Is that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we have clarified it.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>More or less on the same point, in referring in line 4 of subsection (1) to the authorities therein specified, I assume in this case that this refers to nothing other than local authorities and health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps now that we are on the section which enables the Minister to allow corporate body services for ancillary organisations to those as defined by paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 2, he might enlighten the House as to what sort of organisations and what sort of activities he envisaged might be covered by subsections (2), (3) and (4).  The main point which I should like to make in relation to section 3, and which I mentioned on the Second Stage, but which unfortunately the Minister had not an opportunity of replying to then, was subsection (7) and the implications of it whereby anybody who is nominated as a candidate for <Col N="481" /> election to either the Dáil or Seanad would be disqualified from being a member of any corporate body set up under this Bill.</P>
      <P>As we agreed last week, the Bill is virtually, section for section, a copy of the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961, but that Act did not contain the provisions of subsection (7) or (8) of this particular section.  Subsection (8) says that: any person who is a Member of the Dáil or a Member of the Seanad would be disqualified from becoming a member of any corporate body established under this section.  I could envisage a situation where a corporate body might be established to advise local authorities on some particular legal matter and the very best brains and advice available might happen to lie within the ranks of either the Fianna Fáil, the Fine Gael or the Labour or Independent benches, either in this House or in Dáil Éireann.  Unfortunately, those local authorities would be deprived of the intelligence, experience and expertise of the gentlemen who happened to be Members of this House.  I would consider that to be a shameful thing.</P>
      <P>To take an example, in the field of engineering, Senator Professor Dooge would not be allowed to become a member of a corporate body to advise local authorities on engineering and, in the legal field, Senator Nash would not be able to give to the local authorities his vast wealth of experience in dealing with local authorities and the legislation governing local authorities. I do not see the purpose of subsections (7) or (8) and I was disappointed that the Minister did not get an opportunity last week of explaining why they should have been included in a section which, apart from them, is almost a direct copy of the Act of ten years ago. Perhaps now the Minister could explain to us why these two subsections have been considered necessary at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I add a word on that last point made by Senator Boland?  I was nominated, by a nominating body, to the Seanad and as far as I recollect nobody ever asked for my consent to this nomination.  In <Col N="482" /> fact, I had made approaches which made my consent unnecessary.  However, I could well have been nominated by malicious persons.  Some of the nominating bodies did not even bother to nominate persons to stand on some of the panels.  I could have been managing director of a State company or of a number of them.  I could have been in quite an important office but under a section which has been repeated in Bill after Bill I would thereupon cease to be a member of the body in question.  It seems to be a defect that ought to be remedied by some amendment in regard to the nomination of persons to the Seanad.  The same thing could not happen if one was nominated to the Dáil.  Certainly, it can happen to people who are nominated to the Seanad.  It seems undesirable.  In principle there is something to be said for a person already on such a body not making himself available without first resigning from the body by taking steps that are appropriate, in his view, to achieve this.  For someone who is not on such a body to be nominated and thereupon to be disqualified by the nomination seems to be in principle wrong and a maldistribution of power between the Civil Service and the people who offer themselves for public service in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I am speaking on the section perhaps I could ask a question for the purpose of clarification.  I do not see specified here the means whereby the Minister proposes to designate for the purposes of subsection (3), any body to receive the services to be received under subsection (3).  It seems quite clear that this body is not going to be an authorised body such as would be in the establishment order which would contain the provisions in regard to the charging of fees in respect of services. The designation of this body also seems to me, if I am reading the section correctly, to be something for which the Minister does not have to have the consent of the Minister for Finance.  That seems to me to be odd. There may be good reason for it but there is no explanation here.  Under subsection (4) the authorised body, when established by establishment order, is then in the position that it relies on subsection (1) of section 4 <Col N="483" /> for the general authorisation as to the administration of their finances.  They seem free, without the control of the Department of Finance, to go off and render their services to bodies that are not authorised bodies but which are designated by the Minister in the manner in which he proposes to designate them without necessarily the charges out to these bodies being proper recoupment of the cost of services being rendered&mdash;a matter that I would have thought would be of the greatest interest to the taxpayer whose interest in this matter is looked after by the Minister for Finance.  There will be no expressed provisions to have these bodies designated.  One is forced back to the view that the provisions of the designation are going to be contained in the establishment order to be made under section 4.  If there is, for example, to be the rather constant inflation which has been experienced all over Europe in the last ten years there is going to be some provision for increasing the fees to be charged.  Is it to be understood that the establishment order has got to be amended to deal with fresh designations that are to be made, or is it contemplated that the original establishment order will designate all the persons that are in mind by that time to receive the benefit of the services under section 3, subsection (3) thereof.  If this is correct it seems to be putting rather a heavy onus on the Minister and to be requiring him to amend his establishment order from time to time with the undesirable consequence that he has got to come to the Houses with the amendments.  I wonder if he would consider putting in some special provision with regard to the manner of designation under subsection (3).</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want a little bit of information.  I am not quite clear about subsection (3) as to why the Minister may, whenever he determines it is expedient to do so, create with the agreement of the Minister for Finance, a corporate body.  I am not quite certain what kind of a corporate body the Minister would have in mind.  Senator Russell gave a typical one and these kind of bodies are likely to be springing up now with the concept of reginalisation. <Col N="484" /> In our own area we have the regional development association.  They have no statutory powers at the moment.  The expenses of that association are being paid jointly by a number of bodies, including the three county councils involved.  As of now they have not any statutory powers and could not be termed a corporate body.</P>
      <P>What I am worried about is that these bodies begin very simply.  They do not seem to be of any great importance at the time.  But Parkinson's Law begins to take a hold and the expenses of these organisations are rocketing to quite a considerable amount.  I wonder if the Minister can, within this section, give these people statutory powers and make them into a corporate body.  If they become corporate bodies, will the county councils and the other local authorities in the area be required to pay the expenses of these companies and boards?  This is going to take on a dimension that nobody is bargaining for at the moment.  It would be a good thing to have it understood clearly as to whether a number of people who come together to start a board or association under the aegis of the local authorities can apply, under this section, to become corporate bodies.  The situation might arise where there would be a proliferation of bodies all doing the same job and costing a lot of money in so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>As section I, subsection (3) reads, if the Minister decides to set up a statutory body to provide a service for the Minister he can so do.  In other words&mdash;unless I am completely wrong &mdash;the Minister can decide that it is desirable to set up a corporate body to provide any service no matter what it is.  Am I correct in saying that he could decide that this corporate body would provide a service which at present is being provided by a local authority, in other words to take some of the powers out of the hands of the local authorities and hand them over to a statutory body on which no Member of the Dáil or Seanad could sit?  Are these corporate bodies to provide services which are not being provided by the local authorities because they have not got the necessary legal powers to provide them?  As Senator Honan has <Col N="485" /> said quite rightly, the idea of regionalisation is developing.  There is a lot to be said for that.  But I do not think anybody would wish it to develop, unless there were very good reasons for such a development, at the expense of the local authorities who are in most cases doing a very good job.  Many of us have sat on local authorities for a number of years and who appreciated their defects and saw the advantages of working together on a regional basis, would not like to see services taken out of the hands of the county council or city council, as the case may be, and handed over to a statutory body on which no Member of the Dáil or Seanad could find a place due to the provisions of this section of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to endorse what the Senators have said on section 3, subsections (3) and (4).  Senator FitzGerald, Senator Robinson and Senator Russell dealt mainly with subsection (3).</P>
      <P>What agitated my mind and those of many of the Senators who have spoken on the Second Reading of this Bill in relation to the establishment of these bodies was whether they will usurp the functions of local authorities?  If they are to usurp the functions of local authorities, what is their purpose at all?  If they are not an adjunct to local authorities, is there to be an accretion of extra staff to these bodies?  Senator Honan rightly asked what will be the cost of these bodies.  That is a question that was brought out on Second Reading and as I only glanced through the Seanad Official Report I did not see the Minister's answer to the point.</P>
      <P>One of the points made was in relation to the County Managers' Association. Would they be provided with a special staff and where would that special staff come from?  Will it involve recruitment of more people at the local civil service level?  In other words, will it add to the local civil service we already have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsections (7) and (8) were also mentioned on the Second Stage.  Senator <Col N="486" /> Boland and other Senators have already spoken about this.  Senator Boland's point was that there may be people with a special scientific knowledge that would be of great advantage to these special boards, these corporate bodies, and that it would preclude them from membership of these bodies if they wished to remain Members of the Oireachtas.  The bodies, therefore, would be devoid of their experience if subsections (7) and (8) were included.  I said on the Second Reading that subsection (7) seems to be worse than subsection (8), though both are bad.  I do not see what was in the minds of those who framed this Bill, especially section 3 (7).  Why not wait and see if a person is elected as a Member of the Oireachtas and then disqualify him if necessary?  I do not believe it will be necessary.  I think both are wrong, but subsection (7) is far more wrong than subsection (8).  At least they should get the chance of being elected before they are disqualified from any body that may be on under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>One point I should like to make clear is that, when a corporate body is established, it can provide the services which are set out in the establishment order to the bodies which are mentioned in the Bill.  If they wish to extend their services to other bodies these bodies must be designated. Only designated bodies can benefit from those services which a corporate body provides.  There is no intention, as I said in my Second Reading speech, to interfere in any way with or to detract from the powers of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to expand on this question of designation.  A corporate body set up under the Act can provide the services specified in the relevant establishment order which, of course, must come before both Houses of the Oireachtas and which can be annulled by either House.  The corporate body can provide these services, on such terms as may be agreed on, for a body which the Minister designates, and which is not an authority to which the Act applies.  These provisions are designed to ensure that the services which a corporate body provides can be made available, if the Minister sees fit, at <Col N="487" /> any particular time to other bodies which, though not authorities to which this Act applies, are nevertheless public authorities, or other bodies which have close links with public authorities.</P>
    <P>Such other bodies could include bodies set up by establishment orders under other Acts, various regional and local organisations, the vocational education committees, county committees of agriculture, boards of conservators, harbour authorities, public and semi-State bodies.  All of these could also benefit from the services provided by a corporate body if the Minister consented to their designation and to their benefitting from whatever services they require, which the corporate body could make available to them.</P>
    <P>The power to designate would be used only if the body in question sought the services of the corporate body.  When the designation is made, it would be for the designated body themselves to decide on and to agree with the corporate body the extent to which the services would apply and the terms and the conditions that would govern the provision of the services.  I hope that is clear.</P>
    <P>There is no intention whatever to cut across the services and the powers of local authorities as they exist at the present time.  The principal reason for introducing the Bill was to provide a body which would give services to the city and county managers who act as the Official Side in negotiations with the local authority staffs.  There has been a certain amount of dissatisfaction because of long delays, which were unavoidable under present arrangements in dealing with these claims because there was no body which could process the claims and assist the managers in preparing their case.  The Bill will enable a body to be set up to assist the managers in the operation of the conciliation and arbitration scheme which exists for local authority staffs.  The question of the disqualification of Members of the Oireachtas is not new.  It has been included in several Bills before.</P>

      <P>It has been accepted in previous legislation.  Similar provisions have been included in legislation setting up many semi-State bodies.  For instance, the Horse Industry Act, 1970, which I mentioned the last day, the Industrial Credit (Amendment) Bill, 1970, the Film Industry Bill, 1970, and most of the other statutes relating to semi-State bodies and other agencies in the public sector contain provisions similar to those in this Bill.</P>
      <P>There are a number of reasons for this.  One is that these provisions could be justified on the basis that the principle of separating the Legislature from the Executive is a good one.  There is also the possibility of a conflict of interest arising; persons who would owe allegiance to various political institutions might not therefore be the best people to sit on such bodies.  One of the reasons why Senators have been disturbed at the exclusion of Members of the Oireachtas is that they may have something very valuable to contribute. We should bear in mind that they are only excluded from becoming members of the corporate body itself, that is, of the board of the corporate body.  They are not excluded from sub-committees which that body might set up to act in an advisory capacity.  If Senator Dooge or Senator Nash were to be called upon by a corporate body they could act on a sub-committee and/or in an advisory capacity.  The corporate body itself is not set up to be an advisory body as such.  It is set up to provide specific services.  The provisions of subsections (7) and (8) would in no way exclude the brains available even if those people who could best contribute were, in fact, Members of the Oireachtas.  It is a good principle to separate both.</P>

      <P>Not having a legal mind or being trained in the law, I am not as well able to grasp the particular implications of various sections of the Bill as the people trained in law, but it seems to me to be extraordinary that a Member of the Oireachtas is precluded from being a member of a corporate body set up to do work for other corporate bodies on which Members of the Oireachtas can sit and be elected, such as county councils, county vocational education committees, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
      <P>Whatever about the principle enshrined in this, it seems to me a strange procedure if we can be Members of the Oireachtas and members of the particular bodies I am talking about.  At the same time, a body are being set up now with a roving commission. This is the first time I have heard of a corporate body being set up by the Minister for Local Government which have the power to roam into the sphere of the Department of Education, the sphere of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries or the sphere of any other Department.  It is something so completely new that it would be well for the legal men to examine it line by line and to make sure that we are not caught up in something that gives extraordinary powers to any particular Department in relation to the function of another Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I feel I am not competent to deal with the legalistic questions but the Minister himself was a member of a local authority and he knows very well what I am talking about.  It does seem an extraordinarily strange thing to me that in this body a Member of the Oireachtas is precluded from membership just because he becomes a member of a body that has been set up to help other bodies of which he is already a member.  Surely there is no reason at all <Col N="490" /> why the actual nomination of a person to become a Member of the Oireachtas should be taken as precluding him?  It certainly should not.</P>
    <P>I would say that the Minister should delete the appropriate words in that section and say &ldquo;when he is elected to either House of the Oireachtas&rdquo; and not say that a man who has been doing excellent work in a particular body and who has been appointed to it should be precluded, just because he is nominated as a candidate.  In fact, he sacrifices his seat even if he is not elected.  Surely that is entirely unfair.</P>

      <P>As I have explained to the House, if and when this Bill is passed, I intend making an establishment order to establish a body which will provide services to enable the managers to deal with staff claims for salaries and perhaps other matters in relation to those who work for local authorities.  In that body, when they are established, the board will consist of the nominees of the County and City Managers' Association and the chief executive officers of the new health boards.  I do not think it would be fit and proper that we should include on that board elected Oireachtas Members or prospective candidates.  I do not see any need for it.  This board would be dealing with very delicate matters and there should not be any outside factors allowed to play on the opinions of the members who would act on it.  They should be free and independent in all their decisions.  I think they would be somewhat inhibited if they were Members of the Oireachtas, of particular parties representing particular points of view.  If it is proposed to establish any other body, the establishment order will come before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It can be annulled and debated by them.</P>

We can make a great contribution in many <Col N="491" /> other ways.  I am surprised in one way because if the subsections in question were omitted the way would be open to appoint all Members of one particular point of view.  In this way, I am closing the door.  There can be no representatives of political parties.  I think this is reasonable and I trust that Senators will accept this, particularly in view of the fact that the establishment order which I have in mind is of the nature which I have explained.  In that case certainly I do not think there would be any strong case for representation from Oireachtas Members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is moving from the general to the particular, I would feel, just a little bit too quickly.  I think we all probably want to have a word about this corporate body that might be established to allow for conciliation and arbitration machinery for the staff of local authorities.  As has already been said, the Bill is, in the main, a copy of the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961, and, as many Members of the House know, hospital boards have quite recently been established by order under that Act.  Members of this House and of the other House have been appointed to serve as members of those hospital boards.  Those Members are from all parties.  I would hope, and I am quite sure the Minister was not for one moment implying that any body with such a history of service as his old colleague, Senator Walsh, or Deputy P.J. Burke, might in any way be inhibited by his party affiliations in the manner in which he would serve on those hospital boards.  In the same way, these two gentlemen, and many other worthy Members of this House and of the other House, could obviously have a great part to play in local government corporate bodies which might be established under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health Act did not include these two subsections.  It seems to have <Col N="492" /> worked very well and very admirably. I do not remember any time when an establishment order was made under that Act which allowed Members of this House, or of the other House, to serve on a board and where they found a conflict of interest at a later stage.  It just did not arise.  We all know, of course, that the Minister would not be as foolish as to utilise his power to appoint all people of a particular point of view.  I do not think that is really a valid argument.  The Minister knows that we have more confidence in him than that.  These two subsections are really quite superfluous and quite unnecessary to the Bill.  It would be just as good and just as effective as the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961, was and is if these two subsections were omitted.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is absolutely adamant on seeing them included, he must, by implication, be saying that there is a serious defect in the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961, which does not seem to have come to light in its operation in the last ten years.  Perhaps he might be able to tell us if that is so and whether it is expected to introduce an amending Act to that Act so as to exclude Members of the Oireachtas from serving on hospital boards or the like from now on.  I would not think this is a good thing in the same way as I do not think it is a good thing to exclude Senator Garrett or the Minister if at some stage he was not a Minister but had some great contribution to make in the field of local government, or the Minister for Transport and Power if he had some great contribution to make at some stage when he was not Minister for Transport and Power either in matters of transport or power or legal affairs or any other thing.  He would be excluded by virtue of the fact that he was a Member of Dáil Éireann.  He would be excluded, indeed, by virtue of the fact that he received a nomination to stand as a candidate for election to Dáil Éireann. I do not think it would necessarily be a good thing.  I would suggest to the Minister that between now and Report Stage he considers very seriously the quite restrained but, I would think, very valid points that have been made to him in this connection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="493" /> However, as section 3 really is the kernel of this whole Bill, could we ask the Minister, as he has spoken about it at some length, what exactly he proposes to do when he makes an establishment order to give the City and County Managers' Association statutory power?  The House would be interested to know whether that statutory power will extend to any aspect of their present activity other than negotiations with staff, and whether it will allow them to act as a statutory body in any field other than the fields of conciliation and arbitration and the negotiation of working conditions and pay claims.  I think it is important that this should be clarified at this stage, and also whether the Minister envisages a large staff being given to the City and County Managers' Association in their corporate status and whether that staff may be utilised by that association for any purpose other than negotiating with staff associations in relation to wages, working conditions and the like.  In other words, will the establishment order allow the managers' association to create a staff and to have statutory standing in any fields or in any activities other than the field of negotiation with the joint staffs of local authorities?</P>
    <P>While we are talking about that, perhaps the Minister could tell us why it is necessary&mdash;I am sure it must be&mdash; that there should be a standard rate of pay, salary and working conditions applying to all grades in the local authority service throughout the country.  Could the Minister enlighten the House the reason why, for example, Galway Corporation could not offer a higher level of remuneration to a county engineer than Louth County Council if it were felt that the Galway county engineer was doing a more onerous job?  Presumably this corporate body which he intends to establish will be involved very deeply in this sort of thing, so I feel this is a relevant question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies, could I just raise a point of clarification?  He has gone a good way to explain the point, as he sees it, that there is no danger that any of these new statutory bodies will usurp or take <Col N="494" /> over any of the responsibilities or powers carried out by local authorities such as county councils or city councils.  That being so, could the Minister state quite specifically that, in fact, the purpose of setting up these statutory bodies is to provide a service which may be availed of by the local authorities covered in this Bill, but that there will be no question of forcing them to avail of these services? In other words, he instances&mdash;and we all agree with the instance&mdash;the setting up of a statutory body to deal with arbitration for staff wages, salaries and conditions.  That is perfectly acceptable. It does not exist at the moment. But if the Minister sets up, say, something like the National Building Agency, if he decides that the local authorities, county and city councils, are not doing a proper job in regard to the provision of houses, which is a very sore point in certain areas at the present time, he may then decide to set up a statutory body similar to the National Building Agency and insist that all building is taken over by this agency.</P>
      <P>As things stand at the moment there is a certain reservation, if I could put it that way, on the part of local authorities.  They do not have to use the National Building Agency.  In fact several of them, as the Minister knows, have availed of its services; but the point I want to make again, in conclusion, is that these statutory bodies will be there to provide a service which will be available on request, not on demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is so.  There will be no question of compulsion.  They will be providing a service and the local authorities can avail of that service if they so wish.  They will not be compelled to avail of the services.  In answer to some of the points that Senator Boland made, the only purpose of the establishment order which I propose to make is to set up machinery to facilitate the efficient operation of the conciliation and arbitration scheme which exists for local authorities.  That is the only purpose.  There will be no extension of powers.  There will be no extension of the powers that the managers, acting on that body, will have. <Col N="495" /> They can deal with staff matters arising under the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  That is all.</P>

      <P>The Senator mentioned salaries.  I think that would be widening the scope of the debate; it would not really be relevant and I do not think we should go into that at the moment.  We could debate for a long time this question of whether Members of the Oireachtas should be allowed to be members of these boards.  We could argue both sides of that case <i>ad infinitum.</i>  I am strongly of the opinion that they should not and this view has been supported by the Houses of the Oireachtas on former occasions and is supported by provisions in many Bills which have been passed; it is a principle which has been adhered to consistently and will, I expect, be adhered to in the future.  I think it is a good principle and I would ask the House to accept it.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister's reply has shown the dangers in section 3.  As I pointed out on Second Reading, the setting up of this type of statutory body by order is a very dangerous thing and I would propose that, when the first order is brought in setting up the City and County Managers' Association as a statutory body concerned with this, we should have a full-scale debate on it in this House.  It is the only substitute we can have for what should have been proper legislation which should have presented to us the particular case at which the Bill is aimed in the form of a Bill which we could amend.</P>
      <P>Now I ask the Minister to give us an assurance.  I know he has said he will not use the clause in section 3 in a way in which it could be used.  In other words, he could assign anything to the City and County Managers' Association when constituted as a statutory body, but I ask him if he will give an assurance to the Seanad that when he drafts this order he will accept an offer, which we hope to make from this Seanad, to come and to discuss the order with Seanad Éireann.</P>

      <P>On the Second Stage of this Bill, the Leader of the House mentioned an urgency to get this Bill through, and our party agreed we would facilitate him to some extent, and that is what we did.  It transpires that the reason was that he wanted to give to the County Managers' Association, which already had power to negotiate, a staff.  In other words, he wanted to put them on a level where they could employ staff legally.  Roughly that is what that meant and I take it I am not wrong in my assumption.  If I am I will be corrected, I am sure, by the Minister.  I posed the question today&mdash; I posed it on the Second Reading&mdash; where are all the staff coming from?  I should like to know if there is to be an increase in civil service, be it at central or local level.  I do not think the Minister has particularly answered that point which was made on the Second Reading and made again today by me. Senator Quinlan also made a particular point.  I do not know whether the Minister slipped or not, but he did say that orders were to be laid before the House and that there would be a debate on them.</P>
      <P>I am not exactly clear on this.  The point I made on Second Reading was whether it is in the form and laying the orders before the House or on the revocation of the orders that Members of the Oireachtas will be able to make contributions. Those are the two points I should like to make at this stage.  I am rather afraid that this will tend to enlarge the Civil Service, either local or central government level, to an extent that it will be unwieldy.  God knows we are already overloaded enough.  I am not criticising the members of the Civil Service in this.  It is obvious to anybody who knows, that an underpopulated country like this must have a minimum of civil servants who could equally have been called on to cater for 12 million at the initial setting up of the Civil Service.  But an unwarranted increase in the Civil Service now should be examined very closely.</P>

      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with what Senator Quinlan said.  I restrain my impulse to make the same point that he has <Col N="497" /> made.  This seems to me to be a totally uninhibited power to establish bodies corporate.  There does not seem to be any limitation that I can find in this Bill as to what this, or any such body corporate, would be entitled to do. Perhaps it would help if an order were made to tell them to start racing stables.  Perhaps somebody could construe this as something that was not within their power because of the Short Title to the Bill.  I hate to rely on the Short Title to the Bill to ensure that the Minister was inhibited as to what he was to do.</P>
      <P>Generally, as most will agree, what is established under statute, normally speaking, is established by statute and not by a Ministerial order made pursuant to a statute.  This has only come in in the last decade, I think.  Still, it is probably within the powers of the Legislature to delegate this power to a Minister.  One has to look at either the statute or the order made by the Minister pursuant to the statute, the statute having validly given him the authority, to discover if the statute has the power to do these various things.  I failed to understand the Minister when he was replying to a point I made earlier with regard to the designation of bodies.</P>
      <P>It is really only under subsection (3) that the words &ldquo;services of a similar nature&rdquo; come to be used.  If I am reading this section correctly, it is only when he comes to designate a body other than an authority under this Bill that he takes power to enable them to provide services of a similar nature. He does not seem to take that power anywhere else in the Bill.  Looking at section 4, which we later have to debate, I do not see any power there, either, without prejudice to subsection (1), which gives the generality of what is to be in the establishment order, or in subsection (2) which deals with a series of matters none of which includes the rendering of services of a similar nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister had a rather difficult theme here today.  There were a lot of people asking a lot of different questions and he had, from time to time, to try to deal with them comprehensively. Perhaps I could isolate this one point; in what manner does he propose to designate?  How is this designation to <Col N="498" /> be in fact a valid conferment of power on the body in question to render the service in question, so that that body would be able to thrash it out in the courts if necessary.  The establishment order, as I understand it, does not propose to contain the designation, or else there is no need for subsection (3), that all be contained in the power to make the establishment order.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how this designation process is to operate.  For example, if a body is designated any powers, is this designation to be made by way of order?  Where is this order to be found?  Is this order to be laid before the House?  Is it in the provisions for laying it before either House? Would the Minister consider the exclusion of this power to designate or the limitation of this power to designate, at least to bodies that are analogous to the authorities to be established by the establishment order?  Perhaps he could tell us how the provision for designation is to be exercised.</P>

      <P>The House is being asked to allow the Minister for Local Government to designate bodies who may benefit from the services of a corporate body.  By passing the Bill the House is enabling the Minister to establish these bodies by way of an establishment order which will be laid before the House.  If Members of the House so wish, they can propose its annulment and thereby cause the order to be debated and annulled, if such is the decision of the House.  During the debate it could happen that the Minister himself would agree to amend the order because there is power in this Bill to amend orders.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not proposing to challenge the exact legal position.  As I understand it, it is as the Minister says: he needs subsection (3) to designate other bodies to be entitled to receive the services from the bodies to be established under this Bill.  He has power, if granted to him under this section, to make an order under the Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries Act which will legally entitle the authorities to be established under this Act to go and render their services.  I want to get this point clear.  Am I correct in understanding that this is an operation which he can do subsequently to a debate in this House on an annulment of an order without this House knowing anything whatever about it, or anybody else knowing anything about it, and to render charges for the services? This is the point I want to know.  The Minister for Finance is required to approve and no doubt has special regard to the financial terms for the establishment order, to the provisions of the establishment order.  But the Minister for Finance, who is the person to look after the public purse, and the taxpayer, will not be in any way interested in, or quietly consulted about the designation of other bodies.  To get these services, to get the benefit of the Minister's phrase, to get the benefit of these services, we presume any benefit can include services without their being adequately or properly charged for, and are we to assume that the voice of the Minister for Finance will not be heard on that matter?  Is this incorrect? Am I to understand it to be, because the establishing order will, in fact, contain provision, or can it contain provision, requiring the Minister for Finance's consent to the terms of any order or designation?  I do not want to labour this as I am sure the Minister stated the law correctly.  I just wanted to know which law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position as proposed.  I do not see anything extraordinary in it.  The Minister will only designate those bodies who request the Minister that they be designated, who make a request for these services and, as has been the practice, these matters will not be done in <Col N="501" /> secret; there is generally some publicity given to any activities of this kind on the part of the Minister and there will be no question of its being done secretly.  There would be no purpose in doing it secretly.  This will be a public body seeking services from another public body and the Minister would be enabling them to obtain these services.  I do not see any difficulty on this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 4 (2) paragraphs (a) and (c), I note the inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;if the Minister thinks fit&rdquo;.  This is in relation to provisions for the application of the method of appointment being through the Local Appointments Commission in paragraph (a), and in paragraph (c) the provisions of the Act of 1956 in relation to the superannuation of officers or servants of the corporate body which might be established.  Whatever about having that phrase included in paragraph (a) in relation to using the Local Appointments Commission to appoint staff, I fail to see the necessity <Col N="502" /> for including the phrase in relation to the application of the superannuation provisions of the Act of 1956.  I think it is very necessary that there should not even be the provision &ldquo;if the Minister thinks fit&rdquo;: it should be clearcut that the superannuation provisions should apply to any officer in the service of any corporate body of this nature.  I do not see why any officers or servants appointed to serve that corporate body should not also be appointed by means of the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
      <P>In paragraph (f) we have the provision relating to the regulating of the body's finances and the keeping of their accounts.  The suggestion has already been made to the Minister on the Second Reading that that paragraph should also include the provision that the annual accounts of any corporate body set up under this Bill should be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  I think this would be a worthwhile inclusion in this piece of legislation and any similar type of legislation that comes before either House in the near future.  It is a good thing that the financial standing of corporate bodies, semi-State bodies and any other public bodies such as this should be readily available to both Houses of the Oireachtas and to members of the general public who desire to examine them.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The other point raised was about section 4 (2), paragraph (c), where the Minister is given power to make provision in an establishment order for the superannuation of officers and servants of the corporate body and, if he thinks fit, to provide for the application of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956, to the body as if it were a local authority. The words &ldquo;if he thinks fit&rdquo; are there simply to enable the Minister, in appropriation cases, to apply the Local Government Superannuation Act.  There may be cases where it should not apply. There could be bodies established to which it might not be appropriate to apply the Local Government (Superannuation) Act.  It could so happen, but it is intended generally that Act would apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This requires the consent of the Minister for Finance for the inclusion in an establishment order under the Act of any provisions relating to the appointment, remuneration, superannuation, <i>et cetera,</i> of personnel of a corporate body, and the payment of grants.  The necessity for this arises from the central role of the Minister for Finance in relation to public sector pay and personnel matters generally and to public expenditure.  He has a central role to play in all of these matters and must be consulted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally accepted that expenditure would arise mainly through the staffing of the body which is set up to provide the services.  It is those staffing expenses, in the main, with which the Minister for Finance would be concerned.  His consent would be necessary and proper in relation to the establishment of any body.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to provide for the regulation and control of the supply and distribution of fuels. There is no immediate need for the measures proposed; these measures are <Col N="506" /> purely precautionary and I would hope that the Bill, if enacted, would go into cold storage and that it would never be necessary to avail if its powers.</P>
      <P>In the light of what I have just said, Senators will no doubt wonder why the Bill has been introduced.  I should explain firstly that the decision to have the Bill prepared and ready for enactment at short notice was taken several years ago as part of an OECD programme of a general preparedness to deal with peacetime emergency shortages. This preparatory work, including the drafting of orders, permits, <i>et cetera</i>, was carried through by my Department so that controls could be introduced at short notice if the need arose.  I repeat that there is no immediate need but, because of the growing importance of energy sources in the economy and because of recent changes in the world energy situation, the Government have considered it prudent to have this Bill enacted so that the necessary powers will be immediately available if they are ever required.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned changes in the energy situation as the reason for this Bill.  These changes affect primarily fuel oil and coal.  Both these commodities, at fairly short notice, have become in short supply.</P>
      <P>The demand for fuel oil has been increasing rapidly in the western world. There are various reasons for this. There has been a steady growth in economic activity and industrial expansion. Fuel oil used either directly or as converted energy in the form of electricity is now the accepted source of motive power and heating for industry. Similarly, fuel oil is rapidly replacing solid fuels for domestic heating and with the growing standard of living the standards of domestic heating have been going up with consequent increases in energy consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This situation of increased level of demand for fuel oil has coincided with shortfalls in other energy sources.  The rationalisation of the coal mining industry in Europe has resulted in the closure of many uneconomic mines and an overall reduction in production.  The programme of nuclear energy stations for the production of electricity has fallen short of targets.  Reduced rainfall <Col N="507" /> in a number of European countries in the year 1970 reduced the production of hydro-electricity.  While there have been some gains through increases in the production of natural gas in Europe, this has, so far, had only a small impact on the overall energy supply position in Europe.  In the USA, which depends heavily on the production of natural gas, production has been lagging with consequent heavier demands on other energy sources.</P>
    <P>The combination of these circumstances gave rise to a greatly increased and unexpected demand for fuel oil and this situation has been aggravated by some fall-off in oil deliveries from the Mediterranean area.  The situation has been such that if the weather this winter proved very severe supplies would have had to be restricted to some degree.  Fortunately, the weather has, so far, been relatively mild.</P>
    <P>The scarcity of fuel oil has created an extra demand for coal particularly for power production.  This extra demand, combined with the reduction in the output of coal in Europe, has given rise to some concern about our coal supplies.  This country still consumes about one million tons of coal a year mainly for domestic purposes. We are now dependent to the extent of about 80 per cent of our requirements on European coal sources and other countries are competing sharply with us for the available supplies.  Unforeseeable circumstances such as a dislocation of transport facilities due to severe weather could in this tight situation lead to a shortage.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that the Bill also provides for the control of supplies of electricity.  We are now dependent on fuel oil for the production of more than 50 per cent of our electricity requirements and a scarcity of fuel oil could lead to a situation in which it would be necessary to ration electricity.</P>
    <P>Senators will, of course, realise that powers to regulate and control the supply of fuels would be of little use to us unless supplies are available to control and regulate.  Precautionary measures were, therefore, taken some <Col N="508" /> ten years ago to maintain, within practical limits, a stockpile to safeguard against a short-term interruption of supplies.  On Government direction, the Electricity Supply Board and CIE carry substantial reserves of oil.  The oil companies also carry reserve stocks and, in addition, we participate with other OECD countries in a scheme for control and sharing of oil products generally which would be activated in the event of a scarcity of supplies.  The coal trade in this country safeguards the supply position as far as possible by entering into long-term contracts and by diversification of supply sources and I am glad to say that their efforts successfully averted a shortage during a period of temporary supply difficulty last year.</P>
    <P>I should say that stockpiling of oils and coal is a very expensive operation and can only be done within limits without increasing prices.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I have outlined, Senators will, I am sure, agree that it is no more than prudent to be in a state of preparedness to deal with a shortage of fuel supplies if the need should arise instead of waiting until an emergency is upon us.  Enactment of this Bill would enable the Government, under section 2 (1), to declare by order at any time it considers that the supply situation warrants it, that the Minister for Transport and Power may control the supply and distribution of any fuel or fuels.  The Minister would then be empowered to make orders under section 3 (1) to control to the extent necessary the supply and distribution of the various fuels covered by the Government order.  Drafts of orders which would be made by the Minister have been prepared and they could be made at short notice.  In addition, plans have been prepared to facilitate the speedy introduction of a rationing scheme.</P>
    <P>Any order made by the Government would expire after a period of six months unless continued in force by order of the Government, and any order made by the Minister for Transport and Power would expire with the enabling Government order unless previously revoked by him.</P>
    <P>While, as I have said, there is no <Col N="509" /> immediate likelihood of a shortage of any fuels, the Government consider it wise to make all possible preparations to meet such a situation should it arise. It is for this reason that I recommend the Bill to the Seanad, but I repeat that the Bill is precautionary.</P>

In his opening statement the Minister said he was sure that Senators would agree that it is no more than prudent to be in a state of preparedness to deal with a shortage of fuel supplies if the need should arise instead of waiting until an emergency is upon us.  Taking that expression of the Minister's hope as being the principle contained in the Bill, there would probably be general agreement with regard to the principle of the Bill.  I find myself, having read this Bill in the situation&mdash;possibly because I am a lawyer by profession&mdash; quite appalled at the manner in which the Government have chosen to put themselves into this state of preparedness.</P>
      <P>It is generally bad that the Houses of the Oireachtas should consent without objection to any further increase in a system of legislation by Ministerial order which has become fairly prevalent. This legislation which is proposed to us now depends entirely on a Government order and Ministerial order. Not only does it do that but it provides in effect that the Government order, in the first place, and, secondly, any Ministerial orders to be made following the making of the general Government order, will all be made without consultation with either House of the Oireachtas.  It is provided that when the orders have been made they will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by resolution brought in within 21 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In legislation which contains some of the very drastic powers which are envisaged in this legislation that procedure is not adequate.  The Minister should ensure that any orders that will be made either by the Government or by him, as Minister for Transport and Power, will be brought before the <Col N="510" /> Houses of the Oireachtas before they are made.  That would not cause any inconvenience at all to the Government, having regard to the statement we have just heard from the Minister. He has made it quite clear that these orders, or a number of them, are already drafted.  Why does he not publish them now?  Why does he not, in conjunction with this Bill, let us see the orders, let us know what is in them?</P>
    <P>If we look at the Explanatory Memorandum which was circulated with the Bill, we will see that it is made clear&mdash;as indeed the Minister, to give him his due, made it clear in his opening statement&mdash;that the whole purpose of this Bill is to deal with possible scarcity conditions, possible shortages, which could give rise to difficulties.  In the first paragraph of the Explanatory Memorandum reference is made to short supply and in the second paragraph reference is made to short-term scarcity.</P>
    <P>Throughout the Minister's opening statement that theme was developed. Having regard to the background&mdash; and I accept that that is the background to this Bill&mdash;I find it somewhat surprising that the powers which can be brought into operation on the making of a Government order will deal not only with the question of short supply but under section 3 of the Bill enable the Minister to prohibit the import of fuels.  I could readily understand if power was to be taken to restrict the exportation of fuels which might be required in a situation of emergency as regards short supply. Section 3, subsection (2) of the Bill states that an order made by the Minister under this section</P>
    <P>may contain all such incidental or ancillary provisions, including the power to grant or issue such authorisations or licences....</P>
    <P>I am sorry, I am wrong there.  It is subsection (1), paragraph (b), the second paragraph which provides that the Minister may by order</P>
    <P>provide for the control, regulation, restriction or prohibition of the import or the export of the type or types of fuel to which the order under section 2 of this Act relates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> While the Minister has presented this Bill to the House, both in the Explanatory Memorandum and in his opening statement, as a precautionary measure to deal with a situation of short supply which might arise, nevertheless he is expanding the Bill so as to enable him to restrict or prohibit the importation of fuel.  What are the types of fuel referred to in the Bill?  Virtually everything one could visualise, including even firewood.  There is one omission, and I am surprised it is there, having regard to the fact that the Minister referred to it in his opening statement. So far as I can see there is nothing in this Bill which would enable the Minister to deal at all with the question of natural gas.  It may be that at present the sources of natural gas which might be available to us are either limited or untapped, but if a Bill of this sort is being introduced as part of our permanent legislation and as a precautionary measure it would seem to me that natural gas should be dealt with also, as well as the other types of fuel to which the Minister has referred.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister, in connection with the Explanatory Memorandum that has been issued, what type of consultation has taken place in recent years with other European Governments.  He has mentioned the question of the OECD approach to this but, referring to short-term scarcity, the Explanatory Memorandum goes on to say: &ldquo;Situations of this kind nearly arose on occasions in recent years&rdquo;.  I should like to know what those occasions were and how real danger was?  What state of preparedness, if any, were the Government in in connection with them?  Then the Explanatory Memorandum goes on to say: &ldquo;The Government, in common with other European Governments, consider it desirable to be in a position to act speedily if the need should arise&rdquo;.  I think that the Minister might give us some detailed information with regard to what consultations, or what advice, he or his Department have engaged in or received from other Governments.</P>
    <P>I have referred to my view, in any <Col N="512" /> event, that an opportunity should be given to Parliament to consider and, if necessary, discuss the orders that are contemplated in this Bill before those orders come into operation.  Section 2 of the Bill is the section which enables the Government, if they are of opinion that exigencies of the common good necessitate the control by the Minister of supply and distribution of fuels, to make an order.</P>
    <P>Section 2 then goes on to stipulate that any order made by the Government will have a life of only six months but it also provides that continuation orders may be made and that they may be made indefinitely under section 2.  While the initial order has a life of only six months continuation orders, and any number of continuation orders as may be considered to be necessary, can be made, all extending the life of the original order.  All that can be done without any consultation, good, bad or indifferent, with either Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann.  The only provision in the Bill to enable that situation to be reviewed is the provision for the laying of the orders before the Houses <i>ex-post facto.</i>  The thing has been done before Parliament gets an opportunity of expressing a view as to whether or not such an emergency situation as is envisaged by the Bill has arisen.  Bad enough as that may be, I think the provisions in relation to the orders that may be made by the Minister for Transport and Power, once the initial Government order has been made, are extremely drastic indeed.</P>
    <P>The Minister, towards the conclusion of his statement, referred to the fact that the order made by the Government would expire after a period of six months unless continued in force by order of the Government.  Then he said &ldquo;Any order made by the Minister for Transport and Power would expire with the enabling Government order unless previously revoked by him&rdquo;.  I wonder is the Minister quite certain that that is the position because there does not seem to me to be anything in the Bill, as introduced, which automatically kills a Ministerial order once the initial Government order has been made.  In fact it is solemnly provided <Col N="513" /> in section 3 that any orders made by the Minister will have the force of law. The orders which the Minister may make can be extremely comprehensive and can have far-reaching and continuous effects.</P>
    <P>Any contravention of these orders will, under this Bill, be an offence punishable with heavy penalties.  I wonder is it being suggested that, once the emergency situation which is envisaged has lapsed, once the Government order has lapsed, any aftermath of a Ministerial order is going to lapse also?  The orders which the Minister may make may provide for the regulation and control of the supply and distribution of the type or types of fuel to which the Government order relates.  They also provide for the control, regulation, restriction or prohibition of the import or export of those types of fuels.  Then it goes on, in subsection (2) of section 3 to provide that:</P>
    <P>An order made by the Minister under this section may contain all such incidental or ancillary provisions, including the power to grant or issue such authorisations or licences and give such directions as shall appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient for giving full effect to any provision inserted in such order under the powers conferred on the Minister by this section.</P>
    <P>Here we have a subsection which gives the Minister vast powers as to what will be included in his orders.  He can give whatever direction he likes.  There is no rein or check whatever.  There is no guideline laid down as to what course the Minister is going to pursue. There is no general statement of Government policy as regards fuel.  It is entirely discretionary to the Minister as to what type of order he may make or what type of directions he will give. There is no one, except the Minister, to judge to what extent the directions he may give are going to be regarded as necessary or expedient.</P>
    <P>Then we go along to section 4 of the Bill to find out what happens if any of the Minister's orders are contravened. Subsection (1) states clearly that any contravention will be an offence.  It says:</P>
    <P>Any person who contravenes <Col N="514" /> (whether by act or omission) or attempts so to contravene a provision in an order made by the Minister under this Act or in a direction, shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Therefore, you have an offence created if a person either by an act or omission contravenes either an order which the Minister makes or a direction which the Minister gives.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2), I think, could be summarised as the subsection which is intended to deal with a person who abets a contravention of the order. Subsection (3) deals with the contravention involving a ship or aircraft and provides that the person in charge of the vessel or the person who has its management shall each be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (4) deals with a body corporate and if an offence is committed by a body corporate it provides:</P>
    <P>Where an offence under this section is committed by a body corporate and is proved to have been so committed with the consent or approval of, or to have been facilitated by any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or other officer of the body corporate, the director, manager, secretary or other officer shall also be deemed to have committed the offence.</P>
    <P>In subsection (5) we go on to the penalties.  I want to call the attention of Members of the House to just what is being proposed under Section 4 in relation to the offences.  There is no provision in this section which stimulates that a breach of the Ministerial order or direction shall only become an offence if it is done knowingly by the person who is to be charged with the offence.  The person who contravenes a Ministerial order, or who acts contrary to a Ministerial direction, even though he does not know that the order has been made or the direction given, even if he does it quite innocently and accidentally, will, under the terms of section 4, be guilty of an offence and will be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100 or to imprisonment for six months, or both.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> I have referred to the subsection dealing with bodies corporate and which provides that, if an offence is committed by the body corporate and if that is consented to by the various officers, they also will be guilty.  I have no particular objection to that but it does not stop there.  It says that, if it has been committed with the consent or approval, or proved to have been facilitated by any neglect on the part of the various officers, then those officers will find themselves in the position of being guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>It does not need a lawyer to know that degrees of neglect vary considerably and what may be held to be neglect in a criminal matter, in a matter involving a technical offence, may be of the very lightest nature.  The mere fact that the secretary of a company omitted to open his post until the afternoon, instead of doing it as he normally would do in the morning, might be held to be neglect and in certain circumstances might make that unfortunate person guilty of an offence under this legislation which would render him liable to a fine of £100 or imprisonment for six months, or both. I would strongly urge the Minister, between this and the Committee Stage, to consider amending this section, or at least to make it quite clear that an offence will be committed only when a person knowingly contravenes any of the regulations made by the Minister or any directions given by him.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I think, pointed out that electricity is one of the commodities being dealt with by this order.  I want to ask the Minister to let the House know if this legislation providing for Government order and Ministerial order could be used, for example, if a situation arose again where there was an ESB strike, a strike of ESB workers.  Would the position be that this legislation could then be relied on? Could the Minister, in pursuance of authority given to him under section 3, make an order providing for the regulation and control of the supply and distribution of electricity?  Would the situation be that, without any discussion in the Dáil, without any discussion in this House, the Minister could <Col N="516" /> simply, by regulation, bring into operation all the powers which were brought in under the Act dealing with the last electricity strike?  Could he do that then without any Parliamentary discussion whatever?  It seems to me that the door would be opened for the Minister to act in that way if section 3 goes through unaltered.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the principle behind this Bill; I appreciate the need to be ready; I appreciate the desirability of protecting the public and acting for the common good if an emergency situation of shortage should arise.  But I feel this Bill will require very close and very searching examination on Committee Stage.  I hope that some of the matters I have mentioned now will be considered by the Minister between this and Committee Stage and that, on the Committee Stage discussions, if the Minister does not introduce amendments himself, I would hope that from this side of the House we would be able to discuss the sections in Committee and to put forward amendments which would try to achieve what the Minister has in mind and at the same time eliminate some of the objectionable features of the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Bill was introduced I was a bit surprised to find that we needed it, that in fact we could run into a situation here suddenly in which the Minister for Transport and Power or the Government had no powers to deal with the use of essential fuel resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his opening speech referred to the change that has taken place&mdash;which is, to say the least, startling&mdash;that we are now dependent to the extent of 50 per cent on fuel oil.  It is fairly obvious that, if any type of emergency arose, this area of resources, which is vital to the life of the community, should be protected and that we should be able to use what resources existed or were stored as sparingly as possible.  There is no doubt about that.  I have listened to Senator O'Higgins but I am sure that he would be the first to criticise any Government that failed to do this and that waited to call the Dáil or the Seanad together to discuss the situation that already existed.  Any intelligent person would <Col N="517" /> make provisions in advance to enable the Government to act in the public interest in a situation that could only be regarded as desperately serious, if it became necessary to use this type of Act.</P>
    <P>Of course we can discuss in Committee the relevant sections of the Bill. It occurred to me listening to Senator O'Higgins how would a supplier or a large holder know the position.  In all probability he would know because the emergency was there; the situation of shortage would be there and he would want to be deaf and blind not to know that it existed.  Therefore, if a person with a private interest, holding very large supplies were to do away with those supplies in any way it would be difficult to claim that he did not know. Perhaps Senator O'Higgins may have a point when he stipulates &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; in the event of prosecution. However, the Minister might consider some means of informing the holder of large supplies, if it became necessary. There could not be very many of them; this is a small country.</P>
    <P>The Government, considering the possible serious position created for the entire community in the provision of power for factories, homes, hospitals and so on if there were serious misuse of fuel supplies, should be in a position to see a very substantial fine, to act as a deterrent.  We are becoming more and more dependent on the resources which are imported, such as fuel oil.  I would certainly support the idea that the Government should be placed in a position in advance to deal with any serious situation that would arise.</P>
    <P>In the concluding part of his address, the Minister mentioned the question of rationing.  The only query I would put to him there is whether or not any form of rationing is in existence, because if the situation did arise the plans would need to be ready.  I do not see a great problem in relation to the ESB.  We had this experience many years ago where the Electricity Supply Board were operating a very efficient rationing system.  The Minister should have a right to require them to do so, although he should not need it, in order to conserve supply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="518" /> The Minister mentioned the demand on coal supplies.  We are not in a very strong position in regard to the supply of coal and fuel oil because our consumption is so heavy, and I doubt if at any stage we would have more than a couple of months supply.  It would, therefore, be essential to ensure that any stocks on hands should be conserved and used in such a way as to serve the community for as long as possible.  I am therefore supporting the Bill, although I may raise a few points on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister a few questions in connection with this Bill.  Senator O'Higgins has raised the point that the natural gas resources are not included in the definition of the word &ldquo;fuel&rdquo; in section 1.  Does the Minister intend to include nuclear fuels in the coverage of this Bill when they become relevant?  As time goes on, we may become more dependent on nuclear resources and this may take away some of our dependence on fuel oils.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to have a Bill dealing with shortage of fuel, but when the fuels run short, I certainly agree that they must be rationed but when they run short what will happen to this country?  Does the Minister think that because of the pressure of consuming countries on those which produce that shortage will not occur?  I am less optimistic. The present conference in Teheran outlines the division between the consuming and the producing countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will happen to this country? Our transport depends entirely on petroleum products.  Our industry, to a great extent, depends on petroleum products.  In 1980, I think 80 per cent of our electricity generation will depend on oil.  What is going to happen?  Have the Government made any provision in the event of an extreme and protracted shortage?  I was very glad to note that CIE and the ESB have got reserves, but how long will these reserves last?  What is the position on this?  It is a very serious matter and there should be more in the way of contingency plans than just a Bill to ration supplies, although this is necessary. <Col N="519" /> I should like the Minister to say something about this.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister intend to use the powers given him by this Bill in the event of industrial disputes?  There was an interesting situation recently during the Northern Ireland electricity dispute. Our electricity grid is connected to the Northern Ireland one.  That is a very good development and the link provides backing for the Northern system in the event of a shortage there and it provides for our system in the event of an electricity shortage here.  However, during the dispute in Northern Ireland the link was officially cut, not blown up by some enthusiast from North or South of the Border.  The Electricity Supply Board here did not wish to get involved in any dispute with its colleague organisation in the North.  I should like to ask the Minister how he intends to use the powers in this Bill in the event of an industrial dispute. These sorts of restrictions, these sorts of powers, are necessary but I should like more information on what would happen in the event of a major shortage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The action the Minister proposes to take to give him powers to regulate supplies and the distribution of fuel by order follows the OECD programme of general preparedness to deal with peace-time emergency shortages.  I wonder if the OECD have given any consideration to wartime emergency shortages.  We live in a world that is virtually continuously at war in some place or other.  It would seem appropriate here that consideration should be given to the possible effects of various local wars and to what might happen if they spread into larger areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has handled this matter in a somewhat haphazard manner. As he has told us, this is a precautionary measure.  He wants powers to regulate supplies of energy fuels by order.  No consideration seems to have been given to supplies of these necessary fuels.  In other words, the Minister has said, in effect: &ldquo;Look here, there is no emergency at the moment; this is purely a precautionary measure.  If <Col N="520" /> you pass this Bill, I intend to put the Act into cold storage until it is required&rdquo;. With all due respect to the Minister, and having regard to the rapid changes that have taken place in the world in regard to the use of various energy fuels, he should have gone very much farther in his capacity as Minister for Transport and Power to ensure that steps will be taken to provide, as far as is practicable, supplies of the necessary fuels, the most important fuels such as oil and coal, over the next decade.  I should like to see the Minister setting up some form of permanent committee or institution, such as a National Fuel Supply Council to advise him on the country's requirements of the various types of energy fuels over, say, the next ten years.  This council would be a permanent body; it would meet regularly; it would advise the Minister and his Department from time to time, as circumstances changed and as the needs of the country altered on energy fuel requirements for industrial, commercial, domestic and other purposes.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the storage of large quantities of fuels, particularly oil and coal, is a very expensive operation. I think the House would feel happy that the country should undergo these heavy expenses if it means that, in time of emergency&mdash;and, these days, an emergency can come very suddenly &mdash;the country would be reasonably well supplied with at least the most important fuels.  Today, oil is the most important fuel as far as this and every other developed or developing country is concerned.</P>
    <P>We have taken no active part, as far as I am aware, in the drive to find new sources of oil.  Apart from some minor participation by private enterprise interests, the Government have not participated, as far as I am aware, anyway, in any of the worldwide oil drilling programmes that are going on at present. Other countries, such as the United States and Great Britain, are not content to rely on the traditional sources of oil&mdash;for very good reasons. We have seen, as Senator West, quite rightly said, that already, in the midEast, supplies of oil are threatened due to the fact that the people who control <Col N="521" /> the affairs of the mid-Eastern countries are demanding a greater and greater share of the rewards from the oil won from their countries.  This situation could blow up into an emergency.  As a matter of interest and as we are talking about controls and storage, how would the country stand if there was an emergency as of now?  Have any plans been made for a continuance of supplies of oil from countries other than the Middle East and, if so, could the Minister give some indication of what these steps are?</P>
    <P>One obvious location for the storage of oil is the Shannon Estuary.  Storage tanks could be erected there at a comparatively small cost.  As we know, and as myself and other Senators who live in that area have stated time and again, the Shannon Estuary can take in tankers of over 200,000 tons at the present time.  It would seem a very obvious centre to store vast quantities of oil for use in the country.</P>
    <P>Has the country sufficient shipping facilities to ensure a regular supply of oil from alternative sources if an emergency arises or will we be faced with the situation that our ships are contracted out to other countries for moving oil when we need them closer home?  These various considerations should have been in the Minister's mind when he was considering bringing this Bill before the Seanad.  It deals in the short term, with an emergency situation.  It does not take into consideration the question of supplies of fuel.  It is merely a provisional measure to enable the Minister to make certain Orders.  The House would like to be assured that, if the Minister is likely to have to make an order suddenly, there will be fuels there to be distributed and that they will be distributed over a sufficiently long period of time.</P>
    <P>I regret there is no reference in the Bill, or in the Minister's speech, to joint action with the North of Ireland.  Senator West touched on that point.  Any action to provide for an emergency either in peacetime or in wartime should certainly be taken in conjunction with the North of Ireland.  None of us wants unilateral action in regard to the Twenty-six Counties if a serious <Col N="522" /> emergency arises that will affect supplies of energy fuels North and South. The Minister should seriously consider the setting up of a permanent council to consider all aspects of our energy fuel requirements.  Such council should include representatives from the North of Ireland.  The Minister should be guided by its findings and recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this most desirable precautionary measure.  The two factors which can most upset the normal life of the citizens of a State are shortage of water and shortage of fuel.  When shortage of water occurs in an area, the distribution becomes rather haphazard.  Sources are cut off for various hours and let on for various hours. Everybody can draw when it is on.  This of course is the best that can be done. With fuel, the situation is completely different.  Various people have stocks of it on hands and some can pay more for fuels than others.  There must be an orderly distribution.  The necessity for an orderly distribution can arise at any time.  It would, of course, arise in wartime but it can also just as easily arise in peacetime and it can arise for very many reasons.  The reasons may be natural.  There may be a shortage of water and motor power where water is used for motor power in other countries. It may be seasonal.  It may be due to war conditions with which we are not personally involved.  It may even be due to domestic conditions such as trade disputes.  In each and every one of those conditions the Minister and the Government should be empowered to take appropriate steps to ensure that there will be an orderly distribution of what is available and that what is available will be used to the best advantage in the interests of the common good.  Those circumstances may arise when neither House of the Oireachtas is in session and when it will not be possible to introduce legislation readily. Immediate steps may be required.  Possibly, consideration of these matters would influence Senator O'Higgins in the criticism he has urged that the Dáil and Seanad should be called together and legislation passed where something has to be done immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those circumstances, these various <Col N="523" /> views are needed for so many different things.  They have got to be put in order.  I do not give them necessarily in the order that is most important. There are considerations of transport, power, light and heat.  Those various views can be broken down.  There may be requirements for industrial purposes, for domestic purposes or for pleasure purposes.  It seems reasonably clear that the Minister could not give an indication in advance of the particular type of order that would be required having regard to the special exigencies of the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Did he not say that they are already drafted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>They are draft orders. But these draft orders are with so many blanks.  They merely specify&mdash;I feel sure&mdash;the type or form they would take&mdash;how you measure out priorities as between, say, industrial, domestic and pleasure users of things, and so on.  I do not think it would be possible to make the orders in advance.  Like Senator O'Higgins, I do not like legislation by order.  If emergency situations arise&mdash;if they can under any circumstances be justified&mdash;they would be justified in those circumstances.  Like Senator O'Higgins, I have some slight reservations regarding section 4 which concerns a person who contravenes whether by act or omission.  An omission may be deliberate: it may not be deliberate.  The problem arises as to when, how or in what circumstances an omission is committed.  I should like to see the word &ldquo;omission&rdquo; qualified there.  I do not know how it can be qualified.  Even &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;, I fear, would be an adequate word there.</P>
      <P>Likewise, section 4 (b), which reads:</P>
      <P>Where a person is convicted under this section the Court may, in addition to the various other powers it has, forfeit not only the goods or chattels used in relation to or by means of which the offence was committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There again &ldquo;by means of which the offence was committed&rdquo; can, in my opinion, be unduly wide.  Possibly we could rely on the good sense and discretion <Col N="524" /> of our courts but, at the same time, I should much prefer to see penalties set out precisely and with specific limitation.</P>
    <P>Again, in section 4 (4) &ldquo;or to have been facilitated by any neglect on the part of a director, manager or secretary of a company&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; could possibly be the neglect to sack somebody who was careless or neglectful at work and who does not draw attention to something.  The word &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; there would, in my opinion, need to be qualified.  There, however, are minor matters.  I should like the Minister to consider them.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is a piece of very wise legislation.  I welcome it.  I should like to see more legislation of this nature to provide against contingencies which can arise in various circumstances. This is one of the few I have seen; this is one of the first, in my memory, while I have been a Member of the Seanad. I congratulate the Minister on his foresight in introducing it.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell asked what the position would be if an emergency happened at the moment.  He will realise, I am sure, that if huge stocks are to be kept it involves the investment of huge amounts of money which is tied up.  It makes the fuel considerably dearer.  In industrial competition and in everything else the price at which fuel and motor power can be got is a very important factor.  Provided that reasonable stocks are kept by such bodies as oil companies, CIE, the ESB, I do not think unduly large sums should be sunk in stockpiling.  If unduly large sums are so sunk there is always the danger of loss through evaporation, seepage and otherwise.  Those are the only comments I should like to make on the Bill.  Again, I congratulate the Minister on its introduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before us has been introduced as a purely precautionary measure.  Yet, when we go fully into the Minister's statement we find many grounds for prudent planning. I agree with Senator Nash that the instrument itself is highly desirable to have in the case of an emergency. We know from the conference in Teheran, and others, that a fuel crisis could be precipitated at any moment, <Col N="525" /> even a crisis of relatively short duration, while there are differences over prices.  Consequently, we must be prepared for such a situation.  I shall look at a few such steps which we can take.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned stockpiling. A certain amount, within limit, is all right: it is rather costly.  When we talk about cost, we should bear in mind that coal is still a very important item in our fuel supply.  One million tons per annum are imported.  The time is opportune to have another look at our Irish coal supply sources.  Many of these closed down because they were uneconomic: there was no great pressure to keep them going.  I refer to Castlecomer, indeed, there are other Irish coal fields in rather serious straits. Money will have to be spent on stockpiling and, because we are so dependent on fuel oil, a certain amount could be spent on further development of our native coal resources.  Maybe a certain amount of that should be made the responsibility of some board; maybe a number of them should be nationalised or maybe some more broadly based national company should be set up to ensure their development.  It is opportune to take another look at this matter.</P>
      <P>Water is still an important part in this.  Therefore, under that heading, I ask the Minister if he is satisfied that the ESB are keeping their water stations at peak capacity; that maintenance, and so on, is adequate and has not been allowed to lag behind.  A diminution of water generating power, or a temporary reduction of it is of no consequence in the normal state of affairs.  But, when we are planning to meet short-term emergencies, our water resources provide a great means of stockpiling.  In other words, reservoirs can be kept at a prudent level.  We can ensure and the Minister can demand from the ESB that all their water turbines be kept in a state of preparedness: they must be at something over a 90 per cent efficiency goal level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to worries about our oil supplies.  Just two years ago, I was at an opening ceremony where we were, in effect, transporting an oil field from the Middle East and locating it in Bantry Bay.  We have in Gulf Oil tremendous stocks of oil but have we <Col N="526" /> any priority rights in those stocks?  If we have not, why not?  That is something into which the Government should look.  We sold much too cheaply to Gulf Oil and, furthermore, we have no rates.  We provided a tremendous set-up for them.  In the present situation, they are probably looking for expansion as well.  There was a suggestion of building some new tanks there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are having very detailed discussions along this line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We have a very strong card there if we play it right.  Let us now examine the question of conservation in the use of oil.  The Minister quite rightly mentioned the big development in central heating.  It is becoming quite a feature of life here. It would be well to try to ensure and advise that conservation procedures be adopted in the installations&mdash;proper insulation, and so on&mdash;to ensure an efficient system.  It is well to have the orders available because, if even a short-term crisis developed, prompt action would be required to ensure that what we had was equitably distributed and made to last out the crisis as well as possible.</P>
      <P>When considering what I would regard as a short-term fuel crisis, surely we have got to look at another source also&mdash;the possibility of a general electricity strike at any time. This could have a most crippling effect on the nation.  While it does not strictly come under the present Bill it is nevertheless the responsibility of the Minister for Transport and Power.  It is up to the Government to ensure a full supply of power.  Strikes should not be tolerated in our national electricity system.  It is up to the Government to rule out that even if it means that slightly differential wages have to be paid to ensure that this right of the nation to its electricity, generated by a semi-State company, is guaranteed.  We cannot tolerate strikes in essential services of this nature.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill not its precise terms as a belated recognition of the danger facing our country in common with the rest of Western Europe but, more particularly, <Col N="527" /> having regard to our resources, this country.  I say, and I doubt if anyone will dissent, that the availability of energy for production lies at the root of all modern economic development.  As there has been great economic development in Western Europe, in particular, over the past 20 years, there has been a greatly increased demand for petroleum products. This increased demand is likely to continue.  The petroleum-exporter countries are so organised, the ten of them, they are supplying 80 to 85 per cent of the needs of Europe.  Venezuela is able to put a 60 per cent tax on oil companies' profits and to threaten a unilateral increase in its posting of oil prices.  I understand that, in America, the oil companies control the gas companies and also control the coal producers. That being so, they are in a position to support the demand for extra prices by the petroleum-exporting countries.</P>
      <P>The <i>Times</i>, today, referred to negotiations that have failed: I agree with Senator Quinlan that this failure will not be of long duration.  This is a debate about price.  There are two very tough negotiating bodies engaged in the operations involved here.  We know how tough the oil companies are at this end.  We see how the oil-producing countries are becoming increasingly tough as they become increasingly aware of the strength of their position. The <i>Times</i> said:</P>
      <P>The negotiations, considered to be probably the most important development in the oil industry for twenty years or more,...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a situation which has been exacerbated by political traditions.  It would be an extraordinarily wise man who could make any prophesy in regard to political developments.  If I am not incorrect it is from the Middle East that we get most of our supplies of crude oil.  The ESB, Cement Limited and certain other producers also get supplies from Russia.  On a point that was made, I think, by the Minister in his opening speech, the very fact that the demand is increasing means that the sources from which we are getting our supplies, whether it be <Col N="528" /> oil, as in the case of Russia, or coal, as is the case of Poland, are under threat from demand from other countries.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that for the first time in 30 years the United Kingdom has just relaxed a 30-year ban on Russian crude oil.  That is an indication of the kinds of problems we shall be faced with.  This Bill, or something like this Bill, should have been under debate here months ago.  If that had been done perhaps we would not have gone through the situation that I think the public largely went through uninformed when we were faced with a coal shortage here before Christmas. At that time we were faced with a really serious threat.  We were saved, possibly, by the mildness of the weather.  The shortage arose out of political troubles in Poland: who says they will not be repeated?  The position was aggravated by the coal strike in Britain.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves whether the Minister has struck an entirely wrong note by the use of the words &ldquo;in cold storage&rdquo;.  I do not think this should be in cold storage at all.  It should receive constant attention not merely from his Department but from the various representatives&mdash;the people who are in-informed; the people who will tell you about the position of coal supplies; the people who import coal; the oil companies.</P>
    <P>What is the position about our refinery? I understand that one of the problems is a scarcity of refining capacity in Europe.  I know nothing of the degree or the capacity to which our oil refinery can be increased or if it is being fully utilised by the demand for the products here.  Senator Russell introduced a very good concept indeed into this debate and one which accords with my thinking and, I think, with something Senator Quinlan said.  The phrase used was &ldquo;a national fuel supply council&rdquo;: it does not matter what you call it.</P>
    <P>When we talk here about rationing, I think the basic thought lying behind this is to empower the Government, the Minister or some person&mdash;if scarcities arise&mdash;to speak for Ireland and to have the strength, going into the market, <Col N="529" /> of being so authorised and equipped with the best possible information and the best possible contacts.  The Department would have the co-operation of the oil companies who have got to live in this country in the future as well as derive their profit from it now.  They would also be assisted by the coal importers who know a great deal about their own business because, to survive, they have to know it.  The determination of priorities would be the secondary objective of giving the Minister the sorts of powers he has asked for. The determination of priorities can be and will be, if these critical days come on us, a very painful matter for a lot of people.  If I understand our national situation correctly, if we run short of crude oil there will be planning which will involve the determination that certain industries will be cut back.  We should think ahead of how this plan should be applied in such a critical situation.  Will we cut back capital intensive industries which would probably mean a cut back on our exports? Will we cut back on employment&mdash; which leaves a still more painful choice but one which, possibly, a planner would see should be made in our situation?</P>
    <P>This is not a matter for cold storage. This is a matter for a plan by people who understand the full range of our industry and its requirements&mdash; people in the ESB; people in the Department of Transport and Power; people in the business of supplying and getting the various fuels involved.  The leader of my party said, in opening for us this debate, that we shall propose amendements not with a view to depriving the Minister, because ultimately he must have the powers to do everything necessary to cope with an emergency situation.  Take, for example black marketing.  The best must be done for the country.  The Minister should not be dependent solely on advice from the excellent advisers, no doubt, he has got.  A cross fertilisation of the thinking of these advisers and the thinking of the other two types of people I see involved in this is necessary and desirable&mdash;people whose job it is to look after our industry and plan ahead for it.  The Industrial Development Authority I presume have a plan <Col N="530" /> ahead.  The Department of Industry and Commerce, no doubt, is in accord with that plan.  There are also the people who are in business in relation to this.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the definition of &ldquo;direction&rdquo; in section 1.  It seems absolutely outrageous&mdash;here I speak as a lawyer&mdash;that there should be any question of somebody being guilty of an offence because he has breached a direction which the Minister can give orally, not in writing.  By definition, the direction can be given orally as well as in writing.  In the past year or so many things were done orally that should have been done in writing and confirmed in writing.  Communications from Ministers or their authorised officials, should not be given orally but if they are given orally they should be confirmed in writing.  I end on that note.  It seems an important smaller point that I should like to have amended on Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to follow up Senator FitzGerald on that point.  I could not agree with him more that the word &ldquo;direction&rdquo; in this Bill has been given a very broad meaning in that it provides for anything the Minister may do, either orally or in writing, under power conferred and that a contravention of it by a person would be a criminal offence.  I should also like, in conjunction with this and following on Senator FitzGerald's words, to point to section 3 (3) where:</P>
      <P>Every Order under this Act and every authorisation and direction shall have the force of law and shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent with the Order, authorisation or direction contained in any Act other than this Act or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any Act other than this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this would be that the Minister could orally repeal or disregard earlier legislation or earlier orders. I do not think there is any precedent for this.  I am not sure if it can stand, on the face of it, that the Minister could orally by-pass the provisions of any other Act by simply giving a direction.  I mention this point; it may seem a minor point; it may seem a <Col N="531" /> point for the Committee Stage rather than this Stage.  However, I think it better to raise the point at this stage in the hope that an amendment will be put in either by the Government or by another person and that it will be accepted.</P>
    <P>I have no quarrel and I shall not take up the time of the Seanad in speaking about the fuel or coal supplies. I take it, from those who know much more about it than I do, that it is a necessary precautionary measure these days and a welcome one.  I should like to confine myself to talking about the provisions of section 4 which, I find, are rather typical of many provisions creating offences in statutes now in that they are very dangerously worded and appear to interfere with the liberty of a person by limiting their defences which they would be accustomed to under the law.</P>
    <P>Section 4 says:</P>
    <P>A person who contravenes (whether by act or omission) or attempts so to contravene a provision in an order made by the Minister under this Act or in a direction shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>The person does not have to do this knowingly.  He can do it accidentally. He does not have to do anything.  It need not be a positive act.  It can be merely an omission.  This goes very far in creating guilt, in creating a criminal offence, and, as I said earlier in relation to Senator FitzGerald's point about a direction, it can even be an oral statement by the Minister which can be contravened in this way, accidentally, by a person, on the face of that wording, and the person could be found guilty of an offence.  I wonder why the phrase, &ldquo;or attempts so to contravene&rdquo;. In the normal case, if a person cannot be found guilty of an offence he can be convicted of attempt if he has committed sufficient acts leading up to the offence to justify this.  If they are sufficiently related to the attempts to commit the offence, even though the offence itself was not actually committed, the person can be convicted of attempt, I do <Col N="532" /> not see why this has to be included here as a separate offence.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I should like to know why it is necessary under section 4 (2) to create an offence for a person knowing that another has committed an offence under the section who gives that other person any assistance with intent to prevent or hinder the detection of it.  Could this not also be left to the normal criminal law?  The problem I have with this Bill is twofold. The wording of it, in giving the Minister power to make orders and directions, is too wide.  The section relating to criminal offences unnecessarily interferes with the freedom of the individual. Otherwise, I welcome this Bill.  I welcome the fact that it is a precautionary measure which will not be used unless the conditions warrant it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just one or two queries to ask of the Minister. While I note that he stresses that it is purely a precautionary effort, I want to ask him if he can visualise in the future that the Minister for Transport and Power will be able to declare, for example, counties where the people, for domestic purposes, shall use only perhaps coal or turf or oil.  Could he possibly anticipate this in peacetime? I suppose it could be expected in a state of siege or war.  What is the present life expectancy of our turf supplies in the midlands?  For how long more can we expect peat briquette production, which is such a very valuable asset and so very popular with the householders throughout the country, to last?</P>
      <P>I should like to question the propriety of Government policy in exporting such large quantities of peat moss.  This is, perhaps, a national asset that we could use to improve lots of the very pure clay loams that we have throughout the country.  I should also like to ask if the Minister will have powers under this Bill to create smokeless zones or something like that in our cities and towns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been said here, this Bill is essentially an emergency Bill which we can have at the <Col N="533" /> disposal of the Government on behalf of the community in the event of a situation arising where the Government, on behalf of the people, have come to the opinion, as spelt out in section 2, that the exigencies of the common good necessitate the control by me, on behalf of the State, of the supply and distribution of fuels.  Flowing from that, the required order, to last for six months, would be made by the Government and renewed by the Government if necessary.  It would enable Minister for Transport and Power to take all necessary steps in regard to direction, control, regulation, storage and distribution of the basic fuels as set out in section 1.</P>
      <P>I would like to answer one query raised by Senator O'Higgins.  He raised the point about natural gas.  Natural gas is included within the definition of liquefied petroleum gas as set out in (b) of section 1.  Another point that has been made by Senator O'Higgins and some other Senators is that perhaps in the interests of natural justice the word knowingly should be included in the penal section.  That is a valid point.  I propose to bring in an amendment to that effect.</P>
      <P>I agree very much with Senator FitzGerald.  I am more for his approach than that of Senator O'Higgins in the general context of this matter. It is emergency legislation where the vital interests of the community such as jobs and lives, are concerned.  Legislation of that kind, which is only brought into being in an emergency situation, must of necessity be drastic. It is the type of legislation where one cannot, as it were, apply all the canons of ideal legislation in that it is quite simply an enabling Bill to enable the Government and the Minister for Transport and Power to take the most serious, drastic and draconian measures in a situation that warrants that type of decision making on the part of the Government.  In the ordinary course of events this legislation by Government order would not be justified but in this type of emergency legislation I feel it is fully justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say it was such an emergency that would require that an oral statement <Col N="534" /> by him, if contravened, would create a criminal offence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to come to that situation.  I think so.  It is the type of matter where immediate decisions may have to be made&mdash;decisions of the kind where an oil tanker in Bantry, Cork, Dublin or Waterford may have to be literally requisitioned at the drop of a hat and in a very immediate, definite and positive way. In that type of situation, the situation for which this legislation is designed, I feel the word &ldquo;oral&rdquo; is justified when one has regard to the exigencies involved.</P>
      <P>Another point was made about the inclusion of the word &ldquo;conservation&rdquo; in paragraph (b) of section 3.  I will give consideration to the inclusion of that in the definition, so as to read &ldquo;provide for the control, regulation, restriction, prohibition or conservation...&rdquo; It is possibly a good drafting point that can be considered between now and the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>What is happening at the present time is not just an Irish problem: it is an European problem.  We have already started discussions with the oil companies concerned with the supply of oil to Ireland with a view of guaranteeing us the maximum amount of storage of oil here.  We would hope to be in a situation to guarantee at least two to three months supply from within our own storage sources.  By our own I mean the storage resources within the community to be supplied by the oil companies, who want to ensure that, as far as possible, there will be voluntary arrangements of this kind.  Business discussions are already taking place in this regard.  But in the last analysis we want to have a measure under which tough and ruthless action may be necessary in the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall situation is not just an Irish problem; it is a European one. In particular, Europe is vulnerable in this respect in that it is almost entirely dependent on Middle Eastern and North African sources of supply.  For this reason it is essential to have legislation of this kind and all other western European Governments are now engaged in the preparation of similar <Col N="535" /> type legislation to meet a situation which it is hoped will not arise, but which is there.  The oil producing countries of the Middle East and North Africa are digging in their heels in regard to price and supply to Western Europe.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to make is in regard to natural energy requirements. Perhaps this is more relevant to the legislation which will be discussed when we resume, that is in connection with nuclear energy.  At the present time we are overdependent on oil.  Of the primary sources of fuel for energy requirements, oil accounts for 57.2 per cent of the total supply.  It is very important that we diversify our energy supply as much as possible. That is the whole purpose of the legislation that will be following in regard to nuclear energy.  At the moment we have a situation where we have become over dependent on oil as an energy source.  In the national interest it is essential that we have as dispersed and diffused energy resources as possible. This is a full justification for our whole turf development programme and our hydro-electric development programme.  It is all important that, as far as possible, the community is not dependent on any one source, but that we have a wide range of energy supplies.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Seanad that at all stages we have been very much in touch with the situation.  We are members of the special OECD Oil Committee. They have been meeting regularly, particularly in recent months, with this emergency situation looming. We are very much in contact with the whole situation and it is not one in which Ireland alone is involved.  Countries more powerful than ourselves, such as Britain, France and Germany, are even more vulnerable than we are. We all have a common interest in ensuring that (a) we make reasonable settlements with the oil producing countries, which we are reasonably hopeful will eventuate; and (b) in the event of such a reasonable settlement not eventuating, to have the appropriate legislative measures to deal with the storage, distribution, regulation and <Col N="536" /> organisation of our energy requirements&mdash;rationing, conservation, general organisation&mdash;so that in a given emergency we can derive the maximum utilisation from whatever oil, fuel or other resources we have.  It is a minimal development which we should organise as a precaution against a situation developing.  We wish to see these matters being worked out on a voluntary basis; that is why I used the phrase &ldquo;cold storage&rdquo;.  We do not want to set up any panic stations, but we shall have this legislation available with the drastic orders that need to be made under it in the event of steps being needed to be taken in the national interest.  That is the summation of the matter and I should like to thank the Seanad for their welcome of the Bill. We shall probably range to a wider degree over the whole energy and power field in the legislation which will be taken on resumption&mdash;that is the Nuclear Energy Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>When a method of producing self-sustaining nuclear fission was first achieved during the course of the Second World War its first application was to produce a devastating weapon of war.  Since then, progress in nuclear sciences and technology has made possible some revolutionary contributions to the material and humanitarian advancement of the world.  The most obvious example of this progress is in the development of nuclear power plants which are now, in many countries, providing a safe and reliable method of producing electric power in competition with traditional methods.  Research into atomic power continues at a very intensive rate throughout the world with the present emphasis on fission reactors fuelled <Col N="537" /> with natural fissile material generally in an enriched form.  The next development will be the production of commercial breeder reactors utilising as fuel virtually inexhaustible supplies of fertile material such as uranium 238. Further ahead is a prospect of controlled fusion which could give access to the potential energy in the heavy hydrogen in the oceans of the world.</P>
      <P>Apart from the production of power, nuclear science has made progress in a multitude of beneficial applications based on radioisotopes. These have been of great value in research, in medical diagnosis and treatment, in food preservation, in various agricultural uses, in quality control in industry and in the development of new products generally.  It can be said that nuclear science has contributed and will continue to contribute materially to the alleviation of suffering and hardship and in improving the lot of mankind generally.  Nuclear science has, therefore, a tremendous potential for good as well as for evil and the efforts of various international bodies have been directed more and more in recent years towards increasing the peaceful uses of atomic energy while ensuring the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.  I am glad to say that different Ministers for External Affairs of this country have taken an active part in these international activities. The bringing into force in the past year of the Treaty on Non-Proliferiation of Nuclear Weapons was a successful outcome to a resolution pioneered by Ireland at the United Nations Assembly in 1961.</P>
      <P>The development of nuclear power reactors is continually improving.  In recent times the more advanced countries have been able to commission nuclear reactors competitive in price with power stations based on the traditional fossil fuels&mdash;coal and fuel oil.  Nuclear power stations have very high capital costs with relatively low fuel costs.  The capital cost per unit of output decreases with overall size and hence the larger sized units offered the best competitive performance as compared with oil fired units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Experience in the electricity industry shows, however, that it is wiser not to <Col N="538" /> have too much generating capacity, say, not more than about 10 per cent of the peak load, concentrated in a single generating unit, because of the effect of a breakdown in a large unit.  Normally an electricity supply company increases its generatitng unit size in steps as its load develops, taking advantage of the experience already gained by larger companies in the size ranges chosen. Thus the Electricity Supply Board at present operate with 60 megawatt units as the largest size in a system with total capacity of about 1,400 megawatts.  The demand for electricity has been growing for some years at the rate of 10 per cent&mdash;11 per cent a year so that it is necessary to double generating capacity every seven or eight years bringing the probable capacity at the end of this decade to about 3,000 megawatts.  With this expansion, the capacity of the board's system to accommodate larger units than the present maximum of 60 megawatts, will increase.  The board will commission the first 120 megawatt unit in 1971 and the first 250 megawatt unit in 1975.  The most economical nuclear generating stations being planned at present are in the range 1,000 to 1,200 megawatts and upwards and, of course, there can be no question of commissioning any individual unit of this size in Ireland for many years to come.  Technical progress in recent years, however, is succeeding in reducing the size of a nuclear plant which can compete with traditional generating methods.  I am aware that some smaller countries are now commissioning nuclear plants in the 350-500 megawatt region and they claim that these smaller plants are both economic and competitive.</P>
    <P>With such small nuclear plants in operation and with the board's growing capability to accommodate larger units in its generating system the time has now come for us in Ireland to plan the commissioning of a medium size nuclear generating station which, on the one hand, will not be unduly large in relation to total generating capacity and, on the other hand, will be sufficiently efficient to compete with oil-fired plants.</P>
    <P>From a broad security aspect also it is desirable that the ESB should <Col N="539" /> diversify its fuel sources, since at present just over 50 per cent of total electricity production in Ireland is based on fuel oil and, without diversification, this proportion could grow to 80 per cent or so before the end of this decade.  Of course, the fuel for a nuclear station will have to be procured from abroad but we can claim that diversification by way of nuclear power stations will add to the security of the electricity supply.</P>
    <P>Senators are aware that there is an inter-connection between our ESB system and the Northern Ireland system.  This connection allows a saving in installed capacity on both systems while maintaining the same standard of security.  As far as a nuclear plant is concerned, the existence of this inter-connection will allow the individual size of a generating unit to be increased since the risk of losing one of the units can be covered by the insurance provided by inter-connection.</P>
    <P>For some time past, the ESB have been training a team of engineers on nuclear work and have placed men in training in Britain, Germany and the United States of America.  The team has now commenced drafting specifications for the board's first nuclear power station and I am glad to announce here in the Seanad that tenders for the erection of the station will be invited early next year.  It will, of course, be many years before the station can be brought into commission.</P>
    <P>The time has now come to set up an Irish Nuclear Energy Board to advise the Government on matters nuclear and to act as a licensing and controlling agent from the safety aspect.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a nuclear board has been under consideration at different times.  The Atomic Energy Committee Report, published in May, 1958 and presented to the Oireachtas, suggested that an Atomic Energy Board should be established with responsibility for the operation of a research reactor and for other matters pertaining to the development of nuclear energy.  In the circumstances of the time, however, the Government felt that there were very few advantages to <Col N="540" /> be gained by setting up the suggested board and acquiring a training reactor. A further Committee, the members of which were drawn from the Universities, the Electricity Supply Board, the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, An Foras Forbartha and various interested Government Departments reported in 1966 in regard to the setting up of a Nuclear Energy Board, and, in particular, in relation to the composition and functions of such board.  The recommendations of this Committee are incorporated in the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the primary functions of the board should be to keep themselves informed of developments in nuclear energy and associated matters with particular reference to the implications for the State of such developments, and to act as a competent source of advice for the Government. Particular functions being given to the board, as set out in section 5 (1) of the Bill, include advising the Government on the acquisition of nuclear reactors for training or research purposes and, if such reactors are acquired, on all aspects of their location, installation, operation and supervision. The board, if so requested by me, will advise on proposals for the construction of nuclear power stations and on all aspects of the installation, operation and supervision of such stations.  The board may be required to prepare draft safety codes and regulations dealing with fissile or other radioactive substances and irradiating apparatus, taking into account relevant standards recommended by international bodies dealing with nuclear energy and also, to act as the agent of the Minister concerned to ensure compliance with any such safety codes or regulations established or made by a statutory order.  The Board may be required to give advice regarding representation of the State on international bodies dealing with nuclear energy and to maintain such direct relations with such bodies as may be agreed.  A particular function of the board will be to promote knowledge, proficiency and research in nuclear sciences and technology and to act as an agency for the collection and dissemination of information <Col N="541" /> on matters relating to nuclear science.</P>
    <P>At this stage it is not proposed to assign regulatory functions directly to the board but provision is being made for the assignment from time to time of specific functions as agreed with the particular Minister concerned.  In this way, it is intended that existing arrangements should not be disturbed except to the extent that may seem desirable from time to time when the whole position has been examined.  The board will be able to offer expert advice to Ministers on relevant problems arising in their Departments and it will then be possible to decide according to the circumstances of each case what services should be made the direct responsibility of the board.  The specific functions concerned here are set out in section 5 (2) of the Bill and provision is made in the section for assigning such functions to the board from time to time by Order made by me after consulatation with other Ministers concerned.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of exercising complete control over the use of fissile or other radioactive substances and irradiating apparatus, section 6 of the Bill proposes that I may, after consultation with other Ministers concerned, make orders regulating, restricting or prohibiting, save under licences issued by me or by the board as my agent, the custody, use, manufacture, importation, distribution, transportation, exportation or other disposal of all such substances and apparatus.</P>
    <P>It is intended that An Board Fúinnimh Núicléigh shall consist of seven part-time members to be appointed for periods of office not exceeding five years.  The board will appoint their own staff.  I envisage that the initial staff will be fairly limited in number but as developments take place and additional functions are assigned to the board from time to time, this expert staff will be expanded to keep pace with requirements.  It is proposed that the board will be given an annual grant towards its expenses.  The board will be required to submit an annual report which will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>What it is sought to achieve in this <Col N="542" /> Bill, therefore, is to establish a board which will be a source of competent advice for the Government on all matters arising out of nuclear sciences and which will be given executive functions as required from time to time within the limits set by the Bill.  This procedure is necessary because, until we have the organisation to concentrate on the implications for us of developments in the nuclear field, we are not really in a position to make definite decisions about the board's functions.  When the expert advice of the board is available in the light of experience I expect that they will be recommending more exact definition of their functions and of responsibilities to be assigned to them on a permanent basis.  It has been the experience in many other countries that the passage of time makes necessary the introduction of amending legislation and I have little doubt but that when the board have been some years in existence it will be necessary for us to amend and expand the provisions set out in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I suppose one must welcome the fact that the Bill before us this evening has been initiated in the Seanad.  We are grateful to the Minister for bringing this Bill and the Bill that we discussed earlier this afternoon before us so that this House has managed to keep some sort of respectable performance.  However, having said that and without wishing in any way to be ungracious, nevertheless, I must say that some of the other features in the introduction to this Bill are not so worthy of favourable comment.  The Minister has introduced a Bill to us here on an important and complex subject.  Yes, with this Bill there is no Explanatory Memorandum which would have set the scene for us in regard to the Bill and enable Members to place the Bill in perspective and therefore make them better able to make a contribution on it. The Minister has mentioned that there was a report on the subject in 1958; he mentions also a later report of 1966. Unless I have overlooked this latter report, as far as I am aware it was not published.  So we have legislation introduced here on the basis of a report <Col N="543" /> which was not published.  There was no White Paper in regard to it and no Explanatory Memorandum. This makes it difficult for Members of the House to deal with an important piece of legislation like the present Bill.  Therefore, while we welcome this particular Bill so far as it has been introduced into the Seanad, the Seanad, in this particular case, has not been given as much an opportunity as they might to do justice to the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said in his introductory speech that we are concerned with the application of nuclear energy to human wellbeing.  This is something we should remember.  We are repeatedly told that we are living in the nuclear age, but in fact, as it were, live in two nuclear ages.  We live in the nuclear age in which the threat of nuclear war hangs over the whole of mankind.  But we also live in the second nuclear age in which those same forces that can create such havoc on such a scale can be harnessed for our benefit.</P>
      <P>It is hard for us to realise the pace with which these developments have been taking place and will be taking place.  We look back 50 years and find that the nucleus and its energy is merely a matter for academic speculation. Look back 60 years and the very existence of the nucleus itself within the atom was not known.  We look back to just 50 years ago and we had at that period cartoons of a little man with long hair writing on a blackboard capital E=mc².  People talked of Einstein's theories that only six people in the world could understand. Yet here was the germ of the power and the terror of Hiroshima, and of also the opportunities which lie before us and before every other country in regard to this particular line of development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said in his introductory speech, the physical realisation of these theoretical speculations was made during the Second World War under the pressure of war.  It was unfortunate that the first thing that the world at large knew of the new nuclear age was to read in their newspapers on a morning in 1945 of the complete <Col N="544" /> and devastating destruction of a Japanese city by a new weapon of a kind not known before.  Only yesterday, we read in the newspapers, that last year 70 people died from the effects of a bomb dropped 25 years ago.</P>
    <P>So, in a sense, it would be understandable if the attitude of the general public towards nuclear development should be conditioned by this background, this first introduction to the nuclear age.  It is true, to some extent, that there may be difficulties in regard to the question of development of nuclear power here, in regard to the siting of nuclear power stations, because this is what people feel in their inner consciousness.  Having first been introduced, as I have said, to the nuclear age through the horror of Hiroshima, the immediate reaction is to say &ldquo;We want none of this&rdquo;.  We find in many instances that the public attitude towards every aspect of nuclear power is to consider that nuclear energy is, as it were, tainted with the original sin that was incurred by its first large scale use at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, all the more incumbent that we should help the public and do all we can to inform public opinion that there is the second nuclear age: there is the nuclear age ushered in not by the monstrous bomb of 1945 but by the UN Conference of 1955 on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy.  To reject the nuclear age completely is to reject one of the most powerful means we have for improving living standards throughout the world.  It is easy to say that we want no more A bombs, no more H bombs, that we do not want nuclear fission or nuclear fusion, that we wish we never heard of it, that we want nothing to do with it.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to reflect that if we do take an attitude like this, if we take the extreme attitude that we wish nuclear fusion were banished from the universe, we are asking for the sun to be switched off.  We are asking for an end to the source of all our energy, the source of all our power, the source of all life, which is there in the nuclear fusion of the sun safely out in space, where there is no siting problem in regard to it.  Human progress throughout history has been a fitful and uneven <Col N="545" /> thing.  I am one of those who believe that, despite the inequity and the misery that remain, that human progress is a reality, that from century to century the lot of the average man has improved.  I believe that in this particular power which man has unlocked for himself we have the greatest contribution towards making the twenty-first century better than the twentieth.  Progress has been made by replacing physical human drudgery and this was done initially by drawing on the energy which was locked up in our fossil fuels.  These, as we well know, will not last for ever.</P>
    <P>In addition, the development of the industrial revolution showed clearly in the case of energy sources such as this that their bulk gave an immediate advantage to those particular areas in which these fuels were located.  If we are really serious as a world community in promoting the development of the whole world, we must recognise in nuclear power a source in which the fuel is readily transportable so that in fact, the economies of the use of nuclear fuel throughout the world and away from the sources should be much the same as those close to the sources themselves.  If we are to progress further, if we are to raise&mdash;and they must be raised&mdash;the living standards of the world, the power that is locked up in the nucleus of the atom must be drawn upon.</P>
    <P>In making use of nuclear power for the betterment of man, we can discuss it in terms of two broad uses.  Firstly, the use of the isotopes themselves in medicine, direct healing as well as in diagnosis, in applications in industry, applications in agriculture, in medicine &mdash;direct healing in medicine as well as in diagnosis&mdash;in applications in industry, in applications in agriculture and applications in scientific research.</P>
    <P>The second great peaceful use of nuclear energy is in the production of heat and in the production of power. Although the Minister has dwelt largely in his introductory speech on the problem of the development of nuclear energy, which apparently has been the immediate occasion giving rise to this Bill, I think it no harm that we should <Col N="546" /> look just for a moment at these other uses of isotopes.  There is quite substantial use in this country at the moment and this use will certainly increase, perhaps increase very sharply.</P>
    <P>I think it is only proper, therefore, that there should be a unified control of radioactive substances.  They have been used in agricultural research and development in this country but I get the impression that in industry the use of isotopes has been nothing like as widespread as it might well have been. Perhaps in this, as in some other things, our industrialists and their technologists are not as alive as they might be to these recent developments.</P>
    <P>At present, as I understand it, the control of the handling and the use of these isotopes can only be effected under statutes which were intended for more general purposes, many of them, indeed, drafted at times when radioactive substances meant no more than perhaps radium itself.  It is a highly unsatisfactory situation and, indeed, it is unsatisfactory that the condition has gone on so long and that in fact the control of these substances has been done in this particular haphazard fashion. We had, many years ago, a report of the Radioactivity Consultative Council established by the Minister for Health which reported&mdash;I am not sure of the exact date on which it reported, I think sometime in February, 1959&mdash; to the Minister for Health in regard to the control of radioactive materials.</P>
    <P>Eleven years have passed and yet the draft regulations, full draft regulations which appeared in the appendix of this report, have not to my knowledge yet been introduced by the Minister for Health or introduced in any other way.  We appear to be jogging along on the basis of control under quite general powers which the Minister for Health might have, under powers which the Minister for Labour has, which derive largely from the Factories Acts, and we probably find that our old friend the alkali inspector has some function somewhere along the line.</P>
    <P>I think this situation has been grossly unsatisfactory and therefore we can do nothing but welcome the fact that in this Bill there will be control of radioactive <Col N="547" /> substances on a central basis and as a result of expert advice.  There are points in regard to these regulations, indeed there are many points of detail, which I think are better deferred to the Committee Stage rather than discussed now.</P>
    <P>However, before I move away from this question of radioactive substances and the use of isotopes, there is one question that I should like to raise at this time.  There is not in this Bill a definition of radioactive substances.  I should like to ask the Minister why. Though the term is used in the Bill&mdash; there are references, to fissile fuel or other radioactive substances&mdash;we have no definition in the Bill.  I should like to know what is the reason for the omission of a definition here.  I think it is important.  There is a definition of radioactive substances in the Health Act of 1953, but it is a definition so broad as to be virtually useless.  The definition there defines as a radioactive substance anything natural or artificial that contains any radioactive material whatsoever.  This definition, in fact, makes the Minister a radioactive substance. It makes me a radioactive substance as well and makes every Member of this House a radioactive substance and brings us under the control of the legislation which we are talking about now.</P>
    <P>I think we should tease this matter out in a bit more detail on Committee Stage.  I would direct the Minister's attention to the fact that early legislation in Britain on radioactive substances was quite general in definition but in the later Acts, particularly the Act of 1965, the definition became quite specific and was made the subject matter of a schedule.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the main burden of the Minister's speech was concerned with the question of the use of nuclear energy for power purposes. By introducing this particular Bill at this stage, the Minister has initiated a public debate on the question of whether we should have nuclear power, whether we should have nuclear power now, what sort of nuclear power should we have, where should our power stations be situated?  As I see it, the arguments for and against nuclear <Col N="548" /> power fall under a relatively small number of headings.  The arguments in favour of nuclear power put forward at various times can be largely based on three considerations; on questions of economy, on questions of diversification and on the question of experience with nuclear technology.</P>
    <P>The arguments that have been brought forward against nuclear energy have, I think, largely been brought forward, firstly, on the basis of safety and, secondly, on the basis of amenity. When we have to weigh together arguments pro and con for an important decision such as this, on whether we should go ahead with nuclear development for power, we like to have as much information as possible, and so there is, I suppose, a tendency to postpone the decision until the last moment. In this particular operation, unfortunately, this is not possible because one of the very big factors here is, the long lead time that is required in regard to such decisions.  I have heard it estimated that the training time required initially is something in the order of four to five years and that the questions of design and the actual realisation of a power station is something of the order of five to six years.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it is necessary to make decisions to commit some resources of technical manpower some ten years or more before a nuclear plant is commissioned and comes on to the national system.  In this, of course, as the Minister and the ESB have kept us informed, the ESB have already committed certain resources in this direction and they have been commended in this House for their foresight in doing so.</P>
    <P>We are now rapidly approaching the time when a decision must be made to commit far larger resources and, indeed, to make the decision whether to go ahead or not.  It does not appear in the Bill but the Minister in his introductory speech talked of making the decision and going ahead something like 12 months from now.  My own estimate had been that the decision would have to be made within two years from now but apparently the Minister is advised that the decision is even more urgent than that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> So if this decision must now be made it is a decision of such a nature that it is not one to be taken by the Minister in isolation, not to be taken only on technical advice within the Electricity Supply Board.  It is, I think, a decision which must be taken in public, must be taken with as much information as possible being made available to the general public.  For that reason I make no apology for discussing at length the factors which are involved in this decision as I see them on the information available to me.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the first argument for nuclear power was that of economy, but were this the only argument in favour of nuclear power it is probable that we would not build any nuclear stations and it is quite certain that most of the nuclear stations that have been built elsewhere would not have been built.  I should like to quote from a paper entitled <i>Initiation of a National Nuclear Power Programme</i> read to the Third International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy held under United Nations auspices at Geneva in 1964.  Here is a paper on the initiation of a national nuclear power programme.  The authors of the paper are both consulting engineers of experience.  They state as follows:</P>
    <P>A decision to proceed with the construction of a nuclear power station would probably be made for one or more of the following reasons:</P>
    <P>(a)  Because calculations indicate that the energy produced will be cheaper than from any other source;</P>
    <P>(b)  because domestic sources of energy are becoming exhausted;</P>
    <P>(c)  To act as a deterrent to an increase in the price of conventional fuel;</P>
    <P>The last reason, on this particular day, when there is a threatened rise in oil prices, must commend itself to the Minister.</P>
    <P>(d)  To obtain operating experience and operator training facilities in anticipation of nuclear power being required in larger quantities in the future;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="550" /> (e)  To provide manufacturing industry with experience.</P>
    <P>The authors go on to say in the next paragraph:</P>
    <P>Almost no reactors have been built for reason (a) above; most were built for a combination of other reasons.</P>
    <P>I think we will find that the situation is the same in this country.  Since 1955 we have had continual expressions of hope that nuclear power would become competitive on a pure cold economic comparison with more conventional power systems.  If one reads the papers that have been published in the 15 years since then, one reads that nuclear power is not yet competitive, but that improved design, improved operation and reduced cost of fuel will in five to ten years make nuclear power competitive and more than competitive with the conventional plants based on fossil fuels.  These hopes have not been realised.  It has not stopped people continuing to express them up to the present time and we still see from time to time statements that in fact we must make a decision to go ahead now because in ten years time, by the time the plant is commissioned, nuclear power will be the cheapest of all forms of power.  I am not expert in this field but I am certainly sceptical as to whether these hopes will be completely realised ten years from now any more than the hopes of 1955 were realised.</P>
    <P>Certainly there has been an improvement in nuclear technology but this has been matched by improvements, not perhaps so spectacular, in the technology of more conventional power plants.  Nuclear fuel costs have not been greatly reduced and I think the only thing that has narrowed the gap&mdash;I admit that it has been narrowed&mdash;is in fact that, even though nuclear fuel costs have not been substantially reduced, conventional fuel costs have certainly risen.  I mentioned by quotation that one of the arguments used for nuclear power is that it will act as a deterrent to increases in the cost of conventional fuel.  We read in our newspapers today that there is a very serious possibility, a very serious threat, that oil prices, which are the fuel prices which we are concerned with in this country for <Col N="551" /> power purposes, are likely to rise substantially in the near future.</P>
    <P>Indeed, even if we did not have this new situation, we must realise that we have had in the past few years a considerable rise in these fuel prices. The Korean war led to a big jump in the cost of oil.  A slight recovery then occurred which was not completed when the Suez crisis put the cost of oil, not just of Suez oil but of oil all over the world, back up again.  In more recent times we have had disturbances due to political events throughout the world.  The Libyan coup, the Middle East crisis, all of these have been pushing up the price of oil and I do not think any of us will be sanguine enough to believe that the particular regions which we depend on for oil will have a happier political history, happier political chronicles, in the future than they have had in the past.</P>
    <P>So I think it is probably reasonable to plan for the contingency that nuclear power will be within sight of comparability of the cost in ten years' time. It may well be that I am wrong, that oil prices will rocket so much that nuclear power will actually be competitive. So while we cannot say at the moment, on the costings available to us at the moment&mdash;and I would say certainly not at the interest rates on which we would have to calculate at the moment&mdash;nevertheless in ten years time it certainly is a distinct possibility that nuclear fuel will either be competitive with the fossil fuels or that it will be very close to being so. Of course, we cannot be certain of this.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech mentioned the question of the high capital cost of nuclear plants which is, I think, something of the order of twice the capital cost of the same insallation in a conventional thermal power plant, though, of course, not as great as the capital investment in hydro plants.  If high interest rates of the order of which we have at the moment are to persist, if these are to be the rates which are to govern the installation of our first nuclear plant in this country, it will certainly have a great effect on its economy.  So if we look <Col N="552" /> at the arguments from the point of view of economy I think we can say that because we are planning something like ten years ahead we cannot see a clear economic advantage between a nuclear power station and more conventional stations.</P>
    <P>The second type of argument for, which I mentioned earlier, is the one based on the diversification of power supply and this has been touched on by the Minister in recommending this Bill to us this evening.  I think we tend to forget, in a way, how quickly we are growing in this country.  We tend to forget how quickly we are moving away from a power infrastructure which was managed by a few stations &mdash;hydro stations, peat stations and the few oil stations.  It does not seem much when we talk about the 10 per cent increase per year.  Inflation has taught us to live with figures of that size. But it is sobering when we come to realise it that whether we are talking about price inflation or of power of consumption, that 10 per cent per year means a doubling in eight years.</P>
    <P>We are now talking of the type of plant which will go on to the ESB system in something like eight to ten years from now.  When this plant, whose nature has to be decided now, actually comes into commission in the intervening time the power system will have doubled in size.  According to the annual report of the ESB, our hydro power has been largely developed, except for the special development of pump storage which will be complementary to nuclear power stations.  In the terms we are thinking of, our peat stations have a distinctly limited life. This means that from now on the dependence of our power system on one particular fuel&mdash;imported oil&mdash;will be far too concentrated to be healthy, either from the point of view of the operation of the ESB or from a general national viewpoint.</P>
    <P>We can always hope and pray that natural gas will be discovered in the Irish Sea.  If, in fact, any explorations for natural gas in the Irish Sea are successful, I would hope that the Minister and the Government will ensure that these deposits will not be exploited by private developers to the detriment of our power needs.  If there <Col N="553" /> are sources of natural gas close enough to be economic to come into our supply system, here would be a very welcome diversification, a diversification which would be added to that which will be given by a nuclear power plant.  In the case of development of this type I would impress on the Minister that it is of the utmost national importance that our national need in regard to power should not be neglected.</P>
    <P>We can take it as a matter of course that, after the year 2,000 A.D., the vast majority of power will be nuclear power, possibly backed by pumped storage systems with, perhaps, if the deposit continues to develop and continues to be brought in, natural gas. There is a tendency to say &ldquo;Let's wait&rdquo;.  The Minister spoke of the fact that only recently had nuclear power stations of the order of 350 to 500 megawatts been developed in other countries.  There is a fair amount to be said for the argument &ldquo;Let's wait until the year 2,000 A.D. Let's wait until 1990&rdquo;.  Or some people might say &ldquo;Let's wait until 1980&rdquo;.  In fact, we are at 1980 already.  In regard to these decisions, if we want to have nuclear power by 1980 we must make our decisions within the next year or so.  From the point of view of diversification, even if we are not going to get strictly competitive costs, we should move relatively quickly, which means moving now.</P>
    <P>There is also the argument of the gaining of experience, which was mentioned in the quotation I gave earlier. Training goes a certain way.  The training that has been done under the aegis of the ESB has certainly been most valuable.  But there is really no substitution for actual operation. There is no substitute for facing the job to be done.</P>
    <P>While we are talking about nuclear power it is not only the production of power which will be nuclear based from the year 2,000 on.  Heavy industry and our technology generally will be also nuclear based to an extent far beyond what we realise now, perhaps even beyond what we imagine.  There will be a need for a great pool of talent, of trained people here.  In this <Col N="554" /> regard the ESB can fulfil a necessary national function in leading in this particular field: in training people, in giving them operational experience. They themselves may not like to lose the trained people to industry, but this is a function which our semi-State bodies can well serve.  In this regard they can perform an extremely useful function, without being asked to do it in an exaggerated way.</P>
    <P>If we decide to move relatively quickly, it means moving now.  The Minister has indicated some of the considerations in this regard.  It is very hard to say, but it would appear that a station of the size of 500 megawatts is probably the lowest size likely to be economic.  We talk about ten years from commissioning, but decisions in regard to design will have to be made very early on.  When we start to design we are really concerned with the basic technology as it is known now, and developments within the next ten years can be added on points of detail but not on the basic technology.</P>
    <P>We should not move until we can build a station of perhaps the order of 500 megawatts.  If we were to build a station of the order of 200 to 500 megawatts, from costings such as I have seen this might well be about 40 per cent dearer.  This may be a little high but I have seen figures of this nature quoted.  The trouble is the great safety precautions which have to be taken because of the nature of the fuel being used, that these are a far higher proportional charge on the smaller stations than they are on the larger ones.  Why should we not straightaway say, &ldquo;Yes, let's build 500 megawatts. Let's go as quickly as we can.  Why did we not start building it last year?&rdquo; The answer to this lies in what the Minister has said this evening, that it is very bad practice in regard to an electrical supply to put all your eggs in one basket, as the Minister has said, to put more than ten per cent of your system into a particular plant.  We must have all read of the case in the United States where, due to load shedding and the passing on of a shed load from station to station, each of them tripping out in turn, this blacked-out the east coast of the United States due to the instability of their particular <Col N="555" /> system that time.  Adopting the rule of thumb which has been mentioned by the Minister, of 10 per cent, and if we take the figure, which I think it might be dangerous to go below, of 500 megawatts for a nuclear plant, we then would come to the conclusion that, in fact, until the system which we are talking about is a system of 5,000 megawatts, we should not commission a nuclear power plant.</P>
    <P>We want to ask ourselves when will our system reach this particular stage and here, of course, we have to be careful about what we mean by the system.  Mercifully we are not talking about the ESB system only.  Here we begin to see one of the advantages of the essential sanity of the agreement which we have with Northern Ireland in regard to the inter-connection of power supply.  Due to the agreement which has been made in this particular regard, when we talk of the size of the system that must be reached we are not talking only of the ESB system but because of the inter-connection and the backing up, we are talking, of the ESB system and the Northern Ireland system combined. This system is probably something of the order of 2,500 megawatts at the moment.  Therefore my estimate would be that we need a doubling of our present system.  Now a doubling of our present system in fact is something which is liable to come about in eight years at our present rate of increase of supply.</P>
    <P>That is why I reached the estimate that we must make a clear decision within two years, if in fact we are to have a plant on line in that particular time.  It is, of course, absolutely necessary that this must be planned in co-operation with the Northern Ireland electricity authorities.  There are arguments in favour of a joint plant and that discussions should go on this particular basis.  But there are also, I think, some considerations against this. The question of a joint nuclear energy plant is not the essential feature.  The really essential point is the fact of the inter-connection of the two systems, the ability to treat the two systems as a unit, and a willingness to plan the development of the two systems as a <Col N="556" /> single unit.  Given that, there are no overwhelming arguments against separate development.</P>
    <P>We may say that this may lead to difficulties.  If there is to be a nuclear plant in ten years time who is to have it?  Who is going to do it?  When we have made up our minds whether it is a good or a bad thing, it will affect which way that particular argument would go.</P>
    <P>If we look at the position, if we say that there is to be an atomic power plant in the North or there is to be an atomic power plant here, this does not mean postponing forever or postponing for another ten years another atomic power plant.  In ten years time when the first plant is commissioned, we are dealing with a system of 5,000 megawatts, growing at the rate of 10 per cent.  That is growing at the rate of 500 megawatts a year.  So we could, though it might be foolish, commission one atomic plant per year in order to keep up with the load without exceeding what I have taken, for the sake of argument, as an economic size of plant of 500 megawatts.  To do this would be, however, to go against the diversification which I have already spoken of. The question is that if the decision were made for two separate atomic nuclear power plants North and South, there need not necessarily be a delay of more than a few years between the two.  There would need to be coordination and a joint decision.</P>
    <P>The arguments, then, for going into nuclear power would appear to indicate that this would be beneficial, that it would be economic, or nearly so, and that there are other factors in regard to diversification, in regard to the national interest, in gaining experience in nuclear technology.  After all, in the past we have for national and for social reasons made decisions in regard to the forms of electricity production which were quite uneconomic and there is no compelling reason why we should not do this again for sufficient reason.</P>
    <P>The arguments against going in the direction of nuclear power, as I mentioned, were arguments based largely on safety and amenity.  Here people's ideas may well be coloured by the <Col N="557" /> original use of nuclear power.  Also they may remember newspaper accounts of such incidents as the Windscale accident and say we do not want that sort of thing to happen here.  I think it is important to point out that here cerainly was an incident at Windscale that was relatively serious, but Windscale was not a nuclear power station.  It was an experimental reactor.  Whatever was said about it publicly there is no doubt that Windscale was primarily operated for military purposes, and that only incidentally was there power production. It was not designed primarily as a nuclear power plant and, in fact, was operated in a far different fashion than any nuclear power plant which would be operated in this country.</P>
    <P>The safety research in regard to nuclear power is enormous.  Probably in no field of technology has there been such an extensive research effort in regard to safety.  The safety investment in nuclear power stations is extremely high and the record is, as far as I know, a clean sheet.  As far as I know, there has been no serious incident in any nuclear power station designed and operated for power production. If anything, a nuclear power station would be safer than the conventional power plant.  Because of the potentiality of the results of a serious accident the emphasis on safety is very much greater.  Because the fuel used is radioactive there is this huge investment in the shielding of these fuel elements and anything that is in contact with them.  There is the great investment and the whole structuring of the work and of the monitoring system in regard to it and, indeed, I would say it is probably decidedly safer to work in a nuclear power plant than to work on any of our building sites which we see round the city at the moment.</P>
    <P>The safety programme is largely concerned with this problem of the fuel. I take it that in any nuclear power development in this country all that we would be concerned with would be the importation of fabricated elements of enriched uranium.  I do not see any economy, I do not see any sense in any question of breeder reactors, any question of the enrichment of fuel here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Immediately.  The other possibility is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  We are only going to import fabricated elements for the moment.  It is very hard to know what the pace of development will be, but certainly in our first few power stations I would not see any development beyond the importation of fuel.</P>
      <P>The importation of these fabricated elements is certainly a troublesome business.  The precautions which have to be taken are very thorough&mdash;the precautions in handling them when they are imported and in transporting them.  We are talking here about huge power plants.  Perhaps we do tend to magnify the problem that is involved in fuel handling.  It is troublesome to handle uranium.  Great safety precautions are needed.  But the amount of material which would have to be handled, is, by the standards of power production, minute.  We must keep our sense of values here.  We are able to take tremendous precautions because the amount of fuel which we are handling is small.  One pound of uranium has something like the same power potential as three million pounds of coal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can think in terms of a huge power station which is fed on coal when we are dealing with one which is fuelled by uranium.  In the latter case the bulk of fuel concerned is minute.  I do not know if the estimate is correct but it has been said to me in regard to a power plant of the type we are likely to build that all the fuel required to keep this vast plant going, a plant that could meet something like one-third of the power we are geneating at the moment, would be equivalent to about one lorry load per month. The problem of safety in regard to the fuel, particularly of what is the most sensitive area, the transportation of that fuel from its point on entry to the power station and equally the return of the spent fuel, what we are concerned with here is taking precautions <Col N="559" /> with what is the equivalent of a lorry load once a month.  We must keep ourselves in perspective here.  These materials will come in special containers and the spent fuel will go out again in special containers.  I am subject to correction by the Minister here but I take it that in our first nuclear power station all of the fuel will be reexported to the supplier and that there will be no radioactive waste on site.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need for one drop of radioactive waste in the neighbourhood of the site.  The spent fuel will be returned, again in containers, for processing by the supplier. Our interest in regard to radioactive waste is our general interest in regard to the dumping which the suppliers will be doing out in the Atlantic, affecting our interests in other ways but not affecting the immediate vicinity of the plant.</P>
      <P>While many people may fear the siting of a nuclear power station as something to be resisted at all costs, in fact, if we go in this particular way there is no real need for anxiety.  On this question of the siting of a nuclear station there are naturally a number of requirements.  As always in regard to thermal power plants there must be a plentiful supply of cooling water. There must be adequate foundations for the very heavy loads due to the heavy shielding that is required in a nuclear power plant.  These are requirements for all modern power stations but particularly so in regard to a nuclear station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, of course, there should be no unusual safety hazards.  All of these considerations tend to put these stations away from large centres of population.  If there is a plentiful supply of water near a large centre of population it is being pretty well used up by the time we come along with our nuclear power plant.  On the other hand, we cannot really take the point of view that the thing to do with a nuclear power station is to put it as far away as possible.  There is no need for this.  If we did site in a remote spot it would create further difficulties because <Col N="560" /> we also want ready access to the plant.  It would be easier to transport fuel if the route is relatively short. Also, from the point of view of economy and convenient transmission of the electricity generated, it should not be too far removed from the main sources of consumption.</P>
    <P>There has been a very remarkable change in this regard in the last few years.  Recent plants in the United States, I understand, have been installed within ten to 20 miles of very large centres of population.  The development has been such with the nuclear power stations that people no longer have any hesitation in siting them them in this way.  I understand that the great German chemical firm &mdash;BASF of Ludwigshaven&mdash;put forward a proposal recently to site a nuclear power station within the town of Ludwigshaven which has a population of some three-quarters of a million. Planning permission was refused but the fact that this eminently respectable firm, which is the continental equivalent of ICI, felt that this proposal was feasible and reasonable indicates the extent to which technologists are now confident in regard to the siting of these nuclear power stations.</P>
    <P>Many people may feel that, even if there are no worries on the grounds of safety, large stations of this type present an amenity problem.  There is no doubt that every power station presents an amenity problem, as I am sure the Minister and the ESB well know.  It is interesting that it was recently reported that the Swiss, who are extremely conscious of amenities because their economy depends so much on tourism, have made a particular decision in regard to the nature of their power plants.  They made it on the basis of amenity.  They made it in a true Swiss fashion.  It was made as a result of decisions made at the cantonal meetings, this peculiarly Swiss form of participative democracy.  The decision was that there should be no more conventional thermal power stations because of amenity, because of the pollution problem.  Switzerland, conscious of its tourism, conscious of the problems of amenity, has decided <Col N="561" /> that from now on they will build only nuclear and hydro power stations since these two go complementary in meeting a particular system demand.</P>
    <P>So we have here a headline that the amenity arguments are by no means all on the side opposing the installation of these particular type of station. Reviewing these arguments, I can say that when the Minister comes to us and says he would like this Bill, that he thinks a board should be set up because now is the time for us to make decisions about nuclear power, reviewing these particular arguments, I have no option but to say that I agree with him.  I have no option but to say that now is the time because we must make the critical decision to proceed with our first nuclear power station within the next two years.  We will be missing an opportunity if we do not do this. We will be leaving ourselves dependent on a single source of power if we do not do it in this way.  But is what the Minister is proposing in this Bill the best way of doing it?  We should pause a little on this.  He has recommended that there should be a nuclear board.  This was recommended in 1958 and was not acted upon.  It was recommended again in 1966 and now over four years later, the recommendation is being acted upon.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, this is the best way of dealing with the subject.  It is as well that we should have a board of this particular type.  The Minister has available to him certain advice in regard to these problems but this is of an informal nature and it is proper there should be a board of this type. I am reminded of the occasion some years ago when, during a science exhibition which was held at the RDS, there was on exhibition a sub-critical reactor.  The question then arose if this should be purchased for training purposes. I was stopped in the precincts of this House by the then Minister for Education, the redoubtable late Donogh O'Malley, who said to me &ldquo;Jim, you are a fellow who could help me on this.  Do you think we should buy this thing or not?&rdquo;  I was horrified at the notion in giving a snap opinion on this that I would be treated by the Minister for Education as having <Col N="562" /> sufficient expert knowledge in order to come to a decision.  Although I miss such conversations with the late Donogh O'Malley, but it is safer to have a nuclear board to deal with such questions.</P>
    <P>We have here a matter of national concern.  This has arisen because of the need to make a decision about power, but it is not merely concerned with power.  The Minister needs advice beyond the advice available to him from the ESB.  We are not merely concerned with one use of nuclear energy or of the use of isotopes for one particular purpose.  Therefore, it is not sufficient, even at this late stage, for the Minister for Health to act in this particular matter, though he is of necessity concerned.  It is not just one Department of State that is going to be concerned with nuclear development and this country's journey into the nuclear age. It is not just one scientific discipline that is going to be concerned with this development.  It is not just one part of the country, one region, the area where we might have our first nuclear power station.  It is not just a matter for one local authority or one physical planning region.  A board which has adequate consultation with interested parties will give us a good way of doing it and is as good as any I can think of at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us gives us such a board and it defines the functions of that board.  I have some reservations. I wonder is the Minister wise in treating this board as a completely part-time board?  Is he wise in going ahead on this basis and is there not something to be said for perhaps the chairman being on a full-time basis?  There are, of course, arguments against this and these are perhaps best discussed on Committee Stage.  I have reservations in regard to some of the functions.  I have reservations in regard to some of the definitions and the omission of a definition of radioactive substances.  I am troubled about the definition of nuclear reactor and the question of whether certain types of sub-critical reactor will be adequately controlled by the new board under the definition which is in section 1.  Again these are matters best teased out in the informal discussion on Committee Stage. <Col N="563" /> The board the Minister sets up should be an expert board.  It should be broadly based.  There is no use setting up a board and stocking it with non-experts or, what would be even more disastrous still, stocking it with half-experts.  Having said that, it is probably time for this particular half-expert to come to a conclusion.  I would say in regard to the Bill that the Minister is rightly advised to move towards nuclear power now, that he is rightly advised to set up a Nuclear Energy Board at this stage.  He might have been better advised if there had been such a board prior to this but at least if we have such a board now we can define its functions in a proper fashion, and this will be an adequate start.  For these reasons this Bill is welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I must, first of all, congratulate Senator Dooge.  He may describe himself as a half-expert but he gave a most comprehensive lecture, if I may say so.  This is one of the occasions in this House when we can express our gratification that a major measure is being introduced in the Seanad.  The setting up of this Nuclear Energy Board is, as Senator Dooge said, not merely to do with a nuclear power station but covers a very wide area.  The decision to go ahead with it may be regarded as a decision for the future of life in this country to a considerable degree.  The fact that the number of Departments listed here&mdash; the Departments of Finance, Industry and Commerce, Agriculture, Labour, External Affairs and Health&mdash;must become involved in it gives an indication of its importance.  I suppose one can describe it quite simply as planning for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has to us, as a relatively small nation, the great attraction of expanding ideas and thought, research and training in science, especially for young people.  If this develops we will be able to offer opportunities in research and training to young people who at present have to go abroad to obtain this education. As Senator Dooge said, what is involved here is the peaceful use of atomic energy, the peaceful use of one of the great secrets of creation, the <Col N="564" /> greatest source of energy known to man.  When it gets underway it will help to bring Ireland in line scientifically with advanced countries and provide many opportunities.</P>
    <P>We had a debate earlier on the problems in relation to fuel and it is possibly a coincidence that we are now dealing with what should be the bi-product of this.  The Minister has indicated in his address that it is hoped to seek tenders for a nuclear station sometime next year.</P>
    <P>As has been said, our dependence on fuel oil, an imported commodity, has reached a level of 50 per cent of our total need for power energy.  What makes it significant to me&mdash;Senator Dooge has covered some of this ground&mdash;is the fact that, once you get a reactor going, the quantity of fuel it needs is so infinitesimal in relation to the output you get from it.  In fact, I gather that you can actually fuel a reactor for a full year.  In comparison with the tremendous tonnage being imported it is one of the great attractions to us apart altogether from problems relating to fuel both here and throughout the world.</P>
    <P>We know, for instance, that the Electricity Supply Board have reached their full capacity in hydro-electric generation and that our peat supplies have an anticipated life of 25 to 30 years.  At the rate of world consumption, what the supply of ordinary fuel oils is and what the reserve is nobody knows.  However, if there are no dangers in that area there are difficulties approaching us because of a shortage of power, as measured against the increasing demand for power. Again, the Minister and Senator Dooge have dealt with this.  The information available to me is, I am sure, based to some extent on hunches, but it seems that we would be able, certainly for the whole country, on a basis of 10 per cent of our fuel requirements, to utilise a 500 megawatt atomic station.  This seems, as I understand it, to bring it within some sort of economic proposition from the point of view of our community.</P>
    <P>As Senator Dooge said, the other side of the question is that the increasing <Col N="565" /> cost of imported fuel must ultimately catch up with whatever atomic fuel costs are involved and must eventually, I suppose, pass it out.  If we can, within ten years, erect a 500 megawatt station we are well on the way towards fulfilling our needs.  There is one aspect of this I would like to emphasise. It is a question which is concerning many of us at the present time and that is the question of capital cost.  There is no question of this being cheap.  It is estimated to be double the cost of ordinary electrical supply. It seems to me, and I think I have said this before elsewhere, that we in Ireland need to take a look at ourselves and at our habits of expenditure and consumption.  The increasing need for capital involvement in the development of a modern economy will not allow us to continue to use up our resources in the way we do as a community.</P>
    <P>There is one other side to this question of capital cost that we all know: whatever it may cost in the next five years to erect an atomic station here it certainly will not be cheaper to erect five years afterwards.  We all know that whatever you buy today you will not get cheaper tomorrow.  It is a decision that one would urge on the Government; they should go ahead with.</P>
    <P>I should like to express agreement with a remark of Senator Dooge in relation to the possibilities of any fuel resources being available to us around our coasts.  I think he mentioned natural gas.  If such fuel resources are discovered, in the nature of gas or oil, I would urge acceptance of the viewpoint Senator Dooge expressed: that the Government should be in on it, so to speak.</P>
    <P>There are good grounds, I understand, for the fact that foreign interests have exploited our mining resources but this is mainly because we have not got the resources to use the minerals. However, in the case of any natural fuels or minerals that might be discovered around our coast in the coming decade I would urge very strongly that we should exploit these ourselves.  I do not think there would be the same reasons at all for allowing outside interests to deal with them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" /> It is interesting to note that we are, and have been for some time past, a member of the European nuclear energy agency which is the agency from which we would purchase the fuel that would be necessary for atomic reactors.  It is also interesting to note that within the next 15 to 20 years two-thirds of the Common Market countries' fuel requirements will be coming from atomic stations.  This again is an indication of the importance of this type of development to a community like ours.  For a small country like Ireland, it is like taking a step into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Government and the Minister on bringing it this far.  I think a few words of appreciation might be said of the work that has been done by some of the committees mentioned, which include in their membership some of our foremost scientists, such as Professor Walton and Professor Fahy, and the scientific and administrative personnel of the Electricity Supply Board.  I wish this venture well for the future of our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo Senator Brugha's sentiments in welcoming the fact that this very important measure is being introduced in the Seanad.  If I may, I would like briefly to go over some of the background material which has been given to us by the Minister and by Senator Dooge because I think we want to keep firmly in our minds the scale on which we are working and the magnitude of the project we are talking about.  The estimated expenditure now would be at least £50 million.  In five years time perhaps it will be more, in ten years time it will be more than that, so we are committing ourselves to a tremendous expenditure and we want to have a pretty clear idea of what we are getting for our money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our growth in electricity consumption is 9 per cent per annum at the moment and this has the interesting result that we have, if it takes four or five years for generating plant to be commissioned and constructed&mdash;it is a normal period&mdash;to be planning at the moment to construct.  Fifty per cent of <Col N="567" /> our current capacity has to be under construction at any one time and our planning has got to be further ahead than this, so we really have to think very hard.  Our thinking now as Senator Dooge has pointed out, is directed to a situation ten years ahead, maybe 15 years ahead, and for that reason it is essential that a board of this sort be set up and put into operation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>We also, on several occasions, mentioned the problem of dependence on oil, too great a dependence on one particular fuel, the need for diversification of our energy sources, the economic factor.  I think that Senator Dooge made it pretty clear that economics is not the only thing that one thinks about when one is contemplating building a nuclear power station.  We should keep in mind the fact that nuclear research, to a great extent the type of research connected with the building of nuclear power stations, has moved from the era of pure science and pure research to that of technology, the main difference being that in technology the cost is taken into account whereas pure scientists like to think that they have infinite sums of money to play with.  However, the costing of these things is very important and we seem to be reaching the stage in which the power capacity of this country will allow us to build a single nuclear generating station which will not take too great a percentage of the total load and will also manage to produce electricity at roughly the same price as the electricity we are producing at the moment.  We would hope in the future, of course, to produce our electricity more cheaply using nuclear reactors.</P>
    <P>The Turlough Hill scheme, comes very nicely into the picture of nuclear generation of electricity because one of the main features of a nuclear power station is that once it is switched on you cannot switch it off.  You have a constant supply of current and so the problem of what to do with your off-peak current is dealt with by using it to pump the water for the pumped station up the hill during the night, when the load is lowest, and then the water comes down in the daytime, the <Col N="568" /> peaktimes, and you have a greatly increased capacity.  Therefore, these two systems fit together particularly well.  I have no doubt that the Turlough Hill scheme was designed with a nuclear generating station in mind.</P>
    <P>The ESB's objectives are to generate, transmit, distribute and sell a safe, reliable and economic supply of electricity for domestic, commercial and industrial uses, without an accumulating profit or loss.  The ESB are fairly well tied in their objectives and the Nuclear Energy Board is to be set up to, in many ways, assist the Electricity Supply Board.  That is to be one of its main functions&mdash;to deal with safety regulations, to deal with the main philosophical and other problems which arise in the development and siting of a nuclear station.</P>
    <P>At the moment there are virtually no legal controls on radioactive substances, already widely in use in hospitals, in industry and in universities. In the United Kingdom there are two separate Acts dealing with this. One, the Radioactive Substances Act, deals with it on a small scale, and the other, the Nuclear Installation Act, deals with it on a larger scale.  This, I think is important because when one looks at, to me, the most important section of this Bill, section 5, I feel that in some ways the nuclear board we are going to set up will face difficulties because some of its aims to my mind are not entirely compatible with each other.  For example if one looks at subsection (1) (a) and (b) the board is required to deal with all aspects of location, installation, operation and supervision of nuclear reactors and, under (c) are required to deal with safety regulations for the running of these power stations&mdash;in fact safety regulations to deal with the whole of the nuclear field.  These are not entirely compatible functions because, if the board is to advise on construction of nuclear power stations then it would be prejudiced when it comes to advise on safety regulations.  Therefore, I feel it would be better, as is the case of many of the European countries, if these two functions were separated, and a body set up to advise on construction and operation of a nuclear station and <Col N="569" /> another body set up to deal with the safety regulations, which are a most important part of the whole operation.</P>
    <P>There is another incompatibility in the proposed functions of the board; I think it is dealing with the macro and the micro sales at the same time. In other words, it is dealing with radioactive materials which can be quite small sources which one can carry around in one's hand and it is then dealing with the powerful huge sources which will be installed in the reactors.  The incompatibility here is not as great as the first case I mentioned, but again it has been the experience of other European countries that separate bodies should deal with the control of the small quantities of radioactive materials used in research, in hospitals, in industry and in university research, while another body should deal with the larger problems associated with nuclear reactors, whether they are for training or for power generation or whatever other purpose they may have.</P>
    <P>In section 5, subsection (2) (a), the board is to make arrangements for the supply of fuel and other radioactive substances as may be specified in the order.  This could lead to the board having a commercial interest, not just for gain, in obtaining the cheapest possible fissile materials.  This could conflict with the board's function in setting up safety regulations if the cheapest materials were not necessarily the safest ones.  I would ask the Minister to look at this problem.  It is an important conflict of interest.</P>
    <P>There is also a very important public relations problem here.  The setting up of a nuclear power station requires considerable public relations expertise.  As Professor Dooge has pointed out, nuclear generating stations are just as safe as the conventional type of electricity generating stations.  How are we going to get this over to the public?  That is the important matter and this is where public relations come in.  As I said, the arrangements for supply of fuel and the laying down of the safety conditions with which the Electricity Supply Board, who will be operating the <Col N="570" /> station, will have to comply, can be incompatible.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of those people who are going to commission the station, the Electricity Supply Board, it is vital to have a completely independent body setting up safety standards.  Clearly defined standards must be set by the Electricity Supply Board too for the contractor building the station.  They must say &ldquo;Now, we have to work inside these regulations. We want to see your specifications, so that they comply with these regulations&rdquo;. Then we shall have no safety problem or no problems in convincing the public that we are running a safe installation.</P>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board are to be commended.  As the Minister has said, the ESB have had a training scheme going on for some time.  They have been sending some of their engineers and physicists to work with firms who make and install nuclear power stations in various parts of the world.  This far-sightedness on the part of the Electricity Supply Board will result in our benefiting from the progress that has been made over the last 20 years in nuclear technology, and I feel confident that we shall get the best possible station to suit our particular requirements.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that another matter has not been mentioned in this Bill.  It is a very important problem and it is the question of liability&mdash; the considerable problem of insurance that arises in connection with nuclear installations.  We need to give the House some idea of the order of magnitude of which we are talking. We need to keep this large scale in our minds.  The European Convention specifies that the operator of the plant is liable for the first £5 million; from £5 million to £70 million the Government are liable; and from £70 million to £120 million liability is shared by the pool of countries that ratify this Convention.  I think that we are a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency and I think we are also linked with the European atomic authorities, but I think it is true to say that we have not signed this Convention. This means, among other things. <Col N="571" /> that, to give an example, supposing there was a major nuclear disaster in the United Kingdom which affected people in this country, we would not have any claim on the operators in the UK because all insurance policies, even the straightforward ones dealing with houses, fire, theft, have a nuclear exclusion clause in the small print at the bottom.  The agreement between the countries which sign this Convention is that they will not consider liability from persons or from institutions in countries which have not signed the Convention.  This problem of insurance is a very important one and I am disappointed that it is not mentioned in the Bill, as far as I can see.  I hope that it is one of the problems that the Minister will ask the Nuclear Energy Board to deal with.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Dooge and Senator Brugha, I welcome the Bill.  I hope that on the Committee Stage we can get some of these incompatibilities sorted out, such as those dealing with construction and safety, and those dealing with the commercial involvement of the board and the safety regulations which the board have got to lay down. I welcome the idea and I wish this project well.  We must remember that there is a considerable public relations problem in setting up a nuclear station and Members of the Oireachtas can all contribute towards informing the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>In his speech the Minister referred to the prospect of nuclear power stations producing 1,200 megawatts becoming economic units.  There is a power station near my home producing 40 megawatts.  But plants of the size now being talked about could carry most of the country's requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Voicing a farmer's viewpoint, I hope that in any expansion programme the ESB will try to use the existing cables that they have for bringing the leads to the different parts of the country. There are areas where you have those big pylons right throughout farms.  It would be practically impossible to change the route.  It stops people from building or doing any development anywhere <Col N="572" /> near those pylons.  I suppose we happen to be on a line between Dublin and quite a few of those high tension cables.  I should hate to see a whole series of them coming if this type of unit is going to be put, say, in the west of Ireland and stretching right out. Most of the power seems to have to come to Dublin, anyway.  With ones that size, I could see cables again coming, approaching Dublin.  I should like to see the minimum of cables coming to connect with existing lines. The question arises whether the cable will be able to sustain the power in question.</P>
    <P>It is wise to go only for 10 per cent of the peak load so as not to have to depend on any one type of fuel.  I was interested to note that we are inviting tenders in the next year or so.  I presume we are not too sure what the bad news will be until we get in some of the tenders.  We have not seen any figure remotely saying how much it will cost.</P>

      <P>It is a fair slice.  In the colossal need for electricity we are keeping in step with the world.  I suppose our national resources would not be sufficient to compete with or give the supply of electricity we need.  We need this extra amount.  It gives rise to the thought, in spending this type of money and where cables are carried over long distances of the country, that a very small amount of this could bring a lot of happiness to people in very isolated places&mdash;what we call the 4 per cent&mdash;and we should try to bring electricity to them.  I had a letter from a lady this morning because she had heard the ESB were recanvassing in her area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.  The Minister might convey to the Government that, in addition to providing money for this, they should also think of the rural community who are without electricity.  It would be a great service to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> Senator West mentioned safety factors in the nuclear power station. People in the area where it will be sited will be very worried.  I regret the Minister did not advert to this vital point.  Whenever a Minister or a public representative talks about a nuclear power station he should mention the safety factors.  It is not so long since there was some seepage trouble at Calder Hall in England which affected farmland in the adjoining area.  Such incidents tend to be remembered. Safety factors here cannot be mentioned too often.  I presume safety factors are uppermost in mind here.</P>
    <P>We are looking ahead.  By the time this project is in operation there may be a falling off in our peat supplies for the generation of electricity.  This would then take on the burden of increased consumption and also compensate for the falling off in peat supplies.  I presume some thought has been given to the question whether existing generators can be used when the bogs are cut away.  They would hardly be big enough for atomic power.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I trust the Minister will keep in mind those 4 per cent of our people who have not got electricity at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It brings to mind one very important omission in our legislation.  We are, I think, the only developed country which has no legislation whatsoever for protection against exposure to radioactive materials.</P>
      <P>As far back as 1958, a committee reported to the then Minister for Health and made recommendations to the Government for protective legislation. Unfortunately nothing has since been done.  I am glad to see in this Bill that at least the Minister may make orders to that effect.  The sooner those orders are made and given effect to the better.  At present, in this country, radioactive isotopes are constantly being imported.  They are used in hospitals, in research and, by manufacturing companies.  The Government have no way of being informed how much of them are in use.  I trust the Minister will take early steps in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> The Bill commends itself, I am sure, to the entire country.  It is obviously a step which, sooner or later, must be taken.  There is nothing to be gained by postponement.  It will not make electricity cheaper although we hope that, at some stage it will.  At the least, it will give us diversification.  It will be an added protection in the event of a breakdown of any section of the power system.</P>
    <P>I assume there is provision in the Bill for the appointment of officers many of whom will, no doubt, be research and technical experts.  Should that be the case, I should like to see provision in the Bill as in the appointment of those people.  The board should first have a recommendation from an independent committee of experts, in the nature of an interview board, who would interview the officers and recommend.  The board would not necessarily be bound by their recommendation but they would at least have the benefit of their advice. I congratulate the Minister on the various provisions and on the active steps he is taking in his Department with a view to the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I too should like to welcome this Bill and to make some comments on some of its content and the implications of the arrival of a nuclear energy power station in our community.  I was glad to note a reference by the Minister to the part Ireland played in pioneering the treaty on the non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  Whenever one hears the word &ldquo;nuclear&rdquo; it is unfortunately a sign of our times that most people tend to think first of all of nuclear weapons rather than of nuclear power stations. This field of disarmament is one in which I am interested.  This was one of the matters I immediately looked into.  How, for example, is the building of a nuclear power station connected with the manufacturing of nuclear weapons.  My bedside reading, at the time of the announcement that we were to have a nuclear power station, was a well known book called <i>The Year 2000</i> by Herman Kahn, a member of the Hudson Research Institute in the United States.  This book was recommended reading by <Col N="575" /> Professor Fogarty of the Economic and Social Research Institute when, some time ago, he quite properly called for more long-term looking into the future by Government Departments and commercial and other bodies in our State.  We tend to overlook this factor in planning matters.  We tend to plan ahead from day to day or our longest programmes tend to look ahead only five or ten years.  Particularly now, with the pace of modern technology, it is extremely important that people should at least try&mdash;though their basic information must be inadequate and a lot of it must largely be speculative&mdash; to look ahead and anticipate the sorts of affects that technology will bring to society.  I welcome in the Minister's remarks that the ESB are looking well into the future where the provision of power supply is concerned.</P>
      <P>In this book <i>The Year 2000</i> I was interested to see that it is reckoned that, in the seventies, a nuclear installation of around 500 megawatts will be competitive with a thermal plant.  This seems to be readily recognised by the ESB.  I was interested to find that each five to ten megawatts of electrical capacity can be used to produce enough plutonium each year for one small nuclear weapon.  I wondered if we might be entering the era when we would have our own nuclear weapon. I was interested to read the comments of Professor Fahy in the <i>Sunday Press</i> and to find that it is a lot more sophisticated than that and it is unlikely that we would have the resources to process the plutonium we would produce. If we enter the European Economic Community and particularly if we have arrangements with EURATOM for the sale or transfer of whatever plutonium we may produce, I for one should like to feel that we would not at any stage ever contribute to the production of nuclear weapons.  I do not know if this is a matter which can be dealt with in the legislation but I should certainly like some assurances in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of general comment I would have made has been covered earlier in the debate.  One of the things which interested me was that, when a power <Col N="576" /> station is built, land, for quite a large area around it, must be sterilised.  This is one of the steps taken to prevent danger to the community in case of accident.  The surroundings of a nuclear power station often can be a splendid bird sanctuary or nature reserve of some kind.  At a time when we are very conscious of protecting these resources here, even if this could be a small factor in the siting of a nuclear power station, if one could place it in a site of scientific interest from a natural history point of view, so much the better.  The land reserved or sterilised by the plan would not be entirely wasted: it would be a rich natural resource.</P>
    <P>The various points about safety and whether or not safety responsibility should lie with the Nuclear Energy Board have been fully dealt with.  I notice that the board will have some responsibilities, where research is concerned in providing information for research workers, and so on.  I felt that the board might, at some stage, become a funding body for some research. We have a National Science Council. It may well be financing research using radioactive materials.  Is it not better that the money devoted to research should be distributed by one body responsible for scientific research rather than cutting the cake, before the distribution starts, by dividing responsibility? I should be interested to know the relationship between the board and the National Science Council.</P>

      <P>I have not very much to contribute on this rather complex Bill.  A few points have agitated my mind and perhaps the Minister might, at some stage, be good enough to clarify the position for me.  Senator Keery suggested that perhaps this new sister board of the ESB might go into the conservation business.  I should prefer to see the ESB getting out of the fishing business and leaving the salmon for the fishermen and even the sportsmen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is as much as <Col N="577" /> I shall say on it.  I feel that these people should deal mainly with what they were set up to do.  Shall we have two boards supplying power?  I admire the ESB and indeed the personnel who work there.  They are highly efficient and give quite a good service.  If it is proposed to build a new power system and stations, why not leave all the work solely to the ESB?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has a broader connotation outside of power stations.  That is only part of the whole nuclear&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems, nevertheless, that at present, we have the turf-burning stations.  There is a queer relationship there between the ESB and Bord na Móna.  We are going to preserve this dual control or whatever we like to call it.  No matter what is said, it is extremely difficult to keep abreast of Government thinking.  In many fields of agriculture, in the dairying industry and in the pig industry, we have this rationalisation gimmick.  In the health sector, we hear a lot of talk about regionalisation.  Here, we are going into nuclear energy.  We have to set up a completely new board rather than allow the ESB, who are doing quite a good job, a subsidiary body or some council to advise them and to study the matter in depth.</P>
      <P>We must be the country with the greatest number of boards.  It has become fashionable to set up boards. We can have a new board at the drop of a hat.  It is difficult to see where there is complete co-operation between any two of these boards no matter what sector of our national economy these boards are set up to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, too, regret that the Minister did not see fit to supply us with an Explanatory Memorandum.  This subject is rather difficult for those of us not versed in technology or engineering. I should like to compliment Senator Dooge on the very fine way he treated this matter in his Second Reading speech.  I should not allow the opportunity to pass without thanking him for the great research he did, thus making things so much clearer to those of us who otherwise might not be able to grapple with the full implications <Col N="578" /> of the Bill.  I wish the ESB success and progress in the very fine job they are doing throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very thankful to the Seanad for the very excellent debate that has taken place on this Bill. I should like to emphasise that the fundamental principle behind it is the need to diversify our power supply resources as much as possible.  This is particularly evident when taken in context with the Bill to which the Seanad gave a Second Stage Reading earlier today.  That was the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Bill.  I emphasised during that debate that at the present time in the world there are very real difficulties in regard to coal and oil supplies.  Our resources in regard to power generation are now running ahead of 50 per cent in the oil sector alone.  In my view, looking to the future, this is a bit dangerous.  It shows an overdependence on one particular type of power resource and for that reason it is important that we develop a diversification into the nuclear field in which the ESB, through their excellent staff, have already made considerable investigation and, indeed, have advanced their investigation to the extent that they are now ready to proceed with the seeking of tenders for the erection of a nuclar power station next year.</P>
      <P>The difference in the scale of supply operations between conventional and atomic fuels is quite substantial.  I will give one or two figures to the Seanad that bear out what I am saying.  One cubic foot of uranium has the same energy content as 1.7 million tons of coal or 7.2 million barrels of oil or 32 billion cubic feet of natural gas.  One sees here the fantastic difference in scale between nuclear fuels as compared with conventional fuels to which we have been used over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be emphasised that, from the world point of view, oil is now a very important factor for industrial purposes&mdash;petro-chemical production, animal feeding stuffs, fertilisers, plastics, <i>et cetera.</i>  Nobody will thank the world if we burn up oil as a fuel and have no oil products in 50 years time.  Oil is too valuable to use for <Col N="579" /> purposes of fuel and the logical development of the world of the future so far as power resources are concerned is in the nuclear field.  In the long run the development of nuclear energy into the breeder-reactor field is going to happen.  If we achieve this on an economically viable basis from the power provision point of view, there will be available throughout the world virtually an inexhaustible source of power supply in that the nuclear reactor will vitalise other minerals into a continuing source of power supply that will continually enrich itself and be, what might be called, a permanent power supply source.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of future into which we are going.  In my view, pending the economic development of that, it is practical for this country to utilise our own resources such as our peat resources and our hydro-electric resources which will always be with us.  It is also feasible to develop the conservation idea involved in the Turlough Hill project in Wicklow and a further projected utilisation of water in the Comeragh Mountains which is envisaged by the ESB, so that we can have over the years ahead a balanced development of all the resources available to us.</P>
    <P>We are still a reasonable distance away from full utilisation in the nuclear-reactor field and in the meantime it is commonsense for us to utilise what other resources we have, such as those I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>We will have a permanent supply in the form of the hydro-electric and hydro-storage type of power generation and conservation, with the exhaustion over 40 years of our peat supplies and, over the same period, coal supplies throughout the world.  With the narrowing of oil supplies we are moving into permanent utilisation in the nuclear reactor field.  That is the picture which emerges.  In practical terms the ESB are moving towards a 500 megawatt nuclear power station which would cost in the region of £50 million.</P>
    <P>The planning for this station will begin next year in anticipation that it would be operational by about 1978. It is designed to cope with a situation where the demand for electricity has <Col N="580" /> been growing here at the rate of 10 to 12 per cent per year over the past four years, which is one of the highest growth rates in regard to electric power in Europe.  The thinking in ESB is designed to ensure that that sort of growth rate can be met by provision of generation of about 3,000 megawatts in 1980, which is double the present provision of 1,400 megawatts and the nuclear power station would fit into that system.</P>
    <P>I might mention here that as far as the nuclear power station for Ireland is concerned the recent agreements on electricity supply with the Northern Ireland Joint Electricity Authority is very relevant in that a nuclear power station would fit in with the joint transmission grid, irrespective of location.  We have a joint power grid transmission between all parts of the island and a nuclear power station will fit into that joint power grid transmission.  This makes commonsense and shows that, as far as Ireland is concerned, in the power sense and in regard to other aspects of activity under my Department, such as tourism, that Ireland is one island. All the economics of future development, as far as this island is concerned moving into the European Economic Community, makes still more sense of that particular line of thinking.</P>
    <P>One point I should like to mention&mdash; it was raised by Senator McDonald &mdash;is the question of why not have the Nuclear Energy Board functions operated by the ESB.  This Nuclear Energy Board will be broader than the mere aspect, the very important aspect, of power provision.  It will be concerned with education and training of nuclear scientists and technicians.  It will be concerned with safety matters concerning the protection of people from the possible evil side effects of nuclear reaction.  It will be concerned with a number of matters broader than the actual power provision itself.</P>
    <P>I feel that it is incumbent on the Government, and on the Minister for Transport and Power, to have available to them expert technical and scientific advice in the form of a Nuclear Energy Board of this kind <Col N="581" /> which can give advice across the whole range of nuclear energy and education and training in nuclear techniques. This particular board, I envisage, will be of the highest, most selective, technical scientific category.  The ESB, within the ambit of this Nuclear Energy Board, will in their particular field proceed with the construction of a power station.  But the Nuclear Energy Board itself will be on a direct advisory basis to me and I will be able to check, not alone the ESB, but the various educational establishments in the country, and the various developments in regard to nuclear energy and nuclear education.  I will be able to make checks on all of these matters over the whole broad spectrum through the aegis of a board of this kind.  I gave some thought to this particular matter and I am certain that this is the right way to go about it.  That is the view of the ESB as well, with whom I have discussed it.  The board of directors and management of the ESB see it in that light as well.  They have already engaged in considerable research and development themselves. They see their function as a power authority concerned with power development, of which nuclear energy is a part.  I see the Nuclear Energy Board as having a far broader function within which the ESB can proceed with their own particular plans.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="582" /> I do not think there is anything else that I should refer to.  There were a number of Committee Stage points raised which, indeed, can get a further airing on the Committee Stage debate. The Bill, as I have said, is designed to provide me with the best advice that I can get with a view to proceeding in this direction.  I want to say, in conclusion, that the main reason why there is not an Explanatory Memorandum with the Bill is my own particular anxiety to proceed with legislation here in the Seanad.  I felt that it was all important to get on with legislation here in the Seanad and to fully exercise the Seanad, as indeed the Seanad have expressed their view in this direction towards the end of last year.  For that reason we have both this Bill and the previous Bill before the Seanad.  I rushed the matter in order to give the Seanad a bit of work to do.  As a past pupil of the institution I felt that this was the right way to approach the matter.</P>
