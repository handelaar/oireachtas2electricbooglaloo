      <P>I propose an amendment as follows:</P>
      <P>That the Order of Business be Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

      <P>I should like to support that amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some weeks ago I stated that there was no particular urgency about the Bill which Senator Mrs. Robinson, Senator West and myself then sought to introduce.  Subsequent events have led me to revise the opinion I expressed at that stage.  I should now like to make a case for the inclusion of No. 2 on today's Order of Business on the grounds of urgency and specifically in three areas: legal urgency, social urgency and political and constitutional urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I should like to deal with what seems to me to be the legal urgency surrounding this proposal. Since discussion about this and the preceding draft of the Bill was inaugurated it has become clear that, firstly, there is considerable ignorance of the law of the land which extends even to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Secondly, it has emerged that there are, in all probability, a large number of people in this country who are at the moment in a <i>de facto</i> position of breaking the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, section 17, because it interferes with what they consider to be <Col N="1354" /> their human rights.  Any lawyer will agree that a situation which places the law in this position is a very bad one for the rule of law in this country, or in any country, and that it should be reviewed as a matter of urgency.  I am very glad to say that I can quote support for this contention from a very excellent speech made yesterday by a Senator on the other side of the House, Senator Neville Keery, and reported in this morning's newspapers and I quote:</P>
    <P>The extent of this law breaking has made a mockery and...</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to intervene at this stage but I would remind the Senator that he must confine himself to the question of whether this business is to be taken today. Accordingly, he should deal with the question of urgency which he has already raised and not the merits, which would be more appropriate to a later stage of discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully bow to the ruling of the Chair.  I am trying to make a point about the urgency of this Bill.  In making that point I was simply bringing in a certain statement which I do not propose now to read out in view of the Chair's ruling.  This statement, I believe, supports my contention that law reform in this matter is urgent.  Another point which might also be made in connection with the question of legal urgency is this.  If by any chance&mdash;I do not think it is possible to rule this out of question &mdash;section 17 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act was challenged in the courts and found to be unconstitutional it would give rise to a most serious situation for public order and morality in this country.  When determining the legal urgency of the measure which we have proposed we should take this into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second area of urgency I should like to mention, very briefly, is that of social urgency.  Again, I do not intend to discuss the merits of our proposals. I would simply refer the House to three relevant factors.  The first of these is the poll of doctors carried out by the <i>Irish Medical Times.</i>  The second factor is the horrifying statistics quoted <Col N="1355" /> in a speech last night by Dr. Paul McQuaid of the Mater Hospital Child Guidance Clinic and the third is the excellent speech made last night by Senator Neville Keery.</P>
    <P>I should now like to pass on to the third element of urgency which, I believe, is involved: the political and constitutional urgency.  This can be divided, broadly speaking, into two areas: national and international.  On the national level, I think the record shows that agitation of one kind or another&mdash;most of it very responsible agitation&mdash;for a change in our legislation has been going on for the last five or six years.  Secondly, the most recent statements, in my opinion, by bodies and persons outside this House have&mdash;I may be open to correction on this&mdash;brought into question the competence of this House and of the Houses of the Oireachtas to carry on their own affairs.  It is a matter of urgency for us, and the Houses of the Oireachtas as a whole, to show at this point that we are masters in our own house.  It is also true to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I must intervene here.  The only question proper to discuss is whether this matter should be debated by the Seanad today or at another time.  I must ask the Senator to confine himself to this point. The Chair has been indulgent in allowing him to introduce a certain amount of background but he cannot be allowed to dwell on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to the Leas-Chathaoirleach's ruling.  I should like to make one final point, if I may, on this matter.  I would refer Senators to statements, which I do not propose to quote, from resolutions passed by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1969 and the United Nations World Conference on Human Rights in May, 1968, both of which were subscribed to by our Government.  I feel that the inordinate delay between subscription by our Government to these documents and the enactment of suitable legislation is an argument in favour of the urgency of the present case.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment for the reasons given by Senator Horgan and also for another reason which I think is within the terms of the First Stage of the Bill. With respect, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, we are not seeking a debate today; we are seeking purely the passage of the First Stage of the Bill so that it may be published.  I think this is an urgent matter.  The subject has been discussed widely in the Press and debated around the country.  It is unfair that a subject should be discussed at this length without the people having knowledge of the exact terms of the Bill.  We, as Senators, have been distressed at the extent to which we have been misrepresented. We are distressed at the extent to which people are confused and, to some extent, worried at the possibility of opening the floodgates of the permissive society.  We feel that to be allowed to publish the Bill would curtail a great deal of misleading talk.  It would mean that the debate would be centred on the relevant subject matter of the Bill, on the strict control of distribution of contraceptives which it now contains, and on the issue, which is a civil rights issue, whether we, as an Irish community, can tolerate the practices of others in relation to practices which we might not condone for moral reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For this reason, which is relevant to the First Stage, I would support the amendment of the Order of Business. In making this point, may I say that it has been suggested that because the three Senators who have sponsored this Bill represent the university constituency we are not speaking for the people of Ireland.  Our answer to that is that we have been elected to the Seanad to work as Senators.  We have the right and the duty, if we see fit, to introduce legislation.  The legislation, when introduced, will go through the parliamentary process, which is a democratic process, and will be discussed.  We are seeking now the publication of this Bill so that the democratic process may take place.  We are not seeking to rush this process.  We are not seeking to put something through which the people do not feel they wish to accept.  We are simply seeking publication for the purpose of having a valid, constructive, relevant debate on the terms of the Bill. <Col N="1357" /> I, therefore, very strongly support the amendment to the Order of Business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this.  The amendment before us may be a technical question as to whether the particular item will be taken today or not.  I am not criticising either of the Senators who have raised this question but it is clear that to regard this merely as a technical question would probably be oversimplifying the matter.  Those who have views as to whether or not it should be taken would, within the Rules of Order of this House, be entitled to explain that if they felt there was any degree of urgency which would indicate that this item should be taken today, and if they felt disposed on that account to agree with the amendment that this Bill should be ordered for discussion today, they would be entitled to make it quite clear that by doing that they would not necessarily be supporting the contents of the Bill or even committing themselves to support the First Stage of the Bill whenever it is taken.</P>
      <P>I am speaking for myself now.  The only value I would see in this amendment would be to get the bloomin' Bill out of the way.  There has been far too much time taken up, far too much controversy on a matter which I do not believe is exercising the minds of a great number of people in this country.  I say that in particular to Senator Horgan.  We can show we are masters of our own House by dealing with matters which are really important. If there is a vote on this amendment, I will not support it, nor would I support the Bill.  I do not want to discuss this at length now, but it is relevant to point out that this is the first time this Bill has appeared on the Order Paper in the Seanad.  A previous Bill was handed in and did appear on the Order Paper.  Those who proposed it have now abandoned that Bill.  Another Bill appears here for the first time today and we are asked, as a matter of urgency, to set aside a particular Order of Business and to give this Bill a First Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not support the Government&mdash; nobody is in any doubt where I stand <Col N="1358" /> as regards that&mdash;but I think the Government and the Leader of this House are entitled, in a situation where an item appears for the first time on the Order Paper of the Seanad, to give it consideration and to decide their attitude with regard to it.  This should be said in fairness to the proposers of this amendment.  There are very substantial differences between what is now proposed and what was proposed before.  I am not in favour of either proposal, but in fairness to the Senators this should be said.  When that is said the consequences also follow that, with a radical alteration in the proposal which is being brought before the Seanad, the Leader of the House and the Government are entitled to consider the implications of that radical alteration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EvelynOwens" hpid="Miss Owens Miss Owens">
      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  I do for one reason.  I have been quite horrified at the amount of misrepresentation about the contents of both these Bills.  Normally I would agree with Senator O'Higgins's point that, as this is the first time the Bill has appeared on the Order Paper, I should not support this type of amendment.  But there are outside considerations, and we have all been shocked at some of the reactions to this Bill.  This is a subject matter which is alive in Ireland today.  There may be reasons for this, which I do not wish to go into.  We must be concerned about some of the movements which are going on, first of all, to defeat the Bill before it has even been discussed or indeed circulated.  In fairness to the proposers of the Bill, it should, at this stage, be circulated so that we can arrive at intelligent and democratic decisions.</P>

      <P>May I interrupt the Senator?  Are we going to have a debate on this?  I refrained from speaking in the belief that a representative of each of the parties wanted to make his position clear, but if we are going to have a debate on it that makes a big difference.</P>

      <P>The position is that Senator Ó Maoláin has moved a certain Order of Business.  An amendment to that has been proposed and seconded.  It is a matter for the House to decide what they want to do. On that point every Senator may be heard and, when no further Senators are offering, Senator Ó Maoláin will then conclude the discussion on this particular point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it I am in order. As I was saying, I do not doubt the good intentions of the three Senators who are promoting this Bill, but they have failed to make a case for the urgency of its introduction.  As Senators are aware, on 26th February we received a letter from Senator Mrs. Robinson indicating her support for a Bill which she was introducing under her own name for amendment of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935. Four weeks later we had a further communication enclosing the substance of a further Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 1971, sponsored by three Members of this House.  Notwithstanding the criticisms that have been made by the two Senators, three spoke in favour of the early introduction of this Bill.  Although they complain that they have been misrepresented in correspondence and through the news media generally, it seems to me that the dialogue that has taken place so far has caused the sponsors to amend their original ideas.  A further limited delay might result in more amendments, or a further amending Bill, and possibly supported by more Members of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I am not going to indicate at this stage what action I shall take when we finally come to consider a Bill.  In this regard I think that the Leader of the House should indicate a final date. This business has been handled wrongly.  The Bill should be withdrawn and the Taoiseach, who has indicated that he proposes to make a study of this complicated and highly delicate matter, should be encouraged to do so at the earliest possible date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Robinson appears to think that nobody in the country knows what is at the back <Col N="1360" /> of her mind.  She seems to forget that a tremendous amount of explanation of the proposals in the present Bill is available to the people, as a consequence of the interview given on Radio Telefís Éireann on Sunday by Senator Horgan and of the subsequent interview given last night on &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; by Senator Horgan.  As was pointed out here, this is not the original Bill which was introduced into the Seanad by Senator Robinson some weeks ago. This is an entirely different one from that which appeared on the Order Paper.  At that time I said that it was a matter which required consideration and I want to make it quite clear, in case there is any misunderstanding, that this is a matter having wide implications and one of great importance. It is one which could not and should not be approached in the schoolgirlish irresponsible manner in which Senator Robinson and Senator Horgan approached this, by the introduction of two Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

      <P>This is a very important matter which requires mature consideration and it will receive mature consideration from the Government and from the Fianna Fáil Party.  In view of suggestions which have been made, I want to state that we are not going to be rushed by any pleas put forward into doing a thing without considering the implications of our action.  We are not going to be panicked, frightened, rushed or pushed, either from the right or from the left, or through the media or by correspondents in newspapers, or by pressure groups.  Nobody can have any doubt that we will withstand any pressure of that nature.</P>

Until then I must object to the amendment and insist that the Order of Business stand as I have proposed it.</P>

    <Title>Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956 (Continuance) Bill, 1971: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956, which was enacted for a period of three years and has been renewed at the end of each three-year period, will expire on 31st March, 1971.  The purpose of this Bill is to continue the 1956 Act in force until 31st March, 1974.</P>
      <P>The Act empowers the Minister for Industry and Commerce to prohibit by Order the export of industrial goods save under a licence issued by him. Such Orders have a life of 12 months only and may be annulled by Resolution of either House of the Oireachtas at any time during this period.  Control is at present in force on a range of goods under the Control of Exports Order, 1971, and the Control of Exports (Southern Rhodesia) Order, 1970.</P>
      <P>It will be necessary to continue these powers for a further period and to enact the appropriate legislation.  Control continues to be necessary for the following purposes:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  to conserve supplies of scarce <Col N="1362" /> raw materials&mdash;for example, scraps metals&mdash;for the benefit of home industry,</P>
    <P>(b)  to ensure that strategic materials are not exported from this country to undesirable destinations or that this country is not used as a base for such trade from elsewhere.</P>
    <P>(c)  to implement the terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement which requires, <i>inter alia,</i> control on exports to the United Kingdom of textile goods containing cotton,</P>
    <P>(d)  to comply with the mandatory resolution adopted by the United Nations Security Council requiring member states to prevent the exportation of goods to Southern Rhodesia,</P>
    <P>(e)  to have immediately available a means of dealing with any emergency which might denude the country of essential materials before corrective legislation could be enacted.</P>
    <P>For the reasons mentioned I commend this Bill to the favourable consideration of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has said, this is a continuance Bill and there cannot be any serious objections to passing it through the House quickly. However, there are one or two points to which I should like to refer and perhaps the Minister might be good enough to deal with them when he is replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the necessity to conserve supplies of scarce raw materials, for example, scrap metals, for the benefit of home industry.  We would all agree that that is a very desirable provision.  I should like, however, if the Minister would give us some indication what effect this provision is having on the price of scrap metals in this country.  As we know, there is only one customer for scrap metals, Irish Steel Holdings, and it has been suggested that if scrap metal merchants were free to export scrap metal that they would be successful in getting a better price.  I do not know if this is a valid contention but perhaps the Minister could touch on this <Col N="1363" /> point in his reply.  It is obviously desirable that priority would be given to our own steel industry, Irish Steel Holdings.  I do not think any Senator would be in favour of any action that might leave them short of their raw material, scrap metal.  In that regard I should like to ask the Minister if, having regard to the fact that it is possible to import scrap metal into this country, is it not also possible to consider a <i>quid pro quo</i> arrangement whereby in certain circumstances scrap metal could be exported?</P>
    <P>The Minister also said these powers were necessary to ensure that strategic materials are not exported from this country to undesirable destinations or that this country is not used as a base for such trade from elsewhere.  I should like to ask the Minister what are regarded as strategic materials in this context and, as far as this country is concerned, what strategic materials are involved and what are undesirable locations?  Does this provision in any way interfere with the legitimate import-export trade in regard to any raw materials in this country?  What would be the position if and when we become a member of the Common Market? Can this provision still stand or, in the event of Ireland becoming a member of the Common Market, will these provisions all go by the board and will we then be in a position of not being able to harbour or conserve strategic raw materials for use in this country?</P>
    <P>Most important, to my mind, is the Minister's statement that these powers are necessary:</P>
    <P>To implement the terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement which requires, <i>inter alia,</i> control on exports to the United Kingdom of textile goods containing cotton.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was first introduced in 1956 nobody at that time anticipated the signing of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement and obviously no provision could have been made to safeguard against the results of that trade agreement.  I should like to suggest that the terms of that agreement, particularly in regard to the textile industry, the boot and shoe industry, <Col N="1364" /> and other sensitive industries, have worked very adversely as far as this country is concerned.  Are we to stand idly by and take no action whatever to protect the textile and boot and shoe industries, which employ a very substantial number of trained Irish workers?  I think that the terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement need to be radically revised.  There is, as the Minister is aware, a provision in the agreement whereby up to 3 per cent of the total value of imported industrial goods can be protected.  I would suggest to the Minister that the time is now more than opportune when that particular clause should be invoked to prevent further deterioration in the position of the textile and particularly the boot and shoe industries, which are located mainly in areas outside the city of Dublin and have consequently had a very adverse position in regard to employment in these areas. The trouble with the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement is that so far it seems to have had two effects contrary to what&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to the Senator that there is limited reference in this Bill and in the Minister's speech to the Free Trade Agreement and I doubt if it would be appropriate to open up a discussion on the general merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I wish to make the point that we in this country have been scrupulously considerate in carrying out our obligations under that Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement but contrarywise the British on a number of occasions have taken unilateral action to protect their own interests.  I feel that somewhere in this particular Bill, which seeks to extend and protect the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement, it should be possible to take unilateral action if necessary to protect our interests.  I will not develop the point any further.  Perhaps the Minister in his reply will deal with that point because it is one that is causing a considerable amount of concern in the country today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no option but to comply with the mandatory resolutions to which we subscribed in the United <Col N="1365" /> Nations Security Council to prevent exports to Southern Rhodesia.  I should like to ask the Minister what is the position with regard to exports to South Africa?  Does the same apply there or, indeed, to any other country, or is Southern Rhodesia singled out as the only country to which this mandatory resolution applies?</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill makes provision for dealing with any emergency which might denude the country of essential material before corrective legislation could be enacted.  I should again like to ask the Minister what are regarded as essential materials?  Is any national stocktaking carried out at regular intervals in regard to such essential raw materials as energy fuels, metals and metal products, grain, foods, <i>et cetera</i> which could be in short supply in the event of any sudden emergency?  I wish to make the point that, while this legislation is desirable, legislation of its very nature is slow to be put into effect; and it seems to me it would be closing the door after the horse had bolted if, in fact, a sudden emergency, like the one that happened quite recently in regard to the supplies of oil from the Middle East, were to happen and we did not have sufficient stocks of essential raw materials in the country.  Introducing legislation at that stage would serve very little purpose.</P>
    <P>In view of the measure of Anglo-Irish co-operation which is intended to be written into the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement is there any arrangement for joint action with the British Government in the event of a sudden shortage of essential raw materials?  I am sure that a number of Senators will recall the question of tea supplies during the last war when we were faced with a very serious shortage of tea imports due to the fact that up to the outbreak of war all our imports of tea came from British tea houses.  As soon as possible after the war legislation was introduced by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Lemass, to ensure that imports of tea came through Irish sources from then on.  I should like to ask the Minister what proposals, if any, for joint action exist for the sharing of essential raw materials between Great Britain and <Col N="1366" /> ourselves in the event of a sudden shortage.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there are any other points I wish to make and perhaps the Minister, when he is replying, will be kind enough to deal with those I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>I also support this Bill.  This creates the impression of rushed legislation.  The purpose of this Bill is to continue the 1956 Act until 31st March, 1974.  I notice that No. 4 on the Order Paper is a motion in the name of the Leader of the House asking Seanad Éireann to concur with the Government in a request to the President to sign this Bill earlier than the fifth day after the date on which the Bill shall have been presented to him.  To my mind, this is not the proper way to deal with legislation of this kind.</P>
      <P>We can all accept paragraphs (a) and (b) of the Minister's speech.  I was very disappointed, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, when you ruled out of order any references by the previous speaker, Senator Russell, to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement, especially when one of the industries referred to here, the textile industry, is having a very rough time.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that I was careful not to rule out references to the textile industry, with which we are concerned in this particular Bill, and to the general merits of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad we are allowed to say something on the textile industry.  As I have mentioned, this industry and those employed in it are having a rough time.  It is obvious that the effect is being felt because of the terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.  I am sure it comes as a surprise to a number of Senators, as it surprises me, that we are asked in this Bill to endorse something which is having such an effect on an industry on which so many people depend for their livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to paragraphs (d) and (e) of the Minister's speech, I am sure that when the 1956 Act was passed <Col N="1367" /> or even when it came to be continued at the end of the third and sixth years, there was perhaps no reference to Southern Rhodesia.  Like Senator Russell, I wonder why South Africa is not included with Southern Rhodesia.  This again appears to show the influence the United Kingdom have with the United Nations inasmuch as pressures can be put on a country because they happen to declare a UDI or, in other words, disturb the relations they had with the British Commonwealth. Having said that, it is only right and proper that the Minister should be given these powers, especially in relation to (a) and (b), to conserve supplies of scarce raw materials for the benefit of home industry and to ensure that strategic materials are not exported from this country to undesirable destinations or that this country is not used as a base for such trade from elsewhere.</P>

      <P>Senator Russell rightly pointed out that this is continuance legislation merely ensuring that the original Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956, would be operative over the next three years.  This is something the House should bear in mind.  This is enabling legislation to continue something that has already been in existence for quite some time. The House is not being asked to create some new type of situation.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it might be as well for me to comment on Senator J. Fitzgerald's reference to rushed legislation.  Because the Seanad did not sit last week, I asked the Leader of the House to put No. 4 on the Order Paper because the Act expires on 31st March.  I was rather worried during the course of the earlier discussion on the Order of Business that something might happen that would have prevented the Act being continued.  It would have been improper of me to intervene at that Stage, as the Seanad will appreciate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act has not been changed.  Both Senator Russell and Senator Fitzgerald appreciated the necessity for maintaining this legislation in order to conserve our scarce raw materials.  Senator Russell raised the question of the price of scrap.  It is a fact that, due to the monopoly that exists here whereby Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. are the sole users of scrap, the price of scrap here is cheaper than it is across the water.  This is part and parcel of why Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. are economically successful at present. Certainly, if the export of scrap were to be allowed, scrap dealers would get a higher price in the UK with the result that Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. would need to seek supplies from abroad and would be placed in a situation whereby they would be less competitive and certainly more vulnerable and less successful than they are at present.</P>
      <P>As Senator Russell knows&mdash;he contributed to the debate in the House recently on Irish Steel Holdings&mdash;it is an expanding industry and going reasonably well at present.  The Senator spoke about the price of scrap.  There has been criticism about variations in the price paid by Irish Steel Holdings to various clients.  This is a matter which has now been referred to the Fair Trade Commission and I understand that the parties who referred this matter to the Commission have been notified that it is expected that investigations into their complaints in this regard will commence in two to three months time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to this question of strategic materials, the necessity for the regulations as spelled out in (b) is not too obvious, but there is a long list of strategic materials which are agreed on an international basis. We have firms like Irish Explosives Limited, Enfield, and Core Memories Limited, Coolock, turning out items which come under that heading.  It is necessary to have enabling legislation to prevent the export of some of their produce to undesirable countries.  This ties in with paragraph (d) where we comply with the mandatory resolution adopted by the United Nations Security Council in 1968 requiring all member <Col N="1369" /> states to prevent the export of goods to Southern Rhodesia and, as far as strategic goods are concerned, to South Africa.</P>
    <P>It was perhaps a little unfair of Senator Fitzgerald to talk about the influence of the UK in this regard If we are members of the United Nations it is only right that we should abide by their rules.  Our own representatives contributed to the debate on that resolution.  Therefore, it is only right that we should adhere to it. Again in 1963 and in 1964 resolutions were passed by the United Nations Security Council calling on all member states to prohibit the sale and shipment of arms and military supplies to South Africa.  This is covered in the provision ensuring that strategic materials are not exported from this country to undesirable destinations.</P>
    <P>The legislation is broad and goes beyond the points dealt with here.  I refer Senators to section 2 (2) of the principal Act, the Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956, under which the Minister:</P>
    <P>may after consultation with the Minister for External Affairs, by order prohibit, subject to such exceptions, if any, as he may think proper, the exportation of goods of any specified description to a specified destination, save under and, in accordance with, a licence</P>
    <P>This section is so broadly based that it enables the Minister to take any action at short notice.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell referred to a continuous survey and instanced the case of the State moving in to prevent the export of oil in a given situation.  That section of the Act covers the point I made in paragraph (e) of my speech:</P>
    <P>to have immediately available a means of dealing with any emergency which might denude the country of essential materials before corrective legislation could be enacted</P>
    <P>The 1956 Bill was prepared on the basis of its being a Temporary Provisions Bill lasting for three years.  A Bill similar to the one before the House had to come up again in 1959, 1962, 1965, 1968.  As I said, the Act continued in force for a period of three years and then expires.  This is why it is necessary <Col N="1370" /> for me to get this Bill through completely this evening.  Reference was made to the provision in the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement providing control on exports to the United Kingdom of textile goods containing cotton.  This arrangement ensures a guaranteed market for our producers for a certain amount of cotton exports. If we had not this arrangement, it is possible and likely that the volume of exports of our goods containing cotton might be less than it is at present.  It is a satisfactory arrangement from our point of view and we are anxious to maintain it.  Of course, there is a wider issue in regard to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  Both Senator Russell and Senator Fitzgerald spoke about the effects of the agreement on our exports.  The Government do not agree with the general case being made by the Opposition, who are blaming the recession in exports on the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  But, in deference to the Leas-Chathaoirleach's ruling, I do not wish to involve myself in a debate on that subject which does not come within the ambit of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with the points that have been made.  If the Senators are not satisfied with any aspect of the reply, they could raise the matter on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister two questions?  First, what are regarded as strategic raw materials and, second, is there any national stocktaking in regard to these raw materials?  I made the point that, if we were out of stocks, legislation would not be very effective. Have any plans been made to take general stock of these materials from time to time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>In that regard I did say there was a pretty extensive list of strategic raw materials.  Typical examples of these are electronic and precision instruments, such as navigation and direction-finding equipment, radar, detection and tracking equipment and jambing apparatus.  I endeavoured, when replying, to deal with Irish made strategic materials such as the products of Irish Explosives <Col N="1371" /> Limited, Enfield, and of Core Memories Limited, Coolock.  I referred only to those because I did not want to bore the House with a long list.  Senators will note that I said in my introductory remarks that we were taking this power to ensure that strategic materials are not exported from this country to undesirable destinations or that this country is not used as a base for such trade from elsewhere.  We could have various items coming through for export to undesirable destinations, unless we avail of these powers to prevent it.</P>
      <P>The Senator asked whether we had made a survey.  He said it would be too late when an emergency had developed to make the necessary order.  He quoted the example of oil supplies in relation to a particular situation.  The Department of Transport and Power have a continuing assessment of that situation. But I could not visualise a survey team constantly having to examine all supplies which might become scarce in an emergency.  Both myself and the Minister for Transport and Power have constant information about supplies of essential items and it is unnecessary to set up a survey team in anticipation of an emergency situation.</P>

At that time Senator Ó Maoláin said:</P>
      <P>I should like to suggest to the Seanad that with the agreement of the House, if this Bill were given the same expeditious despatch as it received from the other House the Minister's Estimate will be taken in the Dáil today or tomorrow, and he has undertaken to return to the Seanad immediately that Estimate is finished and to devote the whole day to discussion on that motion.</P>

      <P>Is le cúrsaí Ghaeltarra Éireann a bhaineann an Bille seo agus ba mhaith liom, i dtosach báire, tagairt a dhéanamh don dul chun cinn atá déanta le blianta beaga anuas ó tugadh cumhachtaí breise do Ghaeltarra chun tionscail a fhorbairt sa Ghaeltacht.  Is féidir le Gaeltarra scaireanna a ghlacadh i gcomhlachtaí agus deontais tionscail a thabhairt do na comhlachtaí más gá: tá sé cinn déag de na comhthionscail sin bunaithe cheana nó le bunú go luath.  Tig le Gaeltarra chomh maith deontais, nach dtéann thar £10,000 go dtí seo, a thabhairt chun miontionscadail shomhaoineacha a chur ar aghaidh gan dul i bpáirtíocht leis na daoine ina mbun: tá breis agus céad de na miondeontais sin ceadaithe.  Na tionscail, idir mhór <Col N="1374" /> agus bheag, atá i gceist meastar, ach iad a bheith faoi lánseol, go gcuirfidh siad fostaíocht bhreise lánaimsire ar fáil do suas le 1,500 cainteoir Gaeilge ina gceantair dhúchais.  Ní gan dua a rinneadh an méid sin agus is é mo thuairimse go bhfuil ardmholadh tuillte ag Gaeltarra dá bharr.  Ar ndóigh, tá a fhios againn nach leor a bhfuil déanta go fóill: is é atá uainn ná lánfhostaíocht sna seachtóidí do na cainteoirí Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus tá plean á ullmhú ag Gaeltarra chun an cuspóir sin a bhaint amach.</P>
      <P>Ní féidir dul chun cinn mar atá luaite agam a dhéanamh gan cúnamh mór airgid ón Stát.  Tá dhá bhealach ina dtugtar an cúnamh sin do Ghaeltarra&mdash;deontais trí Vóta Roinn na Gaeltachta gach bliain agus airleacain as an bPríomh-Chiste.  Baineann uasteorainn reachtúil leis na hairleacain&mdash; £500,000 a leagadh síos sa bhliain 1957 agus £2 mhilliún sa bhliain 1965. Tá an £2 mhilliún sin caite mar seo a leanas:&mdash;</P>
      <P>£900,000 ar fhoirgnimh agus ar ghléasra do na tionscail atá á reachtáil ag Gaeltarra féin,</P>
      <P>£760,000 ar mhonarchana lena gcur ar cíos, agus</P>
      <P>£340,000 ar scaireanna i gcomhlachtaí ina bhfuil Gaeltarra agus daoine eile i gcomhar lena chéile chun comhthionscail a reachtáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ó tharla go bhfuil an uasteorainn sroichte, is mithid í a ardú arís agus sin é príomhchuspóir an Bhille seo. Tá foráil in alt 4 chun an uasteorainn do na hairleacain a íoctar le Gaeltarra a ardú ó £2 mhilliún go dtí £6 mhilliún.  Nuair a bheidh an £4 mhilliún breise caite a gceann tamaill de bhlianta, cuirfear an scéal faoi bhráid an Oireachtais arís.  I dteannta uasteorainn na n-airleacan a ardú, tá roinnt leasuithe eile á ndéanamh sa Bhille seo.  Luaigh mé cheana go bhfuil cumhacht ag Gaeltarra deontais a thabhairt chun miontionscadail shomhaoineacha a chur chun cinn&mdash; gan dul i bpáirtíocht leis na daoine ina mbun.  Uasteorainn £2,000 a cuireadh leis na deontais sin sa bhliain 1965 agus ardaíodh í go dtí £10,000 sa bhliain 1968.  Anois, le halt 2 (a) den Bhille, tá an uasteorainn á chur ar ceal <Col N="1375" /> ionas go mbeidh Gaeltarra in ann tionscail bheaga a bhreithniú faoi mar a dhéanann an tÚdarás Forbartha Tionscail agus deontais níos mó ná £10,000 a thabhairt i gcásanna cuí.  Ar ndóigh, ní thabharfadh Gaeltarra agus an tÚdarás Forbartha Tionscail deontais san aon chás amháin agus tá sé sin á dheimhniú le halt 2 (b).</P>
    <P>Tá foráil thábhachtach eile in alt 5 den Bhille a chuirfidh ar chumas údaráis áitiúil dhá thrian de na rátaí a mhaitheamh go ceann deich mbliana ar áitribh thionscail is ábhar cúnaimh ó Ghaeltarra &mdash; faoi mar atá i bhfeidhm d'áitribh a sholáthraítear i limistéir ainmnithe le cúnamh ón Údarás Forbartha Tionscail.  Baineann an fhoráil seo le háitribh a tógadh, a méadaíodh nó a feabhsaíodh ón uair a tugadh na cumhachtaí breise do Ghaeltarra sa bhliain 1965.  Bhí faoiseamh ó rátaí le fáil cheana go ceann tréimhse nach faide ná seacht mbliana, faoi na hAchtanna Rialtais Áitiúil (Luacháil a Laghdú go Sealadach), 1954 go 1970, ach tá na hAchtanna sin ag dul in éag.</P>
    <P>Le cúig bliana anuas níor ceapadh aon chomhalta de Bhord Gaeltarra ina stiúrthóir bainistí: is amhlaidh a fágadh faoin mBord bainisteoir ginearálta a fhostú agus leanfar den nós imeachta sin.  Dá réir sin tá na tagairtí do stiúrthóir bainistí á mbaint amach as an Acht bunaidh le halt 3 den Bhille.</P>
    <P>Sin iad príomhfhorálacha an Bhille: níl fágtha ach mínithe in alt 1 agus gearrtheideal agus comhlua in alt 6. D'fhonn go bhféadfar leanúint de na hiarrachtaí fiúntacha atá ar siúl ag Gaeltarra ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht, tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Seanad glacadh leis an mBille seo inniu.</P>

Beagnach bliain ó shin bhí diospóireacht againn sa tSeanaid &mdash;diospóireacht iomlán, leathan, sasúil ar thuarascáil bhliantuil Ghaeltarra Éireann.  An uair sin dúirt lucht an pháirtí seo nach rabhamar mí-shásta le Gaeltarra Éireann ach nach rabhamar lán-tsásta leo ach oiread.  Idir an dá linn ní féidir a fháil amach cé acu tá athrú tagtha ar scéal Ghaeltarra nó <Col N="1376" /> nach bhfuil.  Ní féidir fós a dhéanamh amach i gceart an bhfuil aon fheabhas tagtha ar an scéal.</P>
      <P>Na tuairimí a nochtaíomar an uair úd tá siad fós againn agus ní mórán an tairbhe dúinn é dul siar ar a ndúramar an tráth úd.  Dá bhrí sin níl mórán le rá againn anois.  Amach anseo is dócha beidh díospóireacht arís againn ar chúrsaí Ghaeltarra Éireann.  Uime sin, níl uainn anois ach mion-thagairt a dhéanamh d'altanna áirithe sa Bhille féin.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith an rud é an uasteorainn a ardú arís.  Táimíd lán tsásta leis sin, go háirithe le halt 2 (a) den Bhille maidir le cabhair a thabhairt do no miontionscadail.  Sár obair ar fad atá á déanamh ag Gaeltarra i dtaobh na scéime seo agus is maith an rud ar fad í a chur chun cinn.</P>
      <P>Maidir le halt 3 den Bhille, dúirt an Rúnaí Parlaiminte nár ceapadh éinne ina stiúrtheór bainistí le cúig bhliain anuas, agus, mar sin, tá sé ar intinn aige an post sin a scriosadh as an dlí ar fad.  An bhfuil sé riachtanach é sin a dhéanamh?  An ndéanfaidh sé aon dochar na tagairtí atá san Principal Act a fhágaint ann?  B'fhéidir i gceann tamaill de bhlianta go mbeidh duine ar an mbord a bheidh an-oiriúnach mar stiúrtheór bainistí.  Ón méid a chualamar inniú, níl mé cinnte gur ceart na tagairtí sin a scriosadh.</P>
      <P>Is maith iad na forálacha atá in alt 5 den Bhille a bhaineann le maitheamh rataí.</P>
      <P>Níl gach rud atá a dhéanamh ag Gaeltarra Éireann sásúil ach an obair atá idir lámha acu is tábhachtach an obair í.  Táimid go léir ar aon intinn faoi sin.

      <P>Mara dúirt an Seanadóir Dooge leis, do dheineamar cúrsaí Ghaeltarra Éireann cíoradh go maith taobh istigh deich bhliain ó shin, agus ní dóigh liom gur gá dul isteach ins na rudaí go léir mar dheineamar an tuarascáil go léir a cíoradh.  Ní dóigh liom go rabhamar go léir mí- shásta, mara dúirt an Seanadóir.  Bhí mé féin sásta go maith leis an méid a bhí á dhéanamh acu.</P>

      <P>Ar aon nós, tá obair mhaith déanta ag Gaeltarra Éireann agus is mian liom tréaslú leo a bhfuil déanta acu.  Is ró-mhór ar fad an méid cáineadh atá ar siúl sa tír seo, agus ba ceart dúinn, anois is arís, daoine do mholadh as ucht an méid a dheineann siad.  Nílim chun dul isteach ins na h-altanna go léir, ach chonaic mé anseo in áit éigin go bhfuil Gaeltarra Éireann ag dul isteach go dtí Baile an Sceilg agus cuirim fáilte roimh an tionscal sin.  Is maith liom i gcónaí tionscail a bheith bunaithe ar bunábhair na háite.  Mar sin, is mór an trua nach bhfuil níos mó tionscail bunaithe ar an talmhaíocht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rud eile a cuireann as dom nach bhfuil gluaiseacht na comharchumann ag dul ar aghaidh chomh maith agus ba mhaith liom sa Ghaeltacht.  Níl a fhios agam conas is féidir a chur chuige.  An ndéanfaidh siad cúis roinnt timirí a chur timpeall?  Ach tá a fhios againn nach bhfuil ag éirí go ró-mhaith ag na gcomharchumainn sa Ghalltacht féin.  Is dian an obair a bheidh roimh na timirí má thugann siad faoi.  Is dóigh liom go bhféadfaimís níos mó a dhéanamh leis na déantúisí cois teallaigh a mhuscailt agus a chur ar bun ins na Gaeltachtaí eile.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil ag éirí go maith leo thuas i dTír Chonaill, ach is dócha nach bhfuil an tradisiún sin i gCiarraí ná ins na Gaeltachtaí eile.  B'fhéidir gur mhaith an rud dul i gcomhar le Bantracht na Tuaithe sa mhéid sin, agus roinnt de thionscail <Col N="1378" /> teallaigh a bhunú cosúil le Co-operative Handcrafts i Strokestown.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith an rud é ceanntair mar sin a bhunú ins na Gaeltachtaí go léir. D'fhéadfadh na mná, agus b'fhéidir na leanaí, rudaí a dhéanamh sa gheimhreadh. Bhéadh cabhair le fáil ó Country Markets san obair sin.  Leis sin is mian liom arís Gaeltarra Éireann a mholadh agus tréaslú leo a bhfuil déanta acu, agus rath Dé a ghuí ar an obair atá roimh an Rúnaí Parlaiminte, roimh Gaeltarra Éireann agus roimh an Aire Airgeadais.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús, is mithid dúinn fáilte a chur roimh an Rúnaí Parlaiminte.  Is féidir linn freisin fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo.  Aontaím leis an Rúnaí Parlaiminte gur ceart an uasteorainn a árdú ó £2,000,000 go dtí £6,000,000.  Ba mhaith liom go mbéadh sé á iarraidh suim níos mó uainn agus go mbéadh seift níos leithne aige ná an ceann atá ós ár gcomhair faoi láthair. Ach dúirt an Rúnaí Parlaiminte go bhfuil an scéal á phlé aige agus go mbeidh sé in ann teacht anseo arís le seift eile chun i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh le h-aghaidh lan-fhostaíocht a chur ar fáil sna Gaeltachtaí.</P>
      <P>I have pleasure in welcoming the Bill.  We can all agree on increasing the upper limit from £2 million to £6 million.  However, we would wish for something much more imaginative.  We would look for something which would blaze a trail, not alone merely for the Gaeltacht but for industrial relations generally.  Unfortunately, I do not think industrial relations in the Gaeltacht are any better than they are in the rest of the country.  We should regard the Gaeltacht as being a region of special responsibility and also a relatively small region so that we would regard it as a laboratory in which to work out real industrial relations and real copartnership between capital and workers&mdash;in this case between the State and the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initiative taken in the last Bill to enable Gaeltarra Éireann, a semi-State body, to enter into partnerships with industrialists on certain occasions is a useful initiative but I do not think it goes far enough.  I should like to see the role of Gaeltarra Éireann and of many of those companies as a type of <Col N="1379" /> holding action temporarily injecting capital on behalf of the State but awaiting the opportunity to pass that responsibility and the corresponding share in the business on to the workers in the business.  By and large, in small industries we cannot have just the pattern of the large industry of, on the one hand, the management, and on the other, the workers.</P>
    <P>Surely the Gaeltacht is an ideal setting to work out what we should like to see developed, community factories where the workers concerned would acquire probably the majority of the shares, in fact could acquire all the shares in the company.  They would feel then that it was their company and if things became difficult they would have the same remedy as the small farmer has when difficulties arise &mdash;to work longer hours but still to keep up his output.  If we can pioneer something like that first in the Gaeltacht and then extend it to the rest of the country we will have gone a good distance towards creating some type of a community spirit in a community factory&mdash;something that seems to be lacking in our present efforts.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the setting up of industries and so on where the important thing is know-how: the capital should be secondary.  The State should be able to step in and have a certain holding initially, with the workers in the factory being given opportunities to acquire shares by working longer hours.  By and large, the worker's pay packet does not provide the opportunity to set aside any sizeable sums for acquiring shares.  On the other hand, if shares can be acquired by working an additional four, six, eight or even ten hours a week, then most workers with an interest in getting the factory going would be eager to work the additional time and acquire the shares.</P>
    <P>There should be some means also in the case of a worker who retired whereby the shares could be bought back by the company and, therefore, made available to be acquired by the new workers.  What we want is a continuing participation by the workers in the industry.  It is in that way that <Col N="1380" /> we will get a sense of local pride and get away from being tied to the clock, because the clock is the ruination of endeavour in any industry.  Unfortunately, it is part of the bigger industries but it has no place in the development of the scale of industries that we would like to see developed in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>The number of jobs mentioned, 1,500 &mdash;and that is only when the full development as envisaged here has taken place&mdash;is disappointingly small.  Admittedly, for the amount involved it is working out at something like £4,000 per worker or per job created, and I suppose that is reasonably good by modern standards.  But that seems to suggest that £6 million is too low and that Gaeltarra Éireann should be expanding at a much more rapid pace than it is.</P>
    <P>We should be able to pioneer in those areas a better attitude to buying Irish because many of us, probably all of us, in the country are gravely disturbed by all the closures that we see, the short-time, <i>et cetera,</i> because Irish industry is at a difficult stage.  We are looking for the cause of that.  The cause is obvious in every supermarket one goes to when one sees how well camouflaged is the origin of the various articles on the shelves.  In most cases the attractive positions are given to the foreign goods and there is no effort at all made to confront the housewife with a choice between buying an Irish-made article and buying something foreign. I made several inquiries lately and 90 to 95 per cent of the time the housewife is totally unaware of the origin of the article she is buying.  That is what is hitting our industry and hitting it very hard.</P>
    <P>I suggest that in relation to this small community scheme we are launching here, or rather continuing, there should be scope in those areas for identifying in the minds of the people concerned the connection between &ldquo;buy Irish&rdquo; and &ldquo;keep that job at home&rdquo;.  It is as simple as that, but we have failed and failed deplorably. The Minister may be able to get through to a group that we do not seem to have touched yet in the Buy Irish Campaign, namely, the schoolchildren. The message must be put to <Col N="1381" /> them: if you want to have a prospect of getting a job in your own country or your own locality then you must see that your parents, relatives and everybody else you can influence buy Irish.  It must be brought home to them that the more of the foreign products they buy, the more money they spend on them, the more certain they are of pushing themselves and every other child in the locality out of the country.</P>
    <P>If we enter the Common Market it will be illegal for a Government to take part in any such campaign.  This is against the spirit of the Community but if the schoolchildren of this country can be mobilised to realise that their whole future depends on the people of their locality and everybody else buying Irish, then I think we will have created a force that will succeed even though the tariff barriers may have completely disappeared.</P>
    <P>In any case we need fresh thinking on both of those items I have outlined. I suggest that that fresh thinking can be made the responsibilty at this, the laboratory stage, if you wish, of the Department of the Gaeltacht.  They have an ideal setting for the carrying out of this work.  They have their own semi-State company to do it and the also have a receptive tax audience, the taxpayers of the country, who will not hesitate to put funds at the disposal of Gaeltarra Éireann.  I would suggest to the Minister that when this new scheme is unfurled and the Bill comes before the House he should consider giving additional roles to Gaeltarra Éireann.  The Government might well see what can be done at this pioneering stage.</P>
    <P>Níl a thuille le rá agam anois ach fáilte a cur roimh an mBille.  Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh níos mó ná an £6 milliún ann agus beidh mé ag fanacht leis an Bhille atá geallta dhúinn i gcóir ár scéim mór.  Tá an scéim atá ós ár gcóir ró-shuarach chun an obair mór atá le déanamh ag Gaeltarra a chur i gcríoch.</P>

      <P>Sé an chéad dualgas atá orm ná fáilte a chur roimh an Rúnaí Parlaiminte.  Le cúnamh Dé, déanfaidh sé cion fir ar son na Gaeltachta agus ar son na teanga.  Insan <Col N="1382" /> óráid a thug sé, is chúis mhisnigh dúinn an abairt seo:</P>
      <P>Na tionscail, idir mhór agus bheag, atá i gceist meastar, ach iad a bheith faoi lánseól, go gcuirfidh siad fostaíocht bhreis lánaimsire ar fáil do suas le 1,500 cainteóir Gaeilge ina gceantair dhúchais.</P>
      <P>Tá daoine ann agus déarfaidh siad gur líon an-bheag é sin, 1,500.  Ach is mór an sólás do mhuintir na Gaeltachta an líon sin.  Tá daonra na Gaeltachta anteirc cheana féin agus sílim gur líon an-shásúil é sin go fóill.  Mar sin féin ba cheart é bheith mar chuspóir ag Roinn na Gaeltachta i gcónaí, an líon sin a mhéadú ionas nach mbeidh fostaíocht in easnamh ar na daoine óga atá ag éirí suas agus a bheidh in a gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht san am atá le teacht.</P>
      <P>Deir an Rúnaí Parlaiminte freisin&mdash; deimhníonn sé é, mar bhí sé ráite cheanna féin&mdash;is é atá uainn ná lánfhostaíocht ins na seachtóidí dos na cainteóirí Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá plean á ullmhú ag Gaeltarra Éireann chun an cuspóir sin a bhaint amach. Tá súil agam go dhéanfaidh an Roinn a seacht ndícheall plean a leagadh amach a bheidh sásúil agus a bheidh lán oiriúnach chun an cuspóir sin a bhaint amach.</P>
      <P>Sa Ghalltacht bímíd ag cur síos ar chúrsaí Gaeilge, ar chúrsaí athbheóchana, ar chultúr, ar leathnú na teanga, ar chúrsaí náisiúntachta agus mar sin de.  Ach de gnáth ins na Gaeltachtaí féin is beag uair a chloisfeá caint den tsórt sin, ach cá bhfaghaidh siad job, cá bhfaighfaidh siad an t-airgead chun iad féin a chothú agus chun go bhfaighfaidh siad caighdeán maireachtála a mbraithre san Ghalltacht a bhaint amach.  Is é sin a bhíonn ag déanamh buartha dóibh.  Gach aon uair a théim go dtí na Gaeltachtaí, ó thuaidh nó ó dheas, sé an port céanna é.  Bhéadh i bhfad níos mó daoine in a gcónaí sna Gaeltachtaí dá mbéadh obair le fáil acu ann.  Tá sé sin fíorthábhachtach. Is dóigh liom go bhfuil sé sin tuigthe ag oifigigh Roinn na Gaeltachta agus tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh siad beart dá réir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Caithfear an Ghaeltacht a chaomhnú gan dabht.  Sílim féin go leathnóidh an Ghaeilge amach as na cathracha, ach <Col N="1383" /> mar sin féin bímíd ar dtaobh leis an nGaeltacht gach bliain chun neart agus fuinneamh a chur in ár gcuid cainte. An duine nach dtéann go dtí an Ghaeltacht go rialta is baolach go n-éiríonn a chuid cainte lag.  Éiríonn sé beagáinín tanaí ó thaobh fuaimeanna agus blas. Acht fhad is a bheidh na Gaeltachtaí ann, beidh siad mar a déarfá, mar thobar agus foinse ó thaobh fóghraíochta agus rith na cainte, ó thaobh seanachaíochta agus nithe den tsort san, nithe atá chomh tábhachtach sin maidir le saol teangan.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil san Teach seo cheana féin daoine nach dtuigeann cad iad na gnóthaí a bhíonn ar siúl ag Roinn na Gaeltachta. Léirítear gach rud san leabhrán beag seo atá eisithe ag Roinn na Gaeltachta. Sé an teideal atá air ná <i>Roinn na Gaeltachta: Leabhrán Eolais.</i>  Ba ceart do gach éinne sa Teach seo, agus gach éinne go bhfuil suim aige sa Ghaeilge, an leabhrán beag sin a fháil agus a léamh go cúramach.  Deir sé ar leathnach a seacht:</P>
    <P>Is é is feidhm do Roinn na Gaeltachta leas cultúrtha, sóisialach agus eacnamaíoch na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn; cabhrú le caomhnú agus leathnú na Gaeilge mar gnáthurlabhra; agus, a mhéad is gá nó is cuí, dul i gcomhairle agus comhairle a ghlacadh le ranna eile Stáit i dtaobh seirbhísí a riarann na Ranna sin agus a bhaineann le leas cultúrtha, sóisialach nó eacnamaíoch na Gaeltachta nó a bhaineann leis an gcuspóir náisiúnta an Ghaeilge a athbheóchan...</P>
    <P>Ach go háirithe ó táimíd ag cur síos ar cúrsaí eacnamaíochta:</P>
    <P>Is é aidhm atá le beartas an Rialtais don Ghaeltacht gníomhaíochtaí oiriúnacha a spreagadh agus a fhairsingiú agus cúrsaí sóisialacha a fheabhsú ionas go mbeidh deiseanna leormhaithe ag na daoine a chónaíonn sa Ghaeltacht, agus arb í an Ghaeilge a ngnáthúrlabhra, chun fostaíocht shochrach a fháil agus caighdeán réasúnta maireachtála a bheith acu.</P>
    <P>Is minic a bhímíd ag éisteacht le gearán ó dhaoine in Éirinn agus thar lear i dtaobh cearta sibhialtachta&mdash;<Col N="1384" /> cearta sibhialtachta an Tuaiscirt, cearta sibhialtachta na mac léinn anseo agus ansiúd ar fud na hEorpa, agus le déanaí chualamar an port: cearta sibhialtachta na Gaeltachta.  Fiú amháin oíche Dé Sathairn seo caite nuair a bhí craobh díospóireachta, Craobh na hÉireann, á reachtáil ag Gael-Linn i gCathair Chorcaí bhí scata léirseoirí lasmuigh den halla agus suntaisí ar iompar acu, cuid acu i ngar do bheith maslach.  Ba é an Taoiseach féin a bhí sa chathaoir istigh agus 'bé an port a bhí ag a lán de na léirseoirí ná cearta siabhialta na Gaeltachta.  Ón gcuma a bhí ar chuid acu&mdash;daoine óga&mdash;déarfainn gur beag eolas a bhí ag a lán acu ar an nGaeltacht ná ar aon rud a bhain leis an nGaeltacht.  Go háirithe, ní déarfainn go raibh aon eolas acu mar gheall ar an obair atá á dhéanamh ag Roinn na Gaeltachta ar son na Gaeltachta agus ar son na ndaoine atá ann.</P>
    <P>Trua ar fad nach bhfuil na daoine sin ins an Tigh seo inniú.  Dá mbeadh, bfhéidir go dtuigfidís cén obair atá á dhéanamh ag Roinn na Gaeltachta ar son na ndaoine go mbíonn na léirseorí ag caint mar gheall orthu.  B'fhéidir gur easpa fógraíochta ó Roinn na Gaeltachta faoi ndeara é, agus tá súil agam go mbreacfaidh an Rúnaí Parlaiminte nóta ina leabhar mar gheall air anois.  Ba cheart go mbeadh i bhfad níos mó bolscaireachta á dhéanamh maidir le hobair Roinn na Gaeltachta agus ba cheart go dtuigfeadh pobal na hÉireann dá bhárr san go bhfuil beart fónta á dhéanamh ag Roinn na Gaeltachta. Má bhíonn gearán ag éinne a bhíonn páirteach sa léirseoreachtaí faoi bhrat cearta sibhialta na Gaeltachta, ba cheart dó gearán a dhéanamh go díreach le Roinn na Gaeltachta agus sílim go n-éisteófar leis.</P>
    <P>Aon chabhair a bhíonn ag teastáil ó Roinn na Gaeltachta chun feabhas do chur ar chaighdeán maireachtála ins an Ghaeltacht táim lán chinnte go bfhaighaidh siad tacaíocht, ní hamháin ón dtaobh seo den dTigh ach ón dtaobh eile den Tigh chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Deineadh tagairt ó chianaibh do chaidreamh tionscailíochta.  Dúirt duine éigin go raibh eagla air nach raibh caidreamh tionsclaíochta nó industrial relations chomh sásúil san ins an nGaeltacht. <Col N="1385" /> Gan dabht do thárla rud nó dhó i rith na bliana seo caithe agus níor cheart go dtarlódh siad, ach féacaigí ar an scéal mar seo.  Tá a lán de mhuintir na Gaeltachta a chaith tamall ag obair ins na cathracha mhóra ní amháin anseo i nÉirinn ach thar lear sa Bhreatain ach go háirithe, agus pé droch nósanna a bhíonn le foghluim ins na háiteanna sin ó thaobh tionsclaíochta agus caidreamh tionsclaíochta d'fhogliónn siad iad.  Mar threabh nó mar aicme, táimíd go hiontach maith chun aithris a dhéanamh ar dhaoine eile, go háirithe maidir le gearáin, stailceanna agus nithe den tsórt san.  Má thárla aon rud i rith na bliana seo caite ó thaobh stailceanna, ní dócha go dtógfar ar na daoine sin é agus oiread san stailceanna ar siúl sa chuid eile den tír.  San iomlán, sílím go bhfuil an fhostaíocht sásúil agus go bhfuil an caighdeán ó thaobh caidreamh tionsclaíochta sásúil leis.</P>
    <P>Mar a dubhras cheana, má tá aon locht le fáil ar an mBille seo isé seo: gur go mhó an sásamh a thabarfadh sé dúinn thuille airgid a votáil do Roinn na Gaeltachta dá mbéimís cinnte dhe go mbeadh a thuille daoine fós thar 1,500 fostaithe gan mhoill. Arís deirim é.  Aon uair a thagann Roinn na Gaeltachta anseo ag lorg airgid chun a gcuspóirí a chur i gcrích beidh fáilte is fiche rompu.  Guím gach rath ar an Rúnaí Parlaiminte san obair atá roimhe agus isé ár gcuspóir go léir, is dóigh liom, an Ghaeltacht a leathnú agus feabhas do chur ar chaighdeán maireachtála mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus ina theannta san féachaint chuige go leathnófar úsáid na Gaeilge ón Ghaeltacht amach agus ós na cathracha amach chun go mbeidh gach éinne sa tír seo in ann a shaol a chaitheamh tré Gaeilge agus le Gaeilge.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte freisin roimh an mBille seo.  Is mór an trua nach raibh a leithéid ann 20 nó 30 bliain ó shin.  Dá mbeadh, b'fhéidir nach mbeadh an Ghaeltacht chomh beag is atá sí anois.  Bhí tairiscint againn anseo beagnach bliain ó shin agus bhí díospóireacht fiúntach againn ar an ábhar seo ag an am sin.  Fé mar adúirt an Seanadóir Ó Dúbhthaigh agus na Seanadóirí eile, tá a lán le déanamh fós sa Ghaeltacht <Col N="1386" /> maidir leis an obair seo.  Obair mhaith agus obair fiúntach é.  Rachaidh sé chun tairbhe don Ghaeilge, mar is dóigh liom go dtabharfaidh sé misneach do mhuintir na Gaeltachta thar mar a bhí le fáil acu go dtí seo. Maidir leis na rudaí a dhéantar sa Ghaeltacht agus rudaí a dhéantar in Éirinn, níl siad ar fad go holc agus ba cheart dúinn go léir na rudaí sin a mholadh.</P>
      <P>There is just one question I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary. In his introductory speech he mentioned the year 1967 and I take it that he meant 1957.  It is a small point but I wondered whether the script was wrong.  That is the only point I would make.  I certainly support the Bill.</P>

Táim buíoch freisin mar gheall ar an bhfáilte a chuir Seanadóirí roimh an mBille.

      <P>Rinne mé nóta de na tuairimí a nocht na Seanadóirí a labhair ar an mBille.  Caithfidh mé a rá go ndearna mé dearmad maidir le dátaí.  Dúirt mé &ldquo;1967&rdquo;; ba cheart dom &ldquo;1957&rdquo; a rá, agus thagair an Seanadóir Mac Domhnaill dó sin.</P>
      <P>Tá rud nó dhó ba mhaith liom a rá faoi chúrsaí Ghaeltarra.  Do luaigh mé 16 de chomhthionscail atá bunaithe nó á mbunú i gcomhar le daoine eile. Is i nDún na nGall atá an dá cheann is mó.  Tá seacht gcinn acu i nGaillimh, ceithre cinn i gCiarraí agus dhá cheann i gCorcaigh.  I gcás na miondeontas&mdash;is iad sin deontais a thugann Gaeltarra chun miontionscadail shomhaoineacha a chur chun cinn gan dul i bpáirtíocht le daoine ina mbun, tá na deontais &mdash;breis agus céad díobh&mdash;ag dul go dtí gach ceantar ar fud na gcontaetha Gaeltachta.</P>

    <P>Is eol dúinn go léir na deacrachtaí atá le gnóthaí tionscail a bhunú nó a chur ar aghaidh in aon cheantar tuaithe <Col N="1387" /> agus go háirithe i gceantair scáinte mar atá againn i reigiún na Gaeltachta. Táimid mar sin faoi chomaoin ag Gaeltarra mar gheall ar a bhfuil déanta acu le blianta beaga anuas, agus is féidir liom a dhearbhú don Seanad go leanfar go dícheallach leis an obair, go mbraithimse féin agus go mbraitheann Gaeltarra go bhfuil ag éirí leis na hiarrachtaí agus go bhfuil mórdhóchas againn gur gearr nach mbeidh easpa fostaíochta ar chainteoirí Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.

    <P>&ldquo;(b)  Nothing in this section shall be construed as permitting a person to use a vehicle, in respect of which a restricted road freight licence has been granted, for the purpose of the delivery in the State of goods which have been loaded on to that vehicle in the State.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Committee Stage of the Bill both Senators West and Sheldon expressed some doubts about the wording of paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 8. Senator West, in particular, felt that there could be loopholes in the words &ldquo;intended to be&rdquo; and &ldquo;exported&rdquo;. <Col N="1388" /> Section 8 (1) (a) of the Bill contains a provision which enables the Minister to include in a restricted road freight licence any conditions which he may see fit to impose and specify in the licence.  This provision would enable the Minister to include in the licence a condition that the vehicle to which the restricted road freight licence applied could not be used for the purpose of loading goods at one point in the State for delivery at another point in the State.</P>
      <P>The necessity to prohibit lorries from outside the State from engaging in point-to-point haulage from within the State is very important.  In order to put the question beyond doubt we put section 8 (1) (b) in the Bill.  It was recognised that in prohibiting the loading of goods at one point in the State for delivery to another point in the State by a foreign vehicle circumstances might arise where such vehicles could break down between the loading point in the State and the point of exit from the State.  In these circumstances the goods would have to be unloaded on to another vehicle.  As Senator West pointed out, the vehicle which broke down would have been involved in point-to-point haulage in the State.  To provide for this situation the expression &ldquo;intended to be exported&rdquo; was included in the original section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the exceptional situation mentioned by Senator West, the paragraph as drafted would contain loopholes, so we are now proposing to delete the existing paragraph (b) and to substitute a new paragraph which provides that a vehicle in respect of which a road freight licence has been granted may not be used for the purpose of the delivery of goods in the State which have been loaded on to that vehicle in the State.  If there is a breakdown, the provision now is that the vehicle in respect of which the road freight licence has been issued may not be used for the purpose of delivery in respect of goods which have been loaded on to that vehicle in the State.  The possibility of a breakdown is not specifically provided for but this is a matter where discretion can be exercised in regard to the bringing of a prosecution. It should be possible to distinguish between genuine breakdown and a deliberate <Col N="1389" /> attempt to evade the prohibition on point-to-point haulage.</P>

      <P>This section enables us to deal with the foreign haulage firms coming into this country.  It also enables us to negotiate this type of arrangement for ourselves abroad. The section empowers the Minister to make reciprocal arrangements with other countries.  Naturally, in making such arrangements we would ensure that the arrangements for our hauliers in that country would not be any worse than the arrangements for that country's hauliers in Ireland.  We obviously would not agree to any situation whereby our people hauling in France or Germany were worse off than German or French hauliers hauling in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The section is only an enabling section.  The Minister has discretion: I can grant a licence or make regulations on any basis I wish. If the Senator will look at subsection (2) (a) of section 8, he will see that I may by order declare that a licence or class of licences issued by the competent authority in another State, in pursuance of an international multilateral or bilateral agreement to which the State is a party, shall be deemed to be a restricted road freight licence.  In other words, the discretion lies with me to decide on the licence or class of licence which is issued in respect of a multilateral or bilateral agreement to which the State is a party.  All the licence issuing arrangements are flexible and will depend on bilateral or multilateral <Col N="1390" /> arrangements reached by the State with another state or with a competent authority in another state.</P>

      <P>There is nothing to prevent it, but obviously this is the kind of arrangement to which the Minister, whoever he would be, would not agree to without the proper conditions attaching to it.  One of the conditions envisaged would be the one the Senator just mentioned.  This is a matter for arrangement.  The section enables the Minister to allow this but this does not prevent the Minister in any way from attaching conditions such as the Senator mentions, insisting on a full load in before allowing a load back, as is done at the moment in regard to the North of Ireland hauliers.  They are not allowed to come in here at the moment by arrangement, except on the basis of coming in with a load and going back with a load.</P>

      <P>All of these amendments are related and consequential on one another and refer to a point raised by Senator Eoin Ryan on Committee Stage.  He mentioned that there were a number of amendments and repeals relating to various statutes, which rather complicated the Bill, as drafted, and he suggested that a repeals schedule should be inserted at the end of the Bill.  Amendment No. 7 is really the nub of the matter, in which the new schedule now specifies the precise sections in the various repeals in this statute.</P>
      <P>This meets the point raised by Senator Ryan and is a very sensible way to approach the matter.  As far as practitioners are concerned, and members of the public who want to ascertain expeditiously what their rights are, they are facilitated by specifying in this schedule the short title or subject matter of specific items of legislation, the session and the year of their passing, and the precise extent of repeal involved, section by section in each case.</P>

Several Senators spoke on this section and most Members of the Seanad received representations from the union catering for locomotive drivers.  From the reading of the amendment, it seems to me that the Minister has met very fully the case made by the representatives, and it is right that we should mention our appreciation in that regard.  In fact, it is continuing a policy that has been in effect in CIE for many years.  They have consultation with the unions concerned before any action involving the retirement of a driver is contemplated. It is a good provision and will lead to better relationships between CIE and the locomotive men.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to define more clearly all types of work.  It is to remove any doubt as to whether temporary help agencies would be included or not.  Some of those agencies would be the type where persons are kept on a panel or in a pool of employment and hired out at intervals on casual work to others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to explain this a little bit more fully.  It seems to me that one of the complaints as regards this Bill is that the net which the Minister is casting in his definition of an employment agency is far too wide.  I think that criticism was made very reasonably and very fully on the Second Reading of the Bill.  I may be reading it wrongly, but it seems to me to be that the Minister is further widening the scope of the Bill and extending the definition of an employment agency. The last few remarks the Minister made possibly explain the reason for this, but I certainly argued on the Second Stage &mdash; and Senator Alexis FitzGerald, if I remember his contribution correctly, argued even more fully than I did &mdash; that there were certain types of &mdash; I am trying to avoid using the word &ldquo;agency&rdquo; because they are not really agencies &mdash; services rendered which should be excluded from the provisions of the Bill and which fitted into the definition of &ldquo;employment agency&rdquo; in the Bill as proposed.  Whatever doubt there might have been about whether they did or did not <Col N="1395" /> come into the Bill seems to me to be removed by the Minister's amendment by inserting the words &ldquo;or render services to&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Ordinarily speaking, I think most of us would regard an employment agency as an agency which is in business for the purpose of finding employment for applicants or finding employees for employers who turn to them; and we would not regard ancillary services provided by firms that are not, ordinarily speaking, employment agencies but which, ancillary to their business and to the service which they seek to give their customers, also deal with the question of employment.  Am I right in thinking that the insertion of these words &ldquo;or render services to&rdquo;, apart from other considerations that the Minister may have in mind, put it beyond doubt that management consultant businesses and that kind of thing are being brought clearly within the scope of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is right in his assumption.  This defines more clearly what agencies may come within the ambit of this legislation.  I should like to point out to the Senator that definition is all important here if we are to cover any of those institutions or agencies that do a service, even <i>ad hoc</i> or on a temporary basis, because they may be the people that we are really most anxious to control.  Indeed, I would say that it is also in the interests of the legitimate agencies.  It is of importance to them too that we take power to control any type of employment agency either on an <i>ad hoc</i> or temporary basis or of the type I mentioned here where there is a pool of labour retained for the purpose of being hired out at intervals or for short periods.  This may be where control is most needed and I do not think the legitimate agencies would quarrel with that at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to know what we are dealing with.  The Minister may recall that on the Second Stage I suggested, for example, that under the definition as it then stood, it might even be possible that the Incorporated Law Society would be regarded as an employment agency.  I think some Senators <Col N="1396" /> felt that I might have been stretching my imagination somewhat in making that suggestion.  It seems to me that this amendment, in any event, would clearly bring them in.  Since I spoke here on the Second Stage I have got the Incorporated Law Society <i>Gazette</i> for the month of February.  I see here that reference is made to the Society's introductory service.  This is in connection with solicitors' amalgamations of partnerships, but so long as there is even an introductory service carried on by the governing body of a profession, such as the solicitors profession, it does seem to me now that it is put beyond doubt that the running of such services is being brought within the scope of the Bill.  I propose to argue later on that, if they are in it by reason of the definition section, these kind of services which clearly, I would submit, do not need control under this Bill should be excluded under the excluding provisions of the Bill.  However, that is another day's work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a reference in subsection (3) (b) to the prescribed standards of suitability and fitness of applicants for a licence.  I should be interested to hear if the Minister could give us some indication of what are likely to be prescribed standards of suitability and fitness.  It seems to me that this is an extremely difficult area because I think the range of employment agencies &mdash; and something of the range has been indicated during the Second Stage, debate &mdash; can go from someone who is in effect a managerial consultant to someone who is simply almost a clearing house dealing with straightforward vacancies for labouring or unskilled work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This seems to raise all sorts of problems.  In one sense the only qualification for acting as an employment agency is literally to be able to bring people together to find the people who are looking for work and <Col N="1397" /> to say to the potential employer: &ldquo;I think I have got someone suitable&rdquo;. That is putting it at its lowest.  In other cases an employment agency may bring to bear a great deal of skill in the situation, they may advertise and charge fees according to the skills they have to offer, doing substantial tests on the people who are looking for jobs, screening them in special ways and so on, and making very detailed confidential reports to the potential employers which, in some cases, may even include interviews with the applicant's wife, if it is a situation in which his wife is considered to be part of his assets in seeking employment at a high level with a particular firm where social contact or entertaining may be part of the requirement.</P>
    <P>I should be interested to know how the Minister will deal with what seems to me to be a genuine problem of setting some standard of suitability and fitness for applicants for licences because of the range of the work.  Also, I take it that much of the impetus for this Bill has come from people who have been disturbed about what fate may overcome young girls applying for positions overseas.  It might possibly introduce moral considerations. The Minister might feel that he might have to take regard of the possibility of a criminal background of an applicant or something of that kind. Personally, I would find it helpful to know what is in the Minister's mind in this regard since he has these powers to prescribe standards of suitability and fitness where applicants for licences are concerned.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister regard the agencies operating under his own Department as having a requisite standard?  If he does I, for one, would disagree with it.  Some of the premises throughout the State leave a good deal to be desired.  We would be acting rather hypocritically in this House if we are legislating for private employment <Col N="1398" /> agencies and at the same time excluding agencies under the Minister's own Department from coming up to a required standard.  The question of standards, as has been raised by other Senators, is very pertinent to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of standards will be prescribed of course and will include the usual stipulations with regard to particular classes that would be considered unfit &mdash; persons with criminal records, undischarged bankrupts, persons giving misleading information in their applications and persons whose licences have been revoked. These would be specifically set down.  The premises will be required to conform to certain standards.  I am not too sure what Senator Russell has in mind, whether he is referring to the personnel of the employment agencies or the quality of the buildings.  He is, I am sure, aware that the Department of Labour has established a new placement service where separate offices conforming, I hope, to high standards will be at the disposal of the officers in the new placement service.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, employment exchanges have come to be looked upon as agencies for payment of benefits rather than for recruiting for employment.  Perhaps they require, in some instances, a good deal of improvement. Many of these are on a contract basis where we have branch managers and it is their responsibility to provide premises of decent standards. As far as the Department are concerned there is a programme set on foot for the improvement of some of the existing offices.  These are not the offices which will be used in our placement service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which deals with the revocation of a licence and it empowers the Minister to revoke a licence in certain circumstances. The section states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the holder of a licence under <Col N="1399" /> this Act has been convicted of an offence under this Act or has given false information in an application under section 3 of this Act or where in the opinion of the Minister &mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the holder is no longer a suitable person to carry on the business of an employment agency, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the premises where the holder is carrying on the business of an employment agency no longer conform to the prescribed standards,</P>
    <P>the Minister may revoke the licence.</P>
    <P>The case has been made that essentially the Minister's power of revocation here refers to the suitability of the person or the suitability of the premises.  The suggestion has been made to me that this section could be strengthened by specifically adding a subparagraph (c), including as a ground for revocation of the licence if the employment agency is being conducted in an improper or illegal manner having regard to the provisions of the Act.  That proposal has probably been discussed with the Minister or his officials because it was made by the Irish Federation of Employment Agents.  I should like to hear the Minister's view on it.</P>
    <P>It may be that the opening sentence in the section contemplates that what the Federation proposed should be inserted.  In other words, the Minister may feel that the section as it stands meets the point of view being put forward. I do not think it meets it fully because, under the section as it stands, to revoke a licence on the grounds that there has been an offence under the Act, would certainly require the offence to be proved and that the person charged with the offence has been convicted.</P>
    <P>There does not seem to be any discretion left to the Minister.  If the agency itself is carried on in an improper manner, even though there has been no charge made and no conviction secured, the only grounds on which the Minister could revoke, in those circumstances, would be because he comes to the conclusion that the holder is no longer a suitable person.  It may be <Col N="1400" /> that that is strong enough, but I am not sure and I would like the Minister's views on it.</P>

      <P>Yes.  In any event, paragraphs (a) and (b) are essential. This section really seeks to ensure that the standards which are required on the granting of the licence are maintained, that if at any time they fall below the required standards the licence may be revoked.  The person could fall below the standards required but at the same time conduct a business in a suitable manner.  If further powers are to be taken here with regard to the conduct of the business, I would favourably consider adding the paragraph.</P>

      <P>I think that what I want to say on section 5 would possibly be more relevant on section 6 and I will argue it there, if necessary.  However, I am mentioning it here because section 5 is the section which provides for appeals against the Minister's decision to revoke or refuse a licence.  It was suggested, I think very reasonably, by Senator Alexis FitzGerald on the <Col N="1401" /> Second Reading that similar powers of appeal should apply in cases where an exemption has been made by the Minister and the Minister proposes to withdraw the exemption.  The question of exemption would arise under section 6 but the question of appeals arises under section 5.  I am simply mentioning the matter on this section in order to keep the door open with a view, possibly, to putting down a Report Stage amendment to section 5 dealing with or providing for appeals in the event of the exemptions being withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To add to subsection (1) the following new paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( )  Any firm or company of industrial or management consultants or any firm of accountants which:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  merely incidentally to other services which it provides for clients also provides the service of advising them on, or assisting them in, the selection of managerial, professional or senior executive or senior administrative staff, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  does not accept any fee or payment from applicants or candidates for employment but is paid exclusively by the client interested in recruiting such managerial, professional or senior executive or administrative staff.</P>
      <P>Section 6 is the section which sets out the various cases to which the Bill will not apply and I want to add to this section a paragraph to provide that the Bill would not apply in the cases provided for in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will recall that this case was argued fairly fully on Second Reading and the point was made that a number of distinguished and expert professional firms are engaged here in consultancy business and that this is in addition to those who are industrial or management consultants.  You also have the type of work which is <Col N="1402" /> mentioned in the amendment undertaken by some eminent firms of accountants.  The case was made that, dealing with staff of this sort &mdash; professional, senior executive and senior administrative staff &mdash; a very high degree of confidence is required.  It was pointed out, and argued fairly fully, that the actual work of securing employment or placing people is very much subsidiary to the general work of these business consultants.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that the Minister is well aware of the kind of work done, the kind of advice and expertise that is applied by these firms.  I feel sure also that he is aware of the overriding need in many cases of absolute confidence in the dealings of the firms, both with the prospective employees and the prospective employers.  It might be suggested that the kind of firms I have in mind and which are referred to in the amendment could be dealt with by exempting them from the provisions of the Bill.  But there is a feeling, and I venture to say that it may be well-founded, that it is not going far enough, that what is required in order to keep the degree of confidence necessary for these firms to conduct their businesses, as they have been conducting them, in a very excellent manner, is that they should be excluded completely from the provisions of the Bill, should not be interfered with by the Bill and should not be put in the position that they would have to apply for exemption from the terms of the Bill.  The amendment I am proposing poses that question to the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have given most of the reasons why I am moving this amendment.  With regard to my proposal that we should exempt bodies of the type contemplated in the amendment or that we should exclude them from the Bill, it may be said in reply that this would not be necessary because the Minister has powers of exemption and that if there are bodies which are proper to exempt from the provisions of the Bill under section 6, subsection (2), the Minister can make an order exempting them.  I want to <Col N="1403" /> suggest to the Minister that bodies of the type I am speaking about would not be properly dealt with merely by exemption and that they should be excluded from the provisions of the Bill.  I have already mentioned the type of work they are engaged in and the absolute necessity for a very high degree of confidence in their work &mdash; the material they gather with regard to applicants and so on is of a highly confidential nature &mdash; and I do not think that the same degree of confidence would exist if there was an exemption order made.</P>
      <P>Apart from other considerations, under the Bill as it stands at the moment the Minister, under section 6, subsection (3), may by order revoke or amend an order made under this particular section.  If the Minster was to grant an exemption order, the firms in question would never know when that exemption order might be revoked. Remember, under the Bill as it stands there is no appeal from a decision of the Minister to revoke an exemption order.  There is an appeal from a decision of the Minister not to grant a licence, or to revoke a licence, but there is no appeal against a decision by the Minister to revoke an exemption order which he might have made.  Consequently, there would be a very unsettled state of affairs so far as these firms are concerned.  Having regard to the need for absolute confidence as regards the information they get, the fact that an unsettling situation would arise &mdash; they would not know whether an exemption order was going to be withdrawn &mdash; would, in my judgment, be bound to have a very bad effect as regards the applicants with whom they are concerned.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to paint the picture in any more detail except to make this point, which I think is a valid one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The type of positions with which these firms are concerned, and with which this amendment is concerned, are positions of managerial, professional, senior executive or senior administrative staff.  Very often, in relation to posts of this description, the <Col N="1404" /> number of possible candidates will be comparatively limited.  This is a small country and it is very easy for information to leak.  Unless the high character of the confidential nature of the information that is given is completely preserved it is going to have grave ill effects so far as the provision of this type of service is concerned.</P>
    <P>I know it may be argued, and it may be argued sincerely, by the Minister that nothing he intends to do under this Bill is going to cause any breach of confidence.  He is not going to take any action under section 8 or any other section of the Bill which would require information given in confidence to be disclosed.  It is one thing to say that and mean it but it is another thing to have that accepted by people who feel sensitive about making inquiries regarding change of employment, for example, and about that fact being disclosed even inadvertently.  For those reasons I would strongly urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish, briefly, to support the case made by Senator O'Higgins.  It is self-evident that there are two categories of employment agencies.  There are the employment agencies where fees are taken from those seeking employment and in respect of which there must be control and the Bill rightly seeks such control. Then there are the agencies where recommendations and so on are incidental to their other functions and where no fee is taken from the applicant. Whatever cost is involved is paid by the group being advised.  There is a need to make a clear distinction between these two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.  The Bill is not the last word and, as with other Bills, we will have revised legislation in five or ten years.  If it is necessary to increase the scope of the initial Bill in years to come, that can be done.  At present there are bodies doing a satisfactory job and fulfilling a valuable role in management selection and so on in our industry.  This work has been acknowledged and the Minister has received no complaints about these bodies.  I suggest to the Minister that it <Col N="1405" /> is wrong to classify these bodies with the other more mundane type of agency which is open to all sorts of dubious practices.  For instance, they take fees from applicants without guaranteeing results, and this applies especially in recruitment for work abroad.  The Minister should recognise this distinction at this stage.</P>
    <P>In four or five years time, if any abuses come to light and if there is need for any amendment of this legislation, that is the time to face up to it. At the moment, why not leave the bodies doing a good job to continue with their work and tackle instead the real problem, which is the core of this Bill.  The granting of exemptions under section 6 is not too arbitrary and they can be revoked as easily as they can be granted.</P>
    <P>Why should the Government interfere between an agency and their clients?  The scale of fees is determined by the amount of service required, the amount of exploratory studies, of surveys or whatever else are required to arrive at the ultimate recommendation. We think competition is the spirit and it is everyone for himself, as it were.  I cannot see how the State can regulate that type of service.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to meet the Seanad in this amendment and accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see a certain amount of logic in the argument made by the Senators regarding this amendment, but if this Bill is to be what it sets out to be I could not possibly accept it.  To draw the line of demarcation between what Senator Quinlan described as the more mundane agencies and those carrying out the sophisticated work of acting as consultants for the recruitment of executives would be difficult.  I could see some difficulty, after I precluded an agency from operating, in their setting up as consultants and proceeding with the usual personnel recruitment as they had been already doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to have power to control all recruiting agencies and depend on my powers of exemption to leave any agencies out which might not be properly regarded as agencies and which <Col N="1406" /> should not be licensed.  We have branded all these agencies as doing some type of nefarious work, whereas in fact the number of agencies operating who might not qualify is very small.  Many employment agencies give an excellent and highly selective service. To ask me to discriminate between that type and the others who call themselves consultancy agents or otherwise is asking too much and would be defeating the whole purpose of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It would not be fair to those agencies who will not get through the net but who will continue to do a good job to press these amendments.  Better to depend on the good sense of the administration to ensure that there will be no undue obstacles placed in the way of anybody applying for exemption. In order that the Bill operates as it is intended, I would much prefer to leave no opportunity for loopholes or for anybody to opt out and thereby defeat the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A point was made in regard to accountants.  If an accountant is a member of a firm and is employed by that firm, he has a perfect right to recruit staff.  That is not an employment agency by any definition.  If an accountant sets himself up to engage in recruiting staff for other firms, he cannot obtain any specialised treatment under the terms of this legislation. We will have to hold ourselves free to decide whether he is exempt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister does not see his way to accept Senator O'Higgins's amendment. As I understand the purpose of the Bill, and the Minister has confirmed this, it is to bring into line a minority of employment agencies who, through improper or unsuitable personnel and unsatisfactory premises or for some other reason, are not operating their agency in a manner that would safeguard both the interests of the applicant for employment and the potential employer.  Every member would agree wholeheartedly with those objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding what the Minister has said, there is already in existence a line of demarcation.  The Minister is now seeking to bring within the ambit <Col N="1407" /> of the Bill a section of employment agents, or perhaps consultants is the more correct term, who conform to the Minister's stated requirements, because if they did not they could not carry on their type of agency or consultancy.  In fact, they tend to err in the other direction. Their type of employment agency is based, firstly, on the expertise of the individual or individuals concerned and, secondly, on the type of premises they use.  Senator O'Higgins and Senator Quinlan both pointed out that it is quite impossible for these people to regulate their fees in a manner similar to the ordinary employment agency. The fee alters with almost each individual case.  If I understand section 7 correctly, this would mean that they would need to apply to the Minister in each case where they take on an assignment for an individual client or a corporate body.  For this reason they are in a particular category.  Management consultants of this type fulfil a very useful need, particularly when we are so anxious to attract the best personnel to industry.</P>
    <P>We have had management consultants who have come and gone.  However, the really first-class consultants who know their job and do a good job, are still in existence and are now household names in industry generally.  It would be a mistake for the Minister to bring them within the ambit of this Bill, as apparently he is going to insist on doing, and he might do more harm than good.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with the Senators who have already appealed to the Minister to exclude these particular consultants from the ambit of this Bill. The Minister might indicate that these are the type of agencies he has in mind in subsection (2) of section 6, and that might go some way to meeting Senator O'Higgins's point.  The Minister has been quite coy in regard to the type of agencies he has in mind in this subsection. If he does make an exemption, and something goes wrong, he is covered under subsection (3) of section 6, because he can withdraw or revoke any exemption he grants.  He is therefore already covered, except to make the necessary provision to include <Col N="1408" /> the amendments suggested by Senator O'Higgins, or a similar amendment, if it would suit him better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty I see about this amendment is this.  It would be extremely difficult to frame an amendment which would provide no loopholes and which would eliminate the possibility of certain agencies having certain consultative activities which would enable them to remain outside the ambit of the Bill.  On the one hand, there would be the difficulty that this amendment could be used to get round the Bill in order to avoid the controls which are obviously necessary in the Bill.  On the other hand, there is the possibility that, no matter how well this amendment was framed, certain agencies which should be exempt from the Bill would not come within the amendment.</P>
      <P>The Bill as it stands, with the benefit of the Minister's experience, is a much more flexible and more satisfactory way of dealing with this position. In due course the Minister can see what kinds of firms should be exempt from the Bill and he can make the necessary Orders in accordance with the section as it is now provided. There are two objections to this kind of an amendment and on both scores the section, as it stands, is more satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There might be objections to the amendment.  However, there are a great many objections to leaving the position whereby firms that are contemplated by the amendment are not excluded from the Bill.  Of course there will be objections to the drafting of any amendment.  It has always been the practice &mdash; from an Opposition point of view &mdash; to make it clear that what we are concerned with is the principle enshrined in the amendment, rather than the actual wording of it.  If the weight of the objection to the present amendment is that advanced by Senator Eoin Ryan I do not think that there is any insuperable difficulty at all.  As far as I am concerned, I am quite prepared to leave the drafting of the amendment to the Minister and his parliamentary draftsmen. If the Minister would like to <Col N="1409" /> approach it from that point of view it would be possible to have his amendment on these lines for Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I do not insist on the wording here but the objection that the Minister put forward, as I understood it, was the difficulty of differentiating between these management consultant firms. Firms of accountants, as part of their business, have an advisory service which entails selection or recruiting for senior management positions.  There is a difficulty in differentiating between these and what might be regarded as the ordinary employment agencies. The differentiation is quite clearly set out in the amendment, even though I do concede that if there was a better wording I would accept it.</P>
      <P>As I see it, the differentiation is threefold.  Firstly, the employment content of the work should be merely incidental to the other work of the firms in question; secondly, it should deal with senior staff and the senior staff in question is spelled out in the amendment; thirdly, there should be no question of fees being accepted by the applicants or candidates for employment.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that those are three vital distinctions which can be made as between these business consultants and the ordinary type of employment agency.  There is no great difficulty in arriving at and seeing exactly what the differentiation should be.  If it is a question that the real difficulty of the Minister is the difficulty referred to by Senator Eoin Ryan &mdash; that is, the question of the phrasing of the exception or the exclusion from section 6 that I want to see in the Bill &mdash; I am not going to press this particular wording.  But I would strongly urge on the Minister that this is likely to be a very serious matter.  I accept without question the good intentions of the Minister in relation to these management consultant firms but I would ask him to accept that there is real danger that by refusing to exclude them from the operation of this Bill he is going to disrupt their work and to rob our community of a very valuable service, a service which has its impact on the business life in this country and thereby on the economy of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1410" /> The Minister, I am sure, has from time to time had occasion to appreciate the kind of work that is done by these firms.  Let me give a simple example. There may be a particular business or venture either in difficulty or considering whether or not a particular expansion should take place.  They go to these firms of business consultants, who have the expert knowledge and the personnel and expertise to advise and they get their advice.  They are advised as regards the running and the management of the business, the prospects for expansion, the necessity, if it should be the case, of retraction; and in the question of running the business it may be a question of setting the entire business properly on its feet.  They get advice as to the type of control and supervision and management that is required and the type of personnel that is available to do the job.  By reason of the fact that they have been dealing in a completely confidential way they are in a position to give information as to the availability or non-availability of the type of management personnel required.  If these firms are to be debarred effectively from gathering that type of information of a highly confidential character, and if prospective candidates and applicants are going to fear that in a small country and in a comparatively small city there might, because of any regulation the Minister might make, be disclosure of the fact that they were applicants or of what their qualifications are and what their personal history is, then these business consultants will simply not be in a position to provide that part of the service which they have been able to provide up to now.  I think it would be a very serious dislocation of their work.</P>
    <P>I accept fully the Minister's good intentions in the matter.  I accept that, as far as the Minister is concerned, he does not want to see any slow down in the kind of service that is being provided. But I do not think it is enough, quite frankly, for the Minister to appeal to us on the basis that the problem which I foresee and am formulating now should be dealt with by an appeal to us to accept the good sense of the administration.  Different people <Col N="1411" /> will have different views as regards the good sense of this administration or any other administration.  Certainly, I do not think that that is an answer to the problem.</P>
    <P>There is a problem here.  My solution may not be the ideal one, but it is no answer to it, and certainly it is no solution to it, to say you have got to rely on the good sense of the administration. If the Minister would agree to have a close look at this as regards wording between now and the Report Stage I will not press the position further at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to follow more or less the last speaker on this and ask the Minister to have a good look at section 6 between now and the Report Stage.  To my mind, section 6, as it stands especially subsection (2), is very bad legislation. Subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, if he so thinks fit, by order grant exemption from this Act or a specified provision thereof in respect of the carrying on of the business of a particular class of employment agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely it is our job here in examining this Bill to try and define &ldquo;particular class&rdquo;.  What does it mean?  There is nothing in the Bill which tells us what &ldquo;particular class&rdquo; means.  We have in mind here a number of agencies that can be fitted quite definitely into a particular category; and the Minister I think, by and large, agrees.  I agree the Minister should have the power, as in subsection (2), to grant exemptions to a particular class.  But if there are classes that we feel should not be brought within the scope of this Bill at all, if we are agreed on what these are, then we should spell these out in section 6, while at the same time leaving the Minister the power to deal with other classes that we have not thought of here.  Surely those to which it is obvious to us the Bill should not apply should be spelled out?  To my mind, that is the major decision we are called on to make here.  Otherwise, what are we debating at all except simply what could be put into three lines: that the Minister shall control all employment <Col N="1412" /> agencies, shall give whatever exemptions he chooses and shall revoke any he chooses?  That is purely arbitrary legislation and very bad legislation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think that the Minister should study it very carefully between now and Report Stage.  I think a compromise could be arrived at by which the exemption, once we have enumerated the classes that are entitled to it, could still be by way of order of the Minister and could still be subject to revocation if he wishes to go that far.  We must do a far better job in spelling out what is meant by that strange phase &ldquo;a particular class of employment agency&rdquo;; or could somebody tell me what that means?</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the good sense of the Minister.  His is a new Department, one which we have always found quite co-operative and anxious to do the reasonable thing.  Now I ask them to join with us and before we send this Bill as a Seanad Bill to Dáil Éireann let us do a better job in saying what is meant by &ldquo;particular class&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the House that I came here with my mind perfectly open in regard to particular things and to co-operate as far as possible, but I am afraid I cannot quite agree with the Senators who have spoken regarding exemption in relation to these industrial management consultants.  I am in no way trying to denigrate the tremendous work of national importance which they are doing.  I would be the last person to do so.  I have the IMI attached to my own Department.  I am well aware of many other industrial management agencies or institutions who are doing very good work.  I would be the last to do anything to disrupt the good work they are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot leave the opportunity open to people to call themselves another name and opt out of the legislation. I would not like to have one set of rules for one class of workers and another set for another.  I should like to fight this as far as possible.  I not think that this more sophisticated type of employment in the executive class should appear to be given some special exemption different from <Col N="1413" /> agencies that are recruiting highly technical staff, such as typists and second level executives &mdash; and indeed top level executives for that matter &mdash; without referring to themselves as management consultants.  We must avoid any class distinction whatever in the Bill.  I should hope that the Bill will not impede the good work of anybody. We must, in all legislation, use the element of commonsense.  There must be like coverage for everybody.  The exemptions should be used, as I would expect they would be, according to commonsense.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan asked about exemptions. Organisations such as the rehabilitation board for the mentally handicapped immediately spring to mind.  One could hardly bring these in. People, like charitable institutions, who do certain placings would be exempted. It is right that they should be exempt.</P>
    <P>I believe that the general tone of the Bill should encompass all in the beginning. Let those who may be entitled to exemption be let out but I do not think that we should have different sets of rules for different types.</P>

In regard to the classes mentioned in Senator O'Higgins's amendment, provided these are <i>bona fide</i> as described there, does the Minister agree that these should be exempted by him under section 6?

We are asking for legislation under which the Department of Labour will be all powerful in dealing with these agencies but there are certain unspecified exemptions.  Surely our job here is to list those we consider should be exempted and let the Minister have discretion in exempting others afterwards?</P>

      <P>I do not agree that they are all that more important than the girls in the typing pool who will go out to do confidential work for specific firms at intervals and must be recruited through an agency.  There is not all that much difference between top management and the personnel who are working on the confidential records of some firm and who have to be vetted and recruited by an agency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there is this difference, that the number of posts in question at any given time is likely to be comparatively small?  That is a very distinct difference as between what the Minister refers to, and I accept his description of top management and other types of employment.  The Minister himself mentioned the question of typists or, if you like, manual workers. The latter two categories are very much more vast in numbers than top management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I do not think I am slighting in any way or appearing to <Col N="1416" /> dignify one class and lower another class if I say that the type of information and the confidential character of the information required in relation to top management will be vastly different from the type of information required and the degree of confidence in relation to other posts.  If I want to engage a typist probably all I am concerned with is whether she is able to do her work and is honest.  If I want to employ someone in top management I may have to find out a great deal more about him, as to whether or not he is the type of person who is capable of running the place on his own, how he mixes with others, whether he is a person who is too arrogant in dealing with junior staff and so on.  I may have to get psychological reports and this kind of thing.  There is a big difference and it is not an answer to say: &ldquo;We cannot have class distinction.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If I understand Senator Quinlan correctly he wants to have the particular class of employment agencies defined more accurately and to have in particular the type mentioned in Senator O'Higgins's amendment included in this class, but he is still willing to leave the Minister the power contained in subsection (2) of the section.  This is quite inconsistent. If he were to go the whole hog and say that we insist in this House on defining exactly who will be covered by the Bill and who will not, he would be consistent.  But to add a third category of agencies which should be exempt and still leave the Minister quite free to pick and choose those who should be given exemption by order seems to leave us in much the same position as when we started and seems to me to be quite inconsistent.  Either you insist on having everything clearly defined in the Bill and no discretion left to the Minister or, in my view, what is here is the most satisfactory way &mdash; allow the Minister discretion, by order, to exempt certain categories in the light of experience gained when this Act is operating.</P>

      <P>From the point of view of information, I would find it helpful if, on subsection (2), the Minister could give me some idea of what the procedure would be for a particular body making an inquiry about exemption. Should a body which feels it may be entitled to an exemption and should seek an exemption be making inquiries at this stage, or will there be some general invitation, when the Bill becomes law, to people?  Is this something open to them, or how does the Minister envisage this working?  He did not mention it this evening, but on a previous occasion he did mention the particular situation of the university appointments office, for example, and also of careers teachers in schools who may, in effect, be acting as an employment agency.  These seem to me to be bodies which should appropriately be added to the list of candidates for exemption.  It might be helpful if the Minister could explain how if they feel they should be exempt, they should go about making their application for such an exemption?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not follow this. Do I understand the Minister to say that this amendment is designed to prevent any agency charging a registration fee to a person who comes in seeking work and is entered in a register?  I would support banning registration fees of that sort, but I do not follow the Minister's amendment.  It seems to me <Col N="1420" /> that the secret of this lies in the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo;.  Offhand the amendment would seem to exclude the charging of any fees whatever by an employment agency.  The amendment states:</P>
      <P>A person carrying on the business of an employment agency shall not charge any fee solely for agreeing to seek employment for another person or solely for agreeing to seek persons who will give or accept employment.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Agreeing&rdquo; is the paramount word there.  I would agree with that as excluding the registration fee I am talking about.  If the Minister tells me that it does not refer to registration fees then I do not know what it refers to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 7, there <Col N="1421" /> was a point of view expressed on the Second Stage debate to the effect that it might be better if this question of fees was dealt with on the basis of notification to the Minister rather than that the Minister should be put in the position, under the Bill, of being able effectively to fix the fees.  I should like to hear the Minister on that point.  It seems to me that the effect of the provision in section 7, which says that a person should not charge fees &ldquo;save in accordance with such scales as may from time to time be approved by the Minister&rdquo;, will mean that once a scale of fees has been approved by the Minister that fee and no other must be charged in every case.  While I would agree that fees in excess of a particular amount, whether it be notified to the Minister or be approved by him as provided in the Bill, should not be charged, I am not sure that it is wise to legislate that any particular agency may not, in any circumstances, reduce its fee below the scale approved by the Minister.  I would like to see liberty allowed at least to reduce fees below the scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me there is a certain amount of ambiguity about the wording of this section.  To say that &ldquo;an employment agency shall not charge any fees or expenses in respect of services rendered in the course of the business save in accordance with such scales as may from time to time be approved by the Minister&rdquo;, could mean, on the one hand, such scales as each individual agency submits to the Minister and receives his approval for or, on the other hand, that the Minister would approve of a scale of charges and fees to apply generally to employment agencies.  If this was the interpretation which was put on the provision, it would, of course, be one which would be very undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been speaking, on the last section, about the kind of agencies and the kind of firms which should be covered by this Bill and the kind of agencies and firms which should be exempt.  No matter how hard the Minister tries to exempt certain agencies or firms which should be exempt, he will <Col N="1422" /> still be left with a fairly wide variety of employment agencies, some of which would give a very expensive service and some of which would give a very inexpensive service.  Consequently, if there is any probability that this section could be interpreted in the sense of a scale of charges to be approved by the Minister covering all agencies it would, in the circumstances, be a very undesirable interpretation.  I assume the Minister means a different scale of charges for each agency.  However, in order to clarify that, I would suggest to the Minister that he look at this section again to see whether this could be set out more clearly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is any ambiguity in this section I would be quite pleased to have it clarified to mean what I intend it to mean.  It is not intended that one should be held to be in breach of the section by charging less than the scale, but technically I think the Senator is right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  &ldquo;Not more than&rdquo; or &ldquo;not in excess of&rdquo;.  I want to assure Senator Ryan that we do not propose to have anything to do with fixing scales but will merely approve of them.  I accept that different agencies may have different scales, depending on the type of work.  Indeed, a single agency might possibly have different scales for different clients according to the amount of work that was necessary.</P>
      <P>I would be very slow to interfere with scale-fixing when a good job is being done.  There is such a variety of interests involved here in the type of work which one agency does as compared with another, that they must be given a good deal of freedom in the matter of the scale of fees which they will submit for approval.  I would be prepared, if necessary, to allow the draftsman to have another look at that and see if it is sufficiently clear.</P>

There could be a reference to scales made which would be from time to time submitted to and approved by the Minister. Something on those lines would leave it clear that the scales were suggested by the agency and are only subject to the Minister's approval.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 4:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 is also the result of representations from employment agencies.  This is to enable an employment agency holding a licence under the provisions of the Bill to advertise vacancies abroad under its own name.  Any agency which failed to act in a responsible manner in connection with the assessments could run the risk of losing its licence.  This is an essential amendment and one which seeks to get to the root of what the Bill is intended to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the name of the licence holder being inserted in the advertisement, but am I right in thinking that that would still leave a possible obligation to name the person offering employment?  What we are dealing with are regulations which will be made by the Minister.  It seems to me that, under the terms of the Minister's amendment, he is saying: &ldquo;I may make a regulation which will provide either that the name of the employer must be given or that the name of the licence holder will be given.&rdquo;  If the Minister were saying &ldquo;I will make a regulation which will provide for the giving of either&rdquo;, in which event I suppose normally what would appear would be the name of the licence holder, that would be a different matter.  I do not think that is what is happening here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;or&rdquo; in this sense seems to me to <Col N="1424" /> relate to the Minister's regulation or it may be related to the Minister's regulation. The principal point in this is that the federation feel very strongly that they should not be obliged to publish the name of the prospective employer. This is not due to any sinister reason but simply because the employer may not want his name known until he has decided what applicant he will interview, etc.  It would be against the confidential character of the work from the employer's point of view if there was a requirement that his name be published.  I think the Minister is endeavouring to meet this, but I am in doubt as to whether in fact it does.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>Requiring...the inclusion in the notice of the name and address of the person outside the State seeking a person for or offering employment; or the name and address of the holder of a licence under this Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is exactly the type of section I do not like.  The Seanad should realise that subsection (2) does not mean anything, that subsection (1) contains the whole subject matter of the section.  Subsection (2) is the sort of thing which keeps cropping up in legislation.  It was in road traffic legislation; it was in the diseases of animals legislation. The latter had, I think, 67 sections and we were informed that once we accepted subsection (1) of section 3 of that Act, the other sections were not needed.  The Dáil and Seanad wasted their time discussing the 64 sections, but the full powers for the Minister were included in subsection (1) of section 3 of that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is much the same.  If you read subsection (1) it says: &ldquo;The Minister <Col N="1426" /> may make regulations for giving effect to this Act&rdquo;&mdash;that is fair enough; he requires that power; but then it goes on &mdash;&ldquo;and generally for controlling and supervising the carrying on of employment agencies&rdquo;.  Under that he can do anything he considers necessary by way of controlling and supervising.  The Attorney General will find that and the law officers will back him up.  They have already done it in relation to other legislation.  The rest would be better in a Schedule, rather than set out as if it really meant something of statutory importance.  They are all without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) and this secures that the Minister may, under subsection (1), do anything he likes to control and supervise the carrying on of employment agencies.  I doubt if it is even clear that he is bound by the Act.  If you liked to be really narky, you could read it that &ldquo;and generally for controlling and supervising&rdquo; is in addition to giving effect to the Act.  I do not know if a court would so hold, but I have heard legal arguments put forward which seemed to have a great deal less to hang on than what I am suggesting.</P>
    <P>My chief interest in this is that it has become increasingly popular to attempt in legislation to do what was suggested by Senator Quinlan &mdash; I would have disagreed with him if he had pursued the matter &mdash; in defining the precise classes of agency or people who are to be involved.  The more you define, the more you exclude.  Afterwards you find that people have been left out and, because certain things were specified, others that should have been included were excluded.  The Minister or the draftsman will not be caught in such a position.  Subsection (1) is so widely drawn that subsection (2), except as a matter of general information, does not really exist at all. Is there anything in subsection (2) which is not covered by subsection (1)? I doubt it very much.  Subsection (1) is so very wide that you could nearly stop there and not bother about the rest of the sections in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I made this point on it.  Generally with regard to the provisions of section 8, I agree, by and large, with the view expressed by Senator Sheldon that subsection (1) gives virtually all the power that the Minister could wish for.  What I am concerned with in relation to this section generally is the possibility that regulations may be made by the Minister in connection with the controlling, supervising and carrying on of employment agencies which may lead to the disclosure of information which was given in confidence.  This may be done &mdash; although I see that the Minister has an amendment down which may qualify that to some extent &mdash; by the disclosure of information given in confidence, either by inspection of records or by some other requirements under a regulation made by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own simple way as a lawyer it seems to me that, if a person gives information to another person in confidence, that confidence should be respected.  There should not be any risk whatever under our legislation that the Minister, or any future Minister, may make a regulation, the effect of which will be to impose a legal obligation on an employment agency to act in breach of confidence with a candidate for employment, or with an employer seeking a person for employment. If this section remains as it is, I am afraid that the position may very well be that an employment agency may find itself legally compelled, under the penalties imposed in this Bill, to break a confidence which has been given to them by a person seeking employment or a person seeking an employee.  I therefore suggest that between now and Report Stage the Minister might ask his advisers to consider drafting a further amendment to this section which would make it clear that under no circumstances would there be a requirement to disclose information given in confidence without the consent of the person who had <Col N="1428" /> given that information in confidence. That is of vital importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Senator O'Higgins with regard to the Minister's regulations, there is a provision in the Bill that any regulation made by the Minister must be laid before both Houses.  I presume that, if a regulation was made to which there was serious objection, it would be within the power of either House to have the regulation referred back to the Minister or possibly have it defeated in either House.  I would not be afraid of the making of regulations because they still come under the scrutiny of both Houses and they could be rejected at that point, if there was anything that was considered dangerous or obnoxious in them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

      <P>That is all right if you do not have a position where the Minister is able to count heads in the Division Lobby and control the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; decision.  Obviously, if a Minister with an overall majority behind him in either House of the Oireachtas decides that he will not accept any motion with regard to a regulation, it will not be accepted.  I do not want to allow the situation to arise where a Minister, under this Bill, can enforce on an employment agency the disclosure of information given to them in the strictest confidence and on the understanding that it will not be disclosed.  It seems to me that under this Bill, it is open for that to be done. I recognise the argument of Senator Honan but I do not think that it meets the case.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that I regard this as the most important section in the whole Bill and, as Senator Ryan has said, it is the one that gives any teeth to the legislation as far as these agencies are concerned. While we must retain the power to do the things we have set out to do in the Bill, we would like to have them so set out that we would infringe and trespass as little as possible on the work of decent agencies and indeed not at all on agencies except those about which we had reasonable doubt.  I think we have spelled that out.  Only such books as they are compelled to keep under the Act will be examined.  They may have other records which we would not have access to.  We would merely be concerned that the agency was being run as an agency should, and not to find out about the holiness and virtues of persons who were seeking employment through that agency.  Therefore, only some books or records would be required to be kept by the agency.  This leaves it fairly safe with regard to the likelihood of any confidential matter <Col N="1431" /> being copied by the officers who carry warrants from my Department and are authorised to do this.  I think it is the most important section in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister. There is no doubt that section 8 is a very important section.  There is just one minor point.  When Government amendment No. 4 was being discussed Senator O'Higgins did not seem to be very happy about the phrasing of it.  It might be improved if, instead of saying &ldquo;or the name and address of the holder of a licence under this Act&rdquo; or &mdash; the operative word is &ldquo;notice&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;notice of the name and address of the person outside the State&rdquo; to say &ldquo;or of the name and address of the licence holder&rdquo;.  I think that would improve the English anyway, because it might read &ldquo;seeking a person for or offering employment&rdquo; before &ldquo;or the name and address of the holder of a licence&rdquo;.  It would not read very well but I think the inclusion of &ldquo;of&rdquo; after &ldquo;or&rdquo; after the semicolon would improve it.  I presume it will turn up at the end after the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo; instead. I think putting &ldquo;of&rdquo; in would help the understanding of it anyway.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 9.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3), page 5, line 3, after &ldquo;and&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, where he has reasonable grounds for believing that this Act is being or has been contravened,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment was anticipated somewhat in our discussion on section 8.  In my opinion it would help to put it in plain language that the inspector or the person so entitled to investigate the records out of any employment agency, cannot do so unless he has reasonable grounds to suspect that the Act is being contravened. That is added by way of a further safeguard.  As I said, these are the important provisions in the Bill. These are the provisions which give it all its teeth; but we do not want them to be used, or appear to be used, in <Col N="1432" /> any way that would trespass on the privacy, confidence and proper working of a decent employment agency.  I should like to have the views of Senators on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is general agreement that a Bill of this sort should be introduced; and the federation, I think, specifically agreed that some controlling Bill of this nature would be a good thing.  I would not like the Minister to feel that I was unnecessarily trying to diminish the powers of control which the Minister and the Department think is necessary, but I think we have got to try to keep a balance in these things.</P>
      <P>As regards this amendment the modification which the Minister proposes to insert by the amendment only governs the taking of copies of entries in books or records.  It does not govern the actual power of inspection.  The inspection can take place whether or not the authorised officer has reasonable grounds for believing that the provisions of the Act are being contravened. I really do not know what particular safeguard is constituted then by saying in effect that authorised officers may inspect such books, records, <i>et cetera</i> as are required to be kept but that they could only take copies of these if they think the Act is being contravened.  Possibly the reason for that would be that by taking copies they can then furnish evidence in court to substantiate a charge that might be brought under the Act.  That does not seem to me to constitute a safeguard. I may be a prudent step to take with a view to being able to prove a case in court.</P>
      <P>I will not repeat my arguments, but I would like the Minister to consider again this question of legally compelling an agency to disclose information given to them in strict confidence.  It is not fair to put an agency in a position where they risk quite heavy penalties under this Bill if they do not disclose information, if it is required under section 8 or section 9 by the authorised officer of the Minister or by Ministerial regulation.  I should like the Minister to have another look at that.</P>

      <P>One of the occasions when an authorised officer may inspect such books is stated to be where an application under section 3 of the Bill has been made.  Surely when a person carrying on the business of an employment agency applies to the Minister for a licence he cannot reasonably object to an authorised officer having a look at the books to see if it is a <i>bona fide</i> agency?  This does not suggest that there is anything wrong with the agency.  It is merely to enable the Minister to ascertain if it is a genuine agency and one which should be licensed.</P>

      <P>If I may say a last word on this, I would try to impress on the Senators who have any fears about this section or about unnecessary intrusion by the authorised officer, that we have tried to write a protection into the Bill.  I think this goes a good way. Senator O'Higgins, or anybody who has experience in the law courts, must know that an officer who would have to show he had reasonable grounds for suspecting that an agency was not being run properly before he could take records, would be very slow to take records in any other circumstances. This is a very good legal safeguard. The wording there is &ldquo;as required to be kept under this Act&rdquo;.  No doubt there would be many other confidential records which would not be required <Col N="1434" /> to be kept.  The Bill does not propose the perusal of these.</P>

      <P>It might now be relevant to reply to Senator Ryan.  Section 9 (3) (a) deals with the power of an authorised officer to enter and inspect premises.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan made the point that it was reasonable in the case where an application was made under section 3 of the Bill that the power of inspection should exist.  The point I am making is that that power of inspection is limited to the premises and presumably it is proper to check on the suitability of premises.  The other matters in relation to the inspection of books, taking copies of entries in the books, and in relation to the giving of information are contained in paragraphs (b) and (c).  There is no safeguard against the disclosing of information without the permission of the person who gave that information.</P>
      <P>It cannot be regarded as an essential feature of the working of this Bill that the Minister's officers should have the right to demand information which was given in confidence.

      <P>I should like to make a number of factual points which seem to me to arise from the powers of inspection and the work of these authorised officers which, it seems to me, will be extremely important.  Apart from the matter to which Senator O'Higgins has referred &mdash; the possibility of confidential information being seen &mdash; it also seems that the amendment which we have accepted also raises another possible area of delicacy because it introduces this concept of an inspector having reasonable grounds for believing that this Bill has been or is being contravened.</P>
      <P>I have had some experience in this type of field and one possible source of information or complaint regarding the working of an agency is not only the clients of that agency but possibly junior staff in the agency.  For example, an immature young typist who came into an office and saw some of the records might easily get misled about the work of an agency and the activities of the proprietor.</P>

    <P>If I could give an example of what I mean, it is quite likely that the format used for interviewing will be a form which can be placed on a desk so that the person interviewing can read everything off the form while interviewing the person.  It is quite possible that the comments of the placement person or interviewer, whoever it may be, in the employment agency, may be written on the face of the form in a special section just below the data on the person concerned.  In an agency where large <Col N="1436" /> numbers of people may be interviewed during the day it is important that the interviewer should have some little word-picture so that when he looks at the form again he will recognise the particular case, remember the particular person.  This may lead, for example, to the appearance on forms of such comments as &ldquo;This man is swarthy looking&rdquo; or &ldquo;This girl is a sexy looking girl&rdquo;&mdash; something of this kind.</P>
    <P>There have been cases of this in Britain where typists working in employment agency offices have seen forms, have drawn completely the wrong conclusions because of seeing this type of material on a form, and in some cases serious difficulties have arisen for the people who conducted the placement interviews because of the complaints made.  I am making this point as an example of the delicacies involved, many of them unexpected by people who do not fully understand the background of interviewing or who have no experience of placement work, and the sort of notes made on forms such as I referred to.</P>
    <P>Whilst I accept that the powers are important I think that, when it comes to the actual administration of this section and section 8, the training and role of the authorised officers will be extremely important.  It is also important that whatever regulations may be made for prescribing the form of records and the entries to be made in them will take account of the actual physical business of an agency keeping its records, how forms are most handily laid out, how comment should be separated from factual information and so on.  I thought these practical points might be worth making.</P>

      <P>In regard to this whole question of inspection and entering premises, the authorised officer will be, I hope, the proper type of person, the type of person who will be committed to treating as confidential anything they may find.  They will not normally be seeking information regarding individuals who have been interviewed in the office.  They will be concerned with the lay-out of the premises, to see that they are up to the <Col N="1437" /> standards required regarding ventilation, heating and space and that the work of the agency generally is conducted in a manner that would comply with the general requirements of the Bill as enacted?  It would not normally be part of their duty to inquire about individuals or the <i>curriculum vitae</i> of an individual.  The manager of a good employment agency would not have the confidential records of a private individual thrown on the desk for anybody to read.  Our officers would only be concerned to see that they keep the required records.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 6:</P>

      <P>This amendment actually arises out of a suggestion made by Senator O'Higgins on the Second Reading of the Bill when he suggested that the subsection was drawn in rather wide terms and could have the effect of rendering a secretary or another officer of a firm guilty of an offence although he had not knowingly contravened the Bill.  We saw some validity in this argument and, in order to obviate any doubt or any likelihood of that happening, the amendment by inserting the word &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; as suggested by Senator O'Higgins, is proposed.</P>
