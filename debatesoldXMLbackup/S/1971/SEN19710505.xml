The Members <Col N="2" /> of the House will appreciate that the right of the Seanad to annul would be completely negatived if this motion were not to be taken in time to have some effect on the order.

      <P>Amendments Nos. 1, 3 and 49 form a composite proposition and I suggest, by agreement, that they be taken together.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>

      <P>These amendments are consequential on amendment No. 43, which brings the terms &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo; and &ldquo;holding company&rdquo; into section 12.  Their effect is to transfer the definitions of these terms from section 14, to which they were confined, to section 1, where they will affect the Bill as a whole.  During the Committee Stage, Senator FitzGerald made the point that all definitions should be in one section.  He also said he did not think that the definition of &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo; in the Companies Act was a good definition and suggested that the definition in the North of Ireland Act, 1960, ought to be adopted.  Having considered this matter I do not think it desirable to depart from the definition already in the Companies Act.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to agree to these amendments which meet the points that I made on Committee Stage.  I am sorry the Minister will not consider the advantages of the definition of &ldquo;holding company&rdquo; in the North of Ireland Act, 1960, but I can well understand why he does not want to depart from the definitions which we have incorporated in the existing Companies Act.  I accept these amendments.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>Bill recommitted in respect of amendments No. 4 and 23.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 15, after &ldquo;whatsoever&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;, but does not include any such arrangement participation in which is obtained by effecting a policy of assurance upon human life with the holder of a licence under the Insurance Act, 1936&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of these two amendments is to exclude from the scope of the Bill schemes of collective investment associated with policies of life or industrial assurance effected with assurance companies licensed under the Insurance Act, 1936.  These schemes fall into two broad categories.  The first is a fund for investment either in securities or other property which forms an integral part of the insurance company's funds; for example, the Irish Life property modules.  The second is an arrangement whereby a separate management company, which is a subsidiary of the insurance company, manages a separate fund under a trust deed and the investments are held by <Col N="5" /> a trustee; for example, the Norwich Irish units policy.</P>
      <P>I decided to introduce these amendments after very careful consideration of representations which had been made to me by the insurance companies, and on being satisfied that the exclusion of insurance linked schemes would not affect the two main objectives of the Bill, which are to provide protection for investors and to promote investment in this country.</P>
      <P>Investment in this country is assured by the long-standing gentlemen's agreement with the life assurance companies under which they have undertaken to invest a proportion increasing to 80 per cent of their total funds here by the end of 1977.</P>
      <P>These two amendments are to exclude this category and it is arising from strong representations which have been made to me by insurance companies in this regard that I decided to introduce both these amendments at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad we are in Committee for this one.  I can understand that the Minister would have been under pressure to have an amendment of this kind, but I should have thought he could have made a concession which would have assisted the insurance companies in question. Without such a concession the Minister loses all control over such institutions because, as I understand this, all the restrictions on proportions that are proposed to be made by the Minister, all the protections that are to be given to citizens who subscribe for units in these modules&mdash;these property life-backed insurances&mdash;will lack the protection that this Bill gives them.  There will be no register in which will appear the information that the public or financial writers might wish to obtain about them.  There are no restrictions of any kind imposed on them as to the sort of things they would say, or as to the documents they would issue looking for subscriptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should have thought that, in relation to vested interests of great strength and authority, to yield to them a position which is denied to everyone else seems to me to be too great a concession <Col N="6" /> for the Minister to make.  What would be objectionable to them would be in particular the Minister making an order in regard to the proportion that they had to invest in Irish securities.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the Committee Stage the Minister was inclined to meet this question by having specified classes which would have regard to their existing insurance investments in Irish securities. That provision should have been sufficient. Looking over the entire scheme of the Bill there is prohibition of advertising in relation to unregistered unit trust schemes.  These will be schemes not subject to any of the provisions of the Bill.  There is an opinion which I voiced here, more to have it put on record than to have it stated as my opinion, and that is the English view, which is strongly held, that the manager and the trustee should be separated so completely that the Board of Trade would not register a unit trust scheme or allow it to be formed without the manager and trustee being definitely separated.</P>
    <P>In this case, one of the reasons given for giving them exemption is that they are to be closely managed together. There is no provision for the application of any of the statutory obligations. None of the orders in relation to unit trust schemes will be applied to them. None of the provisions in regard to the profit of the manager or subsidiaries of the manager or parents of subsidiaries or, taking the Minister's amendment on this in its entirety, of all those persons who will be subject to these controls, will apply.  There will be no necessity for audit of a particular kind.  There will be no obligation on them to furnish, other than such rights as the Minister has in relation to the insurance element in such schemes under the existing insurance law.  There is no provision for investigation into their schemes.  Many of the offences and punishments that officers of registered unit trust schemes will be liable to will not be in force.</P>
    <P>The Minister could consider if there is any merit in what I say.  I agree that we should go a long distance to help these life-backed schemes but not so as to leave them completely free from restrictions to which they cannot <Col N="7" /> object simply because they are life-backed. I take it that the representation the Minister has received is in regard to this and that it particularly relates to the proportion that one has invested in Irish securities or Irish property?</P>
    <P>If there are other grounds for these objections I think that it would assist the continued debate if we knew what these grounds were.  I am only guessing the one that seems to me to make sense.  I cannot see why they should object to making accounts available that would enable investors in these schemes to compare their performance with the performance of any other registered unit trust scheme or be obliged, for example, to buy back units, as they will not be obliged when this Bill is enacted, or be obliged to offer prices that are relevant to the assets underlying the trusts, which is a very significant feature in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I should have thought they should be bound to all of these things and that the Minister would deal with them as a specified class.  Under the Insurance Act, 1936, licences have been issued and are now held by a fair number of people.  I do not think that the class is effectively and finally controlled as the Acts now stand, but it does mean that perhaps the very people whom the Minister does not want to be free to collect money can do so, by making an arrangement with the company which has a licence under the Insurance Act to insure lives.  One of the objectives of this Bill would be wholly overcome by that arrangement because by it they would be free from the trammels and control of this Bill and all the funds in Ireland could flow out to them and the Minister would be in no better position than he is today to control that situation.  I am merely addressing these remarks so that the Minister may think about the full implications of giving a concession as wide as this to those who made the representation.  It is not particularly in my interest to make this contribution but I consider it very relevant to having a proper Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator draws attention <Col N="8" /> to the fact that in tabling these amendments I was influenced by representations made to me by insurance companies.  I noted what the Senator said about the effect of these amendments being to release the companies concerned from the terms of the Bill. On the other hand, I do not accept the argument that I have no control over those people.</P>
      <P>The Senator stressed one influencing factor, that is that the question of their commitment to investing or reinvesting a particular share of the money would have had an influence on me in relation to their joint ventures. This was not all of it, however.  I am satisfied, as it stands, that within the framework of the Insurance Act, 1936, I have the power under section 96 of that Act to amend, by order, the Schedules of the Act which set out the form of returns which insurance companies are required to furnish.  From the point of view of protecting the unit trust holder, the Senator is stressing to me that by going through with both those amendments I am foregoing the rights that I have under this Act in relation to any other unit trust schemes that could be established.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the implications of amendments Nos. 4 and 23, but I do not think they will have the effect the Senator visualises.  The Senator draws the conclusion that a saver who wants to buy units would be naturally satisfied that a trust registered under the scheme would, of necessity, be a far more sound investment than one that is not caught under this Bill. This would mean, and this is one of the things the Senator mentioned, that information regarding registration and a lot of other information that is required under the Bill, would be available arising from unit trusts schemes that would be commenced following the enactment of this legislation.  I have no reason for doubting our ability to control, by order, under section 96 of the Insurance Act, 1936, the people whom I am proposing to exclude under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that what the Minister has said does not ease my dissatisfaction with the proposed amendments to these sections. <Col N="9" /> I shall deal with the points as they occur to me.</P>
      <P>There are rights given to civilians here in relation to registered unit trust schemes.  The purchasers of modules in these life-backed schemes will not have the same rights: there are provisions for investigation, extended in a fairly satisfactory way, which will not apply. The Minister has power to extend the accounts in the form that insurance companies may give him and this is a useful power.  I do not know if he has ever exercised it but if I know the operations of the insurance code, these accounts are all put together in one volume.  They are not filed and there is no provision here that they should be filed in the register where the registered unit trust schemes are to be found.  There is no provision for controlling their management charges; there is no provision for the maintenance of assets to back the yields.</P>
      <P>I think I am right in saying that once a licence has been given, provided the terms of the 1936 Insurance Act are complied with, the Minister has no power to cancel that licence.  He would have to come to the Dáil and Seanad &mdash;or the Seanad and the Dáil as we would like the progression to be&mdash;to get an appropriate amendment to do that.  I think the Minister's advisers might well have a look at the Insurance Act to see whether it is beyond the wit of man to put the Minister into a position where, no matter how spurious he thought the arrangements which lay behind the company were, he would be obliged in law to give the licence to a newly formed insurance company which technically conformed with the requirements of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think he has made a virtue of this separation of the manager from the trustee.  I argued at the beginning that there was something to be said for examining the necessity for that on the grounds of the reputations of the institutions who would be involved.  The insurance companies that are operative in this field at the moment enjoy enormous reputation and respect for every aspect of their affairs and they are not to be thought of as engaging as parties in any operations that would have repercussions. But I can see the very <Col N="10" /> creation of this Bill giving inventive minds thoughts as to how the Bill could be overcome and how advantages could be found in being able to describe this as an Irish registered unit trust and being able to say things which, if it was a British registered unit trust, could not be said because the Board of Trade would have control of the form of a deed which would, in fact, oblige the trustees and managers to do various things.  There would be no authority here, as there is at this moment, to control such things. But the difference is, of course, that everybody has known a Unit Trust Bill was coming and has been awaiting its arrival before they did anything, if they intend to do anything.</P>
    <P>If I were involved on the other side I would see means whereby this whole Bill could be quickly overcome and people who wanted to establish a unit trust gaining from the reputation of established registered Irish unit trusts and, in fact, as free as birds in their operations.  I do not expect the Minister to do anything about this at this point but perhaps he would consider what I have said before this comes into the Dáil where he obviously could introduce an amendment along the lines I suggest whereby he can take power to exempt these bodies from certain provisions that, according to the representations made to him and which are convincing to him, they should not be subject to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I can certainly take cognisance of what the Senator said in the manner in which he finally put it.  I am quite conscious of the step I am taking in this regard.  I think the message that the Senator was spelling out to me was that it could be possible, arising from the introduction of this amendment, that somebody might have the capacity to dig up a spurious life assurance company and be able to opt out from this Bill in that manner, but they would have to get a licence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Which, subject to certain conditions, the Minister cannot refuse them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, subject to certain <Col N="11" /> conditions, agreed.  It is true that unit holders in the type of unit trust that we are talking about here would not have all of the forms of protection which are being provided for unit holders under this Bill, but they would have the protection provided for the life policy holders under the Insurance Acts.  If the protection provided by the Insurance Acts for the public is thought to be lacking in any way in the light of modern practice and modern developments, a Committee on Insurance which is at present sitting, although dealing specifically with motor insurance, will also be dealing with insurance in general.  I would expect they would make recommendations for improvements or general tightening up.</P>
      <P>I am anticipating that, arising from the report of that Committee on Insurance, I will have to introduce fresh legislation in this regard.  On the other hand, mindful of what the Senator has said and mindful of my own slight worries in this regard, I can give the House an assurance that before introducing this finalised Bill into the Dáil I will have a look at the aspects of it the Senator has presented to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 4 between lines 38 and 39 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  On the alteration of the terms of the deed (in due compliance with the provisions thereof) which expresses the unit trust scheme a copy of the deed as altered shall within 21 days of such alteration be deposited with the registrar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="14" /> (2)  On the change of the name of the unit trust scheme (in due compliance with the terms of the deed which expresses the unit trust scheme) particulars of the change of name shall within 21 days be deposited with the registrar.</P>
    <P>If this new section were adopted amendments Nos. 14 and 15 would then be consequential, but if the proposed new section were not adopted, I think Nos. 14 and 15 would fail.</P>
    <P>The best way to approach this is to look at the provisions of subsection (1) of section 4.  This gives the Minister power to direct the cancellation of a scheme upon a day specified in the direction.  He may do this in certain circumstances which are set out in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).  In relation to (b) he would be entitled to direct the cancellation of the registration if paragraph (f) of section 3 (1) were no longer fulfilled.  Section 3 (1) (f) reads:</P>
    <P>the deed aforesaid is deposited with the registrar,</P>
    <P>The scheme will not be a registered unit trust scheme until the registrar gives a certificate.  The registrar cannot give a certificate if the deed is not deposited.  The deed having been deposited, the Minister could not under this section direct cancellation because the provisions of paragraph (f) were no longer fulfilled.  Once the deed was deposited the requirement of that paragraph would have been fulfilled and, once fulfilled, would have been fulfilled forever unless he positively stole it back or it was lost and the loss could be imputed to him, but once he has deposited the deed he has deposited the deed and once he has deposited the deed and the other circumstances are fulfilled then the registrar will certify and the unit trust scheme will come into existence.  The Minister could not become satisfied that the requirement to deposit the deed was no longer fulfilled.  That relates to paragraph (f). Paragraph (g) provides that the name of the scheme is not, in the opinion of the Minister, undesirable.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a right to express himself as having an opinion that the name is undesirable or to say that it is desirable.  The registrar, having heard <Col N="15" /> his opinion, would then register and give a certificate that the unit trust scheme existed and the unit trust scheme would exist.  It would not be proper, in my view, if the Minister having expressed an opinion that the name of the scheme was desirable could subsequently become not satisfied that the name was not desirable. Therefore to give meaning to the intentions of section 4 as drafted, I propose a new section which would precede section 4 and which would read as set out in amendment No. 13.  Subsection (1) of the new section would deal with the position of (f), that is, on the deposit of the deed.  But on the alteration of the terms of the deed in due compliance with the provisions thereof&mdash;because they could not alter the deed unless the deed provided for its own alteration which expresses the unit trust scheme&mdash;a copy of the deed as altered shall within 21 days of such alteration be deposited with the registrar.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is faced with an alteration in the deed it would seem to me quite proper that he should be entitled to require that the scheme be cancelled because the original deed is in but there is an alteration in it which could deceive everyone if it is not deposited.  It should be deposited, and having been deposited the Minister is entitled to look at it and if he is no longer satisfied with the provisions of the deed as altered he should be entitled to cancel it.  I will link that up with the reading of subsection (1) (b) of section 4 to which I have already referred where the Minister is entitled to direct cancellation when</P>
    <P>the conditions specified in paragraphs (b), (c) and (f) of section 3 (1) of this Act are no longer fulfilled.</P>
    <P>Leaving out (b) and (c), just to take (f), relating to the deposit of a copy of the altered deed, there has been failure to comply with the provisions of the preceding section&mdash;that is the section which I have proposed in the amendment of this Bill.  Subsection (2) of the proposed new section provides an obligation on the people who are <Col N="16" /> running the unit trust scheme as follows:</P>
    <P>On the change of the name of the unit trust scheme (in due compliance with the terms of the deed which expresses the unit trust scheme) particulars of the change of name shall within 21 days be deposited with the registrar.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if they change their name there should be a clear obligation on them to notify the registrar of the change.  But in doing so they expose themselves to the possibility that, under section 4 or whatever the number of this section would be, if my proposed new section were accepted, the Minister would be entitled on considering the new name to form an opinion that the changed name was undesirable.  He would be prevented from having a whim&mdash;if the Minister would ever have a whim&mdash;that would have him approve of a name in February and disapprove of it in May; but he would be entitled to form a view that if a name which he orginally approved was changed to a new name the scheme must go, because he does not think the new name is desirable and he would be entitled to direct the registrar to cancel it.</P>
    <P>These three amendments amount to an amendment introducing a new section which makes it possible coherently to relate the right of the Minister to cancel registration, but involves consequential amendments such as are proposed in Nos. 14 and 15.  The topic is not very exciting but it does not seem to me to make sense at all to talk about the Minister saying that the conditions specified in (f) are no longer fulfilled; the deed as deposited fulfils the requirement of (f).  That is the end of that.  The Minister therefore could only be entitled to cancel it if a new deed, or an alteration has been made in that deed, for which there is no provision requiring him to register, has been made and is not registered.  Then it is right that at that point he could say: &ldquo;I do not like these new sections, new paragraphs, new clauses and I am no longer satisfied that the requirements of the preceding subsections are satisfied and I want to cancel them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Neither does it seem to make sense to say &ldquo;Right, the Minister should be <Col N="17" /> entitled to form a view, to change a view he has formed about the desirability of a name and then say that a name that he had once thought was desirable is now no longer desirable&rdquo;. It does seem to be right that a unit trust scheme which changes its name should be obliged to notify the registrar of the change; and it then seems to be right that if the changed name is one that the Minister still thinks is not desirable he should be empowered to cancel it.</P>
    <P>These amendments are designed to give power and meaning to section 4. They cannot in any way weaken it; they are intended to strengthen it.  It is right that the Minister should be in a position to approve of all alterations in deeds.  I do not see him having this power anywhere else.  It seems to be right that if he does not like the new name he should be entitled to disapprove of it in the most effective way open to him, by cancelling the scheme.  However, it does not seem to be right that he should be entitled to cancel a scheme the name of which he originally approved and of which he now disapproves, although no change has been made.  I do not think a court would give a great deal of strength to the interpretation of section 4 (1) as drafted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have studied amendment No. 13 and the consequential amendments Nos. 14 and 15.  The Senator is endeavouring to ensure here that an alteration of the terms of the deed be notified to the registrar within a given period, in relation to this amendment within 21 days.  With the exception of the covering of &ldquo;within 21 days&rdquo;, my amendment No. 50, with regard to notification as such, covers this aspect of the amendment moved by Senator FitzGerald.  Amendment No. 50, in subsection (d) covers the points made by Senator FitzGerald, the only difference being that I am substituting each quarter of a financial year or such other period as the Minister may determine.  The object of the exercise, from the Senator's point of view, is being met, although it is under a different heading.  My amendment does bring in the provision that <Col N="18" /> any change in ownership, or any change in the deed, must be notified to me. Because of that I feel that the object of the Senator's amendment is achieved by my amendment No. 50.  I do not need to accept amendment No. 13. There is nothing to stop me, of course, from specifying the 21 days under amendment No. 50, but we will get around to discussing that particular amendment.  One of the reasons for introducing that amendment was that on Committee Stage it was said that asking the manager to send in quarterly returns could prove a rather difficult operation and this is why in the amendment there is provision for such other period as the Minister might determine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not failed to note the provisions in amendment No. 50.  It would seem to me to be appropriate to interpose at this point, in relation to the cancellation of the scheme, before the section dealing with the cancellation of the scheme, a provision spelling out the requirement of deposits within a specified period of time, which would mean that, in relation to the terms of the deed and the Minister's power to cancel it, it would come quickly before him and not depend upon quarterly accounts and that in relation to the change of name of this scheme it would come quickly before him, within 21 days, and that he would be entitled to cancel it if it did not come quickly before him. In addition, he would specifically have the right to cancel if the new name was undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no provision anywhere in this Bill, even as amended, which would seem to me to entitle the Minister to disapprove of a changed name unless he is going to take the position, which seems to me to be very wrong, that he is entitled to change his mind about the original name which would be the logic of his having to take up the position that he could disapprove of a new name.  It also means that the references in section 4 to paragraphs (f) and (g) of subsection (1) of section 3 are wrong in so far as they do not incorporate the effect of the amendment of section 15.  Because <Col N="19" /> as drafted it is the terms of the original deed which must be complied with and if that is complied with and it is deposited with the registrar, whatever about any alteration to it, then it is only in that case that he is entitled to cancel the scheme.  It seems to me that he should be entitled to cancel the scheme if it is altered.  He has no power under this section to cancel the scheme if it is altered.  Even though it is deposited under amendment No. 50 he has no power to cancel a scheme because the name is no longer desirable unless he takes up the highly undesirable and unsatisfactory and bad position that a Minister who approves of a name as being desirable &mdash;this is a very serious operation by a Minister&mdash;is entitled to change his mind with regard to the earlier name. The Minister should have the power to cancel the scheme&mdash;either under my proposed new section or under the amendment arising from section 15&mdash; because he does not like the new name of the scheme.  There is no reference to the section which is amended by amendment No. 50 in the section dealing with the Minister's power of cancellation, which is section 4.  The Minister could be in the position that, notwithstanding his amendment No. 50, he would have no power without being forced in the court to argue&mdash; and this might be a fight&mdash;that the meaning of paragraph (f) includes that you have to write into paragraph (f) &ldquo;the deed aforesaid&rdquo;, which is after all the original deed, &ldquo;includes all alterations of the deed which he becomes aware of after the end of the quarter in which the change is made&rdquo; or&mdash;and this is a matter on which I do not think he would be given a great deal of attention&mdash;to argue that he was entitled at all times to change his mind with regard to the scheme originally named.  If he is not entitled to change his mind with regard to the original name then he has no power to invoke subsection (1) of section 4 because amendment No. 50 is not incorporated in any way as an amendment of paragraphs (f) or (g) of section 3. There is work to be done on that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to deal with amendments Nos. 17 and 21.  Amendment No. 17 relates to section 4 (3).  I make this point for the third time&mdash;I have already made it on Second Reading and on Committee Stage&mdash;it is conceivable that it would be in the public interest to cancel registered unit trust schemes and not in <Col N="22" /> the interests of the members.  I could conceive a situation in which somebody would go into the market and buy up all the units, get control of the registered trust scheme and get all the advantages of being a registered trust scheme, and do all sorts of things that the person who then got possession of these assets wanted to do with those assets which would be liquefiable.  He could use them for all sorts of projects that would be of more interest to himself&mdash;and perhaps of great interest to himself&mdash;but because he had effectively excluded everyone but himself it might not be in the public interest that the public's invested money should have been used in this way.  I cannot see what the Minister loses by giving himself the power in the alternative.  It limits him to becoming satisfied that it is in the public interest and in the interests of holders of units.  I am sorry I am not able to give a good example of this but it is conceivable that the public interest might not be suited where the interests of holders of units would be suited.</P>
    <P>This seems to be an opinion which the Minister is going to form subjectively. There is no provision here, for example, for a majority or a minority of the members of the unit trust scheme soliciting him to do this.  That would be a case where you would have minority rights being preserved by the Minister being requested, and an amendment of that kind would wholly overcome my difficulty with regard to that.  However, in anticipation of what the Minister may have to say about it, I do not wish to press it but I would ask him to consider it again before this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>I now wish to move on to amendment No. 21.  It is consequential on amendment No. 17 and I would like to make the same point with regard to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Senator said, he has spoken about this particular aspect on Second Stage and on Committee Stage and we had a discussion about it.  I have been looking at this and I was waiting for the Senator to move his amendment to see if it would be possible for him to instance a case where he could see a conflict of interests. <Col N="23" /> He did mention the case of a minority of unit holders feeling that their interests were not being properly attended to.  In that case the Minister could give a direction, which would be met under the original here, and it would be both in the interests of the public and of holders.  Subsection (3) does not say in the interests of the majority of holders of units.  I think it is flexible enough, if the Minister is satisfied that it is in the public interests and in the interests of holders.  I find it impossible to visualise a situation where something could, on the one hand, be in the public interest and, on the other hand, not in keeping with the interests of unit holders.</P>
      <P>The Senator visualised the situation whereby one person would be buying up the majority of units.  Even in such a case, the interests of the remaining holders, if it were felt that it was also in the public interest, could be covered in this section.  Having considered this I am quite satisfied that if a certain section of unit holders interests are affected and if the Minister also feels it is in the public interest to give a direction, then this section enables him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>From what the Minister has said I understand he does not envisage any conflict of interest between the public good or the good of the holders of the unit trust.  Possibly, it might be difficult to visualise such a situation arising just now.  We must, however, get back to one of the basic points which the Minister made on the early Stages of this Bill.  That is, it is to a large extent going to be an Irish unit trust, in that the Minister will prescribe a minimum proportion of shareholdings of Irish-owned or controlled companies.  It may be fanciful to imagine it but it is possible that foreign interests, in order to get control of a company in which there is a large proportion of Irish shareholdings, or Irish companies, may purchase the shares or large blocs of the shares.  This would immediately affect the price of the units to the benefit of the holders, but not necessarily in the national interest.  The Minister might allow himself some leeway <Col N="24" /> there by substituting, as the amendment suggests, the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; or, if he prefers, &ldquo;and/or&rdquo;, so that, in the event of such a situation arising as I have indicated the Minister could take action.  It can happen and I am sure the Minister knows of instances where the public good does, in fact, conflict with the good of owners or holders in companies.  An obvious example is that of an outside interest whose buying of the units might not be relished by the Government.  It would certainly benefit the shareholders because the price would rise, but it might not be in the best national interest.</P>

      <P>I do not have very much to say.  I think the advantage to the community lies with the proposals which are in these two amendments. <Col N="25" /> I challenge the quality of my own imagination in not being able to give illustrations of the uses which I think could be made of this.  Senator Russell has given one.  There could be a reverse sort of operation in which some people could come in to operate under the disguise of an Irish unit trust. They would become the interested persons. You might be in the position of not being able to say it was to their disadvantage that the scheme should be cancelled.  It might be very much to their disadvantage if you cancelled the scheme and yet you could not cancel the scheme unless it was not merely in the public interest but also not in their interests to have the scheme cancelled.  To carry that burden, with all the, I will not say chicanery, but the legal agility there can be with regard to designing devices within Acts, I would have thought the Minister would have been able to use the one or the other and that was the reason for my amendment.</P>
      <P>If our unit trust movement is designed by this Bill to be so operated as to get reputation in the financial world, it might be useful for people to get hold of one.  I am against the proportion being high, as the Minister knows from the amendment which I have put down but if you really want to overcome the proportion, I am bound to tell the Minister that there are various fairly recognised legal devices whereby things can become Irish securities without being Irish in the sense in which the Minister intends them to be.  The purchaser of a unit trust scheme could easily comply with the Minister's directions with regard to the proportion and have all the advantages of the reputation of an Irish unit trust and be free to invest, in reality, a much higher proportion outside the State.  The Minister may like to think a little further about this matter.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="26" /> In page 5, line 45, after &ldquo;scheme&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;other&rdquo; than advertisements offering to buy units of the scheme&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5), section 4, where the Minister proposes to cancel the registration of the unit trusts schemes, empowers him to require the manager to refrain from selling units and from publishing or procuring the publication of advertisements in relation to the scheme.  I can see why if he is unhappy about the unit trust scheme, he should prevent them selling units. However, it is not fair to investors in the scheme that during this time the ordinary procedures might not be adopted by the unit trusts scheme. For example, if they believed that, on appeal, the cancellation was going to be proved bad, they would not be in a position to be reminded of the unit trusts schemes preparedness to buy. They ought to know this, but how many people read the small print in documents that come from companies, and who can understand them anyhow? An advertisement is expressed in language which they are expected to understand.  I think the Minister should not be in a position to prevent them from advertising to buy units when there is a proposal to cancel. Precisely the same observations relate to amendment No. 22.</P>

      <P>I am opposed to these amendments.  In practice, the manager of a scheme who has been forbidden to advertise the sale of units would hardly publish an advertisement stating that he was willing to buy back units from the holders.  The Minister's power here to prohibit advertisements is permissive and he need not exercise it.  On the other hand, if I were to accept the amendment I would then be in the position that I would not have the power to prevent the manager from doing something which could in fact be wrong.  There are two sides to this.  For that reason the amendment is not one that appeals to me.</P>

      <P>In page 8, line 40, after <i>&ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil&rdquo;</i> to insert &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am not wedded to the words here but it seems to me to be very desirable that the public and the newspapers should know when these exemptions are granted or when the section is being operated to their disadvantage. The words &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; may not be the right words or words that are necessarily to be construed as meaning that registration is to take place all that quickly.  I know of a case where it took 153 days for a notice to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of a statutory obligation that should be published as soon as may be.  I do not know if &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; are necessarily the right words.  The Minister may have a formula that would be more precise than the words I have suggested.  However, it should be open to the Minister to exempt papers and not to publish in any of the Irish newspapers, but not to publish within any specified time in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> does seem to me to be wrong, in a matter affecting the public and the newspapers.  At the moment as the section stands he could effectively provide a statutory obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the experience of this that the Senator has.  However, in relation to statutory notices it is the standard practice to publish those <Col N="28" /> statutory notices at the earliest possible date.  I do not see any practical value in the proposed amendment.  From my experience, the words in the amendment: &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; may not be the best form of words.</P>
      <P>I have in mind a situation where an Order was made on a given date and the statutory notice appeared in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> about eight days later.  A copy of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> appeared in the meantime and it was suggested that it could be contended that that notice would not have complied with what we have here &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; on the basis that it should have appeared on the previous Friday rather than on the Monday or Tuesday afterwards because the Tuesday afterwards was not &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; after the Order was made.  Certainly from my experience in that regard, and mindful of what the standard practice is, where normally I would look upon the suggested amendment as being a reasonable one, even with amended wording, I think that by writing this in we are leaving a loophole whereby somebody could come along afterwards and say that the order should have appeared a week before.  I can appreciate the Senator's views when he mentioned 13 months or 13 weeks or something like that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is very much the exception.  Certainly the, statutory notices normally appear quickly after an order is made.  In relation to this piece of legislation one can assume that the standard practice will be followed and we have it spelled out in the section here that:</P>
      <P>Whenever the Minister excercises a power under this subsection, notice of such exercise and its nature and the name of the newspaper or magazine to which it relates shall be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am worried about this.  I was not happy with the words I put down, which just came easily to me.  I think we have had quite a number of Bills here where <Col N="29" /> there were provisions actually specifying days within which publications were to be made.  In most of the cases of these publications, the publication is required for formal reasons, reasons of proof, and to see that the Minister's statutory duty is compiled with.  Interested parties get to know about them.  I made the point on Committee Stage that there should be a requirement here on the Minister to publish in the four national newspapers the fact that he was exercising this power of exemption.  I said that <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> was not a bestseller and that people did not rush down early in the morning to buy copies of it.  But the Minister told me that one would be surprised at how early in the morning editors of newspapers look at it, or words to that effect.  For that reason I did not press because I felt they would pretty quickly see whether an exemption was granted and to what extent they were being deprived of revenue that was being allowed flow into the foreign newspapers who were being given the benefit of the exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that in this case where it profoundly affects the interests of Irish newspapers there ought to be a direct obligation on the Minister, if he is exempting foreign newspapers from an obligation which is being imposed on Irish newspapers, they should be notified of it either by publication in their own advertising column or that he should do this within a specified time in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> It is not a very difficult thing.  It is not as if such an exemption order will have in it elements or difficulties we are aware certain other kinds of orders can have with regard to the matters that have to be considered before they are made up and where even the very form of the order may be of the greatest importance.  In this particular case it seems to me that there will be an order in a very simple form exempting such-and-such a newspaper, presumably for such-and-such a period.  If you put in that notice of the order had to appear in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> within seven issues after the date of the making of the order, or something of that kind, then it would be very easy to set up a practical <Col N="30" /> administrative operation whereby that would be complied with.  It is not as if the exemption order is going to present any difficulties in its terms. Presumably each exemption order will be in the same form.  It will exempt a particular newspaper.  I do not know that the Minister will even be called upon to specify his reasons for giving an exemption.  My own expectations is that he will exempt the lot of them when he finds how he has to operate this section.</P>

      <P>This amendment meets Senator Alexis FitzGerald's previous point that a manager should not automatically be guilty of an offence in relation to publication of a prohibited advertisement because it is conceivable that publication could be made without his authority or knowledge.  The amendment will not provide a let out for a manager who knowingly publishes a prohibited advertisement.  He would be caught by the phrase &ldquo;any person who procures such publishing&rdquo; in section 7, subsection (3).  Arising from the views expressed by the Senator on the Committee Stage, I put in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 43 and 44, to delete &ldquo;the person who publishes the advertisement and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> As subsection (3) is amended now, where an advertisement is published in contravention of subsection (1), which prohibits the publication of advertisements in relation to or referring to a unit trust scheme that is not a registered unit trust, the person who publishes the advertisement and any person who procures such publishing shall each be guilty of an offence.  I am going to take for the purposes of construing the classes of the persons who are affected here the person who publishes the advertisement as being the publisher of the newspaper in question and any person who procures such publishing as being some unauthorised agent of the manager who for his own good business puts in the advertisement.  By this amendment proposed by Senator Russell and myself it is proposed to delete from the offence the person who publishes the advertisement and leave the only person guilty the person who without authorisation put in the advertisement.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to cast an appalling obligation on the busy men who manage the editorial work involved in preparing newspapers, that they should be obliged to know what is and what is not a registered unit trust scheme and to keep themselves up to date with this information without having daily inspection of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.  Not even telling them that an exemption has been made under subsection (2) and their not being aware that a registered unit trust scheme has been cancelled by the Minister under section 4, which provides for the cancellation of the registered unit trust scheme, involves them in further obligations to be sure that they comply with this section.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister visualises this will operate.  If the deed is deposited, if the Minister regards the name as desirable, if the Minister is satisfied that this scheme is such as to secure that every trust created in pursuance of the scheme is expressed in a deed which complies with certain provisions and if he is satisfied with the probity of the manager or the trustee, I do not know at what point of time and in what fashion the public are <Col N="32" /> going to be informed of the actual registration.  It seems to me that there is no obligation on anyone to announce to the public that a new scheme has been registered.  To ensure that they were not committing an offence under section 7, the newspapers would have to have a posse of persons operative daily to check on the registration and the registrar would be required the moment he registers a scheme to say it is all right and enter all about it in a book which is open to the public. There is no obligation on him not to do that at midnight, if he wants to, and the newspapers are coming out the following day.</P>
    <P>The exposure to liability here of the newspapers is too considerable and there should be some words written in. If my proposal is not acceptable, there should be some reservation of liability to those cases of which he had notification that, in fact, the unit trust scheme was not, a registered unit trust scheme so that it would be the registrar's duty to see that the notice was conveyed, or else that it should not be the duty of the newspaper to be liable or so to act so as to ensure that they would not be liable in all circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Alexis FitzGerald and to point out that there may be practical difficulties in establishing who the person is who publishes, having regard to the complex organisation which the modern newspaper is.  It seems to me, too, that the person who is guilty and should be punished under this section is the person who procures such publishing.  That is quite clear and specific.  It would be very difficult, and possibly very wrong, to try and establish somebody who, if it is an individual, published in good faith or, as is most likely, a number of individuals who are concerned with the publishing.  From the Minister's point of view it would certainly clarify this section and make it far more easy to implement if the words suggested in the amendment were deleted.</P>

      <P>Listening to Senator Alexis FitzGerald a few moments ago on this question of the difficulty the publisher would have in dealing with <Col N="33" /> this&mdash;shoals of advertisements coming in at midnight&mdash;I get the impression that unit trusts are being visualised as something like the opening of bingo halls.  We can logically assume that we are not going to have a surfeit of unit trust schemes the very minute this legislation is through.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  It is reaching the stage now that I am afraid to sneeze.  The reason why Senator Alexis FitzGerald is suggesting that we exclude the person who publishes the advertisement is because he feels it is unfair to impose a regulation here which makes that person an offender in the event of his taking an advertisement and publishing it in all good faith. In fact, all the newspaper publisher is required to do under section 7 is to check a simple fact, as to whether or not a unit trust scheme is registered.  I do not accept that it is as complicated or as difficult as the Senator says. He pointed out that under the Bill the registrar has to keep a list.  I cannot visualise that being a very extensive or very exhaustive list and I do not think there is a problem in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, Senator Russell raised the question of establishing who is the person who publishes the advertisement, and he asked me to be a little more explicit about that.  That may be difficult.  But there must be an onus on all publishers.  Publication of an advertisement can be through various media&mdash;from TV down to the simple poster with the printer's name at the end.  It is necessary for me in this Bill to place joint responsibility on the person who procures the publication and also the person who publishes. As evident from the debate in the Dáil last week, there is no trouble in <Col N="34" /> identifying the publisher of a publication regarding illegal organisations but there is a great problem trying to identify the person who procures the publication.</P>
    <P>I am not lightly opposing any amendment moved by Senators FitzGerald and Russell.  I am opposing them having taken a balanced view of the situation and having weighed up all of the factors involved.  There are some I have accepted, others I propose to accept, and others that I am opposing. I think I am fully justified, having weighed the pros and cons, in opposing this amendment and insisting that both the procurer of the publication and the person who publishes should be responsible.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, the essence of the case made by Senator FitzGerald is to protect the innocent publisher: the person who, inadvertently, not knowing that the trust was registered, accepts an advertisement. It seems to me that the Minister, by looking at this again, might meet Senator FitzGerald's point and at the same time uphold the strength of the section by putting it on the basis of where an advertisement is knowingly published in contravention of the section.  That would meet the point made by Senator FitzGerald and, at the same time, I think it would leave the penalties and the control in the Bill.</P>

If the newspaper was aware that no liability could result to them for publishing it they might be more willing to accept it, even knowing that the trust was not registered here. There would be danger in not having any sanction, though I would agree with Senator O'Higgins that it might be possible to insert a provision that it be knowingly.</P>

      <P>I am not pressing my amendment in the light of what has been said.  If Senator O'Higgins's suggestion is adopted, the words &ldquo;in knowing contravention&rdquo; or something of that kind would appear. I know that this casts the burden of proof on the Minister, but I do not think it a heavy burden if he adopted the practice of formally addressing a letter to the manager or editor of the papers that would be likely to take these advertisements, keeping them up to date as to the unit trusts that were entitled to advertise and the unit trusts that were not entitled to advertise.  I suppose we would have to make an exception in the case of those not affected as a result of the amendments which have been made earlier today with regard to the arrangements with the insurance companies, because that will confuse editors too in due course.  I think the section could be improved and these are my last words on it.  I will now, with your permission, withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 9, line 48 after &ldquo;order&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and different charges may be specified in the order in relation to different schemes according to the nature, distinctive features and the policy to be applied in relation to different schemes&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must confess that I am not happy that this matter of charges should <Col N="36" /> appear in the Bill at all.  I think it would be better if it were a matter to be worked out between the manager and the trustee.  A reputable trustee will always see that the manager's charges are right anyhow.  If it has to be in the Bill I think the Minister should recognise expressly that the charges to be allowed differ enormously according to the nature of the trust which is being operated.  If one has £10,000 units the cost of administering that trust and the rate of charges that are proper to be made would be quite different to units of £5 where the overhead cost would be much more considerable and the charges any manager would be entitled to make should be much greater.  This is one of the advantages for people who have money to be able to put their large units into large unit trusts, because the fact of having only a small register compared to a vast one means the management costs are very much less.  Maybe the Minister is satisfied that he has this power already but, as I read this, he seems to be in a position where he will make an order for a scale of charges which will be applicable to all unit trusts.  I believe that the charges vary enormously in practice in the UK, which is the only place which we really know, where the Board of Trade requirements are applied but not in a statutory way. If he has any doubt about his ability to specify different charges for different trusts he ought to take that power.</P>

      <P>This is to give the Minister power to provide for a different proportion for any specified scheme.  I would strongly urge him to take this power.  He may be presented with very attractive schemes of a highly individual character but they may not fall within any specified class.  The net effect of his registering them and giving them a different proportion for investment in Ireland might be to gain that proportion for investment in Ireland which it would not otherwise have got because it would not otherwise fall within the range of specified class in question. It also might be, and here I speak with some awareness, that existing unit trusts that have already substantial Irish investors might be able to present to the Minister a case for a different proportion to be applied to them for foreign investment, having regard to the fact that they would be bringing home the capital which is being invested by Irish residents in the foreign trust into an Irish unit trust, bringing service advantages here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="38" /> There are all sorts of services industries that represent great wealth-earning concerns.  This was recognised in an amendment during the last year or so to the arrangements with regard to Shannon where certain service-rendering engineering companies were allowed get the benefits of the tax-free provisions at Shannon.  I do not like to specify a proportion, but I do not think I am wrong in saying that the majority of the work done in New York city is service-rendering, and I would say that is one of the richest parts of the globe.  The Minister ought not to exclude from consideration the actual creation of unit trusts here, the transfer of their administration, and the transfer of their skilled financiers to reside here and pay taxes here and who would, with their interests, tend to look around them to see what prospects there are for stimulating activities here when they get themselves past the stage of being deluded by the charm of our people to the point of considering investing in projects here.</P>
    <P>Even if the net capital gain was not immediately obvious, if you have a unit trust scheme which specifies a proportion in relation to it&mdash;it need not be for an indefinite period of time&mdash; the Minister could have a look at the performance of the trust after a few years and measure out what advantages or disadvantages it has brought to the economy.  If he ties himself to the position that he can only make an order which is different if it relates to particular classes he may deny himself the opportunity of registering unit trusts which are of an entirely individual character, which could not be put together into a class and which should, for the benefits that the economy would get, have the rights of registration under this Bill when enacted.  What I have said on that amendment covers also the next amendment.</P>

      <P>I find myself once again opposing this amendment.  I think it is going very far in giving the Minister power to allow him to particularise in any specific scheme.  Although Senator FitzGerald is looking at it from the point of view of a scheme wishing to have special consideration, it would empower the Minister to require that a <Col N="39" /> particular scheme would have to have a certain proportion of Irish securities or other property in the State.  Therefore, the Minister would be empowered to discriminate against a particular scheme and this type of discrimination might be held by the courts subsequently when challenged to be unconstitutional. In the Supreme Court decision on the East Donegal Co-op. Livestock case the provision allowing the Minister to exempt any particular business was held to be unconstitutional. In that case Mr. Justice Walsh, in the Supreme Court, said:</P>
      <P>The constitutional right of the Oireachtas in its legislation to take account of difference of social function, difference in capacity, physical and moral, does not extend to delegating that power to members of the Executive, to the exclusion of the Oireachtas, to decide as between individuals, all of whom are by the terms of the Act bound by it, which ones shall be exempted from its application unless such exemption were necessary to avoid the infringement of a constitutional right in such individuals which, because of circumstances peculiar to them, would necessarily be imposed upon them by the application of the statutory provision without such exemption. In the view of this Court the provision purporting to grant power to the Minister to exempt &ldquo;any particular business&rdquo; is invalid having regard to the provisions of the Constitution. The same considerations do not apply with regard to the power to exempt businesses of a particular class or kind because this primarily does not involve the making of a distinction between citizens but rather permits the making of a distinction which would benefit or otherwise affect all businesses of the particular class or kind involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this is directly analogous to that.  Whereas the Minister may decide that certain unit trusts of a particular class or kind must invest in a certain proportion of Irish securities, to allow the Minister to particularise a specified scheme would, on the basis of the reasoning of the Supreme Court, be <Col N="40" /> failing to treat citizens&mdash;and here the Minister would have <i>locus standi</i> with legal persons&mdash;equally by allowing the Minister, within the terms of the Act, to discriminate against a particular scheme.  For that reason I find myself opposing this amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 9, line 63, after &ldquo;State&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;provided that the proportion so specified of any such property shall not exceed in value 30 per centum of such property&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is only to give the Minister an opportunity of disclosing his mind, as it is at the moment, with regard to this proportion.  I believe it would be far better for the country if we had successful unit trusts with the hope that we could stop capital flowing out.  It is going to flow out anyway until you have exchange control with all the disadvantages of exchange control.  If we have some limitation placed on the percentage that may be specified in the statute this would be an encouraging gesture to people who see great opportunities for building up this new type of financial institution with its headquarters in Ireland and bringing to Ireland people with financial know-how who, being here, would benefit by their presence the whole of the economy and the whole community.  Perhaps the Minister would say whether he is delighted with the proportion specified or what reason he has for finding it too limiting.  Some limitation ought to be imposed.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Senator FitzGerald.  I was one of a number of Senators who spoke on this particular point, not with any desire to be un-national in this regard but having some business experience of what might constitute a successful unit trust in this country.  I think it was the feeling of a number of Senators, including myself that, certainly at the early stages, a reasonable figure should be applied to the proportion of Irish property or Irish securities to be included in the unit trust scheme.  I do not know whether the Minister has been influenced by these arguments which came from both sides of the House, but I certainly would ask him to be realistic in his proportion.  I agree with Senator FitzGerald that it would be helpful to the unit trust scheme to indicate at the outset a realistic figure for the proportion of Irish property and securities to be included in the scheme.  Rather than doing a disservice to the scheme it would be giving it an impetus which a scheme of this nature will require in its early days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving this amendment Senator FitzGerald said it was specifically to give me an opportunity of expressing my views.  It is understandable that I would not want the amount&mdash;here it says &ldquo;not exceeding in value 30 per cent of such property&rdquo;&mdash;written into the Bill as such.  I do not think this approach with no provision for amendments or alterations, would be the proper one.</P>
      <P>As I said during the Second Stage debate, I fully appreciate the need for a unit trust to invest a certain amount outside the country.  It is because of this that I provided in the Bill for the determining by the Minister at any given time of the amount which must be invested in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Russell said people from both sides of the House here expressed views which suggested that I should set a reasonably low level in order to encourage this type of small saving as much as possible.  Other people in the House suggested a figure of almost 100 per cent.  I do not think this is the time to spell out the amount I have in mind, even if I had positively made <Col N="42" /> up my mind as to the amount which should be indicated.  My ideas are flexible and this piece of legislation will have to be taken through the Dáil. The amendment, as proposed here, would have to be opposed by me because it would be specifying this 30 per cent as being a fixed proportion. It would not be proper for me to accept that amendment.</P>

      <P>Am I to understand that it is proposed merely to introduce a ceiling on the amount that the Minister could require?  It could be argued that the amount invested in Irish securities would be fundamental to the whole Bill and it might be proper to introduce a ceiling that would be known within which the Minister would have flexibility in weighing up other considerations.  It might be of value if this was written into the Bill rather than unknown and, therefore, subject only to the Minister's power by order to vary it from anything from 0-100 per cent.</P>

      <P>My only objection to the amendment is that it is restricted to property.  The market in Irish securities is such a limited one that it would be extremely doubtful if any trust could embark in Ireland in a satisfactory way.  If a unit trust comes in looking for 200,000 to 300,000 shares in Irish equities, the market would be in a state of chaos before the week was out.  Property seemed to be a wise thing to bring in.  If you limit the investment in property to 30 per cent you will discourage anyone from starting at all.  If it had been 30 per cent of the equities or any company's equities, it might be a different matter. I would be unwise to limit in the Bill the value of property to 30 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I must immediately confess to seeing a piece of very bad drafting there.  Senator Sheldon has drawn my attention to it. I had intended that amendment to take in all the funds in the unit trust scheme and to include Irish securities. &ldquo;The property concerned&rdquo; seemed to take in everything in the unit trust. I meant of course Irish securities and <Col N="43" /> property.  I must confess to that blunder.</P>
      <P>With regard to percentage, I am not very anxious, except that to keep this figure undetermined by the Minister and not known to the legislators is not good for the legislation.  We should know what the policy of the administration is in regard to this.  There lies behind this Bill a class of attitudes. There are some people who are interested in establishing a unit trust movement which would be successful and want to encourage it, and who have studied how these unit trusts work and have so provided for them.  Then there is the negative thinking that, short of exchange control, we will try and hold back as much of the savings of our people that flow out elsewhere and that we will do all we can to prevent such outflow.  I am convinced that, short of exchange control, this will not happen.  The Irish investors will find out quickly where they will get the best return for their money and that is where they will go. Attempting to fix too high a proportion will prevent investment in Irish trust movements unless they are nonregistered, insurance backed, where they will have the advantage of the confidence of the particular institutions they support by their investments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many financial people who are quite interested in establishing unit trusts here, whose presence here would be helpful to the economy.  I am not talking in terms of one or two. There are many more.  They regard this Bill as not having a specified proportion; and it is making it impossible for them to establish themselves here, if it goes through without their knowing where they stand with regard to the proportion of investment in Irish securities. This is not because of any lack of confidence.  The fact that they want to establish unit trusts here means that they have confidence in the future of the country.  Generally, on the question of how you conduct a portfolio investment for a large number of people, you spread it and they have regard to the actual size and the thinness of the Irish stock market.  They are not enamoured of fixed interest securities <Col N="44" /> which would be the only thing that they could be sure of realising quickly.  If the habits of the Government broker are examined it will be found that this will be done on sale generally at a loss.  There is a marking down process which takes place when you actually start selling back to the Government stock that they have issued. This is not very attractive for a unit trust manager who wants to make money, because it is only on the successful performance of his unit trust that he will attract further funds.  However, as I have faith in the future of the country and believe in the usefulness of these financial institutions, and more of them, I should like to see a Bill enacted which would be attractive and not putting off.  The Minister said &mdash;and I understand him&mdash;that he does not know what his mind is at the moment as to the proportion that he ought to specify.  He ought to try to make it up as soon as possible and let people then decide if it is worth while pursuing their various schemes.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 3, to delete &ldquo;, estimated by the Minister,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would be able to tell me that under some other section or some other subsection of this section he may make an order which will express the mechanics of this thing and <Col N="45" /> how it will work.  He will have unit trusts obliged to invest in Irish securities and Irish property up to a certain percentage&mdash;whatever that may be ordered to be.  In relation to the property, other than Irish securities, the value is to be determined by the Minister. The accounts are to be made every quarter.  What is the procedure whereby the Minister is to be informed of the property to be held at the end of the quarter, so that he can estimate the value of it in time for the unit trust to make its report as to the value at the end of the quarter?  What length of time does he require to do that? Does this involve an addition to the Minister's staff who will be asked to do work which could be done by people of reputation in the private sphere who are competent to do this and who are skilled in this matter of valuing?  What is the point in having additional civil servants doing what under unit trust schemes operative all over the world is done by people with professional qualification?  With a section such as this, clients will be endangering themselves in the most appalling way if they inflate values.</P>
    <P>It is to be presumed that there will be changes in the portfolio holdings of property, if not from quarter to quarter, from year to year.  It will not be a case of a once-and-for-all value because the valuations will change with inflation, will change with changing tax laws, will change perhaps by different lettings being made, because a lease has passed into its seventh year and the rent has now gone up by £2,000, £5,000 a year, or by whatever it might be, and a different value ought to be made in relation to it.  The Minister should tell me where he will spell all this out, how, as a matter of machinery, he will get it done, how, as a matter of machinery, the information will be provided to the unit trusts scheme, so that the unit trusts scheme can comply with that other section whereby every quarter they are required to return the values of the units.</P>
    <P>Further, how will the Minister's valuation be made available to deal with the bid and offer price of the units which must constantly be quoted by the unit trusts scheme?  Does this mean <Col N="46" /> that not merely in relation to the position at the end of the quarter, but in relation to any valuation of the property which forms part of the unit trust, the Minister has to be consulted, with cost and difficulty for the unit trust, as well as for the Department? In effect this would involve them in the management of all the registered Irish unit trust schemes.</P>
    <P>Consequential on the deletion of the words &ldquo;estimated by the Minister&rdquo;, I put down as an amendment &ldquo;a method&rdquo; because it would be easier to see how you value quoted securities. Your broker will tell you that they issue a piece of paper every day telling you what the offered prices were for the different securities and presumably that would be our guide in relation to Irish securities.  You get similar information in relation to British securities and most other markets that are recognised. I was not quite satisfied about tying ourselves to the Federation of Stock Exchanges of Great Britain and Ireland, but in so far as the Dublin Stock Exchange forms part of that federation I thought it sensible to do so.  That was why I put down amendment No. 32, and at this stage perhaps I should read it because it is intended to take in not merely the quoted securities, but other property, even those cases where the investment is not necessarily a quoted one at all.  Very often unit trust managers go into situations ahead of quotations because of the fact they are informed that there will be quotations, and they take shares in unquoted companies.  There will be the job of valuing the unquoted security where there is no quotation for that security to be found on any stock exchange.</P>
    <P>I should now like to read to the House amendment No. 32, and to see if Senator Sheldon will be able to point out if there are drafting errors in it. It reads as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;value&rdquo; with reference to an investment at any given time means the value thereof calculated by reference to either the lowest available market dealing offered price or the highest available market dealing bid price (according to the context) at that time quoted on any recognised Stock <Col N="47" /> Exchange being a member of the Federation of Stock Exchanges of Great Britain and Ireland or if not so quoted in the case of securities as quoted or in the case of property other than securities as determined by a competent person firm or corporation in any part of the world for such amount of the investment in question as the managers may consider in the circumstances to provide a fair criterion or if no such price is available such price as may be certified by an approved broker.</P>
    <P>That is to save the Minister from having to introduce an increased estimate next year for the number of new people he will have to take into his Department to operate the Unit Trusts Bill. It is well precedented, and if there are defects in the language they are not mine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping for a moment that Senator Sheldon would take it up.  It must be appreciated that there could be and possibly would be a conflict of opinion on the value of property for the purposes of calculating the proportion to be invested in the State.  This is referring to amendment No. 31.  The value of securities can usually be ascertained by reference to the prices quoted on the Stock Exchange, and this was instanced by the Senator, but there can be a wide divergence of opinion on the value of a building.  The amendment seeks to take from the Minister the right to estimate the value of the property concerned and this is considered unacceptable. The Minister must determine value in a realistic way and must not act in an arbitrary way or capriciously in any shape or form.  Having said that, I think the Senator's second amendment attempts to define something which is extremely difficult to define.  In fact, it illustrates the difficulty involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my speech on the Second Stage I emphasised that it was not possible in legislation of this kind, where it was necessary to make due allowance for flexibility, to put all the requirements into the Bill.  As I saw it, the whole approach to this legislation was that the Bill should provide a framework <Col N="48" /> which would include the essential basic provisions but would leave the details to be settled in the light of experience and, if necessary, by orders made after consultation with the interests concerned. In the normal course, as far as value is concerned, the Minister would be inclined to accept the manager's view on value provided it was reasonable but would have to reserve the right to reject anything unreasonable.  On the other hand, the Senator wanted to know how the Minister could determine the reasonable value.  I think the flexibility which is here is essential where so many matters of detail are involved.  I feel that the question of defining &ldquo;value&rdquo; should not be considered at this stage.  I would go further and say that, if and when the need arises, the term can be defined in an order under section 8.  I do not think that it is wise at the present time to follow the elaborate definition the Senator sets out here.  He read out his amendment No. 32, which ends by saying: &ldquo;if no such price is available such price as may be certified by an approved broker.&rdquo;  Here we have the problem of the Minister having to select a broker.  He could run into great difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Except the Minister is not proposing to do it because he is tying his hand to this paragraph by reference to the value estimated by the Minister.  I would withdraw very happily these two amendments if the words &ldquo;estimated by the Minister&rdquo; were deleted and the matter were determined by order. When he gets down to the details of this he will find that he will have to take the reputable broker's value of an unquoted company, the reputable valuer's value of property which may be situated anywhere in the world. As this Bill has been designed, it is not likely that non-Irish property will be bought, but some of it could be bought.  Then it could be very far away.  The obviously sensible thing would be that the Minister would know or cause an inquiry to be made as to who is reputable in Jamaica, the Bahamas or wherever else property is accelerating in value, the south of Spain and so on.  May I say that this is really the duty of the trustee to see that the manager gets his property valued and the unquoted securities valued properly by reputable and respectable people and the Minister should take that from them until the day he finds they are no longer reputable and respectable and then cancel the registered unit trust scheme they are operating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to wander into a discussion about the civil servants and <Col N="50" /> power and the politicians and very often their lack of power and the public.  The general assumption is that everything that is done right is done by the bureaucracy and that nothing can be done right unless the bureaucracy checks it to see that it is right. I think this is a completely wrong philosophy, a completely wrong approach, and adds unnecessarily to the staffs in the Departments of State. If we had a separate motion on that I would go through it with a long list of personnel, not knowing the persons' names, but people who are holding down jobs that are quite unnecessary and costing a lot of money to the country, too, by holding them.</P>
    <P>Take the Board of Trade.  Does the Board of Trade go in for this nonsense? Of course, it does not.  There is no question of the Board of Trade intervening in estimating values of unquoted securities for example.  There seems to be some distinction.  I may have been incorrect when I said at an earlier stage that the Board of Trade do not approve of any scheme with investments in property.  I saw over the weekend, schemes advertising property trusts but they seem to be all life insurance linked property trusts, which meant that they were assured of the liquidity of the insurance company to guarantee the risks involved in owning the property.  You will find that the President of the Board of Trade does not seek to take to himself this power which involves an interference that is unnecessary with the operations of these schemes.  I do not know how the Minister is going to be in a position constantly to estimate.  Say this is a success and you have 20 unit trusts. You will certainly have to have 50 to 100 people employed looking after daily queries as to how their property is to be valued and you will have to have lawyers examining the titles before any valuers will revalue them. As I said, I did not draft my amendment. It was taken firmly out of a leading unit trust, and I found the same repeated in many other unit trust documents.  I would accept the alternative quite happily: the Minister taking power to specify by order how this valuation is to be done.  I am sure when <Col N="51" /> he gets down to the details of it he will see that running it economically from the State's point of view will be an essential feature of success for the unit trust movement and the operation of the schemes.</P>

      <P>These amendments are all drafting changes designed to tighten up the working of subsection (8) (3) (c) by enabling me to determine what proportion of investment in the unit trust should be deemed to be investment in the State.  As it stood the shares of a foreign company could be deemed to be Irish securities if issued in the State. This was a point raised by Senator FitzGerald on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Minister but I would like if he did not sit down.  Paragraph (c) says:</P>
      <P>Where securities are held under any trust created under a registered trust scheme&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i) in case any of the securities are shares or debentures ... of a body <Col N="52" /> corporate carrying on a business the whole of which is, in the opinion of the Minister, carried on in the State, the whole of those securities,</P>
    <P>Now you say in this amendment:</P>
    <P>other than an arrangement to which this paragraph applies.</P>
    <P>Where is the arrangement to which this paragraph applies which excepts such a case?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in amendment No. 37.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>An arrangement is defined for the purposes of this paragraph as:</P>
      <P>any arrangement made for the purpose, or having the effect, of providing facilities for the participation by the public in profits or income arising from the acquisition, holding, management or disposal of securities or any other property whatsoever.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to write in these words to exclude any arrangement whereby people would subscribe for money to acquire, hold, manage or dispose of securities or other property.  Any such arrangement would be excluded as being not Irish under the proposed amendment in line 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Where there is an investment by a unit trust in another unit trust, to determine what proportion of it is Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If you had a company carrying on business which the Minister thought was wholly being carried on in the State, the whole of these securities would be taken as Irish other than investments which resulted from special arrangements made by the company in question whereby money was subscirbed by the public to be invested in other unit trust schemes that might not be subject to this Bill.  If a company doing such business as buying or selling leather want to expand their powers to engage in managing and holding securities or investing in property, provided they can get a requisite number of their members to agree to the proposition and there is no objection which is supported by the court, they <Col N="53" /> can do that.  If they issue securities to the public in response to this, telling the public what this money is to be used for, and they then proceed to invest the moneys in buying securities, investing in investment trust companies or investing in unit trusts, are all such investments then excluded even if some of them are Irish?  Surely this would not be right?  There are mixed companies which, as we know, do not issue to the public.  One knows of private companies that are vastly liquid and have large amounts of money which they invest in securities as well as the money which they use in their businesses. A situation can be seen in which a progressive company would say: &ldquo;We would like to diversify and engage in a marriage with the merchant bank and have an investment trust operation.&rdquo;  Would the Minister's exclusion not have the effect that he could not count as Irish investments that were made in Irish unit trusts to the extent that he could form the view that they were to a proportion Irish, represented by the underlying assets, and that it would exclude also investments in investment trust companies or in any investment, some of which might be Irish?</P>
      <P>I will accept as consequential amendments Nos. 33 and 34 if amendment No. 37 effectively achieves what it is designed to achieve and then should be supported.  I do not know if a section of the Bill can be recommitted at this Stage.  It is very hard to debate this series of amendments on the basis of one speech by one person and then a reply, because I am simply trying to ascertain the meaning.  I think that the effect of this exclusion of arrangement where it is provided does not meet the point which I made at all.  I will, in a cold-blooded way, make the point to the Minister that I think Irish securities could be securities which are issued here but not necessarily issued by an Irish body corporate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, according to our law, bearer securities issued by companies in Vietnam, Spain or Liechtenstein, Luxembourg or any of these companies that are used for tax saving purposes could be brought to Dublin and put in the <Col N="54" /> vaults of a bank and by their location in Dublin be classed as Irish securities for the purposes of this section.  I do not think the exclusion from the determination of what is the proportion of securities which are shares in a business wholly or partly carried on under paragraph (c) (i) and (ii) are helped, that either of these means are stopped. The effect of the proposed amendment No. 37 is to stop things that cannot be undesirable because they would have the effect of a wholly owned Irish company raising funds for the purposes of investment in other wholly-owned Irish companies, for example, or partial in such to bring them in under paragraph (c) (ii).</P>
    <P>With regard to what the Minister is trying to do in amendment No. 36, I am afraid that I will have to crave the indulgence of the House to re-read it in the context of the analysis I have made following on what the Minister said.  I must confess that, although I tried to do so, I could not make an analysis that satisfied myself in regard to these until I heard the Minister speak.  Lines 22 and 24 go, that is the present subparagraph (iii).  Now, we have another category which will be deemed to be Irish securities.  That category will consist of securities or interests, described whether as units or otherwise, acquired under an arrangement to which this paragraph applies.  Which paragraph applies? There is no exclusion from the arrangement. This amendment states what happens to what is excluded by the proposed amendments Nos. 33 and 34. Subparagraph (iii) states:</P>
    <P>(iii) in case any of the securities are rights or interests (described whether as units or otherwise) acquired under an arrangement to which this paragraph applies, such proportion of the rights or interests as is equal to the proportion of the property for the time being the subject of the arrangement that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I) is, or if the arrangement is not a registered unit trust scheme, would be, but for that fact, deemed, for the purposes of this section, to be, Irish securities, or</P>
    <P>(II) is other property in the State;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> The arrangement is not for investing in a unit trust scheme but is one which would be deemed to be Irish securities but for that fact.  What does that mean? I am in the dark.  I do not know what is meant by &ldquo;other property in the State;&rdquo;.  If it is not a unit trust scheme, that is to say, the money is got under an arrangement which is not a registered unit trust scheme, but is got under an issue of shares or something of that kind it is then an Irish security; or other properties paid for and taken in under this arrangement and subject to the provisions of the arrangement.  We should take an afternoon off to think about this.</P>
    <P>The general intention seems to be to take in, as Irish securities, money which is put in pursuant to this arrangement under some deeming that the arrangement, although not a registered unit trust scheme, represents Irish securities.</P>

I have briefly put the point of view that there are many thousands of people whose livelihoods are affected by this order.  We have a statutory right to decide whether that state of affairs should continue.

Unless I am greatly mistaken, on the few occasions when, at this hour, a discussion has arisen as to business for the remainder of the day, it has always been titled in the official record of the House as &ldquo;Order of Business&rdquo;.  That being so, we would now be discussing the Order of Business for the day and I would suggest that the Order of Business be varied by the inclusion of item No. 22 in the Order of Business for the remainder of the day.</P>

Any Member of this House who disagrees with the Order of Business is entitled to move an amendment to that Order of Business.  What we did when we reconvened after the tea break was <Col N="59" /> to discuss once again the Order of Business.  Might I also respectfully point out to you that the Order of Business was agreed at the commencement of the day on the undertaking of the Leader of the House that he would be present here at 7.30 p.m. to tell us if Item No. 22 could be debated today.  That being so, the item of Order of Business was not concluded some time after 3 o'clock but was extended also to take place after 7.30 p.m. today.  I suggest that what we are discussing now is the Order of Business of this House, and this House, as the Chair so often rightly points out to us, is the one which decides what the Order of Business should be.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but subject to Standing Orders.  The situation is as I have stated, that the Order of Business was decided by the House by means of a motion.  The Chair has allowed perhaps an unduly wide discussion on this matter and I now call upon Senator FitzGerald to continue his speech on amendment No. 33 of the Unit Trusts Bill, 1970.</P>

      <P>Would you permit me to address you on the last topic that has been under discussion, because the consensus of this party came into this House today with the desire to debate this motion today because of the importance of it for the lives of many people in this country? We were prepared to vote against the Order of Business if the Order of Business proposed by the Leader of the House did not contain this item. This party abstained from voting against the Order of Business, which is provisionally put before us, on the undertaking of the Leader of the House that this matter would be raised. His party's agreement to debating this would ensure a real debate and a real vote.  It seems to be that the Chair, without giving full consideration to it, is putting the reputation of the Leader of the House in jeopardy if he, by his ruling today, in effect has put the Leader of the House in the position of securing by way of an undertaking a situation which technically under the rules of the House enables the <Col N="60" /> Chairman to rule this debate out of order and to prevent this party and other Members on this side who want to do so, voting against this Order of Business as a protest against the deplorable method of excluding this.</P>

That would be a complete denigration of the right of the Opposition to divide on the Order of Business.  It is a form of evasion.  I am not suggesting that you are a party to it.

I can see the dilemma of the Chair.  I make no suggestion whatever that the Chair is acting in any way harshly or unfairly or improperly. I am quite sure that the Chair is not doing any of these things and finds itself in the dilemma that Standard Orders are there.  The Chair finds that he must insist on the rigid application of the Standing Orders if there is no inclination from the Government benches to concede the point we are making.  However, in fairness to Members on this side of the House, the Chair will agree that if my recollection of the matter is correct, what we should be doing now is taking a decision on the amendment which was withdrawn on the basis of the suggestion made by the Leader of the House.

      <P>I should like wholeheartedly to agree with what my colleague, Senator O'Higgins, has said about your own impartiality which does not arise even.  Indeed, as you have stated the matter to us, you seem to be in a dilemma.  I am sure you would be as concerned as anyone in this House to get rid of any sense of injustice having been done to anybody in this House, or to the people whom we represent.</P>
      <P>I suggest that what we decided today was the Order of Business, and that the Order of Business was to take the following items: item No. 3, which a number of people will agree has taken too long, item No. 4 and item No. 5 subject to our hearing from the Leader of the House at 7.30 p.m., when the tea break was over, what was his attitude to including in the Order of Business for today or tomorrow motion No. 22.  I submit that we did not at that time determine anything other than that at 7.30 p.m. the Leader of the House would be here and would tell us what were his views on that motion. When he had done so, this party would decide if we were prepared to support that proposed Order of Business.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Chair that the motion for the Order of Business was not passed this afternoon, that the motion for the Order of Business that was passed this afternoon was the following: items Nos. 3, 4 and 5, subject to an intervention by the Leader of the House with regard to motion No. 22. It is open to the Opposition now and to us as a party, in the absence of the Leader of the House, to vote against that motion.  Otherwise, we will feel a sense of injustice with regard to the whole affair, which would probably be as unfair to the Fianna Fáil Party as it would be to us.  I do not like to think that this was intended, that the matter be left to me to clarify in the manner that I hope I have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In all fairness, what this really amounts to now, as far as I am concerned, is that the Leader of the House has either accidentally or deliberately misled the House.  If we are to accept the sort of ruling we are getting from you&mdash;and I feel you have been placed in an impossible position &mdash;never again can we take the word of the Leader of the House on any undertaking which he gives us.  Surely the matter could be helped in some way if some of those sitting on the Government benches were to intervene and at least give some assurance as to when this urgent debate might take place.  It is all very well for Senators there to sit complacently, but while we are speaking there are people in rural Ireland starving and deprived because of the nature of this order.</P>

      <P>The merits of item No. 22 may not be discussed. I shall conclude this discussion by saying again that the Order of Business was put and agreed to this afternoon. There must be some finality in these matters.  We could not carry out our business except on the basis that the Order of Business is fixed at the start of the day and that this is then adhered to.  The only suggestion I can make is that tomorrow is another day and a motion on the Order of Business would then be in order.  At the moment this discussion is not in order.

      <Col N="65" /> Debate resumed on Government amendment No. 33 :</P>
    <P>In page 10, line 10, before &ldquo;carrying&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(other than an arrangement to which this paragraph applies)&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that between 6 p.m. and now I was engaged otherwise.  I had not a great deal of time to get this as clear as I would have liked. I think it is worth taking a look at paragraph (c) with a view to seeing what we are wishing to do with it.  We are wishing to determine the law as to what is to be deemed to be Irish securities for the purposes of determination by the Minister under another paragraph.</P>
      <P>At the moment there exists three different classes that the Minister feels he has to deal with in three different ways.  As the paragraph stands, the first two are simple.  Where the whole of the business of the body corporate is carried on in the State, the whole question of securities arises.  There is no problem there if it is read like that. In regard to subparagraph (ii) this is not the position.  Then the Minister determines the proportion of the business which is carried on in the country and that proportion is the proportion which determines the proportions of the securities which should be Irish. These two are all deemed to be Irish securities&mdash;the first, the whole lot of them and, the second, the proportion determined by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Subparagraph (iii), as it is drafted, deals with securities other than these. It states that these would be deemed to be Irish securities if they were issued in the State.  It is proposed to get rid of subparagraph (iii) as it stands and to redefine it in new subparagraphs (iii) and (iv).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of defining these new subparagraphs, it is necessary to take out of subparagraphs (I) and (II) securities which result from arrangements made &ldquo;having the effect of providing facilities for the participation by the public in profits or income arising <Col N="66" /> by acquisition, holding, management, or disposal of securities or any other property whatsoever.&rdquo;  This amendment to subparagraphs (I) and (II) makes sense in the new subparagraphs (iii) and (iv) and deals adequately with the new definition of what is excluded from subparagraphs (I) and (II) because subparagraph (iv) deals with some of subparagraph (iii).</P>
    <P>It is here that I want elucidation.  We must look at amendment No. 36 and remind ourselves that paragraph (c) ends with the words &ldquo;shall be deemed, for the purposes of this section, to be Irish securities.&rdquo;  We have got subparagraphs (i) and (ii) out of the way : they are deemed to be Irish securities &mdash;those whose business is wholly carried on here and those whose business is partly carried on here.  It is not taking into account in relation to those bodies corporate anything which participates in the arrangements made for the purpose of providing facilities for participation in profits or income arising from the acquisition, holding, management or disposal of securities or any other property whatsoever for which there is a special provision in subparagraph (iii), which must be looked at.</P>
    <P>At this point in the discussion, this means that, if we have a company which is an Irish body corporate, the whole of whose business is carried on here, and where there is a body corporate which carries on part of its business here, by virtue of the amendment to section 8 you exclude any arrangements made by these bodies corporate which are designed to enable the public to participate in profits or income arising from the acquisition, holding, management or disposal of securities or any other property.  Could I ask is that the intention&mdash;to exclude? Take the case of a public company which is wholly carrying on a business here and which make an arrangement under which they get money, the object of which is to enable the public to participate in profits or income arising from the acquisition, holding management or disposal of securities. They issue shares, for example, with special rights in so far as profits arise for reinvestment of the money subscribed <Col N="67" /> to the shares&mdash;if it is the business of a body corporate wholly carrying on business here or a body corporate partly carrying on their business here&mdash;the element of the business of this body corporate, which is represented by their holding of securities, is excluded under subparagraphs (I) and (II).  Is that the defined effect of amendments Nos. 33, 34 and 37 in relation to subparagraphs (I) and (II)?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It also includes investment companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It takes in any body corporate whether it is an investment one or not?  I am quite unable to make a suggestion.  I think it would involve an analysis of companies and consideration with merchant bankers whether genuinely in the course of their business companies do not find themselves in the position of having surplus cash which is not yet enough to enable them to go on with the project they have in mind to finance but which they are accumulating and investing. This has reached them perhaps before this Bill was ever introduced. It has been a subscription to the company and the effect of this subscription has led to the creation of the investments, which are then excluded as being non-Irish under subparagraphs (i) and (ii) as redefined, but may yet be proved to be Irish under subparagraphs (iii) or (iv).</P>
      <P>I think the long range consequences of this on companies operating in Ireland, irrespective of the unit trust aspect, should be considered.  I am not able to help the Minister on this but I think it should be considered.  I take it that what he is trying to get at here is a company which is trying to get outside the unit trust legislation by making arrangements which they do not announce to a registrar of the unit trust, because the funds are subscribed to the company and have formed part of the company carrying on business here, wholly or partly, and should not be accounted, because they are that type of arrangements, as Irish securities for the purposes of calculating the proportion which is Irish within the terms of whatever order he makes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" /> I understand the Minister to say that I am not wholly wide of the mark in my understanding of that.  Now we look at the new subparagraph (iii), which is divided into two, and subparagraph (iv).  Except for one phrase, this does not seem to me to create great difficulty.  I would like, for understanding, to draw the House's attention to the fact that they are deemed in the case where these arrangements exist, to be Irish securities only if and to the extent that the securities or rights or interests acquired are issued in the State; or are the words &ldquo;such of them as are issued in the State&rdquo; wholly part of subparagraph (iv), or do they govern subparagraphs (iii) and (iv) for clarification?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Four.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Four only; very good.  Then we can look at (iii). It deals with the securities acquired under the arrangements defined in the new paragraph (d).  In case any of the securities are rights or interests acquired under an arrangement to which this paragraph applies, such proportion of the rights or interests as is equal to the proportion of the property for the time being is subject to the arrangement.  Equal to the propertion of the property for the time being is the subject of the arrangement.  That is all right.  If they are Irish securities then they are taken in.  If the arrangement is not a registered unit trust scheme it would be, but for that fact, deemed for the purpose of this section to be Irish securities.  But for what fact?  Again, a question of elucidation. Is it the fact that it is not registered? I think that should be said&mdash;&ldquo;but for the fact that it is not registered, deemed for the purpose of this section to be Irish securities&rdquo;.  When you read the entire section, or even the entire subsection, or the entire paragraph, there are so many facts referred to that it would be very difficult to be sure what &ldquo;that fact&rdquo; was.  Is it that it is not capable of registration or it does not choose to be registered, or what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>But for the fact that it is not a registered unit trust scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It does, but it is defined in language that is so completely different from the definition of a unit trust scheme that it is patently not a unit trust scheme.  I have no difficulty about the second leg of that: &ldquo;other property in the State&rdquo;.  There is need for redrafting so as to make it very explicit as to what is missing for it to be deemed for the purposes of this section to be Irish securities. If it is a registered unit trust scheme then it counts.  Presumably it counts to the proportion, although I do think I see this anywhere.  Say I have an Irish trust scheme and I am told I have to have 30 per cent of it in Irish securities and I put 50 per cent of it in another Irish unit trust scheme, do I get 50 per cent of their 30 per cent or 40 per cent of whatever it might be chalked up as an Irish investment by me?  If I have this kind of cannibalistic operation going on, and I think unit trust schemes do sometimes invest in other unit trust schemes, what propertion of the second unit trust scheme that is Irish, is counted as Irish from the point of view of the first unit trust scheme which makes the investment in the other?  Say I put 30 per cent of mine into something that is 50 per cent Irish, do I then get 15 per cent of my investment treated as Irish?  If I do, where is that?  I know that is what is intended, but where is it?</P>

Paragraph (4) takes in &ldquo;other than the rules specified in subparagraph (iii).&rdquo;  What could they be? That would be securities issued in the State.  They are deemed to be Irish securities if they are not in paragraph (3).  What would they be?

      <P>So if you get a body corporate that was not carrying on business it could come over here and issue shares.  I think I have said enough&mdash;said too much in trying to say a few things&mdash;but it is much too complicated material to be dealing with on Report Stage.  I do not know whether this can be done, if the Standing Orders permit, but when we get amendments of this kind we should get a reprint of the whole section so that we can read it all together instead of looking for a scissors that will not cut, which is what I was doing at 6 o'clock, to try to put it all together in one piece.  The Minister has been helpful to me in his answers to my questions.  This ought to be very carefully examined again to see what are the full consequences of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Sir, if I in my efforts to answer the questions raised during the course of the discussion generated by Senator Alexis FitzGerald I cut across your ruling, but let me say that during the tea break the Senator did get a pretty full picture of the operation of that paragraph. Paragraph (c) (i) deals with the corporate bodies which are wholly Irish; paragraph (c) (ii) with corporate bodies who do some of their business here and some of their business overseas; and then the new paragraph (c) (iii), which is covered under amendment No. 36, covers such things as arrangements involving other unit trust companies, or other investment or collective <Col N="72" /> agencies.  In fact paragraph (c) (iv), which is the one the Senator finished up on, is what I described to him as a dragnet clause.  It visualises covering any type of arrangement.</P>
      <P>The Senator questioned the type of people we were excluding.  He was wondering if it included some firm from Hong Kong coming over here and collecting shares and getting investments over here.  I needed to point out what it was excluding and then the type of company I visualised.  What I am endeavouring to visualise in this regard is any type of arrangement.  It is a dragnet heading to cover any other types of securities at all.  Amendment No. 37 is covering the arrangement exclusions that took place in both paragraphs (c) (i) and (c) (ii) as was covered in amendments Nos. 33 and 34.  The Senator fully appreciated the reasons behind amendments Nos. 33 and 34, insofar as they excluded and needed to exclude the type of investment company which can be totally Irish but can have investments overseas. It was necessary to cover them by the arrangement that is introduced under subsection (3) (d), as covered in amendment No. 37.</P>
      <P>In regard to the manner in which the parliamentary draftsmen have drafted subsection (3), (c) (1), this is something that the Senator suggested I might look at in relation to the overall presentation for the Dáil.  I agree that in an effort to try to iron out its meaning it is quite possible that a better arrangement of words might be presented in order to get across what he now understands is the meaning in this regard.  This is something that I would be only too happy to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy with the Minister's reaction to what I found, I must confess, a very difficult series of amendments to grasp. I think it is pertinent to my observations on this to refer to its workability and to the difficulties that the Minister may have to face in this matter of determining how much of a company's business is to be regarded as Irish. Senator Ryan will understand this very well, particularly when we are dealing with it on a quarterly basis.  Who has <Col N="73" /> got the right to go to an Irish public company every quarter and ask them to inform what proportion of their business is being carried on in Ireland and what proportion is being carried on elsewhere, when the people to whom the questions are being put will not know the answer, or may not know the answer, and when, above all, they do not want their competitors to know the answer to it, where it may be damaging to them to have to give the answer to it?  Generally, I think the difficulty involved is this matter of determining the proportions.  While I was not capable of proposing any amendment that would solve this problem I thought, seeing the various amendments that the Minister had put down in response to some remarks I made, it might entitle me to draw attention to that aspect of it.  There are public companies which would be precluded from giving information to the Minister without giving information to the Stock Exchange and to their shareholders and which might be embarrassed by the additional cost involved in taking accounts for the purpose and might be damaged by the consequences of having to disclose this information to the public.  Could I just leave that with the Minister?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment is to confine liability for contravention of an order under section 8 to the manager of a unit trust scheme.  It meets a point made by Senator FitzGerald on Committe Stage that newspaper companies and advertising agencies should not be expected to know whether documents they publish on behalf of clients are in compliance with technical requirements under the Bill.  During discussions I <Col N="75" /> had with the parliamentary draftsman it was agreed that virtually all of the matters specified in section 8 (2), which I might regulate by order, came within the manager's sphere.  It is felt that it is undesirable to provide that the trustee as well as the manager would be guilty of an offence if the provisions of an order were contravened.  The amendment, therefore, removes from section 8 (5) the references to the trustee, the person who publishes a document which contravenes an order, and also the person who procures such publishing.  Under section 7 a newspaper is responsible for ensuring that the unit trust advertisement is from a registered unit trust.  We went into that point earlier.  It is not responsible for the details of the advertisement.</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment very much.  It almost wholly disposes of the difficulties I had about this particular subsection.  I move my amendment to the amendment, as follows:</P>
      <P>After &ldquo;offence&rdquo; to add &ldquo;provided that if the proportion specified by the Minister under subsection 3 (a) is exceeded during any quarter of any financial year is reduced to the specified proportion within the quarter succeeding such quarter no offence shall be deemed to have been committed.</P>

      <P>There may be a separate debate on this in which Senators will be limited to the amendment to the amendment.  Alternatively, the Minister's amendment and the Senator's amendment could be discussed together.  It is a matter on which Senators might come to some agreement.  Perhaps it would be better to discuss it separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be.  I am satisfied save for subsection (3) (a) that the Minister's amendment has got rid of everything that is offensive in the section.  Therefore&mdash;and I think Senator Russell will agree with me&mdash;we can happily direct <Col N="76" /> ourselves simply to this particular proposed amendment to the amendment. Practically speaking, it is simply that we are going to get quarterly accounts from the registered unit trust schemes. I do not think it ought to be an offence if, at the end of the quarter, the value of some Canadian or Australian mine has jumped up and the value of some Irish mine has fallen and as a result the proportions have gone wrong; or, if through some inadvertence, perhaps not a circumstance wholly outside the manager's control&mdash; let us allow for fraility in this and omissions of people employed to do the job&mdash;the turnout at the end of the quarter surprises the managers themselves by being fractionally out; with the day-to-day oscillation of the market, and perhaps the effect on the portfolio of a property that was practically valueless because it was a half-built site at the opening of the quarter, and has become a wholly built building at the end, the proportions have gone wrong.</P>
      <P>Also we should have regard to another fact which is important.  It is in the interest of the unit trust holders that the managers are not compelled to make sudden decisions to sell, say, British securities, at a time when in their judgment it may be very bad for them to sell, when in two months' time they can take advantage of the market. They are given at least three months to put it right.  That is not an unusual type of provision in legislation dealing with this sort of thing.  They are given time to put it right.  You may cut it down to provide that this shall not happen more than three times over five years or something of that sort.  I am assuming in the ordinary situation where the proportion has gone wrong at the end of the quarter they will find themselves right.  They have got a quarter to put it right and keep it right. That is the object of that amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator FitzGerald in that remark. It strikes me that if an offence has been apparently committed on a certain date by the time the Minister moves in to take action against the offence the ordinary play of the market prices <Col N="77" /> may have rectified the offence.  There is a sound case for leaving a period of, say, three months or such other period as the Minister may regard as reasonable to put the matter right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to support the amendment.  However, I should just like to point out that the wording does not tie in too well.  I think it probably requires an &ldquo;if&rdquo; to be introduced.  As it reads at the moment &ldquo;provided that if the proportion specified by the Minister under subsection 3 (a) is exceeded during any quarter of any financial year is reduced to the specified proportion within the quarter succeeding such quarter no offence shall be deemed to have been committed&rdquo;. The amendment is a reasonable one and it is a realistic one for the reasons given by the Senator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw Senator Mrs. Robinson getting up I thought it might be to draw attention to the fact again that from the wording of the amendment she might find it necessary to oppose it.  In my reading of the amendment the effect of it is to provide that the manager would not be guilty of an offence in a case where the proportion specified by the Minister is exceeded.  Under section 8 (iii) I may specify a minimum proportion and therefore it would not be an offence to exceed the minimum figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand, if the Senators intend the amendment to relate to a case where the figure drops below the prescribed minimum&mdash;that is what the Senators who proposed the amendment are aiming at&mdash;then the answer must surely be the defence provided in section 8 (6) in so far as I have gone in that regard.  You will recall on Committee Stage I introduced this amendment in order to cover that type of situation.  It may be contended <Col N="78" /> that it leaves a loophole if, due to some change in the value of shares, an accidental situation should arise whereby the trust falls below the prescribed minimum.  In view of the fact that this is taken care of, by way of a defence under section 8 (6), it would be rather irrational for the Minister to move in and take any positive action, knowing that any genuine defence of that nature must be acceptable.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, a further quarter from the Minister's point of view, would almost automatically need to be given in order to clear himself of the defence that could be offered under section 8 (6).  This, in its own way, prompts the necessity for extending that period further, and this opens the door to a manager doing some sort of a re-shuffle by extending that extra quarter, if it were built into the Bill. It provides a type of time factor loophole to balance things again.  This may be what is intended and what has prompted the amendment.  The two things are running together.  The likelihood of prosecution or of Ministerial action following such an eventuality as envisaged by Senators would be extremely unlikely.  This is why I feel it is not necessary to press this amendment, even further amended, to clear up this question of exceeding.  I do not think it is necessary in view of section 8 (6).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I can hardly continue to press an amendment which would seem to achieve the opposite to what I intended.  I am grateful to the Minister for drawing my attention to what my real thoughts on the matter were and which I failed to express, and to Senator Mary Robinson for making grammatical whatever I intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact of the matter is, however, that a lot of people do not like to be in the position of being prosecuted.  In the world of finance your reputation is worth everything.  If you are prosecuted and found not guilty, it is still no use; your reputation is gone and nobody bothers to read about why you got off. We may have an all prudent Minister and wise advisers all the time but you can get difficult and recalcitrant people. <Col N="79" /> The man in charge of the trust may himself be difficult and recalcitrant and may have annoyed and irritated the Minister and his advisers, may have made public criticisms of the Unit Trusts Bill and there may be people lying in wait for him.  I am not saying this will happen, it is just possible.  I cannot see what difficulty there is for the Minister in giving the right to the person who finds himself in this situation so to act that he will not have to convince the High Court.  They may not be guided with all that wisdom that inspired the judge, who was cited here earlier today, in the decision he would come to as to what is reasonable in circumstances he probably will not understand at all.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to look to somebody competent to convert into competent language my amendment, or some alteration of it which would put decent people in the position that their reputations will not be put in jeopardy by being prosecuted without their being given any time.  A quite short term is all I propose.  Three months is a very short term during which to get your portfolio right and it would be unfair to the unit holders if the accounts are being taken and suddenly they discover, as could happen, that securities have doubled, trebled and quadrupled in a matter of weeks.  They could find themselves out of line and it might be very unfair to the unit holders to sell these securities because they have not yet completed their increase if they had to sell them.  But if they had three months to get things right, they then know the code they have to apply.  Again I am on the overall question of not having a code here which puts people off and which makes them afraid.  People are very afraid of prosections and will do anything to avoid them in order to keep their reputations because they know the consequences even if they win.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 39:</P>
      <P>In page 10 to delete lines 51 to 55 and substitute:&mdash;</P>
      <P>9.&mdash;(1) The assets which are subject to any trusts created under a registered unit trust scheme shall initially be constituted out of the proceeds of an offer of units at a price per unit of an amount to be determined by the manager after deducting any preliminary charge authorised to be made by the deed expressing the unit trust scheme.</P>
      <P>(2) The price at which any subsequent issue of units shall be ascertained:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) by dividing the value of the assets which at the date of such <Col N="81" /> issue are subject to such trusts by the number of units then in existence and deemed to be in issue;</P>
    <P>(b) by adding to the resultant quotient such sum as the manager may consider represents the appropriate provision for duties and charges;</P>
    <P>(c) by adding to the resulting sum the preliminary charge the manager is authorised to make by the deed expressing the unit trust scheme; and</P>
    <P>(d) by adjusting the resulting total upwards by not more than 1.25p per unit or one per cent (whichever is the less).</P>
    <P>As I read and re-read section 9 I could not see that it added up to the answer to the question that was bothering the Minister.  I tried to redraft what I thought was intended.  That was what, under statute, ought to be the method of determining the price at which units would be sold and the relationship of that price to the assets. In doing this I would also hope to have written into the Bill one provision which would expressly give a right to a manager to make a remuneration under this trust deed.  Having only failed to get from the Minister&mdash;from whom I must confess I have got a lot &mdash;the full details of these orders and I am sure he has a sheaf of them behind him&mdash;there is much that is spelled out in this statute that would nearly be better not spelled out, and may limit the Minister's power to make the right kind of order when he comes to make it.  The Bill says:</P>
    <P>The assets which at any particular time are subject to any trusts created under a registered unit trust scheme shall be of a value that is not less than the value of the units of the scheme for the time being standing issued thereunder calculated by reference to the price at which the manager under the scheme buys the units at that time.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that, whatever the meaning of the section, it is clearly designed to determine what the price per unit should be in relation to the assets.  My amendment does that and applies what is in fact a constantly used <Col N="82" /> formula in relation to this.  First, we have the case that when you start a trust &ldquo;the assets which are subject to any trusts created under a registered unit trust scheme shall initially be constituted out of the proceeds in an offer of units at a price per unit of an amount to be determined by the manager, after deducting any preliminary charge authorised to be made by the deed expressing the unit trust scheme&rdquo;. It seems to me that section 9, unamended, does not appear to deal with that at all, because the price is determined before there are any assets to refer to.  Subsection (1) of my amendment deals with the case where you have a unit trust voted at a price which statutorily is to be determined by the manager.  The assets resulting from this subscription are subject to a deduction of a charge in favour of the manager as remuneration for his services.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) deals with the price at which any subsequent issue of units should be ascertained.  It is spelled out in quite a clear way, and it is a very clear and lucid amendment:</P>
    <P>(a) by dividing the value of the assets, which at the date of such issue are subject to such trusts by the number of units then in existence and deemed to be in issue;</P>
    <P>(b) by adding to the resultant quotient such sum as the manager may consider represents the appropriate provision for duties and charges;</P>
    <P>I have a feeling in my bones that there will be duties&mdash;</P>
    <P>(c) by adding to the resulting sum the preliminary charge the manager is authorised to make by the deed expressing the unit trust scheme; and</P>
    <P>(d) by adjusting the resulting total upwards by not more than 1.25p per unit or one per cent (whichever is the less).</P>
    <P>This is the way that I suggest the price at which the subsequent issue of units should be ascertained and be spelled out exactly in that fashion.</P>
    <P>If you are going to have section 9 in the form it is in, as an alternative to my own, I would leave it to be subject to an order under section 8.  I do not think that the meaning of section 9 is at all clear.  It is not clear to me at any <Col N="83" /> rate.  If there has to be a statutory provision in regard to it, that statutory provision should make it clear that the manager is going to get out of it initially what his preliminary charge in regard to the preliminary issue is. In relation to subsequent issues he is going to get out of it his preliminary charge to the extent that that charge is authorised by the deed, which I would have thought, in the working out of this, the Minister would have seen before even it is deposited with him, as a matter of practice.  But the figures will not work.  Unless you deliberately get together some figures that will produce the quotient, it is very hard to get a number of figures that will in fact divide so as to produce an equal quotient. You have to deal with the unequal quotient in some form.  If he is issuing units the general practice is, if the resultant total upwards requires an adjustment to get some things equal, that it could be by as much as 1.24p per unit, or one per cent, whichever is the less, and it keeps control of what the manager is getting out of it. He only gets this if he does not get an even quotient from his division.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of section 9 is to ensure that all units issued by a unit trust will be covered by assets made up of securities or other property vested in the trustees.  It is considered by the parliamentary draftsman that the section, as drafted, achieves this purpose.  The amendment sets out variout details as to how the price of units should be ascertained and the Senator has gone down through the amendment, point by point, justifying his opinions in this regard.  In his introductory remarks the Senator said that in this piece of legislation there are perhaps a great number of extras that might have been omitted, that I might find myself constrained or restricted in making orders by certain parts that are already written into the Bill.  It is sufficient for me to have the basic requirement in this section and to provide for the details such as are outlined by the Senator in his amendment, in orders to be made under section 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, the Senator mentioned that I must have a great pile of <Col N="84" /> orders building up at present.  When this legislation has gone through it is quite possible that there will be very few orders required.  But certainly, by way of developing section 9, which is simply and solely designed to prevent assets from being removed from the fund, this can preferably be done by order rather than having it spelled out in the manner suggested in the amendment. I would like to assure the Senator that my information on this is that the section, as drafted, will achieve its purpose, that is of preventing assets from being removed from the fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with the Minister that it is probably better done by order.  However, there is one point of Senator FitzGerald's which he did not answer and that is what happens at the start of a new unit trust which is offered for subscription? The manager has not got any money until he gets the money in from the new venture.  He will not have any assets to cover those and Senator FitzGerald did cover that point in the first part of his amendment.  The Minister has not referred to that and yet the Minister did say that he wanted to secure that there were always assets to cover any units issued.  If you are starting off <i>de novo</i> and you are selling units, at that stage I presume that you have not got any assets.  The Minister did not make any reference to that part of Senator Alexis FitzGerald's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it factual to relate the value of the assets only to the price at which the units are purchased?  That could cut both ways.  The actual value of the units might be substantially less than the price at which they were purchased.  That would affect the asset-backing of the trust, or, conversely, they could be substantially higher.  There should be some provision made to value the assets at, say, the market value and/or the purchase price to get a realistic value of the backing of the trust.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="85" /> In relation to Senator Sheldon's question, the theory of unit trusts as such is that somebody comes in to buy units and it is the allocation of the money which the investor brings in that creates the assets in its own way.</P>

      <P>I appreciate <Col N="86" /> the Minister's attitude to this, which is similar to his attitude throughout the debate.  I have just one final point to make in relation to the amendment, and that is that the section relates to the price at which the manager buys the units and does not seem to prevent the assets being more than what would result from a calculation by reference to the price.  If the assets are more, then it would mean that the person who is selling his units to the unit trust is not getting his full share of the assets. Could I ask the Minister about this?</P>
      <P>A final point on which I was not very clear was as to how assets would be excluded from the trust without crime being involved in some fashion.  I would have thought that we did not need any section to deal with that.  I am glad that the Minister will look at the suggestions that have been made to him.</P>

      <P>The kind of document which was envisaged when section 10 was drafted was a form of prospectus giving general information about a scheme to prospective purchasers of units.  It was not intended to require that the document must include information which would need to be updated at unduly frequent intervals. However, on Committee Stage Senator Alexis FitzGerald expressed the view that the section, as drafted, could require a document which could change daily and the purpose of the amendment is simply and solely to ensure that this will not be the case.</P>

    <P>(3) (a) Subject to the provisions of this subsection, the manager under a unit trust scheme shall be liable to pay compensation to a person who buys units of the scheme on the faith of a document of the kind referred to in subsection (1) of this section for the loss or damage he may have suffered by reason of any untrue statement included therein.</P>

    <P>(i) as regards every untrue statement not purporting to be made on the authority of an expert (which expression has the same meaning in this subsection as in section 46 of the Companies Act, 1963) or of a public official document or statement, he had reasonable ground to believe, and did up to the time of the purchase of the units concerned believe, that the statement was true; and</P>
    <P>(ii) as regards every untrue statement purporting to be a statement by an expert or contained in what purports to be a copy of or extract from a report or valuation of an expert it fairly represented the statement, or was a correct and fair copy of or extract from the report or valuation, and he had reasonable ground to believe and did up to the time of the issue of the document believe that the person making the statement was competent to make it and that person had given his written consent to the issue of the document with the statement included in the form and context in which it is included and had not withdrawn that consent before the purchase aforesaid; and</P>
    <P>(iii) as regards every untrue statement purporting to be a statement made by an official person or contained in what purports to be a copy of or extract from a public official document, it was <Col N="88" /> a correct and fair representation of the statement or copy of or extract from the document.</P>

    <P>(ii) the document is issued without the consent of the expert or the expert has withdrawn his consent to such issue before it is issued,</P>
    <P>the manager under the unit trust scheme concerned shall be liable to indemnify the expert against all damages, costs and expenses to which he may be made liable by reason of the inclusion in the document of a statement purporting to have been made by him as an expert or in defending himself against any action or legal proceeding brought against him in respect thereof.</P>

      <P>This amendment is intended to meet Senator Alexis FitzGerald's recommendation that the Bill should provide for civil liability of a manager who misleads the public by making an untrue statement in a document.  The proposed subsection is based on section 49 of the Companies Act, as suggested by the Senator at the time.  It is felt that these elaborate provisions from the Companies Act are designed to meet rather remote contingencies. However, I have had them included because of the fact that Senator Alexis FitzGerald attached considerable importance to them.</P>

      <P>In speaking to this amendment, perhaps I am off the point, but in view of the fact that the provisions introduced impose civil liability on the manager only, does the Minister intend to modify at all the portion of section 19, where if there is contravention of section 9 or 10 of this Bill the manager and the trustee under the scheme shall each be guilty of an offence?  Yet only the manager would <Col N="89" /> incur civil liability.  Would the Minister consider dropping the trustee from section 19 where, in relation to civil liability, it is only the manager who appears to be likely to incur civil liability, whereas in relation to criminal offences under sections 9 and 10 both the manager and the trustee would incur criminal liability?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would very much welcome this amendment.  I know it is a little complex but I think the complexity was necessary in order to save innocent people and to give them opportunities of getting out of such a liability.  I am a great believer in civil liability and I think people will be much more likely to enforce their own rights than State authorities will be organised to prosecute people. Everybody, I imagine, is slow to engage in prosecutions which can have adverse effects on people's reputations. The best thing is to give the citizen the remedy.  This amendment is an excellent one.  It puts the small man, who on the whole will be the investor in the unit trust, in the same position as the larger man.  I welcome it very much.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point made by Senator Mrs. Robinson, I think that the amendment to section 10 proposed by the Minister and which has been accepted seems to me to shift the responsibility firmly, certainly on civil side, to the manager, who will be the person preparing this document.  If I may direct through you, Sir, the Senator's attention to amendment No. 54, she will find that I have there proposed to make the following amendment:</P>
      <P>In page 14, line 3, after &ldquo;offence&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;save that the trustee shall not be guilty of an offence under section 10 if either the document has been issued by the manager without submitting it to the trustee or the trustee has disapproved of it or a copy thereof has been issued without the signature of a director or secretary of the trustee.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In other words, in the later amendment I tried to take the criminal liability away from the man who will not be responsible for it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 42:</P>
      <P>In page 11, line 15, after &ldquo;scheme&rdquo; to add:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Provided that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) No such request to purchaser shall be valid unless the holder shall have delivered to the managers or their authorised agent the certificate or certificates representing the units to be purchased with the endorsement or endorsements thereon duly completed by the holder or in the case of joint holders by both or all of them and any such duly completed endorsement shall for all purposes of this deed be deemed to be a transfer in favour of the managers;</P>
      <P>(ii) A holder shall not be entitled to require the managers to purchase his units otherwise than in such multiples as may from time to time be prescribed pursuant to the deed giving expression to the unit trust scheme or to purchase part only of his units if as a result of such purchase he would remain a holder of less than such number of units as may be prescribed from time to time in the deed giving expression to the unit trust scheme:</P>
      <P>(iii) The managers may at their option dispense with the delivery as aforesaid of any certificate which shall have become lost, stolen or destroyed upon compliance by the holder with the like requirements to those arising in the case of an application by him for the replacement thereof:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="91" /> (iv) The price shall not be payable to the holder until the expiration of seven days after the termination of the customary period for the realisation of investments on the Stock Exchange, Dublin.</P>
    <P>I do not think my amendment can be really understood without looking at the section itself.  An important point with regard to the section is that it casts a statutory duty, a statutory obligation in favour of the holder of units of a registered unit trust scheme, or indeed of a unit trust scheme the registration of which stands cancelled. It puts a statutory duty, in favour of those persons, on the manager, to buy from the holder such number of those units as the holder may specify at the price for the time being at which the manager buys units of the scheme. Now, anyone who has to engage in almost any kind of professional business knows the sort of intolerable brute who will walk into you at 10 o'clock and demands his title deeds which he last handed in 13½ years ago.  Such a man will sit there until he gets the deeds and cause great inconvenience. He has no right whatever to do this to you and he can be told to go to blazes out of your office, and that in fact, you must be given a reasonable time to arrange matters.  Similarly, a dentist could tell such a man to go away and keep his abscess for the next month because he could not fit him in any day.  Doctors, likewise, as we know.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach could tell us about engineers and their methods of saving themselves.  Under this section a man would be able to sit downstairs with a request in writing until he gets his units bought from him as a result of having read in the paper that the Minister cancelled the scheme. I think that he should be required, before he has this statutory right, first of all, to have his certificates there, representing the units to be purchased; if they are held by somebody other than the person who is looking for repayment he should be required to have certificates duly completed by the person who holds them or by joint holders in the case of joint holders.  If it is such a scheme that provides that they are <Col N="92" /> only taking units of a particular multiple, he cannot withdraw such an amount of money as would reduce his investment to something smaller than the unit which the managers, under the unit trust deed, are prepared to take into the unit trust scheme.</P>
    <P>I do not know how unit trust schemes run, but I do not imagine that they have bullion on the premises to hand out to people who come without appointment to demand and exercise their statutory rights to get repaid. Generally, they will carry some cash but that may be at this particular time fully invested.  There may be a time when they cannot borrow for even short term breaks.  These kind of situations arise.  There could be a bank strike or something on.  They must be given some time.  I suggested seven days, the usual settlement day in the Dublin Stock Exchange.  One can think of any other reasonable time.  But if they have a right to get their units bought back they should be there with all their certificates, and the certificates should be in order, properly executed by the holders of them.  Time should be given to the unit trust manager to realise sufficient of the assets under his control to enable him to pay.  Even here, the fact that you are going to have unit trust schemes, not associated with life assurance, which themselves would be unregistered unit trust schemes to which this Bill will not apply at all, but unit trust schemes in contemplation under this Bill with investments in property and, therefore, not necessarily liquid.  To be required to pay back in that situation is most unfair to the people who do not want to buy out from this unit trust because it may force the managers to realise too speedily investments that they think should be held for a longer time. I am not sure that the seven days after the settlement day gives enough time but certainly there ought to be some time given to them because this is a statutory obligation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>This brings us back to the degree of flexibility necessary in such a piece of legislation. I am asked why I do not spell out &ldquo;when&rdquo;.  The Senator is specifically speaking against making it a statutory obligation.  What is said here in the section is that the unit holder is entitled to go to the manager and buy back such number of units which the holder may specify at the price for the time being at which the manager buys units for the scheme.  It does not put the manager in the position, as is visualised by the Senator in justifying his amendment, that the unit holder can sit in the office and refuse to get out until he gets his money.  All that is spelt out in this section is that the unit holder is entitled to cash his units as such.  Complications cannot be anticipated at this time.  It is far better that such difficulties should be overcome by orders rather than having something added in a statutory manner that cannot be adjusted except by the Minister coming back to the House seeking <Col N="94" /> powers of amendment.  I am not saying that the amendments proposed are unreasonable. I remember what the Senator said when speaking on a previous amendment about having too much written into the Bill.  The type of eventuality which the Senator seeks to cover in his amendment is one which should be dealt with by order rather than by having it written in here in a statutory way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The import of Senator FitzGerald's amendment is relevant to the fact that under section 19 the contravention of section 11 makes the manager of a unit trust scheme guilty of an offence.  Apart from the certain amount of leeway in dealing with the unit trust holder as to when the money should be paid on demand, there is the danger that the manager would be immediately guilty of a criminal offence in not paying immediately. This might be relevant in deciding whether the manager would require the type of protection which Senator FitzGerald proposes in his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senator Robinson for drawing attention to this, particularly if I am reading section 19 correctly.  The offences are not small.  Summary conviction may bring a fine not exceeding £100 or on conviction on indictment a fine not exceeding £5,000, and so on for further offences each day the contravention is continued.  Where there is a bald statutory duty on the manager to buy units is he not guilty of an offence when the man comes in and requests payment and does not get it? Is an offence not then committed, there being no provision as to when he has to pay?  A man may not understand the whole business of certificates and how invaluable they are, the risks that are taken if payment is made without the certificates being produced, and how costly it can be sometimes for an insurance company to insure one against a lost certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder has the Minister power or is he not impeded by the terms of this section from making an order under section 8 which would provide for compliance by the unit trust holder with any conditions once there is a <Col N="95" /> statutory obligation on the manager to pay up.  The Minister may not like the language I have used.  I suppose one can talk on an amendment by indicating what a more sensible man might introduce as an alternative.  At any rate I will make the point in that kind of language.  I think I would be quite satisfied if the Minister would insert in section 11 the words &ldquo;on due compliance by the holder with the requirements of the trust deed&rdquo; because this will be stuff which will be in the trust deed anyhow.  He would have to comply with the requirements of the trust deed before he could get his money for his units.</P>
    <P>We know that the trust deed will not be registered unless the Minister is satisfied that its provisions are right. The Minister will be advised as to what ought to be in a trust deed or in an altered trust deed.  He will provide for this contingency in detail, as to how a man will sell back his units to the company. He will find that there are varying provisions with regard to what the holder must do.  That is, in general, what I have set out in my amendment and it indicates what will be found in a lot of trust deeds.  If the Minister does not like to make this statutory he can give himself flexibility and in so doing, to remake another point I have made on other sections he will make this Bill more attractive to people who want to establish unit trusts.  They might not want to take it on, if they are advised that they are running a risk, as in section 11, of having to pay back unit holders immediately.  If they are satisfied that they can provide for this in the terms of the deed which they will draw up and of which the Minister will approve, then the statutory obligation will only arise if the unit holder complies with the requirements of the trust scheme and the deeds phrasing it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>After &ldquo;scheme&rdquo; to add &ldquo;save in accordance with the provisions of the deed expressing the unit trust scheme of which the Minister has approved&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I must explain that I find myself in a difficult position in relation to this. First of all, I wholly agree with the spirit of the proposal that there should not be any concealed, or what one might describe as illicit, profits made by a manager.  I am grateful to the Minister for proposing an amendment which sensibly extends the definition of a manager to take in all those persons associated with him from making these concealed or somewhat illicit profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also recognising that, in fact, unit trust schemes are managed by managers who are in business for the purpose of making money.  As these schemes work they make money in a number of different ways.  They make money when the quotient of the division of the assets among the number of units deemed to be in issue does not work out, and they are entitled to adjust upwards the price at which they would sell by 1.25p or 1 per cent of the total being realised, whichever is the lesser; they do not take 1.25p but <Col N="98" /> not more than 1.25p to get an exact, quotable figure.  They also make money in the simple situation that arises for them that people who are unit holders want money and take a view of the market which is different from the view of the market taken by the managers who are skilled in interpreting its moods and motivation and who keep units themselves and reissue them themselves at a higher price, reflecting the increased value in the assets since the time they bought in the units.  They take that profit for themselves.</P>
    <P>I know some people think&mdash;wrongly in my estimation&mdash;that this is not a transaction in the underlying assets.  I think the reflection in the increased value, in the increased price at which they sell the units, is, on the strict interpretation of this section, as amended by the Minister's proposal. This remuneration should be recognised as necessary remuneration for the successful management of a unit trust. All other types of remuneration, involving, for example, going into an unquoted company six months before it is going to be quoted, buying the shares in the unquoted company for themselves and then reselling them on the public issue with profits to themselves &mdash;that is the type of remuneration which they or their associates should be prevented from making.  They should be prevented from utilising information which they have and which they should be using for the benefit of the unit trust for their own benefit.</P>
    <P>That explains why these two amendments have been put down.  What I would prefer would be that the House accept the Minister's proposed amendment and for the Minister to continue his generosity by accepting the first of our two amendments: &ldquo;save in accordance with the provisions of the deed expressing the unit trust scheme of which the Minister has approved.&rdquo; That deed will, in fact, set out all these matters.  It will set out that they are entitled to a preliminary charge.  It will set out that they are entitled to take the difference when they are buying back units if the resultant figure does not work out properly.  It will recognise their right to keep units in the drawer &mdash;as they call it&mdash;and not to cancel <Col N="99" /> them at all but to retain them for themselves and to reissue them at the higher price, if they judge that is the way the asset values are going.  This will all be set out in the deed and, if approved of by the Minister, his amendment catches all transactions that lie outside the deed of which he has approved and should be illegal; I would support that illegality.  The second amendment was to cut out this altogether.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to express my view that, in principle, if it is to be as blank as this it would run completely counter to the proper operation of a unit trust and would kill the interest of people in establishing unit trusts here, that is, if they had to comply with these sections. I was going to say, but I know this is wrong, that the only unit trusts schemes that we have are the unit trusts schemes that by virtue of our amendments today are not going to be subject to the Unit Trusts Bill.  This is not quite correct, but it is two out of three correct.</P>
    <P>You will not find this in the Prevention of Fraud Investments Act, 1958. There is no provision with regard to that in that Act.  What the Board of Trade do with regard to it is to see that the right sources of remuneration are established in the deeds with which you establish the unit trusts.  I do not think the Board of Trade are right.  There ought to be a statutory provision which would take in others as well as the manager.  The source of the manager's remuneration ought to be identified in the deed which the Minister approves of.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister's amendment, subject to his giving his support to the first of my amendments and then I will withdraw the second of my amendments.</P>

      <P>I look upon section 12 as being essential to protect the interests of the unit holders.  It would be clearly against the interests of the unit holders if a manager could buy assets from the fund if he thought there was a possibility of their appreciating in value and, conversely, that he could sell assets to the fund if he thought their values were about to decline.</P>
      <P>The amendment to the amendment is considered unacceptable because it could nullify the effect of the section. Senator FitzGerald spoke about management charges for providing the service.  These are not affected by this section.  They come under section 8 (2) (h).</P>

      <P>The effect of this amendment is to expand section 16 to include <Col N="108" /> additional provisions from the Companies Act which Senator FitzGerald felt should be included.  The provisions adapted from sections 167, 170, and 171 of the Companies Act will, firstly, enable inspectors to investigate the manager's and the trustee's subsidiaries, holding companies or associated companies.  Secondly, they will provide on foot of an inspector's report for proceedings which can be not merely criminal but also for the purposes of recovery of property that may be due to the unit holders.  Thirdly, they will enable the Minister to recover the expenses of an investigation in a case where no prosecution is brought but where, on the basis of the inspector's report, recovery would be justified.</P>
      <P>The provisions adapted from section 173 of the Companies Act gives safeguards to solicitors in respect of privileged communications and to bankers in relation to the affairs of customers other than the unit trust scheme.  It is felt that these elaborate provisions from the Companies Act are designed to meet remote contingencies.

      <P>I move amendment No. 54:</P>
      <P>In page 14, line 3, after &ldquo;offence&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;save that the trustee shall not be guilty of an offence under section 10 if either the document has been issued by the manager without submitting it to the trustee or the trustee has disapproved of it or a copy thereof has been issued without the signature of a director or secretary of the trustee&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I thought it very wrong that a trustee should be in a position of having committed an offence and become subject to the penalties attached to that offence in section 19, where the offence consists of the manager breaching the requirements of section 10 and issuing the document without submitting it to the trustee, or where the manager has submitted it to the trustee and the trustee has disapproved of it, or where a copy has been issued without the signature of a director or secretary of the trustee.  It would only be if the document in question has been issued by the manager, with the approval of the trustee, and where that approval has been formally signified in the manner provided for under section 10, with the signature of the director or secretary of the trustee.  The Minister must be satisfied, after consultation with the Central Bank of Ireland and after consideration by that bank of the relevant information in the application, that their competence in respect of matters of the kind with which they would be concerned in relation to the unit trust scheme and that the probity of the manager and trustee were such as to render them suitable to act as manager and trustee respectively under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me to be intolerable to create a position where a trustee believes a manager to be honest and subsequently finds he is not, or finds that the manager has been taken over and is now in fact controlled by people entirely different from those in whose probity he had a proper faith at the beginning.  It seems to me intolerable in those circumstances that the trustee should be rendered liable for an offence which is the offence of the manager, and where there is no formal <Col N="110" /> evidence that the trustee has signed the document which constitutes the offence. If the director and secretary of the trustee has signed a document which does not contain what it ought to contain under section 10, then he should be guilty of an offence, then he should be capable of prosecution, then he should be liable to the penalties under section 19.  But if he is not in that position, if he has never seen the document, if he is as innocent of it as any Member of the Seanad, if, having seen it, he has gone further and disapproved of it and assumes that the manager is considering his criticisms&mdash;he may not have yet lost faith in him; he may not yet know the kind of body that he is now dealing with; he may not feel it right in the interests of the unit holders that he should address himself to the Minister on it, because he may think that his criticisms may already be met and there may be adjustments made in this document to see that it represents a full and proper compliance with the Act, which may be a new Act, a new code to the new owners of the manager who may have taken that manager over, and who may not be familiar with its requirements or careful in contemplating its consequences&mdash;if the manager does that and is careless, he should pay for it, because he may be giving rise, as a result of one of the Minister's amendments, to civil liabilities if his statement is incorrect.  But he may be committing a crime, too, and it is such a breach of the law that it ought to be a crime and should be punishable as a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>But the trustee may never have seen it, or may have seen it and disapproved of it; or he saw it and approved of it in an informal kind of way, through somebody who thought he had more authority in the trustee fund than he had, and in fact when it came to the board, the board refused to sign it, and the manager meanwhile assumed that it was all right, because his pal along the line had told him that it was all right, and then issued it without the signature. He may have printed on it the signatures of director and secretary. But where the manager is solely responsible the trustee ought not to be guilty of any criminal offence.</P>

      <P>I should like to support this amendment for the reasons given by Senator FitzGerald and also because I think it follows from the amended version of section 10, that in proposing civil liability on the manager &mdash;acknowledging that it would probably be the manager, unless as Senator FitzGerald has said, the trustee has specifically approved the particular scheme&mdash;that he ought not to be guilty of a criminal offence, ought not to incur criminal liability, unless there is some <i>mens re</i>, unless there is some guilty mind there.</P>

      <P>I look on my function in this regard as protecting the investor. In relation to section 10, which is referred to here, it places a clear responsibility on the trustee by requiring him to approve of the prospectus. I do not look upon this as an onerous duty because, as a result of my amendment No. 40, the document does not now have to be updated too frequently.  I feel that the acceptance of the Senator's amendment would mean that the trustee could neglect his duty without fear of incurring any penalty.

Why should anything that the Minister has done, by way of amendment, have any effect where a manager does something without telling the trustee?

One of them has been to meet the suggestion that this Unit Trust Bill ought to create civil liabilities which do not exist in other codes and which are highly desirable <Col N="112" /> to exist.  The Minister says that he is concerned with civil liabilities, he is concerned with the civilian investors. He is concerned, and ought to be concerned, with the entire Bill and its impact on the unit trust movement.  He is concerned, or ought to be concerned, with the position of the trustee of whose probity he has been satisfied when he allowed the unit trust scheme to be established.</P>
      <P>To take up the point made by Senator Sheldon and to emphasise how right he is in what he said, if you look at the amended section 10, which if it is not complied with will render the trustee liable to an offence with serious consequences, because a trustee who gets himself into this position will find his reputation extremely damaged if he is prosecuted.  Partners sometimes come together; one partner finds the other a rogue and the one of integrity gets rid of the rogue as quickly as he can but he is in no position to be prosecuted because of offences he has not committed but the offences committed by the partner he has got away from.</P>
      <P>Section 10, as amended, reads:</P>
      <P>The manager under a registered unit trust scheme shall prepare or cause to be prepared a document containing such information in relation to the scheme as the manager could reasonably require to have and after approval of the document by the trustee under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who secures the approval of the document by the trustee but the manager? Who is in a position, or called by this section, to see that the information is such as should reasonably be obtained&mdash;the manager not the trustee.  He is now to be put in the position that he has got to satisfy himself with matters that are the concern of the manager as well as matters that are the concern of the trustee. The trustee has onerous duties.  After approval of the document by the trustee under the scheme a copy thereof should be sent to the registrar.  By whom?  By the manager.  It is not the trustee.  It may be sent by the manager without having shown the document to the trustee; or after the document has been disapproved of by the trustee; or after <Col N="113" /> the trustee has declined to give it the formal sanction he is required to give by having it signed by a director and secretary.</P>
    <P>In relation to a matter such as a prospectus, take the stern requirements of company law with regard to that. No prospectus can be issued unless every single person named in the document as a director or promoter signs a copy or has authorised lawfully his agent to sign it.  He then takes all the consequences of the Companies Act if he does not read it or if he relies too much on advice he is getting.  At any rate he knows the consequences or can be advised of the consequences.</P>
    <P>The practice is very strong to see that the documents are signed by and the responsibility firmly taken on by the persons who sign them.  Here we could have a situation in which the trustee has signed nothing, sealed nothing, seen nothing and yet he is being made liable for an offence and can be prosecuted and found guilty for an offence which has been committed by the manager because the manager has failed to get the information he could reasonably be required to have got. He has not told the trustee about it or has not asked him for his consent at all or perhaps he has even forged his signature.  People are very lax in these matters unless the procedures require them to be otherwise.  Thinking that, having had 25 approvals from the trustee&mdash;because it was all working through one man who got sacked in the meantime&mdash;the 26th approval will come as quickly as the 25 previous ones, he has perhaps printed on the signatures of the director and secretary although he did not, in fact, get any authority to do so.  How could we enact legislation making a trustee liable for a criminal offence in a situation where all the burden is cast on the manager?</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment very much.  It meets very well a point which I think was valid and could have been embarrassing in the operation of the Unit Trust Bill.  It is appropriate that I should say generally&mdash;despite my comments on the last amendment, which at this point of time the Minister is not taking but may consider, I hope, at another point of time in another place&mdash;that I think all of us on this side of the House feel that we have been very generously treated in regard to our contributions. Even where the Minister has not accepted all our amendments tabled at this stage, in relation to many of them he has undertaken to consider them in the future.  I feel that what he has done will encourage people who want to do this kind of work in the Seanad and make the House feel it is a better place to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the House for agreeing to take the motion today because there was some urgency.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to raise the remuneration limit for social insurance which applies to non-manual workers and, as required by statute, the draft of a Government order giving effect to this proposal has been placed before each House.  The existing limit of £1,200 has been in operation since the 6th September, 1965.  The new limit contained in the order is £1,600.  It is estimated that 30,000 employed persons will be brought into insurance by the raising of the remuneration limit.</P>
      <P>Since the first scheme of social insurance was introduced into this country in 1912, there has been such a remuneration limit for compulsory insurance in operation but only in relation to persons employed otherwise than by way of manual labour.  The insurance position of workers employed by way of manual labour is not affected by the remuneration and they are compulsorily insured regardless of their earnings.  The limit, which was fixed at £600 in 1953 at the time of the introduction of the social welfare system now in operation, has since been raised twice: in 1958 to £800 and, as I have said, in 1965 to £1,200.</P>
      <P>If the order receives the required approval of both Houses, I intend to make regulations providing for the granting of credited contributions to persons who are brought back into compulsory insurance by the raising of the limit to £1,600 and who might otherwise in some cases not be qualified for certain benefits, such as unemployment benefit and disability benefit.  I commend the motion for the approval by Seanad Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are, of course, agreeable to this.  We accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will be pleased to hear that I know little about this code.  There were a couple of things however that occurred to me in relation to this raising of remuneration.  I had a case myself in relation to the Social Insurance Fund, <Col N="117" /> wherein an employee declined to take an increase because it would put her outside the range of insurance.  That was the situation.  I then ascertained that in her circumstances she was free within a period of, I think, a year to make an option to stay on.  Where the orders raising the remuneration take place at intervals that are greater than a year this ought to be amended so that persons could have at least the length of time which stretched between the making of one order and the next to pay up and opt back again where they have lost out through not having opted in at the time of the earlier raising of the limit.</P>
      <P>Would it not be possible to have some sort of tapering relief?  I know there will be difficult calculations to make here.  A person should be able to exceed the minimum to the extent of some estimated value of the sacrifice made through not being able to continue the benefits in question.  I do not know whether that is a thought capable of being realised or whether it has been considered by the Minister at all?</P>
      <P>What sort of principle is applied in determining these levels?  We start off with a figure of 1953 in relation to non-manual workers and we have had these increases.  Have these increases been related to cost of living figures or to what have they been related?  My ignorance will be displayed in magnitude by asking the other question: why do we have limits in the case of non-manual workers while we have no limits in the case of manual workers? Is there any basic philosophy behind this?  Apart from that, is it a matter of cost?  I should have thought that the bigger remuneration, the greater the relief to the fund, if the contributions are coming in from people with larger incomes.  I do not know whether these questions are within the Minister's power to answer at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The basic thinking behind this originally was that when persons reached a certain remuneration limit they would be in a pension scheme of their own or in a position to have their own pension scheme or perhaps the company for <Col N="118" /> which they worked might have a pension scheme.  Incidentally, it does not apply to manual workers; it is to non-manual workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew that. What the Minister has said applies equally well, does it not, to the manual worker?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The manual workers are insurable at all times irrespective of limit.  One of the cases made for raising the limit at this time is that many manual workers are earning much more than, say, some of the clerical grades who were cut off at the £1,200 limit.  There are other reasons, too, which are not generally referred to or thought of, which make it difficult for me to abolish the limit altogether, although it is something I would hope to do some time in the not far distant future.</P>
      <P>These limits set down by the Department of Social Welfare have been used by other Departments as a yardstick in some of their schemes. This applies particularly to the Department of Health.  For the middle income groups, income was measured by our limit of £1,200, by the Department of Education for some of their scholarship schemes, and by the Department of Local Government for the purpose of loans in some cases&mdash;the statutory limit which requires a person to qualify for a loan.  Other Departments have adopted these limits for the purpose of using them as a yardstick and this has made it difficult to have them adjusted because it affects other Departments as well.</P>
      <P>The main criticism of this is that the £1,600 is not going far enough, but it is as far as one could conveniently go now.  Having regard to increases in the past, it picks up any slack that existed. I said in the other House, and I will repeat it here, that I hope at some stage to abolish the limit altogether and indeed to reach a stage where we could extend the whole field of insurance to self-employed people as well as to people who are employed.  For the time being this will take in 30,000 extra and will, I think, be equitable in relation to past increases.</P>
