    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned last night I was proceeding to show that the Bill as set out does not provide for a National College of Art that would be acceptable as a third level institution.  Yet it appears to be the Minister's intention to designate it as a third level institution very shortly, and it is proper that it should be designated in that way.  However, the various controls provided in the Bill are totally incompatible with the idea of a third level institution.  For instance, in section 22, it says:</P>
      <P>An Bord may, with the approval of the Minister, by construction or acquisition (including acquisition under a lease or other letting or a licence), provide itself with and equip and maintain such buildings and other premises as it considers necessary or desirable for the performance of its functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While that is acceptable as long as it is not a third level institution, surely what is contained in this section will become a function of the Higher Education Authority, if and when the National College of Art is designated as a third level institution.  Similarly, the controls <Col N="1176" /> over fees and over officers and servants, and so on, are totally unacceptable. Therefore, I am now asking the Minister if he will give a categoric assurance to this House that if and when he wishes to designate this as a third level institution, after consultation with the HEA, he will bring in an amending Bill that will remove all these controls that cannot be tolerated in a third level institution.  Again section 5 (3) <i>(a)</i> says:</P>
    <P>An Bord shall have such other functions as may be assigned to it from time to time by the Minister...</P>
    <P>I do not know what is meant there.  It is also a type of control, an arbitrariness, that should not be in a third-level institution.  Then we come to the crucial point for any third level institution, or, indeed, any institution that is to function as the Minister claims this should function, that is, as an independent governing body, and to be removed from the Department of Education. The crucial point here is the composition of the governing body.  In this the Minister appoints seven members purely on his own and will then appoint four others on nomination.  Again, that is contrary to all reasonable ideas of what constitutes independence and what constitutes an autonomous type of third level educational body.  I suggest that the group themselves should provide the majority of their governing body.  In addition, the Minister has to have trust in the people concerned to do the job, and trust must begin with the people who are really in the day-to-day charge of the job, the staff of the college itself.  The staff must play a really significant part in the governing body of any such institution: and not just have a paltry two out of 11.  That would be totally unacceptable to Senator Keery on the governing body of Trinity College, just as it would be unacceptable to any of us in the other universities. I suggest that there is implied in this paltry provision for staff representation on the governing body, a lack of trust in the staff.</P>
    <P>While the Minister is right in providing some student representation on the body, to go so far as to say that the students and staff are equal on the <Col N="1177" /> governing body is again an obvious absurdity, taking into account the wide diversity of staff connected with the National College of Art.  Contrasting their experience in teaching and life generally with the inexperience of the students shows the absurdity of providing equal representation.</P>

      <P>I intend to move amendments to this effect on Committee Stage.  I suggest that the number of student representatives be increased to three and that the number of staff representatives be increased to five, seven nominated by the Minister, <Col N="1178" /> bringing the total number to 15.  Fifteen is a reasonable size of governing body and gives the students and staff that slight edge over the Minister's nominees. With so many diverse subjects in the College of Art and adding to this design, you would need a minimum of five to ensure that those various groups are adequately represented on the Governing Body and that they feel they are adequately represented.  I suggest three for the student representatives, because three is the minimum needed for a selection based on proportional representation.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to ensure, in sanctioning the nomination procedures for this, that it is based on proportional representation.  I wish to guard against domination by any 51 per cent block. Taking any other election procedure there with these X votes and so on. especially the multiple X vote, any group coming together and plumping for their candidate by Xs can, if they have over 50 per cent of the vote, take all of the seats.  This is undesirable, In any academic body, proportional representation, especially tied to a postal vote, is the modern approach and the counting of such votes is no longer any obstacle.</P>
      <P>In all elections, so far as possible, we should get away from this grotesque business of getting all the members into a room and having the voting there to provide an afternoon's enjoyment for the members concerned.  The Minister should ensure that both proportional representation and postal exercise of the vote are observed.  That should ensure we will make a fresh start on the National College of Art and we can overcome the unhappy memories of the past two years.  It is harder to do the job today than it would have been two years ago.  That is why last night I strongly criticised the tradiness of the Government in allowing the many recommendations on the National College of Art to gather dust on the shelves. I cannot understand why action on this was not taken many years ago.  I appeal to the Minister and the Government to learn from this experience and to act on advice given as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In setting up a governing body, the main task is to get them to work as a unit.  That can only be achieved if the <Col N="1179" /> various groups within the college are seen to be in charge of their own destiny. The Minister and his officials may feel that these people are very wise, but will they do the job as well as the Minister and his advisers would?  That is the assumption made in all colonial policy. Britain has, unfortunately, been making that assumption in our regard for 700 years and our main task today is to change that assumption.  It is exemplified in the approach of the Minister and of all Governments to this relinquishing of control and making an outright act of faith in democracy and in its ability to do the job.</P>
    <P>A good plan is no use in this regard if the people concerned with implementing that plan do not feel it is good and are not prepared to carry it through fully.  I commend the Minister on the introduction of the rotation principle here.  It is a good one and one which we tried on many occasions to have introduced into our legislation.  I think this is the first time that the rotation principle has been enshrined in legislation here.  If it is, it should be a prouder boast for the Minister than if it were the first time he gave statutory student representation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I deny that I have ever in any way denied the students their rightful place.  I know what the students can contribute.  I spent a great deal of my time as a student working to that effect, and we did not have sit-ins either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have this absurd clause about membership of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  When a person is nominated <Col N="1180" /> as a candidate he must retire from the Governing Body.  That is something we seem to be stuck with here, a product of the last ten to 15 years.  I suppose we should make another effort on Committee Stage to try to remove this clause.  Members on both sides of the House should endeavour to see that this absurdity will be removed.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the most serious question of all on which the Minister has so far given no information, that is, the site for the new College of Art; yet I believe this is crucial to the whole Bill.  My proposal to the Minister is that there is no valid reason for having this college located in Dublin.  In my view Kilkenny would be the proper place for it.  I advise the people of Kilkenny to see that their claim is made before it is too late.  If the Government are serious about their policy of decentralisation this surely is one Bill calling out for the exercise of that policy.  I have not gone along with the decentralisation policy of sending the whole Department of Education to Athlone.  That was just a crazy election gimmick.  But let us face it, we now have an opportunity of judging the sincerity of the Government and so I ask for a decision forthwith to transfer the national college to a suitable site in the country.  To my mind, Kilkenny seems to be the best but there are many other sites one could think of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Anywhere you wish but not in Dublin, or else drop all this phoney pretence about decentralisation and let us face the fact that this Government are as brutal in their centralisation policy as any other.  It is part of the disease that affects the whole nation that unless a thing is located in Dublin it cannot function.  In other words, Dublin is Dublin, the Pale is outside it and the rest of it is Red Indian country.  Again to justify the label of &ldquo;national&rdquo; the College of Art will have to act in a national capacity. That means it will have to encourage similar work in other parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment we have the Municipal School of Art in Cork.  We are proud of the work that it is doing.  We <Col N="1181" /> think it should get far more encouragement. We believe that it should be part of the task of the National College of Art to co-ordinate and encourage such schools throughout the country.  How many Senators on both sides have voiced that idea?  Surely this encouragement and co-ordination can be done just as well from a centre outside Dublin as from Dublin.  What is especially important in this regard is the question of inter-change of lecturers or staff over short periods.  If the national college is to be the college, the only one designated as a third level institution, the others being at a lower level, there is the task of keeping the teaching staff in all the other schools of art throughout the country abreast of what is happening, and the place in which they can learn that is in the national centre.  Therefore it should be their policy that teachers in the various schools of art might, every four or five years, be given what is now commonplace in educational practice, sabbatical leave&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Teachers should be given sabbatical leave for a period of three months, six months or a year to go to the national centre and perhaps teach classes there, engage in study, attend some courses and so refresh themselves on their various specialities. That is the normal practice. It is the most important function that could be assigned to a National College of Art. I hope we can get something into the functions of An Bord in section 5 that may spell that out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am appalled at the idea that to be recognised as even being in reasonable association with the college the Minister <Col N="1182" /> requires that part-time teachers should have 18 hours' teaching.  To my mind that is a very misguided approach to education, this overloading of teachers in various subjects.  You may get away with it for a couple of years, but the end result is that the teacher concerned is so taken up with actual lecturing that he has no time to keep abreast of his subject.  The result is that he becomes obsolete.  An obsolete teacher is no better than an obsolete motor car. Neither is any use to the community.  In this regard perhaps the provision of sabbaticals would help to care for obsolescence.  The period of obsolescence at present in most science subjects is about seven years.  Therefore the class notes would be totally obsolete after seven years.  Unfortunately, if teachers, whether in the College of Art, higher &ldquo;techs&rdquo; or any other school, are overloaded they become obsolete and after ten or 15 years they are a positive liability to the students and the institution alike.  It is not their fault.  It is the fault of the misguided penny-pinchers in the budgetary situation who think that by forcing teachers to do more than what would be accepted as normal class hours in any other country they are saving the taxpayers.  They are saving the taxpayer at the cost of the quality of instruction involved.  I appeal for a recognition of that fact.</P>
    <P>We do not in this regard want the lecturers in the College of Art or elsewhere to merit the description that was once applied to a lecturer.  Unfortunately it applies to too many of our lecturers at all levels.  &ldquo;A rather boring process by which the notes of a lecturer's college days become the notes of his students without the necessity of passing through the head of either.&rdquo;  Let us be assured that that does not apply either in art or in any other level of our work.</P>
    <P>We can face most of the other problems on Committee Stage.  I appeal to the Minister to meet us fairly and squarely on Committee Stage and not to adopt the same approach as he adopted in putting through the Higher Education Authority Bill here when, despite our best endeavours over several weeks, we failed to change a comma in the Bill.  This same approach of &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; is not good enough.  I ask that we be given at least the credit of know <Col N="1183" /> ing something about educational institutions from a side that is different from the side the Minister and his advisors are on.  Therefore, between us let us co-operate and combine on Committee Stage to ensure that this long overdue development of putting the National College of Art on an independent basis shall be properly launched and that it shall be an institution that will be able to command the respect and loyalty of its staff and students thereby enabling us to get over the unfortunate incidents of the last two years.  Such incidents should never have happened, but let us get over them speedily and get on to a better and more fruitful use of art in the years ahead, especially with the added responsibility of design.  We will then be able to make a full contribution to our national development if and when we enter the European Economic Community.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an Bille seo sa tSeanad agus fáiltímear an Bille féin.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil roinnt maith daoine sa tír ag baint cúis gáire as scoláirí ealaíne.  Is mithid dúinn a thuiscint nach bhfuil duine ar bith inár measc gur féidir leis bheith ag caitheamh clocha ar a dheartháir.  B'fhéidir go gceapann roinnt daoine ar fud na tíre nach bhfuil san ealaín ach leisce agus cailliúint ama.  Is fuiriste do dhaoine bheith ag caint, mar a déarfá, ar an gclaí; ach sé an dualgas atá ar gach duine againn ná na tréithe do bhronn Dia orainn do chothú agus d'úsáid chun go mbéadh tairbhe ann don cine daonna.  Mara mbéadh an scoláire ealaíne ann, ba mhór an cailliúint don spiorad agus dos na rudaí luachmhara a spreagann an t-anam go minic.</P>
      <P>In welcoming this Bill I would like to say that I find myself in considerable sympathy with some of our art students. Those whose talents direct themselves to the interests of form and design are very often highly sensitive, finely-drawn young people who tend to react more quickly to the sometimes intolerable difficulties of life.  They frequently, as we have seen, find themselves in the midst of controversy, with the distractions that go with the controversy.  For that reason I welcome this departure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1184" /> I must say that I also find myself in considerable sympathy with the officials of the Department of Education over some years past.  As the Minister has indicated, it is not really the function of a Department of State or of civil servants to try to run educational institutions of this kind.  I do not think they should be expected to do so.  I see that there is a genuine effort in the Bill to take the College of Art out of its very recent difficulties and to create a new situation which, with the proposed student participation on the new board, ought to give them and those who will be lecturing the students hope of usefully employing themselves and developing their talents in accordance with their natural bents.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill as a welcome departure in the creation of better working institutions and I hope the board, when they get down to their future work, will focus attention on not alone the arts but also on the crafts which are mentioned in the Bill. Possibly, in the commercial sense, crafts will prove to be the more useful development of industrial design.  This is part of what one would expect to get out of such an institution if one creates a situation in which the College of Art can work, please God, in peace so that the talents of all those who are interested may be more constructively and usefully employed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has shown a general agreement that this Bill is a move in the right direction.  Most Senators assume that any move in the right direction is something to be commended without reservation.  But I would suggest this is something on which we might pause, even if there is agreement that in taking the College from under the umbrella&mdash;which is sometimes a dripping umbrella&mdash;of the Department of Education and setting up an independent board.  We must pause before agreeing that this Bill is in principle a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes if a move in the right direction is only a small step it may be worse than no move at all.  Even to move in what is acknowledged the right direction, to go only a tiny part of the way, may have serious effects.  At times it would be better that that small <Col N="1185" /> step were not taken because there is a human tendency to think that because something is being done that enough is being done, that this particular problem can now be laid aside, and allowed to gather whatever is the statutory amount of dust that must fall on a problem before it is taken down off the shelf again for examination.  So we must examine carefully not only whether the primary step taken in this Bill is in the right direction but whether it is sufficiently far in that direction to overcome the psychological disadvantages that may accrue in that people will be content to say to themselves: &ldquo;Well, that problem is solved for the moment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As other Senators have indicated, the probing of this particular question, the discussion as to how far the Minister should go in divesting himself of responsibility for the school of art, is something more appropriate for Committee Stage.  We have before us, to be discussed in relation to this Bill, both a short-term problem of a serious nature in regard to the College of Art and also a long-term problem of an equally serious nature.  Yesterday we facilitated the Minister in taking this Bill on short notice because all of us in the House are desirous, with all the faults of the past system, with the faults that may still exist in what comes under this Bill, that the present suspension of education in the College of Art should be ended as soon as possible.  We are all anxious to see the solution to the short-term problem.</P>
    <P>We must remember, at the same time, our long-term problem.  Probably in nothing have we failed so greatly as an independent nation in the past 50 years as in regard to the arts.  We can look back and we can justify from history, we can justify from the condition of our people, particularly from the 17th century onwards, the fact that all our artistic instincts have gone into a verbal rather than a visual tradition.  We can boast of our impact on English literature through this focussing of all our artistic instincts and all our artistic endeavour in this one particular direction. This can explain the position in which we found ourselves 50 years ago; it cannot justify the inaction and inactivity which has failed to redress <Col N="1186" /> that balance during the past 50 years.</P>
    <P>In regard to artistic matters we are an unhealthy nation.  In regard to matters of visual education we are behind new countries whose material and economic advantages are considerably less than ours.  We must remedy this.  The move that we take in passing this Bill during these few weeks is tackling a small part of a very large problem that faces us. I think more than any other country we tend to separate art and artists from the other sectors of our national life. We are guilty here of a heresy that has vitiated our attitude to art and left us in the condition in which we are.  We, more than any other people perhaps, look on every artist as a special kind of man or woman, whereas we would be a much healthier community if we looked on every man and woman as potentially a special kind of artist.  We tend to deny to the members of our community their full humanity because we tend to separate out art as something which belongs only to one group of people in the community.</P>
    <P>We are rightly proud&mdash;and it has been mentioned during this debate&mdash;of our artistic achievements of the past, but our culture will wither and become merely a historical survival unless we can correct this attitude of mind, unless we can realise that every member of the community has a potentiality, different in magnitude, of course, in each case, but nevertheless real in every case, to be some special kind of artist.</P>
    <P>The moves in regard to primary school education and in regard to adult education are extremely welcome but they must be supported in other directions and the preoccupation with this great lack in our national life must permeate every part of our life as a community.  Consequently, I think there is a great danger that we will in solving the immediate short-term problem of the college, what has happened there over the past few years, what is the position at the moment, be content to solve this problem and to leave the larger problem unsolved.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay too greatly on this aspect of the Bill.  I do not want to anticipate any discussion that the Seanad might have on a motion which is on the Order Paper in order to discuss the 18th Report of the Arts Council.  I <Col N="1187" /> hope that the Cathaoirleach will not think I am anticipating that when I point out that we have not yet debated the 18th Report whereas the 19th Report has now been published.  We must face this problem; we must tackle this problem of the reorganisation of the College of Art as part of this general problem.</P>
    <P>Even in a narrower sense, of the scope of what was the National College of Art and is now to be a National College of Art and Design, we can take too narrow a viewpoint.  Education in art and education in design must not be isolated and the very change in the title of the body which is in this Bill is a reflection of that.  This raises the whole question of whether in emphasising further the design element we are not fragmenting the question of education in design.  There is a wide spectrum of activity in design and consequently a wide spectrum in design education. We can move across that spectrum from the fine arts that are, and apparently will remain, the concern of the College of Art to craft design which has been their concern.  Then we move further across the spectrum to other subjects in which design is an extremely important element, to architecture, to industrial design and to engineering design.  I should like to ask the Minister whether there is any policy in regard to design education, or whether we are merely in this Bill going to confirm the present division of design education whereby the design element in the fine arts and in crafts is going to be in one institution and design in architecture and engineering and industrial design is to remain in another sector in the universities and in the higher technological colleges.  This is another problem which we must tackle if not on this occasion at least in the very near future.</P>
    <P>The splitting of design education is a dangerous thing and leads to a tendency to consider that there are two types of processes whereas the fundamental human processes that underlie design, be it in the area of industrial design or in the fine arts, are very similar.  What is different is the material on which that human process acts.  But the elements are the same.  The difficult part of design education is not to <Col N="1188" /> educate a person in the nature of the materials on which he works&mdash;this is the easy part&mdash;but the fostering of the creative element.  It is the fostering of the ability to design.  It is the attempt to distinguish those who have real talent in this direction.  The difficulties that face a teacher of design in this particular regard are the same problems, whether they are the problems that face a teacher in the present National College of Art or the problems that confront me and my staff in training our students in engineering design. There is a unity here.  This is the problem that we must face.  That is why I ask the Minister if in changing the title here and emphasising design a decision is implied in regard to the location of the teaching of industrial design in this country.  This has been the subject of a number of comments. It was the subject of a seminar in Killarney last year and still is the subject of study.</P>
    <P>This problem of design education taken as a whole must be faced and must be solved.  In looking at this problem we must keep our options wide open.  Many Senators have spoken yesterday and today about the relation of the new college to the Higher Education Authority.  I should hope that we would see a wider range of options considered, whether they are to be considered by the Higher Education Authority or by some other body.  I was disappointed to find in the report of the Commission on Higher Education, that saw the problem of art education quite clearly, an apparent dismissal, without much discussion, of the possibility of bringing not only design education but education in the fine arts within the university structure.  I should hope that this particular alternative would not be ruled out in any discussion in the future.  The universities themselves would be better places if they not only had their faculties of arts but faculties of fine arts as well.  After all, universities are supposed to be designed for the universal person, the full human being. If we continue to exclude students in fine arts or training in fine arts from the universities we are cementing this heresy that I spoke of earlier that artists are a special group&mdash;by some people they are considered a special type of <Col N="1189" /> freak&mdash;that must be treated on a separate basis.  We, as a nation, have a greater failing in this regard than many other nations.  The consequences of continuing to separate the training of students in arts and science and the professions from the training of artists may have more serious consequences in this country than elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that among its other effects creativity creates problems. Those most gifted from this point of view may well create more problems in an educational institution than others. Let us look beyond these secondary effects and realise what a precious thing creativity is.  It may be that the events of the past two years in the College of Art are the price that we have to pay for the fact that we have talented young people willing to devote their lives to art and to the pursuit of beauty not only in the teaching of it in the schools but also as a way of life.  Maybe this is the price we have to pay for having such people in our community. It is a small price if we realise what would be the loss to the community if we did not have such individuals.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons that I think that we must, when passing this Bill urgently at the Minister's request in order to get things moving again in the College of Art, avoid the temptation as marking off this problem of education in art and education in design as a problem disposed of.  The Minister, while his in-tray of matters to be dealt with is overflowing, should resist the temptation when this Bill is passed and the new board set up to transfer his notional file of education in art and design to an out-tray to be filed away and not dealt with again.  We are happy to facilitate the Minister in solving the short-term problem but we will not be happy if he refuses to face the long-term problem. It is one that makes us imperfect and crippled as a nation.  In regard to the visual arts we are less than what we should be as a community.  This problem as well as the immediate problem must be faced, whether by this Minister or by another Minister or by the community, or else our culture of which we are proud will become a thing merely of tradition, a diminishing asset.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill <Col N="1190" /> and have a few comments to make.  In regard to section 6.  I would be against a representation of five teachers and three students, a total of eight out of 15, or, in other words, a monopoly for the teachers and students.  I think this would be altogether out of the question. Somebody must be there who will have some regard for the national purse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it may be stupid but it is a saying.  They would be too much involved in the running of the college to consider the national purse. They would consider that every possible facility, no matter what money it cost, should be provided whether the State could afford it or not.  For that reason I consider that they should not have control.</P>
      <P>I should like to say that I welcome section 19 where it says that no Member of the House should be a member of the board.  However, I see a modification in this that was not in the last Bill that I welcomed where it stated that &ldquo;when he notified his intention of standing for either House he had to resign&rdquo; but it says in this &ldquo;when he becomes a Member of either House of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.  Section 22 states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>An Bord may, with the approval of the Minister, by construction or acquisition (including acquisition under a lease or other letting or a licence), provide itself with and equip and maintain such buildings and other premises as it considers necessary or desirable for the performance of its functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, I think we have far too many buildings, far too many offices and far too many boards.  I think there should be more co-operation between the boards and that a greater number of boards should use the same premises <Col N="1191" /> and, in some cases, the same equipment. All of those boards cannot be operating to the full at all times the equipment and the staff they have.  There should be some co-operation in this matter to effect a saving on State funds.  I wish to say that I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>Senator Dooge, when speaking on this Bill, said he hoped that the Minister would not, having had the Bill passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas, regard the problem as solved and have the whole matter shelved.  I think the Senator will agree with me that, in the educational field, it is never possible to regard any problem as being solved.  Education is a continuing process and, however one may feel at a given time that a problem is solved, it very soon appears in another form and because education is a continuing process we must always regard it as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked, in my opening statement, that there should be no recriminations in <Col N="1192" /> relation to the past history of the college. I am very glad, and I wish to congratulate Senators on this, that my request has, generally speaking, been acceded to.  We are all very anxious to ensure that this new board get off to a good start.  To ensure this, it was and is essential that the debate should be kept at a high level.  We find at the same time, that, in debating a Bill of this kind, it is difficult to discuss it without being influenced by the rather emotional situation which prevailed over the last couple of years.  I must congratulate Senators for the way in which they have endeavoured to avoid recriminations in relation to the past.</P>
    <P>I could not help noting during the discussion that some of the points that were made have already been dealt with in the amended Bill.  It appears to me that perhaps some of the Senators who spoke might not have had an opportunity of reading the Bill as carefully as they would have liked.  Some of the points seem to me to have been related more to the original Bill, which I am sure all Senators have read carefully, rather than to the amended Bill.  I recognise the fact that this whole matter was rather rushed and it is understandable that some points would have been raised which have already been dealt with.</P>
    <P>When introducing the Bill I pointed out that its purpose was to establish a board to be known as An Bord an Choláiste Náisiúnta Ealaíne is Deartha to govern the college.  I was rather perplexed at the amount of time that was spent by Senator Kelly in discussing the name.  He said he felt that perhaps he was being pedantic in relation to this and I must say that I agree with him. If the Senator were to consult the dictionary compiled by his colleague, An tOllamh De Bháldraithe, or the dictionary of An tAthair Duinnín he would find that there is nothing slovenly in the substitution of &ldquo;is&rdquo; for &ldquo;agus&rdquo;. As I have already said in Irish, to me it has a more musical sound in this particular context.  It does not follow that if &ldquo;agus&rdquo; is used in certain circumstances we should use it in all circumstances. The sound of &ldquo;is&rdquo; in this particular context appears, I repeat, to be somewhat more musical than &ldquo;agus&rdquo; and as we are dealing with art perhaps <Col N="1193" /> this is the place we should make the change.</P>
    <P>Senator Keery mentioned, during the course of his discussion&mdash;I will return to some of the points raised by Senator Kelly later&mdash;that the view of many people outside the college is that it should be razed to the ground.  This is understandable when one reflects on its recent history.  Unfortunately this is the attitude of very many people towards the college, because of the activities there in recent times.</P>
    <P>However, I would be failing in my obligations if I did not make special reference to the band of diligent and conscientious people who have worked in that college over the years.  The excellent results that have been achieved there are there for those who want to see them.  I feel annoyed, and justifiably so, when I hear people who owe their present eminence in the world of art and design principally to the National College of Art being highly critical of those very people who guided them in the college.</P>
    <P>Last night Senator FitzGerald referred to the very famous people who were students of the college in the 1800's. I do not think that there is any need to go back to the 1800's in relation to this particular matter.  We have very many eminent artists and architects in our midst at present who owe very much of their success to what they learned in the College of Art.</P>
    <P>In a way I accept that it is perhaps difficult for the ordinary person to know very much about, or to understand, the positive side of the activities of the college.  Personally, as a Deputy, I passed the college, day in day out, without knowing very much about its activities.  It is only since I became Minister for Education that I have become keenly aware of the role that it has played in the life of the country, and must continue to play with added vigour and energy, if we are not to be found wanting in such a basic thing as design, which is vital to our future development.  I should like to stress that we should not neglect for one moment the cultural influence of the college in creating an appreciation and an awareness of those things which are vital to <Col N="1194" /> the existence of the full man.</P>
    <P>If there has been a failure to appreciate the importance of art, the fault lies perhaps in our system generally which until recently did not give art its due place either in the primary or in the post-primary schools.  Senator Dooge referred to this.  There is a very considerable advance being made now and Senator Dooge has referred to the emphasis on art in the new curriculum for primary schools.</P>
    <P>As far as the post-primary schools are concerned, the blame, at least in part, can be placed on the universities for their failure to recognise art as a subject for university entrance.  Again, I should like to refer to the implementation of the new curriculum for primary schools.  It will be noticed now that much greater stress is being laid on activities associated with arts and crafts.  The very much greater degree to which art is being taught in post-primary schools should ensure that both of these taken together will go a very considerable distance towards rectifying the position, and will help very considerably, as mentioned by Senator Dooge, in relation to the development of the artistic ability of our young people.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge asked what our policy was in relation to art.  Our immediate policy in relation to art is to develop the teaching of it to the greatest extent possible in our primary and post-primary schools.  The steps which have already been taken in that direction are beginning to show fruit.  I do not want to tie the hands of those who will be governing the College of Art in the future, by seeking to impose a policy on them before they are even established. It will be for them, in consultation with other institutions, to work out a new approach to the problems of art in general, and of design in particular, and especially where these problems relate to third level teaching.  I should like to add that the universities will have to play their part in these consultations. For instance, it would be impossible to divorce the teaching of engineering at university level from engineering design.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate I was asked if I would answer very pertinent questions about the College of Art and I shall answer them unequivocally.  The <Col N="1195" /> site for the new college will be at Morehampton Road.  An architect has been appointed for the building.  He is Mr. Dáithí Hanly.  I know that comparisons made, particularly between professional people, can be highly invidious.  Therefore, I hope that nobody in professional or other spheres will take it amiss of me when I state that, both in relation to his architectural qualifications and experience, and his knowledge of art and the requirements of art teaching, he is ideally equipped to undertake the task of designing the new College of Art.  He will be assisted by the provision of an educational brief by art and other educational experts.</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister and I shall not do so unless he allows me, or if the Chair does so.  This is an important matter.  I want to make it clear that I accept everything he says about the gentleman he has named, but I should like the Minister to say before deciding on this gentleman, if he held a competition or advertised the giving of this commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but as I have said, the gentleman concerned is highly competent in this particular field. I am sure that the College of Art which he will design will measure up to any standards which might be required in relation to it.</P>
      <P>I was also asked if we had looked for advice in relation to art education generally.  It is true to say that there is hardly any facet of education in relation to which my Department and I have received so much advice as we have in regard to art education.  This advice has come to us from within the State and from outside it, and we have gone to the trouble of finding out what the position is in other countries.  In the final analysis we had to make up our minds as to what would suit our situation best and this Bill represents the results of our consideration in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> I do not wish to go into detail in relation to many of the points raised. They will be more relevant on Committee Stage.  I will refer however, to a number of points raised by Senator Kelly.  Section 5 <i>(e)</i> relates to moneys provided from public funds.  It does not run counter to section 23.  An Bord will determine whether the conditions attaching to a gift are such as to be inconsistent with the functions of An Bord.  The Minister will have no function in relation to section 23.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 18 there will be no question of any employee of An Bord being a civil servant.  The Senator may have been referring to paid officials. This section is necessary in order that An Bord may perform their day-to-day administrative tasks.  We had a discussion on a similar matter before and I explained it in exactly the same way.  I deplore the remarks from some of the Opposition here and in the other House which appear to me to be a constant denigration of civil servants.  This may relate to the fact that civil servants have been dealing for some time with the College of Art.  They have done excellent work there and there is no reason why a civil servant should not be a member of the board if I found that he was competent in the artistic field.  I do not propose to appoint a civil servant but in case this might be interpreted as a denigration of civil servants generally, this is not so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt but it is not fair to say we denigrated the civil servants.  It is possible to be a superb civil servant and still know nothing about art.  That is all I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be but the references generally appear to relate to the difficulties civil servants have been having in endeavouring to operate the College of Art.  They have been subjected to a good deal of abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Horgan referred to what he termed the physical fact that the doors of the College of Art had been locked against the students.  Surely he must have asked himself why.  I wonder if he has noted several letters which have been written and signed by a large <Col N="1197" /> number of students who just wanted to get on with their work.  The tragedy of over-simplification in these matters is that people tend to consult with those who have been making the headlines.</P>
    <P>Regarding Senator Horgan's references to the Department of Education, these sweeping criticisms do not hold water.  One has merely to look at the work done in all aspects of education in recent years.  The Senator should be able to see the enormous changes which have taken place in our educational system. Fortunately most people are not blind to what has been achieved.  Listening to the Senator on this topic one would imagine that Ireland was lagging behind in educational matters and was only now awakening to the educational needs of the people.  One would think we were sadly behind other countries.  Our educational system can be compared with educational systems in developed countries and, in some instance, we are in advance of them.</P>
    <P>The question was raised as to why &ldquo;design&rdquo; was added to the original name of the college and Senator Horgan suggested that perhaps it was because the World Bank were involved and that they were insisting that we should change the system generally in the college.  There is no question of the World Bank being involved.  Senator Horgan also suggested we needed this money from the World Bank to help shore up a tottering economy.  The Senator should recognise that far from the World Bank shoring up a tottering economy, it will give a loan only where it is sure that the economy is sound.</P>
    <P>It was considered necessary to add the word &ldquo;design&rdquo; to the name of the college to emphasise that it will cater equally for other aspects of art, as for the fine arts.  Design could be termed applied art; like applied mathematics it is more practical than the mother subject.  It is a discipline in itself.  It is more restrictive in ways than the fine arts as very often the practitioner must work within stricter limits than the artist; for example, limited space, material, utility, feasibility of our mass production, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>Design in industry is the application of the fine arts to colour and shape in relation to the finished products.  The Scandinavians have developed their own <Col N="1198" /> special type of design.  Senator Robinson referred to the fact that other countries had evolved their own special type of design and that we should do likewise. I agree with this.  It is often possible to identify the national origins of many products by their design.</P>
    <P>It is important from the point of view of national identity that we should develop our own particular style of design and stop imitating other countries.  It could be built-up from the traditional Celtic design or could be inspired by the style of many of our crafts.  Our artists could receive inspiration from their geographic surroundings on land or sea.  It could develop from the imaginative ability which is so eminent in our literature.  The important thing is to develop a style of design so that when one of our products is being examined abroad, it can be identified as Irish.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan stated that had it not been for the problems existing in the College of Art, this Bill would not be before the House.  This, of course, I refute entirely.  I refute also the statement he made in relation to what had been done with regard to student fees.  The Senator should be well aware, knowing students as he does, that if the decision in relation to what I decided to do in regard to the student fees had been made known earlier some other claim would have taken its place.</P>

      <P>Sneator Robinson spoke about the community as a whole being involved in art.  I would very much agree with her that this is something which should be aimed at.  However, without going into the situation in the past, I should like simply to say that the activities in the college in recent times have succeeded in divorcing the community from the college and from the whole art situation, as Senator Keery mentioned.  This is most unfortunate and I pointed out to the students when I was speaking to them that it was essential if we were to develop our whole art education that we should have the goodwill of the community generally and that we should endeavour as best we could to involve the whole community in the question of art education, but that by the type of action that was being highlighted in the media they were unfortunately divorcing the community from them.</P>
      <P>The attitude of the community towards them is very much on the lines which Senator Keery mentioned.  This is unfortunate.  I believe that the College of Art has an exceptionally important function in our whole educational system. I would hope that we could involve the whole community in our art education in general.  It should be obvious that the courses which were followed in recent times had the very opposite effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the problem that is not being solved.  We are just transferring the same bad system to a new building.  My whole point is that unless we create the opportunities for artists, unless we give them an output, unless the College of Art itself changes drastically, we are not solving anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1200" /> We are not meeting the problem.  We are just avoiding it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course we are meeting the problem.  The problem in so far as a relatively small group of students is concerned appeared to be that they were not satisfied with the manner in which the college was being conducted by the Department.  I have said on many occasions that I fully accept that a Department of State are not a suitable body for dealing with the College of Art.  It is for that reason that this Bill is now before the House, so as to provide a new type of government in which not only will eminent people in the world of art be involved but also the teachers and students themselves.  This is a first step.  Having taken this step it will be a matter for the new board to consider the whole situation and see in which way art education in the college and outside it can be developed.</P>
      <P>The question of designating the college as a college of higher education was also mentioned.  As I said in the Dáil, it is not possible for me to designate, or even to suggest that I would designate, a college without consulting the Higher Education Authority.  I do not presume to make any statement on that particular aspect of the matter.</P>

      <P>But the Higher Education Authority are there.  This Bill has been six months in gestation. Could the Minister not have asked them?</P>

      <P>The Senator will realise that the Higher Education Authority have quite a number of matters on their plate and they may feel that they would wish to see this college in operation for some time before deciding whether or not they ought to advise me as to whether it should be a college of higher education.</P>

      <P>Finally, I want to say that some Senators have stated this Bill is a small step.  In my view it is a very considerable step.  It is recognised as such by the vast majority of the students and teachers in the college. We are establishing an autonomous board.  We have got to put our trust in the new board to ensure that our art education will be developed to the extent we should all like to see it developed.  There are, of course, very considerable problems to be overcome but I have no doubt that with sufficient goodwill these problems can be solved.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister omitted to state whether he had any objection to my suggestion about transferring the college to Kilkenny.</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Leader of the House, while the Minister <Col N="1202" /> is still here, whether it is likely that either on Wednesday if the Committee Stage finishes early enough, or otherwise on Thursday, the two motions on the Order Paper which concern the Minister might be taken?  They are Nos. 15 and 16, concerning the National Library and the National Museum.  Can it be foreseen at this stage?</P>
