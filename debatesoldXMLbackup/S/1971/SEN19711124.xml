      <P>I want to raise a matter in relation to the Order of Business which was referred to on the last two occasions on which we met.  This day fortnight I asked the Leader of the House if he could give any indication as to when he is likely to take the motion in my name and that of Senator Desmond, that is, motion No. 19.  It was also raised last Wednesday by Senator Robinson. I should like to appeal to the Leader of the House in this regard.  The motion was tabled on the day on which the report was circulated: it could not have been done any earlier.  I do not want to appear to be asking that my motion should take precedence over anybody else's, but it is particularly important to every woman worker in this country that this matter be treated very seriously and debated.  The time set for the introduction of the recommendation is January, 1972.  Therefore, it is very important that this House be given the opportunity of debating this report before the Employer-Labour Conference meets in 1972, and I appeal to the Leader of the House to inform us if he has it included in his programme of business to be taken between now and the Recess.  If he has not, perhaps the House would consider giving a special session to the taking of this motion.  I cannot stress sufficiently how urgent it is.  I am quite confident that there are many Members of this House on both sides who would want to debate this matter.</P>

      <P>Senator Owens seemed to feel that she might possibly be putting herself in the position of seeking to press her own motion at the expense of others.  In connection with that, while I also recognise that there are several motions of importance on the Order Paper, I subscribe to the view that motion No. 19, in the names of Senators Owens and Desmond, is a motion of considerable importance and of considerable urgency.  It is one which the House should go out of its way, if necessary, to take at an early date.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann, mindful of the growing unrest which exists amongst the members of the nursing profession and the increasingly acute staff shortage in many of our hospitals, whilst noting recent offers made, hereby calls on the Minister for Health to take immediate steps to improve the salary scales and conditions of service&mdash;including promotional opportunities &mdash; working conditions and training facilities of nurses and student nurses, especially by the provision of a College of Nursing, revision of the antiquated disciplinary code and removal of non-nursing duties of a clerical and domestic nature at present required <Col N="1467" /> to be carried out by nurses in many hospitals.</P>

      <P>I should like to set the stage for this motion.  It arose from two or three occurrences.  First, it arose from statements made on the various Stages of the Health Bill, 1970, which eventually was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Also, at the time this motion was put down, on 3rd July, 1970, there were certain units, wards and beds vacant in various hospitals, especially in those under the jurisdiction of the Dublin Health Authority, due to the lack of nursing staff.  That was another reason for it.</P>
      <P>The whole problem of nursing grievances in relation to conditions and any impediment that prevents people from entering the service or vocation of nursing should be examined by this House of the Oireachtas.  Hence this motion on the Order Paper, and I am grateful to the leader of the House for the opportunity of discussing it.</P>
      <P>Certain changes have occurred since 1970.  I should like to show how valid were our reasons in 1970 for putting down a motion of this nature.  This morning I received the report of the Chief Medical Officer for the year 1970, entitled &ldquo;The Dublin Health Authority&rdquo;. The regional health boards had not come into existence at that time; they did not start to operate until 1st April of this year.  Dealing with Cherry Orchard Hospital, it states at the end of the first paragraph on page 33:</P>
      <P>It was found necessary to close three wards for most of the year 1970 due to a shortage of senior nursing personnel, and this mainly accounted for the lower number of admissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very serious if people suffering from infectious diseases are precluded from entering an isolation hospital <Col N="1468" /> due to the lack of proper staffing. I agree with the authorities of the hospital that it is better not to admit them to hospital if they are not going to receive adequate and proper nursing. Dealing with St. Mary's Hospital the medical superintendent says on page 124 of this report:</P>
    <P>The most significant figure in the reports for the year is the overall reduction in numbers of admissions and discharges.  This may be accounted for by the fact that many beds have been out of commission for long periods during the year because of renovations and nursing shortage.</P>
    <P>I adverted to that during the debate on the Committee Stage of the Health Bill when I spoke of State-enrolled nurses. I knew at that time of the severe nursing shortage of staff in the various institutions under the then Dublin Health Authority.  In his reply the Minister said he was not satisfied that there was a need for those nurses.  I quote from Volume 67 of the Seanad Debates of 4th February, 1970:</P>
    <P>Dr. Belton: That is one, and the suggestion here of the State enrolled nurses and the State registered nurses is a thing that might be examined in this context too.</P>
    <P>Mr. Childers: I have no demand for State enrolled nurses, and An Bord Altranais thinks that we do not need to have them here.</P>
    <P>Dr. Belton: There is a feeling in the Dublin Health Authority that the time might come&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. Childers: The time might come, but shortage of nurses can only be seen in certain limited pockets and not over the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Dr. Belton: We have had this discussion with the Health Authority over the State enrolled nurses before.</P>
    <P>Since then the Dublin Health Authority no longer exists.  It forms the main portion of the Eastern Health Board. All the institutions of the Dublin Health Authority are now being run by the Eastern Health Board.  This morning I inquired the number of State-enrolled <Col N="1469" /> nurses who were employed.  There are 95 employed distributed as follows:</P>
    <P>16 James Connolly Hospital</P>
    <P>28 St. James's Hospital</P>
    <P>13 St. Mary's Hospital</P>
    <P>29 Cherry Orchard Hospital</P>
    <P>6 St. Colmcille's Hospital</P>
    <P>At this time last year the figure was 49, so there is an increase of 46 in State-enrolled nurses.  There is a lay administrator as well as a medical superintendent in Cherry Orchard Hospital and he told me he would not have been able to open two wards were it not for State-enrolled nurses.  They now have only one ward closed, whereas at the time I referred to in 1970 there were three wards closed.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the visiting committee set up by the Eastern Health Board to visit Baltinglass Hospital.  The total nursing complement in this hospital is 11, five of whom sleep in and six of whom are married and live in Baltinglass village.  There is no light industry in Baltinglass and so it is possible to have six married women coming in daily to nurse in the hospital.  There has been passed by the Minister's Department plans for a new building to accommodate either 20 or 26 geriatric patients.  This is a good thing as they will be nearer home, but I am worried about the nursing situation in Baltinglass. Is it correct to erect the building before the Department are satisfied that there will be adequate nursing available within the area for these people who will be transferred from Rathdrum Hospital?</P>
    <P>I now go on to deal <i>seriatim</i> with some of the points in this motion. There is still a shortage, especially of qualified nursing personnel.  There is no shortage in pupil nurses' applications for training.  There are probably twice as many applicants as places to be filled.  When they qualify they do not remain on and become sisters.  There is an extreme shortage of qualified State-registered nurses.  This applies to the board I know most about and I presume it applies equally to the boards throughout the country.  The purpose of this motion is to remedy this situation.</P>
    <P>Heretofore nurses, especially pupil nurses and even sisters, have been asked <Col N="1470" /> to do domestic chores or duties which are not appropriate to nursing.  Nurses also have to perform office work which could be done by other people.  There is a tendency in all fields to increase the documentation in every transaction. This applies to medicine and nursing and there is quite a lot of documentation necessary in hospital wards which could be equally well done by non-nursing personnel within the hospital.</P>
    <P>At present there is a lay person appointed as housekeeper in Cherry Orchard Hospital.  Up to now the housekeeper has always been a qualified nurse.  The hospital authorities find the lay person as good at performing the duties of the housekeeper as a qualified nursing sister.  In hospitals generally it may be a wastage of nursing ability to use nurses as housekeepers.</P>
    <P>Regarding the conditions of employment, since this motion was put down certain changes for the better have occurred.  Since July, 1970, there has been a revision in salaries for all grades following an arbitration hearing.  A 40-hour week for nurses has been put into effect.  An 85-hour fortnight has now been agreed for pupil midwives, that is, student nurses in voluntary hospitals.  There has been an increase in the number of posts of night superintendent and superintendent public health nurses.  Some domestic supervisors have been sanctioned in health board hospitals.  These changes for the better have occurred since July, 1970. If this motion had been taken earlier I might have been speaking about those matters.  I should like to congratulate the people who thought fit to alleviate the conditions by introducing these changes.</P>
    <P>An effort has been made to recognise the necessity for a better incrementai scale for those entering the service in certain grades.  I should like the Minister to have another look at this.  The Minister allows full credit for previous service to a nurse taking up a permanent post in the staff nurse grade only.  For more senior grades such credit is allowed for relevant professional experience at home but not for service given abroad, no matter how specialised, in a hospital, administrative or teaching post, for instance, in public health.  I should like the Minister to look at this <Col N="1471" /> again.  Because of the staff shortage in our hospitals, it may be as well to give some inducement even to people returning from abroad.</P>
    <P>The Minister has rejected all efforts to bring within the scope of the superannuation scheme that applies to voluntary hospitals all those who work in licensed nursing homes.  He can correct me if I am wrong on this, but from the information given to me I believe my statement to be correct.  If it is not, I should be very glad if the Minister would correct me.</P>
    <P>I should like to advert now to another matter that was mentioned on the Committee Stage of the Health Act, the fees that pupil nurses pay in some voluntary hospitals.  Many of us&mdash;and I think Senator Ó Maoláin spoke on this&mdash;feel it is wrong to exact from these pupil nurses a fee to enter certain voluntary hospitals.  It may be that a scheme could be devised and I will enlarge on this when I am winding up about the college of nursing&mdash;whereby two different types of grant could be given to a hospital, one for the services rendered to the public and the other towards educating the nursing staff of that hospital.  It could be given as two separate amounts.  That would preclude the collecting of money from the pupil nurses in the voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>There is one other item on which I should like to speak, that is, the disciplinary code.  Since I ceased to be resident in a hospital the code has been relaxed to some extent.  When I was resident in a hospital the nurses had no time off at all.  They could not go to dances.  If they did they were expelled. Has this disciplinary code been relaxed enough?  Hospitals will find it difficult to recruit nurses of suitable age, and we will take 18 years of age as the average, when their time off, their recreation and how they spend their leisure hours is restricted.  The hospitals must recognise that they will be competing with outside firms, employment agencies and employers as regards leisure hours; otherwise recruitment will drop.  I do not suggest that there should be such laxity in discipline as to create havoc.  Neither do I suggest that there should be such laxity as to conflict <Col N="1472" /> with the proper carrying out of the duties of the pupil nurse.  But I think the question of discipline should be examined in the light of what I have suggested.</P>
    <P>Besides the two types of nurses, the State-registered nurse and State-enrolled nurse, a case may be made for a less qualified person in the care of geriatric patients, especially male.  It may not be necessary in geriatric nursing to have the qualifications that would be necessary in other spheres.  The Minister might consider this.  To take again the question of Baltinglass Hospital to which I referred to earlier, the patients there may be ambulant when they come in, and of course can be treated reasonably easily.  But eventually they become bedridden and, in addition to the ordinary nursing care, there will be the physical work of lifting them and doing certain things for them that should be done by a person without the skills of a qualified nurse.</P>
    <P>I should like, having said all that, to come back to the main point: the setting up of a college of nursing.  The Irish Nursing Organisation have been looking for a college of nursing and there is great merit in what they desire. The ultimate in a college of nursing would be a faculty of nursing in the university or something of that nature. That is not practical at the moment and I am not suggesting that the Minister should apply himself to anything of that nature at present.</P>
    <P>Good reasons exist for the establishment of a college of nursing.  Medicine is changing at a rapid rate at present and with it are changing certain nursing skills.  A nurse who qualified five or six years ago may need post-graduate training.  She may need to get instruction in various new techniques.  One such technique has just been introduced in the last few years.  The Minister will know what I am referring to: the monitoring of the condition of people who have heart disease.  Ten years ago no nurse could possibly read one of these instruments, which is tantamount to a television screen with the heart-rate running across it.  Now it is common practice in hospitals.  This is one example of what I am getting at.</P>
    <P>There should be a central college <Col N="1473" /> where nurses could go, spend some time specialising in certain subjects, and specialising in the running of the renal units that are so much in vogue today. There should be a superintendent or a sister tutor and various assistants.  I am certain the Minister has had communication on this matter from the Irish Nurses Organisation.  The Minister was present on 31st October this year at an address given by Miss Maureen T. McCabe and also by Judith M. Chavasae, BA, RNT on post basic nursing education.</P>
    <P>These are lengthy documents and with the limited time I have at my disposal I do not propose to go into great detail as to what a college of nursing should be.  Perhaps those who follow me may elaborate on it.  The Minister has had before him proposals from the Irish Nursing Organisation and he has listened to various nursing organisations making a case for them. He was present at an international nursing conference here during the summer and the Taoiseach spoke at it and advocated a college of nursing.  It is not as easy as it appears to decide whether you integrate such a college with a university or whether you make it a separate entity.  I am not clear, as yet, which is the better course.</P>
    <P>Much more examination of the subject will have to be undertaken before one can decide what form a college of nursing should take, but there must be a college of nursing.  It may not be an institution in the sense of being in one building, but it must be a getting together of people to further the knowledge they have gained in their training and in their experience in hospitals. Whether that be through a university or through a separate body or institution will have to be worked out in greater detail with An Bord Altranais, the various nurses' organisations and the Department.  I commend this motion to the Seanad and I hope every Senator here will support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to second this motion which has been so ably proposed by Senator Belton.  Senator Belton, being a member of the medical profession, certainly knows much more about the nurses' sphere of life than we <Col N="1474" /> lay people; but looking at it, even from a lay person's point of view, when one enters a hospital to see a patient one realises the hardship that is created for the people in the nursing profession. As Senator Belton has said, they have to lift patients who are much too heavy to be lifted by nurses; but they have to try and make the patients as comfortable as possible.  They also have to discuss many problems with these patients. Sickness can often come suddenly. People may have some financial commitments and the nurses have to try and prevent the patients from becoming depressed and to encourage them in every possible way.  Ordinary laymen certainly do not appreciate sufficiently what the nursing profession is doing, in particular for the poorer people who are sick.</P>
      <P>As a member of a local authority for a number of years it often strikes me, going into a hospital and seeing nurses keeping records of the patients, that this work should be done by a clerk in order to leave the nurse with more time to talk to patients and discuss their problems with them.</P>
      <P>On this score, particularly in rural areas, I think we are obliged to say a word of thanks to religious orders who look after the patients in most of our institutions.  By this I mean the various homes, district hospitals and surgical hospitals.  Were it not for the religious orders we would find ourselves with a serious problem.  When we look at our hospitals we find that a number of nurses in them are married women, women who come in there for a miserable salary.  They are dedicated people; they are there on demand.  If any institution requires their services and they are within reach of that institution they are prepared to give their services. We are obliged at least to say thanks to these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other sector of the nursing profession which often cross my mind are the district nurses.  I do not know if that is the correct term for them at the moment.  They were known as district nurses but they have been replaced by area nurses attached to a given dispensary district.  These nurses serve a great purpose.  They look after and advice new mothers and the elderly and <Col N="1475" /> do all they can to help them.  These are the two categories of nurses who come more under my eye more than others now.  I know we have another type of nurse&mdash;those in mental hospitals.  These people are certainly doing a worthwhile job.</P>
    <P>In the West of Ireland we find that a number of our nurses emigrate. Younger people who return often pose the question to me: why are their qualifications in this country not recognised in the United States?  I do not know what the answer is, but I feel obliged on this motion to bring it to the notice of the Minister.  When he is replying to the debate he may be able to comment on it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the training of nurses, one is inclined to ask why so many of our nurses are trained in England and why have we not got training facilities in this country for these young girls.  I am sure they would be prepared to avail of those facilities if they were available here.</P>
    <P>I think the health boards and the Department of Health should have entered into negotiations much earlier in order to prevent the recent strike of nurses.  I think that was their hope and I do not think the various health boards dealt with them in the manner in which they should have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I should, first of all, like to welcome the fair way in which Senator Belton presented his case for the motion.  I think I am right in saying that, when this motion was originally put down, it was largely inspired by a memorandum which was sent to Deputies and Senators by the Irish Nursing Organisation.  It was a memorandum which I read with considerable interest in May, 1970, and I am glad that since that time we have seen an improvement in the pay situation where the nursing profession is concerned. Indeed, last year the general trained nurses were given a substantial increase of salary, varying from 11 per cent to 13 per cent.  So we are, in a sense, discussing this motion in an improved context from the time when it was first put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Belton has said, it <Col N="1476" /> remains true that we have a shortage of nurses, particularly a shortage of certain trained nurses.  In facing that fact, I should like to say that I am still convinced that the situation is as it was recorded in the Fitzgerald Report on the outline of the future hospital system. When they referred to nurses, at page 86, they pointed out that we are fortunate in the Republic in having excellent candidates for the nursing profession.  That is certainly true.  We have a great tradition in the nursing field and we must set that fact beside this situation of shortage and ask ourselves what can be done to ensure that these excellent candidates available for nursing meet this situation of shortage.</P>
    <P>Shortage can, of course, arise in a number of ways, from people leaving the profession or from people who have gone overseas, deciding that for one reason or another they cannot come back on a satisfactory basis; or there may be young girls who, when they look into the detailed career situation, may decide against it.  Apart from the responsibility of the Minister for Health, this is a situation which must be dealt with in a very general way.  The improvement of salaries and conditions in the formal sense, as negotiated by the nursing organisation and the authorities involved, is just part of the picture.  Of course, I hope that the improving pattern which we have seen since 1964, where there has been an increase of 64 per cent in salaries compared with an increase of 48 per cent in the cost of living, will be maintained.</P>
    <P>I want to make some points about the peripheral factors in the situation.  First of all, I should like to say a little about the actual running and working of hospitals.  I think I have mentioned this in previous health debates.  As a layman visiting hospitals from time to time, or bringing in a child for treatment or something of that kind, one is constantly struck&mdash;and it is probably partly a factor of shortage, but also partly a factor of organisation&mdash;by the business of long waits, delays, apparent panics and so on.</P>
    <P>Such a long-established professional situation as obtains in a hospital, with very strong traditions of the various <Col N="1477" /> professional skills there, should have its working organisations reviewed from time to time.  I know some efforts have been made to mount work study surveys in the hospital services.  It is extremely important that the growing interest in applying research in the social services should be applied with as much energy as possible in the hospital field.  It can only help in the organisation of the nursing and specialist staff for the benefit of the patients and the public and it might go some way towards measuring the extent of shortage.</P>
    <P>I was a little disappointed when the Institute of Public Administration was launching a work study unit which for a number of reasons did not properly get off the ground.  I think it is now more directly in the hands of the Department of Health.  Now that this decision has been taken, I hope this kind of work study will go on apace in the hospital service.</P>
    <P>Professional people, like doctors and nurses who are devoted, in a humanitarian sense, to their work, are particularly sensitive to red tape and to hair splitting regarding rules and regulations. I can understand this and I think it is a factor that anybody dealing with people working in the humanitarian field must recognise.  For that reason it is all the more important that those, whether they be civil servants, local authority officials or whoever they may be, dealing with such people should be particularly aware of the negative results and negative attitudes that are likely to be created by a bureaucratic approach.  Often in negotiations regarding salaries or working conditions we find that some small niggling point can tip the whole thing over into disaster.  This is an important point that our administrators should bear in mind.</P>
    <P>In my view, in hospitals, the attitudes of matrons and senior staff to the young students are an extremely important factor in the satisfactory working of the hospitals.  A happy environment in hospitals will encourage girls to enter and continue in the nursing profession. I can understand that many of the older matrons and sisters feel that they went through a tremendously rigid pattern of discipline and that it is only proper that everybody else entering the profession <Col N="1478" /> should be subject to the same discipline.</P>
    <P>Times and attitudes towards discipline of this kind have changed every bit as much as the equipment in the hospitals has changed.  People must recognise this and act accordingly.  For example, a duty roster arranged at one or two weeks notice does not inconvenience an elderly sister or matron in any way, but it can certainly inconvenience a young nurse who may be trying to plan some form of additional education or recreational or social activity on an advance basis.  It can be extremely inconvenient for such a person and it is the sort of thing that can lead to frustration.  They should be given adequate notice of their duties for a reasonable period ahead.  Senior people in hospitals should be aware of this need and should try to ensure that the recreational, educational and social interests of their staff are adequately provided for.</P>
    <P>When this motion was first tabled, a young nurse pointed out to me that interviews with a matron in a hospital usually occur outside duty hours, such as during the coffee break, A student nurse is expected to present herself, sign on for inspection, her uniform and appearance must be spotless and so on, and if any aspect of her appearance is not absolutely perfect that nurse may be penalised by losing a night off or by the cancellation of a late meal.  In addition, during the coffee break and rest periods she is expected to make her own bed, tidy her room and get her light meal.  It is this sort of thing that can lead to frustration.  People must become more conscious of these frustrations.  Senior staff in hospitals should try to ensure that the young student nurses enjoy a certain measure of the freedom which they would enjoy in other professions.</P>
    <P>I should like to end my contribution by stressing the need, which other Senators have stressed, for some form of post-graduate or post-qualification training for nurses on a more organised basis.  I understand that at present An Bord Altranais is considering this matter.  I listened to Senator Belton when he talked about the college of nursing and I was interested to note, in <Col N="1479" /> contrast, that the comment of the Fitzgerald Report on page 86, although they may not have been specifically dealing with the same point, was that nurse training schools should be associated with the regional and general hospitals by arrangement with An Bord Altranais.  This may be something that will be considered by An Bord Altranais as well.</P>
    <P>Training is particularly required nowadays in the nursing profession because of the way the techniques and the machinery available to service the medical profession have advanced.  For example, most nurses now become involved in coronary care and intensive care units and may well become involved in cardiac theatre nursing.  In these fields the equipment and the working of the modern equipment involved is absolutely vital to the wellbeing of the patients.  It is equally vital that the nurses using the equipment or involved in the treatment of such patients should be aware of the most advanced techniques.  The advance in medical technology has made the need for further training for the nursing profession all the more urgent and all the more important.</P>

      <P>This has been a very helpful discussion and some of it, as has been observed by Senators, is outdated.  There have been a remarkable number of improvements in nursing conditions which I shall deal with later.  As everybody will agree, the Irish nursing profession is of worldwide repute.  Irish nurses are commended all over the world for their efficiency, their dedication and their sense of personal humanity.  We have Irish nurses in certain hospitals in England and abroad and it has been agreed that without them the hospital services would collapse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pay and conditions of nurses, until recent settlements were made, were behind acceptable standards.  I was very glad to play a significant role in encouraging settlements on pay and conditions which would result in a great improvement.  I, naturally, have to keep out of most of the disputes over wages and conditions except when I feel there <Col N="1480" /> is a need for some particular approach on the matter.  However, I was very glad to be of some assistance in connection with the demands made by the nurses which resulted in a settlement at the end of 1970.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should give some general picture as to the number of nurses. There are 5,650 female general trained nurses and about a third of these are temporary.  Of the third that are temporary 1,000 are married, 25 per cent of the health board hospital nurses are temporary and 5 per cent of the nurses in voluntary hospitals are temporary. There is quite a large number of temporary unmarried nurses and they are so for private or social reasons and also because nurses like to be able to transfer from one hospital to another very quickly.  I wish there were more of these temporary nurses made permanent. I hope there will be a change in regard to that position but, I feel, it is their own personal wish.  There are 3,500 students in general training hospitals.  There is a very considerable movement of nurses on a fairly continuous basis from one hospital to another, also for reasons of marriage.</P>
    <P>We had a recent survey conducted by UCD Social Science Department.  They found a rather high turnover of nursing staff, the annual rate varying from a quarter of all staff in district hospitals to a third of all staff, other than students, in voluntary hospitals.  In addition to resignation on marriage, which has been reckoned as being about 9 or 10 per cent of nursing staff each year, there are resignations to take appointments abroad, which amount to 5 per cent of the turnover.  Retirements on reaching the age limit would be 2 per cent, and this would cause some 400 vacancies annually.  The switching of jobs and going for further training would account for a further 500 resignations annually.  So there is a very considerable movement of staff.</P>
    <P>I am sure that some Senators would like me to say something about what would happen if the Government adopt the Report of the Commission on the Status of Women.  The report recommends that the retirement on marriage of a public servant in this country should be a personal decision <Col N="1481" /> and not a decision of the State or of the local authority.  It would obviously have some effect on the recruitment and the movement of nurses.  However, I should say that the effect of the removal of the marriage bar would be a fairly long-term operation.  For example, there would be a still greater turnover of nurses when nurses retire for maternity reasons, as married nurses, and then return at a later date.  It would be quite impossible for me, or for any Minister for Health or for An Bord Altranais, to predict what will happen if this report is adopted by the Government.  No decision has been made about it yet.</P>
    <P>Nurses would not be required to leave the service on marriage, but naturally they would have to retire, temporarily at least, for maternity reasons.  This again would cause a shifting in the pattern, in the movement and in the turnover of nurses, an element which I could not possibly predict.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made in this debate already to the shortage of nurses. We had a report on what is described as the manpower of the nursing community. I do not know why the word &ldquo;manpower&rdquo; is used in that connection. The report was prepared by the Department of Social Science in UCD, and it quite evidently indicated that there is no shortage of nurses as a whole in this country.  They examined the positions of 4,955 nurses, in other words, nearly the whole number to which I have already referred.  If one adds up the actual number of shortages, it came to 123 or 2.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>As Senator Belton has said, there is an actual shortage in a small number of hospitals.  Some hospitals have a high turnover and there would be apparent shortages of nurses in those hospitals because of the high turnover, and the decision to appoint new nurses to relieve temporary shortages.  There is a shortage in relation to certain geriatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Belton that in nursing homes where old people are ambulant non-nursing personnel are appropriate, and this should be looked into, if it has not been already, by the health boards concerned.  In the case of bedfast chronic sick old people, nursing still comes very much into the reckoning <Col N="1482" /> and it can be particularly important to avoid deterioration in the patients' conditions.  For example, in relation to the development of bedsores, which is a continuing problem, the rotating bed has now been invented which eliminates bedsores, but it will be some time before those are available in sufficient numbers. Nevertheless there are two types of old people, those for whom non-nursing personnel are appropriate, and those for whom fully trained nurses are essential.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I should say that the number of patients going to Baltinglass from Rathdrum would be about the same, and I do not expect a nursing shortage in Baltinglass.  Those who come from the surrounding areas, including County Carlow, would be glad to work near their homes in this new hospital, which is largely of a geriatric character.  Senator Belton referred to State-enrolled nurses.  There are 95 of these employed.  The Irish Nurses Organisation are opposed to any encouragement in the enrolment of State-enrolled nurses and I am not prepared to take any action in regard to the matter.</P>
    <P>There is a further question which relates to geriatric nursing and the training of student nurses.  An Bord Altranais and my Department are conferring on this matter, to see whether, without great difficulty, some more geriatric trainees or student nurses can be encouraged, which will perhaps eliminate some of the shortages of nurses in geriatric hospitals in Dublin, of which the Senator spoke.  We have not yet made final progress in that, and it relates, to some degree, to the appointment of geriatricians.  We are to have geriatric student training on a definite scale and by then we should be able to appoint more geriatricians. Some geriatricians have been appointed to hospitals: there is still a vacancy, of which I think Senator Belton would know, in the Dublin area and the appointment was refused.  Now another person is being offered the appointment and we hope to establish a greater geriatric service in Dublin and in other areas.  A geriatrician was appointed to Cork some time ago and he has been operating very satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The information that I have at the <Col N="1483" /> moment is that there is an actual shortage of nurses in a small number of hospitals, but no acute shortage, and the position will be reviewed again.  If we have 123 actual vacancies out of nearly 5,000 nursing positions, it obviously does not amount in any sense to a crisis.</P>
    <P>Some Senators referred to non-nursing duties.  Quite rightly, one Senator pointed out that non-nursing duties varied between clerical duties and duties of a domestic kind that are not appropriate to the work of a nurse.  Now we are going to form reginal hospital board before April next.  Resolutions will come before the Dáil and the Seanad as to their constitution and powers.  They will be working with a work study unit which is already beginning to form in my Department, and they will be going into all the questions that have been raised by the Senators in this debate&mdash;the nurse/patient ratio in hospitals of different kinds, what one can do in order to eliminate unnecessary nursing duties, and to establish ward orderlies or domestic staff of one kind or another in their place, if they can be obtained. Unfortunately, there are some places in Ireland where it is difficult to find the domestic type of staff to do some of the work which nurses are compelled to do in these hospitals.  That is not the case everywhere.</P>
    <P>As well as this action being taken, some hospitals have already made an examination of the position, as referred to by Senator Keery.  There has been some work study effected in various hospitals, and they have looked into the question of which non-nursing duties could be eliminated from the work of nurses, so there has been progress in regard to this.  But more progress should be possible as a result of the circular which I addressed to every hospital in the country asking that a nursing committee be formed within the hospital, which will be representative of the management, the nurses and the student-nurses.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these committees should be twofold.  First of all, they should discuss local and minor grievances that need not be discussed on the <Col N="1484" /> basis of some complicated union procedure. Secondly, they should examine how the organisation of the nursing in the hospital can be improved on the basis of the training, advice and experience of the nurses.  They should also get the points of view of the student nurses who come fresh into the hospital and who should be able to give a useful contribution.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say many hospital now have these nursing committees.  They will take time to develop.  Their effectiveness obviously depends on the matron and the administrators of the hospital.  They can become mere talking shops, where the next dance is discussed, or they can be fully effective committees, examining as closely as possible the operation of the hospital in relation to nursing duties, the rosters of nurses and so on.  I should like to see these nursing committees developing.  I have always believed in this kind of communication, and when I was in charge of eight State companies I was constantly addressing those where I felt there should be more immediate communication at local level within a State company as between the management and the employees.  I was pleased to address these letters to all the hospitals, and they have had a considerable response.  A reminder letter should be sent to the hospitals, which are mostly voluntary hospitals, where these nursing committees have not yet been appointed.</P>
    <P>In relation to the duties of nurses, their general effectiveness, the waste of nurses' time because of excessive movements through the hospital, all the work study connected with the placing of drugs and tissues, the removal of drugs and tissues and everything concerning the nurses' movements should in time result in greater efficiency without loss of service to the patients and should help us to deal with nursing shortages and to give the feeling to nurses that they are making good use of their time in the most economical way.</P>
    <P>When the health board management is fully set up there will be a programme manager for the general hospitals in the area and he will be responsible for taking up a better form of administration and management for all the health board hospitals, which is clearly indicated in <Col N="1485" /> the McKinsey Report, most of which has been found satisfactory in that regard by the health boards.  We need better management of the hospitals and this can be obtained by a proper management structure and by the appointment of an executive committee for the management of a number of small hospitals.</P>
    <P>Some Senators mentioned the disciplinary code in relation to nurses.  I remind the House of the recommendation sent out on the instance of the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley in April, 1966, recommending a relaxation of discipline, such as changes in the type of uniform worn by nurses, <i>et cetera</i>.  I have had a number of discussions with the Irish Nurses Organisation, but the suggestion that the disciplinary code throughout the country is still too harsh has not come to me.  I am sure the nurses' organisation would make this point at their meetings with me, which take place at least annually, if there were still an excessively hard disciplinary code.  I have no great complaints about this and I do not believe it is a matter of great moment now.</P>
    <P>There should be placed on the record of this House the very great improvements that have taken place in the salaries and conditions of nurses between April, 1964, and January, 1971. The maximum of the basic salary scale for a staff nurse increased from £840 to £1,375 or by 64 per cent, in that period. The increase in the salary of a student nurse at point of entry was 84 per cent in the same period.  In addition to that, there is an allowance of £2.24 per week for night duty.  There are two long-service increments of £47 each after 14 and 18 years of service.  There is a new allowance of £47 per annum for nurses in long-stay institutions, in county homes, in intensive care units, in cancer hospitals, in hospitals associated with special facilities for paediatrics, orthopaedics, midwifery and mental handicap. There is a special allowance of £2.10 per patient for emergency operating theatre duty.  The hours have been reduced from 90 to an 80 hour fortnight. Present negotiations in respect of student nurses are resulting in a reduction to an 85 hour fortnight which will come immediately in some hospitals and <Col N="1486" /> by the end of February it will apply to the remaining hospitals.</P>
    <P>Full increments are allowed for previous service in respect of nurses who have been in voluntary hospitals and who are taking up permanent appointments in health board hospitals.  Pension rights can be transferred from a nurse enjoying pension rights who is attached to a voluntary hospital and who goes to a health board hospital, or <i>vice versa.</i> Senator Belton is quite right when he states these privileges do not apply to nurses who have been employed in private nursing homes.  There is nothing I can do about that at the moment.  In respect of voluntary hospitals and health board hospitals there is now encouragement of free exchange of appointments because they carry their increment rights and their pension rights with them when they move from one type of hospital to another.  Married nurses have up to five increments allowed when they re-join the service and they now receive increments for each year of service that they did not previously receive.</P>
    <P>The cost of all this in one year was £1,150,000 to the ratepayers and taxpayers. It was money well spent.  At present the maximum salary for a general trained nurse, excluding all the allowances I have mentioned, is £1,375. The rate in the United Kingdom is £1,281.  The reduction for accommodation facilities in the United Kingdom is £309 against £191 in this country. We can say there has been a fairly substantial improvement, very much deserved, in the salaries and conditions of the very splendid nursing community we have in this country.</P>
    <P>I am not the employing authority for nurses.  I intervene as little as possible in matters that should come before the conciliation and arbitration facilities and, having said that, I am glad to remind the House that there is now appointed a local government staff negotiating board where meaningful staff negotiations should be facilitated. This change will alleviate many of the difficulties and frustrations that arose through the absence of proper modern negotiating machinery.  Nurses in health board hospitals and the health board service can have their claims examined <Col N="1487" /> by this negotiating board and the terms of operation of this board enable their services to apply to nurses in voluntary hospitals.  When there are requests for changes in salaries and conditions I hope the voluntary hospitals will agree to use this new local government negotiating board procedure so that there can be a parallel movement as between the voluntary hospitals and the health board hospitals.</P>
    <P>Now I should like to say a few words about a college of nursing.  This I do regard as a possible future development. It is being considered by An Bord Altranais, who are responsible for it, in conjunction with a committee representative of all the nursing organisations, of whom there are four or five different associations.  The proposal is being examined that there should be a faculty of nursing at the Royal College of Surgeons for post-graduate education. I am glad to tell the House that we learn that in a tentative way the nurses in the north of our country would like to be involved in this post-graduate scheme and we would very greatly welcome this.  An Bord Altranais are responsible and I am encouraging them to examine the whole of this proposition. I agree with Senators that this is in line with the whole of the growth of medical and hospital techniques and is another stage in the development of nursing education.</P>
    <P>Having said that, there are a great many post-graduate courses already operating.  There are so many courses that An Bord Altranais say they need a new building and they are discussing the question of some premises with the Eastern Health Board at the present time.  There are courses for public health nurses, management courses, courses for ward sisters and charge sisters, courses held in the maternity hospitals, refresher courses for tutors and public health nurses.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, in relation to the public health nurses who are doing such splendid work in this country, I should mention that in relation to their demands for good conditions we are having the working load of the public health nurses examined in order to see what a public health nurse does in the <Col N="1488" /> week and how best her work can be facilitated.  This is an essential form of study because their duties have been extended, their nurse training has been extended and we want to see the public health nurses, who are so absolutely essential, operating in the best possible way and in a way which to them means a meaningful and very happy career. There are inter-hospital courses in seven hospitals.  There are evening courses held in chemistry, biology and physics.  Special courses are held for coronary care, theatre work and intensive therapy in the Mater Hospital and for renal dialysis in Jervis Street.  I am sure I have not got to the end of the courses that are held in one way or another in hospitals or under the auspices of An Bord Altranais.</P>
    <P>Then, of course, there are hospita administrative courses for middle-management. I agree with those Senators who say that we need to have management courses for nurses and for other personnel developed to a greater extent.  This will be one of the matters that will come to the attention of the regional hospital boards when they are set up&mdash;what we can do to improve management courses over and beyond what is already being done by the Institute of Public Administration and one other institution.  Finally, there are also post-graduate courses for social workers and public health nurses held in University College, Dublin.  We have provided additional promotion posts for nurses by arranging for the appointment of junior ward sisters in training hospitals.  We have doubled the number of ward sister posts in ten years in health board hospitals by some 400 appointments.  That covers the ground fairly well.</P>
    <P>I have not dealt yet with one very important question in relation to the life of nurses, namely the accommodation facilities.  Accommodation some years ago was very deficient, but I am sure the Seanad would like to hear that nurses' accommodation in general hospitals, mental hospitals, county homes and institutions for the mentally handicapped in the last five years has been increased by 1,261 nurses' beds in new nurses' hostels.  Under construction are 341 places for better nursing hostel accommodation and in planning are <Col N="1489" /> another 453 places.  So we are making progress.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are some nurses who are still living under antiquated conditions but the programme of providing better accommodation continues steadily, will continue in the future, and arrangements are being made for some of the capital to be invested in the health and hospital services to be attributed to the improvement of nurses' accommodation.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by saying just a few words about the recent strike of psychiatric nurses.  I want to say first of all, and I hope I have the agreement of the House as a whole, that strikes in hospitals, county homes and institutions for the mentally handicapped are totally and absolutely unjustified in any circumstances whatever.  In a great many countries in Europe arbitration is normally accepted for a great number of essential industries and strikes never take place.  There is a different system of trade union organisation, a different mental attitude to industrial disputes as can be found, for example, in Switzerland, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands.  In most of those countries strikes have taken place from time to time.  In some cases there have been outbreaks of strikes.  In Switzerland and Austria, for example, there are almost never any strikes.</P>
    <P>I do think that the trade union movement here could make up their mind that they would be yielding nothing in relation to the general right to strike if they decided they would accept arbitration in regard to all strikes whose only effect is to exploit the sickness of infirm and ill people who are unable to help themselves.</P>
    <P>In the case of the psychiatric hospitals strike, the point had almost been reached when the Labour Court was to have a final hearing.  I know the dispute had lasted a long time and it had lasted a long time because for ten years the managing authorities for the mental hospitals had been trying to relate the agreement to make permanent a great number of posts among psychiatric nurses, had been trying to link this with a system of promotion by merit and not by seniority.  The system of promotion by seniority is the only case of which I know that exists in the whole of the <Col N="1490" /> public sector, both local and national, for persons whose occupations could be compared, in regard to the skills required, with psychiatric nurses.</P>
    <P>It has been impossible to get any agreement.  The final offer made by the CEO before the Labour Court conciliation took place was that one out of every two promotions would be by seniority as in the past and that one out of every two would be on a combination of suitability and applicability for the job in hand, with a content of 30 out of 100 points for the numbers of years of service.  I regarded that as a very reasonable compromise.</P>
    <P>I am speaking about this because I have got to let everybody know that I agree with the promotion of psychiatric nurses on this basis.  The whole of the mental hospital world has changed in the last ten years through the use of tranquillisers and also the use of new methods of activating patients.  It requires a skill that is not given to every single person, and is given more to one particular psychiatric nurse than another, to be able to engage in meaningful activation of the patient, to be able to engage in group therapy, to understand the patient, to understand how to enliven or tranquillise the patient, to understand how to deal with an institutionalised mental patient.  It also applies to the psychiatric nurses who leave the mental hospitals and who rotate through the country looking after patients who can be kept at home but who require a vistit by the psychiatric nurses at intervals.  I can find no psychiatrist of any note in this country or in any other country who will not agree with me that, if you have a given number of personnel, the situation is exactly the same as for female nurses employed in general hospitals where the system of appointment by merit exists. If it is regarded as desirable that there should be appointment by merit among female general trained nurses in hospitals, nobody can argue with me that it is not equally desirable that promotion should be on the basis of merit in psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>This compromise was offered.  I have to make the decision yet about sanctioning this arrangement and I have to take into consideration all the matters that took place during the strike, but I <Col N="1491" /> want everybody to know my view about it.  It is very rarely that I, as Minister, would have to comment on the particular situation in relation to an industrial dispute.  But it would be grossly dishonest of me just to sit down and say nothing and not to let the community and the Seanad know what I think of the system of promotion by seniority in the year 1971 in our mental hospitals.  I am totally opposed to the concept.  But the arrangement has been made by the Labour Court; it is before me and no doubt I will have to sanction this agreement.  But I hope there will be a change in the future.  I should like to repeat that it seemed to me that the compromise offered which was connected with the making permanent all of these posts that have been left temporary so long&mdash;because the two questions were linked together in discussions&mdash;was that one out of every two appointments should be promotions by seniority.  The appointment which was not by seniority but on the basis of merit had an element of service included in the markings.</P>
    <P>I want to say also that the settlement, as presented to me, means absolutely nothing.  This arrangement for making comments and reports on the nurses which can be noted in connection with their promotion is not a promotion system by merit, and very few psychiatrists would be able or would want to work it as the basis for an alternative to a system of promotion by merit.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I think I have answered all the questions that have been asked of me so far in the course of this debate.  May I finally say that I am tremendously interested in the development of the nursing profession here?  I can say without fear of contradiction that the organisations concerned with nursing have found me ready to meet and discuss matters with them and that I do regard the 15,000 nurses in this country&mdash;between psychiatric nurses, general hospital nurses, female nurses, male nurses, and nurses in student training&mdash;as playing a very vital and wonderful part in our health and hospital services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the happy occasions in the Seanad where <Col N="1492" /> we have a motion before us, the terms of which are agreed by everybody.  I do not see any Senator here likely to stand up to object to anything that has been proposed in this motion.  I am also happy to note that the Minister, in what he has said, is in agreement with the terms of the motion very broadly and has already gone a considerable distance towards meeting the questions that have been raised there.  If it were otherwise I would, of course, be adding my voice to the voices of the other Senators in trying to urge him along this road, but this is not necessary.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it is sufficient for me to speak about this matter in rather broad terms.  We have to be clear when we are talking about nurses and nursing precisely what we mean, because this term &ldquo;nursing&rdquo; has changed a lot in the last 130 years since nursing first became a recognised profession.  This, of course, started off with Florence Nightingale, and in those days nursing was entirely concerned with keeping the patient comfortable.  It remained like that right down through the years until round about the time I was a medical student, about 45 years ago.  The position even then was beginning to change with the introduction of potent, active drugs and the responsibility sometimes devolving on the nurse as to when these should be given to the patient, without the direct instruction of a doctor.  It is a far cry from these days even 50 years ago to the present state of affairs in hospitals where nursing has assumed very largely a technical aspect.  A considerable number of new procedures are being introduced every day.  They add to the complexity of nursing while, at the same time, they are completely essential for the efficient management of certain types of illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the greater and greater stress on this technical side there is a danger that people will lose sight of the need for the older type of commitment of the nurse to keep the patient comfortable.  This has happened to a great extent in some other countries, notably in the United States of America, where the fully qualified nurse is in charge of the arrangements for intensive care which Senator Belton has mentioned, for the kind of medication that patients get intravenously and through various other <Col N="1493" /> channels, for organising and arranging this on the general instruction of the doctor, even when he is not there.</P>
    <P>She very often spends very little time in the ward by the side of the patient. She is in a nursing station.  All the instruments and all the records are before her and she transmits her decisions to people of the orderly type, the enrolled nurse type, who then carry out the instruction she gives them.  It is of course essential that somebody should be in a position to do that, but I would hope that we do not lose sight of the balance that should be maintained between this modern responsibility of the nurse and the older responsibility of direct patient care and comfort.</P>
    <P>I had an argument a while ago with a very prominent matron from one of the American centres.  We were at a conference in Russia.  I was at a conference dealing with public health and she was at one dealing with nursing.  I assumed in conversation that she had in her country a shortage of nurses as they have in Britain, but not so much in this country.  She said: &ldquo;Oh no, there is no shortage of nurses; there is a shortage of nursing.&rdquo;  This distinction took me a little bit by surprise until in conversation it transpired that, in her view, one nurse if properly deployed could, through the medium of all sorts of assistance, carry out the nursing of a very large number of patients in the way I have just tried to describe.  I told her I did not regard that as the whole of nursing.  I mentioned that I have a daughter a nurse and I have been very interested in nursing and nurses ever since I was a medical student.  I think there is something more deeply humane about nursing which the patient needs almost as much as the technical innovations of which the modern nurse must be aware.</P>
    <P>In this country we are very lucky indeed in the quality of our nurses.  I teach them in hospital, I have been a patient, of course and I see them every day in their relationships with other patients.  They are intelligent, well-educated girls and it is a privilege to be associated with them and to be involved in helping in their instruction.  So long as we have a supply of these people I think we have very little to worry about concerning the ordinary nursing care <Col N="1494" /> that the patient in hospital will get. Because we are so fortunate, I am afraid there may be a tendency&mdash; certainly I think there has been a tendency in the past&mdash;for us to take advantage of this position.  This is the kind of thing that happens in nearly every circumstance where somebody is said to have a vocation for a particular kind of work.  Because they have a vocation for it, and because they like doing it, they are expected to do it under less than good conditions sometimes. This should not be allowed to take place in the case of nurses, or indeed any of the other professions that are involved like this.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has indicated that he is aware of this situation and is taking steps to meet it so far as salaries and conditions of service are concerned. I think the conditions of service are, if anything, more important than salaries. I do not think anybody wants us to ask the nurses to work for less than a reasonable salary, but the nurses, being young people looking forward to their career and to their place in the social scheme of things, are very interested indeed in their living conditions.  From the physical point of view they are interested, of course, in the kind of rooms they have in the hospital, but they are also interested in their recreational facilities, their time off, the kind of food they get and their opportunities for a social life.  They would not be very normal if they were otherwise. Their interest in this, as I have said, is rather greater than their interest in just the pure level of salary.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear from the Minister that something is being done to improve these living conditions.  The Minister talked about rooms for nurses. I would hope that, going with these rooms, there would be other facilities such as facilities for recreation, for taking part in social activities, library facilities and all the other hundred and one things that go to make up a life. A nurse's life is not bounded by the nurse's room, no matter how comfortable that may be.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made by Senator Belton and the Minister&mdash;and it was mentioned in the motion to the antiquated conditions of service.  I know that many people become emotionally <Col N="1495" /> disturbed about this matter.  The spectre of the matron, a rather elderly woman with a fearsome appearance, rattling her keys along and every nurse being terrified of her, has gone by the board long ago.  We still have, in some hospitals, perhaps a bit more stress than is necessary on discipline.  I do not think that one can relax discipline to an undue extent.  The reason for this is not any desire to keep young people in their places.  Nobody who works in a university could hang on to that idea in the year 1971: it does not work. The reason is different, and it is a sounder one, I think.  These young people, when they go to their work every day, embark on duties in which a mistake may mean the life of some patient.  If they have not disciplined themselves properly, if they have not taken care about their hours of sleep and their hours of rest and they become tired or exhausted to their duties, they may make a great mistake.  It is the desire to guard against this that is the primary consideration in organising and arranging for what we call discipline in the modern nurse's life.  I do not think that should be lost sight of.</P>
    <P>The nurses have to be on duty&mdash;even with the new conditions&mdash;for quite long hours and so hospitals provide them with nurses' homes to keep them near to the hospital and make it easy for them to reach their work and to have their meals.  It has been pointed out that the nursing profession differs from most other kinds of work in which young people engage in this regard because of the fact that they are herded together in a community and put under the charge of certain senior people and made to submit to certain disciplinary measures.  I am quite aware that in the future there may be a revision of this whole matter.  You may find that nurses live in flats in towns, like their sisters and friends who are employed in banks and insurance companies and so on, and that they come into the hospital to do their work, as most of us go to work each day, as independent people taking on the ordinary day's job.  For the present at any rate, and largely, I think, as a matter of convenience and to help the nurses in the difficult matter of finding places to live, hospitals provide <Col N="1496" /> these nurses' homes; and where you have a lot of people gathered together like that it is only reasonable to have some rules and regulations.</P>
    <P>The non-nursing duties, I think, have now mostly gone.  We do not ask nurses any more to help to clean the wards. We expect them to keep the patients' beds tidy, but this is only natural because the patient would much rather have his or her bed made by the nurse than by somebody else and the nurse knows exactly what kind of illness the patient has and how much the patient can be disturbed.  That is reasonable enough, but the remainder of the non-nursing duties are gone, and rightly so. I know also, as Senator Belton has pointed out, that a great deal of the administrative side of hospital work, which formerly devolved on nurses or senior sisters, has also now been given to lay people.  I think our hospital was one of the first to have the catering aspect transferred from a sister to a person properly trained in catering. That has gone on, so that the great part of that kind of work is done now in most hospitals, as Senator Belton has pointed out, by non-nursing staff.</P>
    <P>The question of a college of nursing is, I think, an extremely important one. It should be considered sympathetically, but also, I think, very carefully.  I am glad to have heard the Minister go some distance towards defining what he has in mind for this college of nursing, with particular emphasis on the post-graduate aspect.  I think it is at this level that a college of nursing would do most good.  All of us in hospitals take some part in teaching nurses.  It is very handy for the nurses to have their instruction in the various subjects directly related to their work given to them by the doctors they know and associate with every day in their own lecture rooms in the hospital.  I would not like if a college of nursing meant the centralisation of all instruction of student nurses in some central building to which all the nurses would have to go from the hospitals in which they carry out their ordinary duties.  This might quite easily be the first step towards down-grading the vocational side of the training of a nurse.  I should like to see the training of student nurses, at least, remain as closely as possible associated <Col N="1497" /> with the hospitals.  In this case they must be the larger type hospitals, because not every small hospital can have a separate school of nursing.  The larger hospitals should be responsible for the training of their nurses and they should organise their staff to look after this matter.  Nowadays we have the necessity for post-graduate training of nurses and this can very properly be taken care of by some separate organisation.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister suggest that this post-graduate training should include the training of management. This is done in England, as the Minister probably knows.  There is a school at Richmond-on-Thames where courses of three months duration are given in management to senior sisters. They are expected to take an intensive interest in the basic principles of management and become proficient in it so that when they become matrons and senior sisters they can carry out their work more efficiently.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by supporting this motion and complimenting the Minister on the steps he has already taken and proposes to take to implement the terms of this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Jessop has said, I am sure virtually everybody in the House agrees with the terms of the motion as set out.  It is as well&mdash;as I think Senator Belton has said&mdash;to realise that this motion has been quite a considerable length of time on the Order Paper and that certain changes and improvements have taken place in the 1½ years during which the motion has languished on the Order Paper waiting for discussion.  That is not to say that the position of nurses is as perfect or as satisfactory as many of us, including the Minister, would like it to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there have been considerable improvements during the last 18 months in the working conditions and salary scale of nurses there exists, nonetheless, a considerable degree of opinion where the people involved in this profession consider that their services are not being recognised in the way in which they feel they should be.  It is as well to say at the outset&mdash;and I imagine everyone will agree with this opinion&mdash;that <Col N="1498" /> nursing is a vocation rather than a profession.  Nursing is not just another job and anybody who takes up nursing in the mistaken belief that it is very quickly finds out to the contrary and very quickly leaves the nursing profession.</P>
    <P>In talking about a number of matters which the nursing profession feel are not being adequately dealt with, it is as well to remember the quite considerable number of courses&mdash;the Minister outlined them when speaking&mdash;which exist at present.  While he was talking I was looking through the presidential address of the president of the Irish Nursing Organisation which was given at the 1971 annual general meeting held on Sunday, 31st October, and which I had just received.  In this address we find, and I quote:</P>
    <P>When there are staff shortages it is almost inevitable that there will be a conflict between education and service. Service needs will always seem to be the most dramatic in an emergency situation and when are there not emergency situations in the hospital service?  If service needs override educational needs, too often students become dissatisfied; ward sisters become more harrassed; and nurse tutors become more and more disenchanted.  Disenchantment is the word of the moment where nurse tutors are concerned.</P>
    <P>Later on in the address we read:</P>
    <P>On the teaching side not one senior post has, as yet, been created although we are dealing with almost 4,000 students....</P>
    <P>It goes on:</P>
    <P>It is true we have recently notified the Hospitals Commission that the Minister for Health has approved of the following nursing officers: junior ward sister, unit nursing officer and theatre superintendent.  There is no mention of a senior teaching post.</P>
    <P>Further on, it continues:</P>
    <P>Have we seriously considered how we might provide an improved programme and perhaps train more <Col N="1499" /> nurses if we had properly structured teaching divisions and a good promotional structure?  How soon will we have a sufficient number of adequately equipped geriatric units where student nurses can be shown the real nursing challenge involved in the care of the aged?</P>
    <P>Again, on the next page:</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the Department of Health have stipulated that the possession of a midwife teacher's diploma is an essential qualification for candidates applying for the post of midwife teacher in a midwifery training school.  Yet, there are no facilities available in this country for obtaining this diploma.  It is extremely difficult to obtain a vacancy in England, infinitely more difficult than to obtain a vacancy to train as a clinical teacher....  Having obtained the diploma at considerable expense, the successful candidate cannot even register in this country because there is no comparable type of training provided here.</P>
    <P>The whole of that presidential address was on the general theme of the lack of education in certain significant fields in the nursing profession.  I think these are fields that are well recognised by the Minister but it is as well to outline them here, immediately following his speech, lest any Member of the House might go away with the impression that a complete and comprehensive training course at all levels is being provided.</P>
    <P>The college of nursing referred to in the motion was envisaged by us to be a college of nursing where post-graduate facilities would be provided.  It was envisaged by us to be a college of nursing more or less on the lines outlined twice recently by the Taoiseach when he as good as promised that that college of nursing was shortly to become a reality.  I am particularly concerned about the position of student nurses. While I accept the suggestion of Senator Jessop that some form of control is necessary in homes where a large number of nurses reside, I cannot accept the suggestion of the Minister that he has not had enough complaints <Col N="1500" /> to justify believing that the disciplinary code is still too strict or too antiquated. I shall give the House just two short examples in this regard.</P>
    <P>The first related to a final-year student nurse in a large Dublin general hospital who received a late pass.  We were informed that the assistant matron of the hospital decided to call to her room at 2 o'clock in the morning merely to give her a message.  It is apparently quite a normal pastime to call to people's rooms at 2 o'clock in the morning to give them messages.  She discovered that the student nurse had not returned in time to comply with her late pass but had instead, as young people often do in places like that, put a pillow in her bed, and had gone to a party and did not return until quite some time later.</P>
    <P>For this grievous sin, which was committed in her off time and presumably did not affect her nursing qualifications, or the way in which her patients were being cared for, that nurse was suspended until the nursing committee&mdash;which the Minister seems to believe in so implicitly&mdash;met.  The nursing committee, in its generosity, decided an appropriate penalty for that nurse would be, in her final year and some four or five months before her final examination, that she be suspended from the service of the hospital for three months.  That would mean a loss of three months' pay and, more importantly, a loss of three months' lectures and tutorials which were vital to her for her final examination. It also meant, of course, the incurring of humiliation from the public and from the rest of the staff in that hospital, and the sending of a frightened young girl home to a hamlet in a rural part of Ireland, where I am quite sure the people in the surrounding countryside firmly and implicitly believed her crime to be a far more heinous one.  The most ironic part of the penalty was that it was directed that, when she returned to the service of that hospital, she would not live in the nurses' home but would live out.  In other words, part of the penalty for the crime was that on her return she would commit the crime in perpetuity.  That happened in late 1969 or in 1970 in one of the main teaching hospitals in Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1501" /> I shall refer to another case, which I believe the Minister knows of.  It related to a grateful private patient in a general hospital in this city during the last couple of months.  The patient was so grateful for the manner in which he had been treated by the nurses and junior medical staff in that hospital that, on the day he was leaving, he invited those doctors and nurses who had been involved in his treatment to come to his room where he gave them a drink and thanked them sincerely for their treatment of him and for helping to restore him to full health.  Those who accepted his invitation did so in their off time.  One nurse was unfortunate enough to be caught and for her heinous crime of attending in her off time to receive the grateful thanks of a patient restored to full health, not only was she dismissed from the hospital but her mother was called again from rural Ireland and made to attend upon the matron who, in the course of the conversation, made such pertinent remarks in regard to the nursing profession as: &ldquo;Does your husband allow you to use lipstick?  I believe your daughter drinks.  She also smokes. These are very bad habits&rdquo;.  So the girl was dismissed.</P>
    <P>Let there be no doubt about it in the Minister's mind or in the mind of any other Member of this House, whether they are involved outside this House in the medical or nursing or allied professions, this sort of thing is still going on in our hospitals.  Unfortunately&mdash;and I say this with reluctance&mdash;the Irish Nurses' Organisation, which is an excellent body of women, firmly dedicated to improving the lot of the nursing profession, and especially dedicated to improving the salary structure, working conditions and educational facilities, is an organisation which represents all levels in the nursing profession.  This organisation does not always represent the views of the junior echelons and the people newly-arrived into the nursing profession.  Without in any way letting the House believe that I have not great admiration for the ladies who are in senior administrative nursing positions in our hospitals, I would sincerely suggest to the Minister that they, also, are more often the people who are in senior administrative positions <Col N="1502" /> in the Irish Nursing Organisation and are less likely to feel that the disciplinary code is too strict.  After all, they are involved on a day-to-day basis in the implementation of that disciplinary code, and in the meting out of the punishments under it.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will feel, and will say if he has an opportunity, that it is not within his power to do anything about it; but it is a dreadful thing that young girls who feel that they have a vocation to nurse, should still, in 1971, be charged entry fees for the privilege of entering this profession in which people are so overworked.  Whether those fees be modest or nominal or whether they be of the quite exorbitant nature charged in some of our more respectable hospitals, which have perhaps a name attaching to them which other teaching hospitals might not have, it is nonetheless a sad reflection on our society in 1971 that someone taking up a vocation such as this should still be required to pay fees of over £200 in some cases for the privilege.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree with Senator Jessop that student and other nurses, no longer have to engage in non-nursing duties, I suggest to the House and to the Minister that there is a great need for a further examination of the business of appointing ward clerks in all hospitals.  These clerks could carry out all the clerical duties attached to the ward in question.  There should also be sufficient people to carry out the domestic duties in order to allow nurses to involve themselves solely in the business of nursing.</P>
    <P>In that regard also, if the Minister speaks to nurses&mdash;not necessarily in the higher echelons of the profession&mdash;who have worked in hospitals abroad, they will tell him that they, when abroad, were much more involved with the medical staffs of the hospitals in the day-to-day business of nursing and caring for the patients.  They were consulted much more as to their views on how the patient was progressing.  If the doctor arrived to examine his patients, he did not wait until matron or one of the senior sisters was present to visit his patients; he visited them and discussed their cases with the nurse who was on duty in the ward, who knew their illnesses and their complaints.  He <Col N="1503" /> involved those nurses and I believe&mdash; nurses have told me this&mdash;that they consequently felt much more responsibility and much more interest in the cases in question.  They felt that they were acting far more as nurses, rather than as carriers of bed pans and urine glasses, which is the sort of thing that is still going on in our hospitals, whether we like it or not.</P>
    <P>There is no particular reflection on anybody in this regard.  It is part of a Victorian system that has changed very slowly down through the years.  It has changed, thank God, much more quickly in recent years; but there is still an urgent need for changes in order to make the nursing profession one into which a girl will go and realise that she will be treated with respect from the start, and that she will be involved in operation of the hospital on a nursing rather than on an administrative or domestic basis; that just recognition will be given to her educational and other needs and to proper promotional opportunities right through the field of nursing.</P>
    <P>The Minister has dealt with the question of bringing married nurses back into the profession, and I appreciate the change that has taken place in recent years.  This means that married women can now go back with up to five years' increments.  I still do not see why a married nurse cannot go back as, for instance, widows may return to the public service on one incremental point less than that on which they left.</P>
    <P>The Minister has outlined fairly fully the salary structure of nurses at various levels and how that structure had improved since 1964.  I accept that the improvements have been considerable but the percentage rates and the year mentioned as an example mean that the increases for nurses have been equivalent to the increases granted to Members of the Oireachtas during the same period.  There are a considerable number of those Members who now feel that the allowances they receive in return for their services are not adequate in 1971.</P>
    <P>The percentage increases given to nurses since 1964 are on a par with those given to all of us, and anyone here who feels he is not adequately remunerated for the amount of time, <Col N="1504" /> talent or service he is providing will have sympathy with the nurses.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing an investigation is taking place into the working conditions of public health nurses.  These nurses have not been given the recognition and help which has been given during the past 18 months to the rest of the nursing profession.  Anything that can be done to help them in the excellent service they are providing will be worth while.</P>
    <P>As a former member of the Dublin Health Authority but not a member of the new Eastern Health Board, I was interested in the Minister's figures on the survey of the number of nurses as against nursing requirements.  I was pleasantly surprised to hear that the percentage shortage is as low as 2.3 per cent.  If that is the case the change which must have taken place since the Eastern Health Board took over administration of the hospitals in Dublin is considerable.  I recall at the time the Dublin Health Authority went out of existence a great and chronic shortage of nurses, especially in geriatric hospitals and to a large extent in psychiatric hospitals.  That does not suggest that the nursing complement in the general hospitals in the Dublin Health Authority area was in all cases satisfactory. If the Eastern Health Board have succeeded in curing the staff nursing shortage in geriatric and psychiatric hospitals in Dublin, this has been a monumental achievement in seven or eight months and they are to be congratulated.</P>
    <P>There has been a tendency over the last number of years to set up hospitals which specialise in accommodating geriatric patients.  Consequently, when the Irish Nurses Organisation talk about the difficulty in training nurses for geriatric hospitals it is for this reason. Not only is it difficult to find student nurses for geriatric hospitals, but it is equally difficult to find qualified nurses. It takes a special type of person to devote all of her time for the rest of her working life to the geriatric field.  I suggest to the Minister that the geriatric service should be integrated in the general hospital service to ensure that student and general nurses can serve in the geriatric field as well as in the allied fields, thereby obtaining all-round <Col N="1505" /> experience and not being left in one branch of the service.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity of complimenting Senator Dr. Belton for the excellent and concise way he proposed this motion and also Senator Reynolds for seconding it.  It was an opportune time to pay a well-deserved tribute to the various branches of the nursing profession.  Some people may feel that the professional touch in nursing is lacking.  I assure the House from my personal experience that this is not so.  It would not be possible for anyone to work in a psychiatric hospital, whether male or female, without being dedicated to that profession. While I understand the points made by the Minister, it was a pity the position was allowed to escalate some weeks ago whereby this very excellent body of nurses, male and female, were forced to take industrial action.  Regarding that unfortunate <Col N="1506" /> strike, I would like to place on record that in our hospitals in the midlands no hardship whatever was inflicted on the patients.  This type of industrial action does not suit the nursing profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may interrupt the Senator for a moment, two out of the three unions took no industrial action and there was to be an open Labour Court hearing on the Monday following the strike.  There was no need to take industrial action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, the dispute did take place and negotiations took too long, having been going on for many months.  It is unfair to place these people, who are in such very important posts and who are bound by conscience to continue working, in a position where they were forced to sustain their rights by taking token industrial action.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a plea on behalf of the married temporary nurses and the single temporary nurses.  I note the Minister's concession towards the married temporary nurses in allowing them five increments.  If a person has experience it should be valued.  Those of us who have been on hospital committees know the difficulty of securing adequate staff.  When these married nurses come to our rescue they should get the maximum salaries to which they are entitled having regard to their years of experience.  They are subject to income tax and a good portion of their salaries go back in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation of temporary single nurses is even worse.  Should a single nurse with 20 years' experience decide to come home and work in her native place to be near an ailing parent or for some other family reason, she will find that she starts without any increments.  This surely is a grievance.  While I agree that the numbers of single nurses in this category must be very small, nevertheless I do not see why nurses, whether temporary or appointed, cannot get credit for their years of service.  In the nursing profession, as in any other, experience is what counts.  These people must keep abreast of modern trends, and I feel that this is one profession <Col N="1507" /> which does.  I see no reason why the Department should deprive them of the salaries to which they are entitled.  I also hold that there should be equal pay for equal work, and surely we are all agreed on that.  Furthermore, if a fully trained nurse with 20 or 30 years' experience who, for some reason or other, opts to take a temporary appointment in a district or county hospital, in justice and in law she should get credit for each year's service.  In addition some special increment or allowance should be paid in respect of each of the certificates she holds.</P>
    <P>The nurses' organisation have over the years been too quiet in this regard. While I have no wish to advocate militancy, it would appear at the present time that unless people really get rough with the Government their grievances will be passed over.  I would again make a special plea that some measure of justice should be given to the married nurses who take on temporary duty and to the single nurses who find themselves in temporary employment.</P>

      <P>I am glad we have had the opportunity today to discuss this motion.  It is unfortunate that it had to remain on the Order Paper practically since the Seanad, as we know it, assembled. I know there are problems about taking motions.  The motion refers to the growing unrest in the nursing profession and I do not know how accurate it is to state now that the unrest is growing.  I believe it is correct to say that there has been and there is unrest. To what degree that exists I would not attempt to evaluate.  However, I think the Minister is well aware of the unrest in the profession.  Some of his remarks today must be very helpful to the people in that profession, and it augurs rather well for the future.  It is a fact that we have to make up practically 50 years, if not more, of neglect of the nursing profession.  I should like to speak broadly on the factors which go to make up an adequate job situation, which will give the person involved the satisfaction which he should have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first important factor in a job is that you must like what you are doing. It is fairly safe to say that nurses, when they choose such a demanding profession, <Col N="1508" /> must have a vocation.  This country is deeply indebted to the dedication, professionalism and vocational inspiration of the nurses.  They have given us tremendous service and the community as a whole has given them very little recognition.  If in the 1970s they are brought more into the light it is about time.  Not alone has this community benefited by Irish nursing but their work abroad, in the underdeveloped, developing and developed countries, has brought great credit to this country.  I would like to record my gratitude for what they have done in the area outside the narrow confines of this island.</P>
    <P>The second factor which is important is that when you enter a job you can see that there is a career in front of you, that you are not entering at the lowest level and going to stay there.  We all accept that when you take up a career you start at the bottom, but there should, and must be, a clearly defined avenue of promotion and the ability to equip oneself for that promotion.  It is now accepted by all management that training facilities, on-the-job training and outside-the-job training, must be provided.  In the long-term, and, indeed, in the short-term, it does lead to a satisfied employee structure, greater efficiency on the job and a happy work relationship.  This is what we are all anxious to achieve.  This is lacking in the nursing profession.  Any methods the Minister can find to improve this would be an advancement on the present situation.</P>
    <P>In other areas when you enter a job you can see clearly what your steps will be.  If you go into a clerical or administrative field you know your grading structure.  You have a general idea what will be required of you and what your line of study will be.  The line of study is probably clear enough in the nursing field.  The facilities for acquiring these qualifications are not so readily available.  If in the proposed college of nursing this problem could be solved, then one of the chief causes of unrest and dissatisfaction in the nursing profession would have been removed or at least alleviated.</P>
    <P>The third factor I would see as being important, and it might surprise some people that it only comes third, is <Col N="1509" /> adequate remuneration.  The Minister gave us salary figures in detail.  I did not take them all down.  If my memory serves me right he did mention one figure of £1,375 as the maximum.  I would suggest to the Minister that this is an inadequate salary for the nursing profession in 1971.  There are other areas where fewer qualifications are required, shorter hours are worked and greater remuneration is received.  The percentage of increases between 1964 and 1970 mentioned&mdash;I think it was 64 per cent&mdash;sounds substantial. Senator Boland drew attention to the Members of the Oireachtas.  I could indicate other areas of health services between the years of 1960 to 1971 in which increases of about 123 per cent have been given.  I doubt if 59 per cent of that came between 1960 and 1964. When you take into account that nurses have been lowly paid, the fact that they got an increase of 64 per cent in the period from 1964 to 1970 does not mean that they have even kept pace or made up the ground they lost.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of remuneration which are not directly related to a salary or incremental scale.  Other Senators have referred to them.  One of them is the reckonable service.  It has been an important breakthrough that you can move from one area of health to the other and carry your incremental service and your pension rights with you.  It is unfortunate that service in the nursing sphere outside the country is not recognised at least for entering on the scale.  One of the attractions for many Irish girls entering the nursing profession is that they go abroad for a while and they gain valuable experience. When they come back it would be only fair and just that we should recognise this fact in their remuneration.</P>
    <P>That married nurses can now come in five points up the scale is good.  I would agree with Senator Boland that perhaps the system operating in the Civil Service is better.  I should like to refer to the situation which, as far as I know, still exists where a nurse in certain areas has to resign on marriage. During the passage of the Health Act through this House we had a division on an amendment tabled by the members of the Labour Party on this question of resignation on marriage. <Col N="1510" /> I suspected at the time that the Minister had some smypathy with the point but was unable to accept the amendment. He stated at that stage that this question of the marriage bar, as it was referred to, was being considered by the Commission on the Status of Women.  They have now issued their report and one of their recommendations is concerned with the marriage bar.  In paragraph 166, page 87 of the Interim Report on Equal Pay presented to the Minister for Finance in August, 1971, it is stated:</P>
    <P>We recommend that the statutory provisions mentioned and any other legislation requiring the retirement of women from employment on marriage, or prohibiting the employment of married women, should be repealed.  We also recommend that from the enactment of this legislation it should be illegal for any employer to compel an employee to retire on marriage or for any employer or Trade Union to place any restriction on the recruitment or retention o married women.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will see his way very soon to ensure that recommendation is implemented and that women will be allowed the right to choose to stay on in whatever work sphere they are involved. It is particularly important in the nursing profession, where there is a shortage of nurses and where there is a considerable investment in the nurse acquiring her qualifications.  I hope we will see the amending legislation before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Other Senators have mentioned working conditions, and some of what I have said refers to working conditions, because working conditions are of course of prime importance in any work sphere.  I accept and I am very glad to hear the Minister remind the Seanad of the improvements that have been made in the accommodation, but I would agree with other Senators that there is room for further improvement.  I feel confident that these improvements will be achieved in the next few years.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is more involved in working conditions than accommodation. Accommodation only arises in an area like the nursing profession.  Conditions in the hospital ward could be improved. <Col N="1511" /> The position where the nurse has to do work which is not directly related to her profession is a waste to her talents and a waste of her training. We will have to have a proper survey done of the nurse's job specification, see in what areas her talents are being wasted and see what duties could more properly be apportioned to a clerical worker, a wardsmaid, a waitress or a chef.  The Minister has said he is already looking at these matters.  We would get a better utilisation of our nursing resources if we carried out that survey and apportioned the work content correctly. There would be a much happier atmosphere in the hospitals if this survey was carried out, and the nurse would feel her time was being better utilised.</P>
    <P>Again, on the question of working conditions, the nurses have now achieved, after considerable pressure and even after showing a bit of militancy, an 80-hour fortnight, which, I would remind the House, is considerably different from a 40-hour week.  Frankly, I would not like to have to work an 80-hour fortnight.  It is physically a rather tiring profession to enter.  Although an 80-hour fortnight is an improvement on what it was, it is still a long way from what I would consider a satisfactory working schedule.  In addition, we have to take into account, as regards working hours, that the nurse has to work on different rotas, which has a considerable disrupting effect on her life outside her work, what we might term her social life. One month she may be on night duty, the next month she may be on an 8 o'clock to 10 o'clock shift or a 6 o'clock to 11 o'clock or whatever way they work uot.  This is a factor which must be taken into account when we are arriving at the length of hours which nurses have to work.</P>
    <P>I was a bit taken aback when the Minister used this motion to make in some ways a rather broadside attack on the trade union movement.  He said, first of all, that he considered strikes were unjustified in hospitals in all circumstances.  This I find a little bit surprising.  Secondly, he mentioned that he wished the trade union movement would get it into their heads that they were not losing anything by accepting arbitration.  In general terms that is <Col N="1512" /> slightly misleading because there is arbitration within the Labour Court. There are separate schemes of conciliation and arbitration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean in general terms.  That is a much larger issue.  Strikes might cause danger to life and infinite hardship to people who are unable to protect themselves in what I regard as the most essential of all industries or services in the country, even more essential than electric light. I was not trying to interfere with the general right to strike.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister made that interjection.  I do not wish to go into the details of the recent strike in the psychiatric hospitals, but generally the trap we fall into is that when a strike has taken place and it is resolved we are a little bit too smug sitting back and trying to apportion blame.  It seemed to me today that the blame was being wholly apportioned to one side in the recent strike.  I do not want to go into this type of debate, but it is fair to state there were two sides in the dispute and when we come to apportion blame we will have to look at the management side also.  Any dispute allowed to continue over a period&mdash;the Minister said ten years, but in fact it may have been longer&mdash;and ending up in the workers withdrawing their labour, a dedicated group of workers, shows there is something wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I do not want to apportion blame on one side or the other but there are a few facts I would like to put on record.  First of all, the strike should never have been allowed to happen. There were initiatives that could perhaps have been made by the Minister or his Department.  Over the years one or two things happened which probably resulted in the strike taking place.  One thing was that at one stage, in a dispute in connection with Sunday work and night allowances, when disagreement was recorded the union side offered to go to a public investigator.  That was allowed under the constitution, which was drawn up in 1954.  The employers' answer to that was that they were not prepared to have a public investigation and that they considered the constitution <Col N="1513" /> out of date.  I do not think this led to good staff relations, to put it mildly.</P>
    <P>I understand that one of the items under dispute was this question of temporary service.  I am also informed that the Minister's Department offered in 1969 to have the temporaries appointed permanently but management refused to carry out this.  I make these two points to illustrate that, if we are going to investigate and carry out a post mortem on this strike, there are two sides to it.  I would certainly not say that the workers in this case were not justified in going on strike.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude with a brief reference to the problems which I can forsee in the implementation of equal pay in the nursing service.  The reason why nurses have been so badly paid over the years is because it is considered women's work.  the reason why they are even worse paid in England is because it is women's work.  If we are going to have comparisons with England there are other areas where, if you make comparisons with England, the Irish worker comes out better.  A street cleaner in Dublin has more than a street cleaner employed in the local councils in England.  It is no surprise to me to learn that the nurses in England are worse off than they are here.  I think the reason for this is that society at large&mdash;it is not confined to this country&mdash;has deemed that because work is done by a woman it is worth less and you can get it cheaply.  When we come to job evaluation the factors to be used in evaluating what nurses do should be their value to the community. If we do this we will find that the nurses will not be on a maximum scale of £1,375; it will be considerably nearer £2,375.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Senator Owens will convince some of her trade union colleagues in regard to her own attitude towards equal pay for work of equal value, because some of them, I am afraid, will be the greatest obstacle she will meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the debate which followed the motion put down by Senator Belton has been well worthwhile since it drew from the Minister the statement which he made earlier on.  I should like to avail of this opportunity to congratulate him <Col N="1514" /> on his excellent relations with the nursing profession&mdash;and with the medical profession, too, while we are at it&mdash;and on the interest which he has taken in the progress, well-being and advancement of the nurses' cause since he became Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why Senator Owens insists that there is unrest in the profession.  Anyone who reads Senator Belton's motion will see in it that most of the things he advocates in the motion have been accomplished or are in process of being accomplished.  I have no evidence of any widespread unrest in the nursing profession.  The only thing I know&mdash;and I think this is all Senator Owens knows also&mdash;is that nobody is satisfied with the amount of money which they get.  In the particular case of nurses I might say that I do not think that any adequate figure could be fixed to really compensate them for the tremendous Christian work they do in alleviating the distress of sick people. I do not think that any money spent on improving the conditions of nurses or in giving them a decent life would be wasted.  It would be a good insurance policy for the future and I would not grudge it.  I cannot see why, when every effort is being made by the present Minister to do everything possible to meet the case put up by the nurses' organisations and by the prople generally who take an interest in these things, people attempt to deny credit for what has been done.</P>
    <P>I did not like the knocking attitude of Senator Boland, neither did I like the knocking attitude of Senator Owens. Senator Owens said she was not a bit surprised that conditions for nurses here are better than they are in Britain, but she failed to add the little courtesy of saying &ldquo;Is it not wonderful that at least in one thing we are better than Britain, considering all the knocks that we have been getting in this country for not being as up-to-date or as advanced as they are in Britain?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With regard to conditions in the hospitals, Senator Owens waxed long and lively on that, too.  I think that she should have a look at the plans made by Mother Perpetua of the Daughters of the Cross in Surrey in England for an automated hospital which will be one of the most&mdash;probably <Col N="1515" /> the most&mdash;scientifically run and up-to-date in these islands when it is completed. The hospital will be run on the conveyor belt system, which is the only type of hospital, in my opinion, that is going to do away with the still existing domestic drudgery which nurses in many cases have to perform, in spite of the assurances we have got from Senator Jessop that that day is ended.  I do not think it is, and I think the sooner an effort is made to end it the better for all concerned.</P>
    <P>Our nurses are very special people. When they go abroad they are valued very highly, not alone because of their nursing skill and their education, but because of their good breeding and good manners and because they bring sunshine whereever they go.  They are happy.  We should value them just as much here at home.  Therefore, I cannot understand why the cases quoted by Senator Boland just passed off as if nothing had happened.  Did he do anything about them?  Did he tell anybody about them?  Was there any newspaper publicity?  Were they reported to the inquisition out in Montrose?  Were they mentioned here before?  I cannot conceive that in this modern age and in this year any girls would be treated in the savage fashion in which those nurses were treated according to Senator Boland.  If he did not do something about it, then he was certainly very negligent in his duty as a public representative.</P>
    <P>If I knew anything about those cases I would raise all hell to ensure that whoever was responsible for them, in whatever hospital they occurred, would be shown up to the public and that the matter would be brought to the attention of whoever was responsible for running the hospital, with a view to getting rid of whoever was responsible for that action.</P>
    <P>The question of the psychiatric nurses' strike was also mentioned by the Minister and was immediately seized on by Senator Owens.  I do not intend to go into the rights or wrongs of it or to question the trade unions' right to strike.  All I know is that in this country trade unions are free.  They have been given every encouragement and every protection under the law.  They have a <Col N="1516" /> congress and I think it is about time that that congress asserted their authority over the organised workers who are banded together in trade unions and found some system not alone of rationalising the congress, as was promised in 1965 at the trade union congress held in Cork, but whereby they could make up their minds on what type of action was permissible and what was not.</P>
    <P>Independent of this new religion of &ldquo;Don't pass the picket&rdquo; which I denounced here eight or nine years ago, something happened in the psychiatric nurses' strike here in Dublin where food suppliers were prevented from delivering foodstuffs to the hospitals by a picket, while the picket of another union, apparently, took no action. Times have changed for the worse, very radically in this country.  I am afraid that the present generation who tolerate that kind of unchristian action have deteriorated.  I know if that happened not so very long ago a group of men would take those pickets and throw them into the Liffey.  I think that time will come again if the Trade Union Congress and the unions do not make up their minds that there is a limit beyond which they should not go.</P>
    <P>The question of fair treatment for nurses is one which concerns us all.  I am quite confident that, in the present Minister for Health, we have somebody who is taking an intense interest in it and who will do all he can to ensure that what we regard as good and proper treatment is accorded to the nurses case. We have had, as the Minister outlined to us, very big improvements during the last couple of years.  Those improvements have accomplished many of the things which Senator Belton mentioned and have rectified some of the grievances under which nurses suffer.</P>
    <P>The college of nursing, about which we may have differing opinions as to its functions, whether it should be a type of training college or a post-graduate institution, is a matter for the nursing board which is the statutory body for the control of training and registration of nurses here.  The matter is under consideration but I should like to ask the Minister to use his influence to get that board to speed up their decision on it and see that something is done in a <Col N="1517" /> tangible way to ensure that they are not considering the matter at a slow pace.</P>
    <P>Dr. Belton's motion has served another good purpose.  It has made us realise that in the nursing profession we have something of which this country can be very proud.  I happen to have had experience of hospitalisation, not alone in this country but in England, where many hospitals are staffed almost entirely by Irish nurses.  The opinions of the English and other foreign medical staff and of the English patients in regard to our Irish nurses would hardly be believed because they sound so fantastic in their admiration of the skill, attention and kindness of those girls. They are the real ambassadors of Ireland and anything that we can do for them, any way in which we can help them, any way we can improve their conditions of work we should be only too happy to do.  I am very glad we had the opportunity of discussing Senator Belton's motion.  I am very glad, also that we have had the pleasure of having the Minister for Health with us to explain what he has done in connection with the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am generally pleased at the reception given to this motion. However, I should like to refer again to one or two points on which the Minister said he could not agree.  Let me advert to private nursing homes again.  Private nursing homes have to be licensed and a person cannot establish a private nursing home at will.  I fail to see why some system of superannuation for the employees of such nursing homes, on the lines of the system for employees of the voluntary hospitals, should not be introduced.  The Minister said he could not see his way to do this.  He did not explain the reason for the difficulty. There may be a valid difficulty which I do not see, but he did not explain it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system of negotiation for nurses has changed since 1970.  The Minister will recall that we levelled criticism at the Minister's predecessor for allowing the manager's association, who had no statutory function, to negotiate at all.  I am glad that position has been rectified by the establishment of the board for local government employees, upon which are represented some, if not all <Col N="1518" /> of the chief executive officers of the health boards.</P>
    <P>The question also arises of giving credit to nurses who have been nursing abroad.  It is generally recognised as extending their post-graduate experience if they qualify here in Ireland and go to hospitals in England or elsewhere before returning to take up positions here.  I do not see why they should be penalised at all.  This point was adverted to by Senator Boland, Senator Owens and myself already.  Senator Owens mentioned the report on the Status of Married Women which advocated certain things. She suggested that if the report had been published before the Health Bill, 1970, the Minister might have seen his way to being more lenient with regard to the employment of married women in the nursing profession.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this that I tried to point out to the Minister for Finance when he was before us.  He increased from £45 to £74 basic relief for an employed married woman whose husband is also employed.  Both Senator Alton and I, having our sights set on what the Minister had emphasised many times regarding the domiciliary nursing services, wanted him to increase the income tax relief up to £120 or £150 but the Minister for Finance would not accept this.  We felt that nurses, having married and wishing to come back into service, would be deterred from doing so because the figure remained at £74.</P>
    <P>Reverting to something which Senator Keery and Senator Ó Maoláin said, this college of nursing was never envisaged, in my view, as a type of training college for nurses but as a system of post-graduate education for nurses.  The Minister mentioned that certain facilities in that regard were already in existence.  There are already post-registration courses in pediatrics, psychiatry, theatre techniques and so on. There are already in existence the tutors' course in UCD, public health courses in An Bord Altranais and various part-time administrative courses.  What is the reason for education is a rhetorical question.  We need nurses who can plan for better nursing, who can administer nursing services in the increasingly complex situations of today.  We need <Col N="1519" /> nurses who can plan for and welcome necessary changes.  Only people who are secure in their background, education and training and do not feel threatened by new ideas can provide the atmosphere needed for progressive work in the health services.</P>
    <P>Change must be brought about in basic nursing education.  This is the reason why there should be a college of nursing.  I avoided in my suggestion to the Minister&mdash;though he said in his reply that he envisaged there might be something like a college of nursing set up in the College of Surgeons, that it might be a building or an institution&mdash; submitting that it might be a combination of post-graduate courses run by a body and taking place in different institutions.</P>

Which is the better or which will be the more practical I do not know.  The whole purpose of this idea of the college of nursing is to make people think of what a college of nursing is and what it should be.</P>
      <P>I want to thank the Seanad for the method in which they have received this motion.  I want to end by saying that if it were not for the dedication, the loyalty and the service of the nursing profession I doubt if any of us would be in this House today to discuss their qualifications and their remuneration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before &ldquo;be&rdquo; in line 29, to insert &ldquo;if An Bord so requests and the Minister thinks fit to do so&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is simple.  It is merely to put the position of the members of An Bord on a par with that of the chairman.  In section 6 (2) (a) there is a provision that the chairman of An Bord shall be appointed from time to time, as the occasion requires, by the Minister.  If An Bord so request and the Minister thinks fit to do so, he may be removed from the office of chairman by the Minister.</P>
      <P>That is quite simple and easy to understand.  The chairman of An Bord may be removed from office, provided two things happen: first, that An Bord request that that should be done and, second, that the Minister thinks fit so to do.  It is necessary to point out in this connection that the members of An Bord, in addition to the chairman, are all appointed by the Minister.  Consequently there does not seem to be any obvious reason why there should be any differentiation at all in the treatment of what I might describe as ordinary members of An Bord and the chairman when it comes to a question of removal from office.</P>
      <P>In section 6 (5), which this amendment seeks to amend, we find that instead of ordinary members of An Bord being treated in the same way as the chairman, the Minister has power of removal without any request being made to him by An Bord.  All this amendment seeks to do is to insert in subsection (5) exactly the same words as are used in subsection (2) (a).  In other words, subsection (5) should read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A member of An Bord shall be appointed by the Minister and may if An Bord so requests and the Minister <Col N="1521" /> thinks fit to do so be removed from office by the Minister.</P>
    <P>That would put the removal of an ordinary member in exactly the same position, so far as this legislation goes, as the chairman.  Unless there are very strong reasons to be advanced by the Minister as to why that should not be the case, it would seem that ordinary justice demands that there should be equal treatment for all members of An Bord.  The chairman is appointed in exactly the same way, and up to the time of his appointment as chairman, he is in exactly the same position as any other member of An Bord.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (a), which I quoted, deals with the appointment of chairman; subsection (2) (b) sets out the manner in which and the reservoir out of which the chairman should be appointed: he shall be appointed from among the members of An Bord other than the director and the members nominated by the staff and by the students.  Apart from the fact that he has, by virtue of subsection (2) (b), become chairman by nomination from among the members, limited in the way that I have mentioned, he is in exactly the same position as any other member of An Bord.  He has been appointed in the same way, and I cannot see why there should be any distinction between his treatment and that of any other member of An Bord when it comes to a question of removal from office.  If it is to be a requirement of removal from office that the request in the first instance should be made by An Bord relative to the chairman, then the request should also be made by An Bord relative to any other member of An Bord.  That is all this amendment seeks to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two different things involved here.  One is the election of the chairman. He shall be nominated for appointment as chairman of An Bord. There is a difference between the removal of the chairman from the office of chairman and the removal of a member from An Bord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer back to a discussion on Committee Stage.  When Senator Kelly pointed out that while a <Col N="1522" /> member was being forced under section 9 to declare his interest in relation to certain matters, there was no provision for any sanctions in the Bill should he fail to do so.  In my reply, I pointed out that the greatest sanction of all was available to me in section 6 (5), through the power given to me to remove him from office.  The amendment which is now proposed would take this power from me.  If the Minister is to appoint the member, it should not be for the other members to decide whether he should be removed from An Bord.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the other point raised by Senator O'Higgins, that is the provisions of section 6 (2) (a). The chairman is appointed on the nomination of An Bord and it is logical enough that a request for his removal from the office of chairman should come from An Bord.  However, I should like to point out that acceptance by me of such a request would not mean his removal from membership of An Bord. Of course, if he were for any reason removed from membership of An Bord, he would automatically cease to be chairman.</P>
    <P>The basic point I want to emphaise here is that the chairman is appointed on the nomination of An Bord.  It is therefore reasonable enough that they should have something to say in relation to a request for his removal.  Again I should like to state that it does not necessarily mean his removal as a member of An Bord.  Here we are dealing with two quite different things.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons why I want to keep the power in the hands of the Minister in relation to this subsection is because, as I have stated in my reply to Senator Kelly in regard to the section in which he was interested at the time, the greatest sanction of all was available to me in section 6 (5).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is, of course, right in making the distinction which, perhaps, I myself should have made when I was moving the amendment&mdash;that subsection (2) (a) refers to the removal of the chairman from the office of chairman, whereas subsection (5) refers to the removal from membership of the board.  There is no fundamental reason for distinguishing the procedure in the two cases.  In the first <Col N="1523" /> case the Minister mentioned that because the members of the board were concerned in the election of chairman, that is, election in the sense of nominating him for appointment as chairman, therefore, they should have some say in his removal.  If that argument were to be accepted as valid, exactly the same process should go down the line in relation to the nomination of various members of the board.  The Minister should be arguing logically that the staff or the students who are concerned with nominating members to the board would be entitled to be consulted before the Minister removed any people who had been appointed on the nominations of the staff or the students as members of the board.</P>
      <P>The Minister's argument is valid in relation to the chairman on that ground. If he were to be logical he would be tying his own hands seriously in relation to certain members of the board because he should see that the nominators of staff and student members should be entitled to consultation before their removal.  The Minister's power would not be whittled down very much if this amendment were accepted, though his power would be limited in certain respects because it would be dependent on the request of the members of the board.</P>
      <P>By making it so dependent there would be a built-in safety measure against a possible collision course as between the Minister and the board as a whole.  If the position is allowed to remain as it is under the section, it is conceivable that the Minister, in defiance of the wishes of the board, may decide to remove a member of the board.  The Minister on the one hand and the board on the other are set on collision course, whereas if this amendment were accepted there would be a built-in safety measure which would guard against this.  The Minister would be acting at the request of the board. However, if the Minister has set his face against accepting this amendment, obviously I will not get it carried here.</P>

      <P>In page 6, to delete section 11, lines 40 to 44, and substitute:</P>
      <P>A member of An Bord shall be disqualified from holding and shall cease to hold office as such member if he</P>

      <P>A member of An Bord shall be disqualified from holding and shall cease to hold office as such member if he is adjudged bankrupt, or makes a composition or arrangement with creditors, or is sentenced by a court of competent jurisdiction to suffer imprisonment or penal serritude or ceases to be ordinarily resident in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1525" /> This amendment seeks to vary that section in a number of respects.  It proposes that instead of section 11 there should be a new section which would read:</P>
    <P>A member of An Bord shall be disqualified from holding and shall cease to hold office as such member if he</P>
    <P>(a)  is adjudged bankrupt,</P>
    <P>That is already contained in the section.</P>
    <P>(b)  makes a composition or arrangement with creditors,</P>
    <P>that is also contained in the section.</P>
    <P>(c)  is sentenced by a court, established under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>That is a variation from what is in the section.  The reason for that it seems is that the reading of the section as it stands is wide enough to refer to a court of competent jurisdiction anywhere in the world, whereas in the amendment it is proposed to limit that to courts within this jurisdiction, that is, courts established under the Constitution. That seems desirable having regard to the consequences of a sentence being passed by the court.  It is possible to conceive a situation where a person might be sentenced by a court somewhere abroad in respect of an offence committed abroad, whereas the matter constituting the offence for which the person was committed might not be an offence at all under our law or if dealt with by courts under our jurisdiction. It seems to be of some importance to limit the application of this section to a sentence passed by an Irish court operating within the jurisdiction here. That is the first material difference between the amendment and the section.</P>
    <P>The second material difference also relates to the operation of the court. The section I have read out referred to &ldquo;sentenced by a court of competent jurisdiction to suffer imprisonment or penal servitude&rdquo;.  It stops there.  This was argued to some extent on Committee and it is necessary to refer briefly to what is involved in the argument here.  If the matter is left <i>simpliciter</i> as it stands in the section, to refer simply to a sentence of imprisonment or penal servitude, it may well be that such a sentence might be the consequence of some act or action or attitude of the defendant which in the eyes of the <Col N="1526" /> Minister, of An Bord and of the general public would not be such as in any way to make the member of An Bord unsuitable to continue acting as a member of An Bord.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly, when dealing with this on Committee Stage, mentioned as an example of what he had in mind the possibility of a person being committed to prison for contempt of court.  That could arise in a variety of ways which would generally be regarded as entirely honourable and praiseworthy on the part of the person so sentenced.</P>
    <P>You can think for a moment of the standards of journalism, journalistic etiquette and ethics in this country, where it would be regarded, as I understand it, as a serious breach of the professional code of journalists if a journalist were to disclose in evidence his source of information.  We had an example in the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; inquiry.  If a journalist were required by the court to disclose his source of information and refused to do so he would almost certainly be held to be in contempt of court and could be sentenced to imprisonment If that journalist happened to be a member of An Bord the consequence of that conduct on his part, which would be regarded, I think, by everyone as thoroughly honourable and merely upholding the standards of his profession, under the section as it stands it would entail automatic disqualification from membership of the board.</P>
    <P>I am sure other Senators could think of other examples.  One could think of some of the offences under the traffic code, for example.  I do not speak with any great authority on this but I recall an occasion where disqualification of a driving licence was imposed for a parking offence.  I do not remember, if indeed I ever knew them, the facts of the case; I just have a recollection of the publicity associated with it.  I am not in any sense being critical of the decision of the district justice who knew all the facts and decided that was a proper penalty to impose.  The point I am making is that the ordinary person would probably never have been aware that it was open to the discretion of the court to disqualify a person from driving by reason of an offence which, by and large, people would regard as a minor traffic offence, that is, an offence <Col N="1527" /> relating to parking even if it were found to be dangerous parking.  It may very well be that elsewhere in our laws, either in the traffic code or in any other of our legislation, there could be cases where discretion is vested in the court to impose a prison sentence and where a prison sentence could be imposed, although it would not be within the general knowledge of the public, or of the Minister for that matter, that the offence, infringement, breach of regulation, whatever it might be, was one which would have as a possible consequence a prison sentence.  Under this section, as it stands, any prison sentence would automatically entail disqualification from membership of the board.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to remedy that as best it can.  It may be that the drafting could be improved upon.  If the Minister has any suggestions to make with regard to the drafting and if he is agreeable, I would be prepared to have the amendment further amended in order to meet any points the Minister might raise.  The proposal for remedying the situation which I have been describing is that we should provide for disqualification if the sentence is one of imprisonment or penal servitude where it is a conviction for an offence in respect of which the Minister certifies in writing that in his opinion its nature is such as to render the member unsuitable for holding office as a member of An Bord.  In other words, we are seeking in this amendment to safeguard in some way against the type of situation where a perfectly honourable man, who acted honourably and who is acknowledged to have acted in the best interests and in accordance with the best standards of his profession, is jailed for contempt of court.  Such a man should not face disqualification from membership of the board.  In that case the man obviously should not be put off.  We are trying to include a safeguard for a situation such as that by providing that this particular provision in relation to a sentence of imprisonment will act only as a disqualification for the member, if the Minister is satisfied and certifies in writing his opinion that the offence was such as to render the member unsuitable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1528" /> The next portion of this amendment is also a new one which does not appear in section 11. Paragraph (d) reads:</P>
    <P>is declared, by resolution of An Bord, to have failed to make a disclosure which he was required to make under section 9 of this Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister will recall that section 9 of the Bill is the section which requires members of An Bord to make disclosure if they have an interest in any company or concern with which An Bord proposes to make any contract, or any interest in any contract which An Bord proposes to make.  Section 9 imposes a statutory obligation on a member in that position to make disclosure of his position.  But section 9 does not impose any sanctions whatever if a person ignores his statutory obligation.  In fact, it is merely a pious aspiration.  It has no teeth.  There is no sanction or penalty if a person ignores his statutory obligation.  The Minister may meet that particular objection by saying &ldquo;But I have power to remove such a member from the Board&rdquo;.  The Minister may have power, but he may not exercise it.  We have got to face up to that kind of situation.  I am not for a moment casting any aspersions on the present Minister.  I have no particular Minister in mind.  But a Minister, just as a member of An Bord or anyone else, may fail in his duty and may simply do nothing about it.  A person who then acts in breach of a statutory obligation solemnly imposed by the Houses of the Oireachtas has no penalty or sanction imposed on him.</P>
    <P>In this amendment we are saying that a person who acts in that way, who deliberately refuses to make disclosure of a matter which he is bound to disclose under section 9 of the Bill, should automatically be removed from membership of the board once the board declare by resolution that such a person has failed to make the disclosure which he should have made.</P>
    <P>The last point I wish to make is this: in the comparison between the section and the amendment it is necessary to point out that one of the reasons for disqualification in the section is that when a member of An Bord ceases to be ordinarily resident in the State that particular cause of disqualification is <Col N="1529" /> not repeated in the amendment.  It is deliberately omitted.  There were a number of arguments advanced on Committee Stage as to why any such cause of disqualification, particularly in relation to this board, was quite appropriate. It might very well be that it would be greatly to the advantage of the National College of Art, or of the students there, that some person who might reside abroad, across the Border, in England, or in Europe should be a member of An Bord.  There seems to be no reason why mere non-residence in the State should be an automatic reason for forfeiture of office.  I agree&mdash; the Minister will accept this&mdash;that it would not be desirable to continue that membership in every case of a person who has been appointed a member of a board and who then goes to reside abroad.  If a person was not able to come to meetings or properly to discharge his functions as a member of the board, then I would agree that it would be better that he or she should cease to be a member.  The Minister has the remedy for that situation, under section 6 which they were discussing a few minutes ago.  The Minister would be enabled to remove that person from membership of the board.  The only difference is that the Minister wants to impose automatic disqualification under section 11, if a person eases ordinarily to be resident in the State rather than have the position exist where the Minister must do something to get rid of a member who, because of non-residence in the State, is not able to give service to the board or to function properly as a member of the board.  I would prefer to leave the situation so that the intervention of the Minister in such a case is required.  The Minister can get the advice of the board on the matter but he is required to make up his mind whether or not the person who has ceased to reside ordinarily in the State has ceased to pull his weight as a member of the board and is thereby unfitted to continue to be a member. For those reasons we have not in this amendment repeated that particular portion of the section.  I would urge the Minister to give serious thought to the matters contained in this amendment. The Bill in any event is going to be <Col N="1530" /> amended so that it is no particular inconvenience to the Minister to accept other amendments to the Bill.</P>

      <P>I wish to support Senator O'Higgins on this amendment. He has made a very clear and strong case on this amendment.  I believe that in order to improve the Bill we need to have things very clear-cut.  In this piece of legislation, which has been the cause of misunderstanding and trouble in the past, I would sincerely ask the Minister to listen and take heed of the very strong and excellent case that Senator O'Higgins has put forward on this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak in broad terms against the first amendment and in favour of my own.  I speak against the first amendment with some regret because parts of it, like the curates egg, are excellent.  There are some difficult and awkward thing in the amendment which I do not think the Minister should accept.  First of all, I want to deal with this amendment and then come to deal with the oen in my name and that of Senator Robinson.</P>
      <P>In so far as the first amendment is concerned, it seems to me that paragraph <i>(a)</i> is excellent, paragraph <i>(b)</i> is excellent and the first line of paragraph <i>(c)</i> is also excellent.  I have been very impressed by Senator O'Higgins's remarks about the possibility of persons being accepted by the courts other than the courts established under the Constitution. Given the times in which we live the case he made is a good one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, I am not altogether satisfied with two further points in this amendment.  The first is that point in paragraph <i>(c)</i>, which enables the Minister to certify in writing that in his opinion the nature of a certain conviction is such as to render a member unsuitable for holding office as a member of An Bord, it putting an incredible burden on the Minister.  Certainly in the unlikely event that I should ever become Minister for Education this is the sott of burden I would be very very slowro accept.  It is asking the Minister to make a personal decision about people which may or may not&mdash;I stand open to correction on his&mdash;render him liable to prosecutions <Col N="1531" /> in the courts.  I do not know whether, if a Minister certified in writing a person's unsuitability for membership of An Bord by virtue of being sentenced in a court of law, that person might not have some remedy against the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be his own opinion which the Minister would be certifying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw that particular remark on the basis of superior legal knowledge.  But even if the Minister is in no respect liable to persons whom he may certify on foot of his opinion, it is a terrible burden to have to put on a Minister to make a second judgment on a person who has already been judged by the courts.  For this reason, I oppose that part of the amendment.  I would have been more ready to support an amendment such as that which was introduced in the other House which attempted to make conditions for membership of An Bord in regard to prison sentences which were exactly equivalent to those which operate on Members of this House and of the other House.  In other words, it is quite well known that members of this House and the other House can suffer imprisonment for up to six months without having their status affected in the slightest.  An amendment which would have included this kind of provision would be far more acceptable to the Government.  I find it very difficult to accept the amendment in its present form which puts on the Minister the onus of making a judgment on a man who has already been judged by the courts of the land.  This is unfair to the Minister.  It would be unfair also to the person concerned.</P>
      <P>I also have some doubts about paragraph <i>(d)</i> which reads:</P>
      <P>is declared, by resolution of An Bord, to have failed to make a disclosure which he was required to make under section 9 of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a certain ambiguity with regard to the phrase: &ldquo;by resolution of An Bord&rdquo;.  It is not at all clear how such a resolution would be framed or would <Col N="1532" /> be arrived at, or whether it would have to be an overall majority of the board who would vote in favour of such a resolution, or whether a simple majority of those present would be sufficient to pass the resolution.  On the grounds of vagueness, this particular paragraph is deficient.  I believe very strongly that there should be some sanction against the person who fails in the disclosure which he is asked to make under section 9.  I recognise that this amendment is an attempt to introduce the sanction, but it raises more problems than it solves in the way in which it is drafted.  I would only very reluctantly leave it to the Minister's discretion to decide whether such a case, in fact, existed, and whether such a person should or should not continue to be a member of the board.</P>
    <P>In this amendment we seem to be trying to strike a balance between giving certain situations force of law and creating other situations in which the Minister's discretion will be operative. All the debates which I have sat through in this House for the past couple of months have tended to narrow down on this point: to what point do you give a Minister discretion to do certain things?  to what point do you take that discretion away from him and write sanctions into the law of the land?</P>
    <P>The amendment which is down in my name and that of Senator Robinson is an attempt to give the Minister discretion which, in the present drafting he would not have.  I should say at this point that when I come to move my amendment&mdash;I hope to move it separately from the first amendment&mdash;I shall be asking the House to amend the amendment to correct what is, in essence, a drafting error, which is the responsibility of nobody but myself, but which will make clearer the case which I want to put before the House.  I propose to ask the House, when this happens, for leave to amend the amendment so that the words which stand to be deleted are only those which follow the word &ldquo;servitude&rdquo;. had meant in my amendment to delete only the words &ldquo;ordinarily resident or ceases to be ordinarily resident in the State&rdquo;.  My drafting error included the words &ldquo;penal servitude&rdquo; which are <Col N="1533" /> really irrelevant to the case which I want to make.</P>
    <P>The leader of the House may see fit to refuse leave to amend this amendment. I honestly feel that he would not add greatly to the reputation of the House if he did so.  If necessary, I would be prepared to argue until the cows come home that there is no difference between imprisonment and penal servitude or that anybody who is sentenced to penal servitude necessarily is also sentenced to imprisonment and therefore to argue in support of my amendment. I shall speak from this point on as if I had been given the leave of the House, which I hope will be given to me, to amend the amendment in the sense that I have suggested.</P>
    <P>I would go even further and say that if leave to amend the amendment is refused I would perhaps even suspect the Government of attempting to dodge a politically awkward situation on a technicality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator never entertains suspicions of the Chair.  The point I wish to make by the amendment which I wish to introduce is simply one of clarification.  I would underline, first of all, the reasons given by Senator O'Higgins for his omission of the phrase &ldquo;or ceases to be ordinarily resident in the State&rdquo; in the amendment which he has put before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Committee Stage debate here, Senator Quinlan asked the Minister what the particular import of this <Col N="1534" /> phrase was.  I confess that we did not get a very satisfactory answer.  My position is that I do not know what this phrase means.  I do not know what the phrase &ldquo;ordinarily resident in the State&rdquo; means.  If I am assured by the Government that this phrase does not operate to exclude from membership of An Bord people who are living in the North of Ireland I will, with reluctance, withdraw the amendment, with reluctance because I believe, like Senator O'Higgins, first of all that the geographical place where a person may happen to live should not necessarily be a decisive factor in his membership of the board as the section currently makes it.  There are probably very many people who live outside the country whose membership of such a board might be useful.</P>
    <P>One of the many points of criticism which has been made by students in the institution which is now called the College of Art is of the cosmopolitan artistic tendency which threatens to take over this country.  I have some sympathy with this feeling which has been expressed by the students.  The Minister is really tying his hands to a far greater extent than he should in making this a matter of law and not a matter of ministerial discretion.  To refer back to the earlier amendment, if he is making non-disclosure under section 9 a matter of ministerial discretion, how much more should he not make residence also a matter of ministerial discretion?  The place of residence it seems to me, is altogether trivial in terms of qualification for membership of An Bord compared with non-disclosure under section 9.  The Minister has every reason to untie his hands in this matter and to give himself a decent leeway on it.</P>
    <P>As I said, generally speaking, I would prefer that these words &ldquo;ceases to be ordinarily resident in the State&rdquo; were not in the Bill at all in order to give the Minister complete freedom to choose people from wherever he likes to act as members of An Bord.  At another level, I would be reasonably happy to see the phrase remain in position provided I was assured that it does not affect the position from north of the Border.  If the Minister or anybody else on the other side of the House tells me that this section acts to exclude people from <Col N="1535" /> north of the Border I would really feel that I must oppose it.</P>
    <P>Finally, one thing occurred to me, and that is to ask the Minister how he would propose to define &ldquo;ordinarily resident in the State&rdquo;.  I have already asked him to define &ldquo;the State&rdquo;.  I should now like him also to define &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;.  I gather that the Revenue Commissioners have a rather complicated sliding scale for tax purposes to decide whether persons are ordinarily resident here of not and that a person can in fact be legally resident here for tax purposes even though he may be physically present here for only two months or less in any year.  If this were the case, my opposition to the section would be slightly lessened.  In broad terms it seems that the simplest way out of this dilemma for the Minister and for us is to delete the offending phrase.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2, in effect, gives the Minister discretionary powers in the case of a member sentenced to a term of imprisonment but not in the case of a member who failed to make a disclosure of interest in the contract or appointment.  It would appear to me that there are much more likely to be extenuating circumstances in relation to the latter case than in a case relating to the subsection dealing with imprisonment.  My family have about 34 first cousins at least and it is quite possible that some of them have never met and probably would not recognise one another if they did meet. I am citing this as a possible situation where it could happen that a person would not, through any misdemeanour on his part, fail to declare that a particular person seeking appointment was a relative of his.  I should like to emphasise again that the question of sanction in connection with this section was referred to by me on Committee Stage when I pointed out that I felt the power of removal by the Minister was sufficient sanction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O Higgins also raised in paragraph (c) the question of the court being established under the Constitution. He made a point that a person could possibly be convicted for the <Col N="1536" /> committal of an offence abroad which might not be an offence here.  On the other hand, if we were to insert this it could mean that a person could commit a very serious offence abroad and it would still be open to him to remain a member of the board.</P>
    <P>With regard to the discretionary powers proposed to be given to the Minister in the amendment regarding disqualification for imprisonment, I held on Committee Stage, and I still hold, that I should not be placed in a position of passing judgment on a sentence imposed by the courts of law. For these reasons I feel that the section as it stands is better and more suited to the Bill.  I was impressed by the case made by Senator O'Higgins and Senator Horgan in relation to the phrase &ldquo;or ceases to be ordinarily resident in the State&rdquo; and I would be willing to accept that amendment.</P>

However, I should like to say&mdash;and I am sure Senator Horgan will agree&mdash;that I am genuinely relieved and encouraged that the Minister has met the points of view put forward in relation to the deletion of the phrase &ldquo;ceases to be ordinarily resident in the State&rdquo;.  I should like to express gratification that the Minister has met us in that regard.</P>

I made inquiries about this and the parliamentary draftsman felt that subsection (5) as it stood would have to be read in conjunction with subsection (6), but I decided, on the basis of the case made by Senator O'Higgins, that I would nevertheless insert this subsection for the purpose of clarifying the position beyond doubt.</P>

      <P>In page 8, line 34, before &ldquo;through&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(not being a function of a purely academic nature or one involving academic judgment)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises out of the Committee Stage discussion in relation to section 18 of the Bill.  Section 18 provides that:</P>
      <P>An Bord may perform any of its functions through or by any of its officers and servants duly authorised by An Bord in that behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I moved an amendment on Committee <Col N="1538" /> Stage to limit the right of the board so to delegate its functions by excluding functions which were of an academic nature.  Perhaps it would be better to read the amendment into the section to make it more understandable.  The section, if this amendment were accepted, would read:</P>
    <P>An Bord may perform any of its functions (not being a function of a purely academic nature or one involving academic judgment) through or by any of its officers and servants duly authorised by An Bord in that behalf.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to take up the time of the House in arguing this point because the principle of it has been argued fairly fully on Committee Stage.  It is felt that, in relation to functions which are purely of an academic nature or functions which involve academic judgment, the power of the board to delegate should be delegation to duly qualified academic members of the staff who, by reason of their qualifications, are in a position to undertake the functions of an academic nature or to exercise the judgments of an academic nature which might be required.</P>

      <P>As I see it, the effect of this amendment would be that An Bord could not delegate any of their teaching functions or their assessment functions to any of their officers which include, of course, the teaching staff. Apart from this, I feel that it would be, to a certain extent, casting a reflection on the board.  It was suggested the other night on the Committee Stage that the board would need to be legally prohibited from putting an attendant in charge of a teaching class.  I think that this would be to assume that the board would not be a responsible board.</P>

At the same time, suggestions have been made of amendments, such as this one, which not alone, in my view, encroach on the autonomy of the board but are, in a sense, a reflection on their integrity. I should also like to underline that I am not suggesting that this is the view of <Col N="1539" /> Senator O'Higgins.  It would appear to take away very much from the responsibility of the board if it were needed to write into the law that they should not do some of the things which were suggested on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I have, on the other hand, accepted amendments which gave the board discretion when I felt that this was warranted.  I do not want to be placed in the position of putting unwarranted and unnecessary constraints on the board.  I feel that this particular amendment would be far too limiting.</P>

There is no question of the amendment reflecting or intending to reflect in any way on the proposed members of the board, nor on their servants or officers. It is simply endeavouring to achieve a situation where, even accidentally there will be no question of matters requiring the exercise of academic judgment being dealt with by persons not properly qualified to deal with them.  I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this very short Bill is simply to enable county councils to give increased contributions <Col N="1540" /> where necessary towards the financing of county committees of agriculture in the local financial year commencing 1st April, 1972, and subsequently.</P>
      <P>The committees of agriculture are financed each year by means of contributions from their respective county councils together with State grants related to such contributions.  The State grant normally approximates to the local rates contribution by the county councils, but in the case of the 12 committees of agriculture in the small farms areas of the west and north west of the country, further State assistance is granted by way of a contribution of 75 per cent instead of the normal 50 per cent towards the cost of employing adequate numbers of advisory staff.</P>
      <P>The existing statutory ceiling of county council contributions, which has been in operation since 1st April, 1970, is a sum not exceeding 27 times the produce of a rate of 1d.&mdash;that is 2s. 3d.&mdash; in the £1 in the area consisting of the county, exclusive of any urban areas therein.  Under section 1, subsection (1), of this Bill, it is proposed to increase the ceiling to 15p or 3/- in the £ with effect from 1st April, 1972.  This maximum does not, of course, make it mandatory on county councils to reach it or indeed to meet the demands of committees of agriculture, unless they see fit.</P>
      <P>Section 1 subsection (2) would enable county councils to make any necessary preliminary arrangements during the current financial year with a view to adopting a suitable rate contribution, within the proposed new maximum, in respect of the coming financial year.</P>
      <P>The short title and collective citation of the Bill are dealt with in section 2, which also proposes, in subsection (3), that the Bill will come into operation on 1st April next.</P>
      <P>Expenditure by committees has risen steeply in recent years due mainly to a progressive increase in the numbers and cost of the county advisory staffs.  Total expenditure has risen from £828,000 in 1963-64 to £2.1 millions in 1970-1971. The total number of advisory officers has increased from 402 in 1963-64 to 602 in 1970-1971, which represents an increase of no less than 50 per cent over that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the current year 13 committees <Col N="1541" /> have requested and received from their respective county councils a contribution based on the existing maximum rate of 27d. in £ but it is estimated that some of these committees will require to go beyond that maximum in the financial year 1972-73.</P>
    <P>The proposed Bill is required to ensure that those committees, which in the immediate future cannot carry out their statutory functions on their present incomes, will be permitted to seek sufficient funds to enable them to do so. My Department will, of course, continue to provide grants for the committees on the same pro-rata basis as before.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to half welcome this Bill to the House as I feel it goes about halfway to meet the problem.  In this I am being very generous and very conservative.</P>
      <P>In the last paragraph of the Minister's speech, he certainly owned up to the fact that he understands the situation. I should like to add a further bit to that because I think that seven counties will find themselves in the red, even if this Bill goes through unamended, and will be unable to meet their requirements at the end of the financial year.  This is mainly because the Agricultural (Amendment) Bill introduced here in 1970 fell that much short of what was required.  I strongly object to the fact that the agricultural sector are always the people who must go shorthanded.</P>
      <P>I should like to compliment the very large and very fine Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  The more I come in contact with the personnel of that Department the more I appreciate the tremendous amount of work that is undertaken and reasonably and satisfactorily carried out within that organisation.  I refuse to accept that those officers cannot see the light. Perhaps I am of a suspicious nature and cannot be blamed if I think there is an effort by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to economically squeeze out the existing committees of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are within a year of entering the EEC, and surely we must expect changes.  There must be improvements and we must be able to gear our <Col N="1542" /> agricultural industry for entry into the Common Market and for competition, if everything we are told about the efficiency of our competitors in Europe is correct.  If we want to give our farmers a chance, we must provide them with the means, with the education and with the educational opportunities. The figures are there to prove, and I know that the Department officials know, that there is an ever-increasing demand on the agricultural advisory services in every county.  Even if this Bill is introduced and if this miserable penny is granted, the Minister must be aware that one committee at least will be about £24,000 in the red at the end of this financial year.  The additional increase will not be able to clear off that debit balance at the end of the coming financial year.  This is not a healthy situation and it is not the way the farming community should be expected to face into a new and challenging era.</P>
    <P>At present we have increased demands all over the country for more and better advisory officers.  Out of a class of 85 agricultural students who graduated from our universities this year, to date about seven or eight of them have been successful in gaining employment. In my own county we could do with some additional temporary officers in our winter farm school.  If we succeeded in employing them, we should be in the red at the end of the year, and therefore the prospects of our getting sanction from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to employ these additional officers are nil.  It is most unfair of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to present this Bill to the House.  Everybody dealing with agriculture, the majority of the Members of this House, and more especially my 11 colleagues on the Agricultural Panel, are keenly aware of the important role that the advisory services in the county committees of agriculture are playing today.  There has been a certain amount of uneasiness expressed by the advisory services themselves.  We should meet this challenge and meet it in a forthright manner in the coming year.</P>
    <P>The onus is on the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to equip the members of the county committees of <Col N="1543" /> agriculture to do the job they have been elected to do.  The Minister&mdash;I doubt if he really feels generous&mdash;suggests that 15p in the £ is a sufficient sum to carry on an agricultural educational programme in our rural counties.  The ratepayers of any county would not shirk their responsibilities in contributing more than 15p in the £.  There are very few counties now where the rate is less than £5 in the £.  Out of that, the total amount that can be devoted to agriculture is a measly 15p.  This is a problem we should face.  Everybody is blue in the face listening to the cry that there is free primary, secondary and third-level education for all.  Yet for the coming year the agricultural colleges propose to increase their fees to £160 per annum.  This at a time when the emphasis should be on agricultural education.  All those people, including myself, who are for entry to the EEC place our hope on the agricultural industry reaping a benefit that will more than compensate for those who will be pinched by our joining the EEC and taking this progressive step.</P>
    <P>I should like to take a look at the progress made in agricultural education. The Minister kindly sent us today the report on the activities of his Department for 1971, although I knew most of the figures already.  In the past 20 years the number of advisers employed by county committees has almost doubled, from 328 in 1959 to 603 in 1971.  It must also be remembered that we have 1,400 employed in An Foras Talúntais.  This is something which annoys me.  We have an excellent agricultural research institute; the universities do their share of research, and piled on top of the load we have the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries blossoming forth with a greater percentage capital increase in their research programmes than the institute or the universities put together.  This, for a small country, is unnecessary duplication of an important service.</P>
    <P>I often wonder if the personnel in these three branches of research are even on talking terms.  The results of some of this research are not 100 per cent in agreement and the system needs to be reorganised.  Since the beginning <Col N="1544" /> of this century, the application of modern science to agriculture has increased and farming innovations are being introduced faster than at any time before in our history.  New agricultural methods and inputs have made it possible to attain substantial increases in output or decreases in production costs, and in many cases both.  There exists a gap between what agricultural scientists know to be feasible and what farmers are actually doing.  While the existence of this gap is unavoidable, in practice the size of this gap is surely open to influence by those concerned with the planning and implementation of agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>As a first step, united research and advisory services would appear to be in the interests of the national economy and it must have the effect of closing this gap to some extent.  In the case of the agricultural sector, where a significant proportion of the research institution's development activities depend on the field advisers, it must be obvious that there must be close cooperation between the research and advisory services.  It is difficult to see where the work of one body ends and the other begins.</P>
    <P>There are good reasons for such organisations being under the same administration.  The present arrangement whereby the specialist services of the institute research staff are made available to advisory officers for the solution of difficult or unusual problems provides an essential link for the two-way flow of information between the advisory officers and the research workers.  This keeps research workers in close touch with the difficult practical problems being encountered in the field.  The research worker is well equipped to deal with such problems because of his specialist knowledge and training and the comprehensive, analytical and diagnostic facilities available to him.</P>
    <P>A review of Government policy in relation to our total agricultural output is long overdue.  Government intervention proliferates in the agricultural sector and its impact goes right through the whole sector.  We must soon attack every problem of priorities and sort them out in relation to suitability, efficiency and market availability. <Col N="1545" /> Official policy in developing these priorities must embrace and develop the agricultural sector as a co-ordinated whole and not as a collection of independent and unrelated activities, as it has been in the past.</P>
    <P>What is required is a broadening of agricultural development responsibilities to include development of the rural community, including social amenities and close co-operation with industrial and tourist development, and the provision of leadership and greater resources to voluntary bodies concerned with rural development.  A national board would act as a top-level advisory group, reporting directly to the Minister. I agree there is a lot of leeway to be made up, but we must have new systems to bring our agriculture into line with the 1970s.  The existing agricultural advisory services have done a tremendous job in bringing the agricultural industry to the reasonably good state it is now in.</P>
    <P>We should have a rural development authority.  Rural development demands the extension of the scope and influence of the present county committee of agricultural system.  If the existing committees were broadened to ensure that the rural and farming voluntary organisations were adequately represented they would form the basis for the decentralisation of most of the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, and perhaps of the Department of Lands, to county level, thereby contributing to efficiency and economy.</P>
    <P>These representative bodies would control the agricultural development funds allocated for their counties and build the advisory and other State services or at least help to co-ordinate them.  There has been over the past year an amount of uneasiness in the agricultural advisory field.  So far as the advisers employed by county committees of agriculture are concerned, there is not sufficient scope for promotion. It is easy to see that there is room for improvement here.  I have looked at the structure in the Minister's Department recently and also at the promotional structure in the Department of Lands</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, surely I am allowed to discuss where this money is going?  It is being provided for the operation of the county committees' schemes.  This includes agricultural education.  A certain amount of uneasiness exists among the 602 officers employed jointly by the committees and the Department in regard to the lack of promotional opportunities which exists in this service.  I was making an analogy with the promotional ladder in the Minister's own Department, the Department of Lands and An Foras Talúntais.  I would submit that in the three ladders of promotion, that is the temporary adviser with a county committee, a full-time appointed adviser, a deputy CAO and a CAO some additional ladder must be inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be possible to introduce a common recruitment grade for all agricultural graduates entering the public service irrespective of whether they take up employment with the Department, a county committee of agriculture, a semi-State body or with An Foras Talúntais.  If we had that common base it would be possible and indeed desirable for men to apply and transfer from one branch of the service to another.  A most important feature of this is that members of the inspectorate from the Minister's own Department who supervise the activities of county committees of agriculture would have had during their earlier years at least a few years' service at county level. In this way these people would have learned a lot by going around and knowing exactly what to expect and what could be done with the advisory service.  It is altogether different for a chap to graduate from college, go in as a junior inspector in the Department of Agriculture and find himself in a few years telling the instructors down the country what to do.  I have the greatest respect for the inspectors whom I know personally in the Department, the people who supervise activities in my own area and I have no crib with them. Nevertheless, in future when we look at these services we should ensure that these people have a good ground <Col N="1547" /> knowledge of the work they are expected to supervise.</P>
    <P>Since the ACC have appointed graduates as field officers in the various counties farmers have found it much easier to obtain loan accommodation with the ACC because these officers are in circulation and living throughout the counties.  Heretofore one or two officers were employed at headquarters in Dublin and living there.  When you have a man on the job he appreciates the difficulties of the farmers that little bit better.  I would like to see greater promotional opportunities for our advisers because if the farming industry is to progress in the future it must be through greater output and efficiency.  The surest way we can hope to obtain this is by availing of the many educational opportunities that may come our way.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department, who are reluctantly paying half the money, are lacking in so far as the Minister has failed to get across fairly and squarely to the farming community the depth, value and scope of the many services that his Department is providing.  In some cases the erratic payments of the various grants by his Department causes an inordinate amount of criticism of the Department.  He appears to do nothing to counteract that.  In the various schemes, other than grant schemes, operated by the Department and with the help of the county committees of agriculture they fail to get the message across.  I know it is easy to be critical of any large Department, but I feel that greater work could be done where there is a spirit of co-operation. From my contact with the Minister's Department I know that his officers appreciate very well the problems throughout rural Ireland, yet I cannot explain the slowness of the Department in doing anything about it.  Many of the Department's schemes are too inflexible.  This tends to show up our agricultural advisers in a bad light.  One year the Department can decide to have the emphasis on increased milk production.  By the time the agricultural advisory service have this in full swing and have the produce flowing, we find that the Minister has <Col N="1548" /> decided to put the brakes on in some other direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  It is a limited Bill dealing with county committees of agriculture.  Anyone can argue anything about agriculture, but not in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the advisory service and how this inflexible Departmental policy puts the ordinary adviser in a bad light. When the June census comes out each year at the end of July or early August and the Department see the way trends are going at that stage, irrespective of what grant schemes they have on they should immediately apply the brakes and ensure that we would have production on an even keel.  If the present system continues and if farmers continue to be bitten by accepting wholeheartedly and without question the excellent advice that the Department instruct our advisory service to impart to the farming community, it will undermine the value and confidence that the farmers at present have in the advisory service.</P>
      <P>I have one other crib about the advisory service and I would ask the Minister to look at the problem sympathetically.  It again deals with the promotional opportunities for a senior adviser on the maximum salary.  If he should be lucky enough to be appointed a deputy CAO he will find himself at a financial loss if he accepts this post. Surely this is something which would not be accepted or tolerated in any other occupation or any other sphere. I respectfully ask the Minister to look at this anomaly.  There are only 27 or 28 men involved.  Because of the fact there are so few men there the minimum salary for a deputy CAO is less than the maximum salary of a senior instructor.  This is a very small problem and it should be rectified right away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On section 1 the increase to 27p in the £ in the 1970 Bill, which was permitted by last year's Agricultural Amendment Act, has proved to be insufficient within the year of adoption. Is this not setting the headline?  It was not enough last year.  We have seven <Col N="1549" /> county committees in the red.  There are no more conservative public representatives than are to be found in county committees of agriculture.  The Minister said the fact that he proposed to increase the demand to 15p did not necessarily mean that each committee must ask for 15p this year.</P>
    <P>The people involved are very responsible bodies of men throughout the 27 county committee of agriculture areas. They will not spend the money unwisely. They will not spend it if it is not necessary.  Therefore, I would suggest to the Minister to amend this figure now.  It is unfair to pass this Bill knowing that seven of the 27 committees will still be in the red at the end of this year.  On the other hand, if the Minister agrees to remit the debit balances presently standing in each of those seven or eight counties there might be a case for accepting this piecemeal legislation.</P>
    <P>The ceiling of 27 old pence should be increased to 27 new pence.  That does not mean that every committee of agriculture will seek the maximum in this coming year.  Far from it, but at least it will give those who are £24,000 in debt breathing space and it will give them an opportunity of meeting their commitments to their banks or to their treasurer.  It is not as if the committees are reluctant to call on the ratepayers to increase the demand.  This is certainly not so.  With the huge increase in rates, £5 in the £ is about the lowest rate in the Republic.  Out of that sum the Minister will allow county committees of agriculture to ask county councils for only 15p.  We are told that agriculture is the backbone of the nation; it is the industry on which we are placing all our hopes.  If the Minister is sincere about continuing this very valuable service by equipping the agricultural community to face the challenge of the years immediately ahead we must have adequate finances to do that.</P>
    <P>I suspect the Minister's Department will propose changes in the present structure of committees of agriculture. I would impress on the Minister the importance of ensuring that the committees are left with at least the same powers as they have at present.  He should utilise the present system on <Col N="1550" /> which to build a stronger committee system, giving the committees statutory and corporate powers so that they can get down to work.  The committees of agriculture do a tremendous amount of voluntary work throughout the country. Most committees have the backing of the farming community.  Many schemes which they operate for the Department are excellent ones and perhaps they could usefully operate a few more.</P>
    <P>It was a pity the horse breeding schemes were taken from the committee of agriculture.  Perhaps with the new horse board this is not so important, but nevertheless since this particular scheme went into the Department the Irish draught horse has suffered considerably numerically.  In schemes such as this local knowledge at grassroots level is of tremendous importance. Therefore, the committees of agriculture, as constituted, should form the basis for building a future structure and their powers should be extended to make them administratively more effective.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to indicate, when he is replying, whether he will, between now and the next Stage, consider amending this Bill; or, on the other hand, if he will give the House an assurance that he is prepared to remit the debit balances of the seven committees who have overdrafts this year. If he undertakes to remit these in full there would then be a reasonable case for letting things go for another year. This, however, is not a view which is very popular with members of the county committees of agriculture and it is not a view which will be accepted by everyone in this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot have it both ways.  We must maintain our services. His Department know that there is an ever-increasing demand for the services of the agricultural adviser.  The Minister also knows that the small farm scheme requires a farm plan to be drafted.  In most counties, where there are so many temporary officers and so many posts to be filled in the committees of agriculture, it is quite a problem for the advisory services to draw up farm plans for the large amount of applicants for this scheme.  If we are to continue with the small farm schemes, surely we must supply the county committees with staff or enable them to employ <Col N="1551" /> the necessary technical officers and graduates to operate effectively?</P>
    <P>There is no shadow of doubt but that this scheme has been successful.  It has put many men on the road to success. It is far more preferable to spend additional money on those types of productive incentives than to mix up social benefits to agriculture.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to indicate that he will accept some worthwhile amendments to this Bill or that he will give an assurance that he is prepared to pick up the cheque in the counties that have sizeable overdrafts at the moment.</P>

      <P>I must congratulate Senator McDonald for the mileage he got out of a very simple Bill like this.  I am sure the Acting Chairman was very indulgent because the only thing I see in this Bill is the giving of permission to the county councils to put them in funds to give an extra contribution as required to the various committees of agriculture.  I am on one of these committees and from my knowledge I do not know how these committees got themselves into the red, because our CAO certainly would not allow our committee to get into the red.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Be that as it may, I have always seen amongst the county councillors, 85 per cent of whom come from rural areas, that they are very parsimonious in <Col N="1552" /> handing out money to the committee at all.  At the same time the committee have been able to function successfully and we have never found ourselves at any disability in getting new agricultural advisers when we required them. I think that possibly in years to come this may have to be reviewed again. This would be welcomed both by the county councils and by the committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I would be afraid to accept, if I were the Minister, the proposal that the overdrafts of seven committees would be met by the Minister and that they would still have this available to them. I know myself&mdash;and I am not talking about committees of agriculture now&mdash; that it is common practice throughout the country with other committees to overbudget, to budget for deficits, and then to go to the Department and say &ldquo;We are in the red so you must get us out of the red or we will have to sack a lot of teachers.&rdquo; I think that this Bill is satisfactory.  It is only to meet a very small operation and I am satisfied that it will be welcomed by both the county councils and the committees of agriculture.</P>

      <P>I think I can agree to a certain extent with Senator Honan that this is a small Bill, but it is a very important one.  I do not think that we can deal with this as lightly as Senator Honan dealt with it, but one does not need to go so far into it as Senator McDonald has done.  It is a simple Bill.  Every Member of the Seanad is getting used to this type of Bill.  In my ten short years in this House this is the third time we have had amending legislation of this kind.  It is the third time we have had this kind of amending legislation since 1964 because we had it in 1964, 1970 and again we have it in 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a similar Bill was before us in 1970 I made a plea to the Minister to increase it to the 15 new pence, otherwise we would be back here in two years seeking to have it increased to 15 new pence.  As a member of an agricultural committee since I first entered public life&mdash;I was appointed a member of the Meath County Committee of Agriculture and I am still on that committee&mdash;I know that I and my <Col N="1553" /> committee are not affected by this Bill, as the Minister and his officials are probably aware.  Last Monday we had our estimates meeting for 1972/73 and we still have not reached the old figure of 27 pence for the past year. There are reasons for that because a penny in the £ in my county brings in almost £2,400.  When you contrast that with a penny in the £ in a county like Longford or Leitrim, bringing in one quarter of that, £600, this is where the problem arises.</P>
    <P>There are one or two things which I should like to ask the Minister and I would deem it a favour if he would answer me.  Why is it that committees of agriculture are inhibited by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in the way in which they are?  A ceiling is put there for the committee of agriculture, &ldquo;thus far and no further must you go&rdquo;, and the result is that in certain counties&mdash;and again I may say that my county is not affected&mdash;they find that they cannot live, operate and give a service that the agricultural community demands on the ceiling that is imposed upon them by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are members of local authorities will know what I am talking about when I talk about the old joint mental hospital boards.  They met and they fixed a rate for the coming year and that demand was presented to each of the local authorities within the joint board's area.  That had to be met and no questions asked.  You have the same situation with the vocational committees.  When we sit down in a few months' time to deal with our estimates for 1972/73 we will be getting a demand from all the regional health boards and councillors may ask questions. But you cannot take one halfpenny off that; it is mandatory, you have to write the cheque and hand it over.</P>
    <P>The agricultural committees are being treated as if their membership were composed of a type of second-class citizen, or somebody who is not to be trusted.  The heavy hand of the Department must be over them and they are told &ldquo;You cannot exceed 27 pence&rdquo; and now we are asked to increase that to 36 pence.  I am dealing in the old <Col N="1554" /> pence, I think it is the easiest way.  It is increased to three shillings.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Department are being realistic in imposing a figure of three shillings.  In section 1 (1) it is proposed to increase the ceiling to 15p in the £ with effect from 1st April, 1972.  This maximum does not, of course, make it mandatory on county committees of agriculture to reach it or indeed to meet the demands of the committees of agriculture unless County Councils see fit.  We all know that is the situation and we all know that county committees of agriculture are in the main composed of members of county councils who are the rating authorities. They have a responsibility to the ratepayers of the county, they accept that responsibility and they carry out that responsibility as members of committees of agriculture and as members of the county councils.  I do not think there should be any fear that they will make excessive or wild demands on their local authority when it comes to the striking of the rates.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister when he is replying to clear up one point.  Why has the figure&mdash;which is sailing so close to the wind and is making it so difficult for committees of agriculture in certain parts of the country to carry on&mdash;to be 15p rather than, say, 30p or 35p?  Is it because committees are not to be trusted or is it because committees are about to be phased out?  There is grave suspicion that this is the case and that this is the reason why we have this piecemeal legislation coming in here every couple of years aimed at getting another couple of shillings to keep the county committees of agriculture in business until we decide what we are to do with them.</P>
    <P>Usually, when a Minister introduces a Bill in the Dáil and subsequently, when it has passed through all Stages in the Dáil and is introduced in the Seanad, we find if we read the Minister's speeches introducing the Bill in the Dáil and Seanad that there is a great similarity in the speeches.  I notice, on reading the Minister's speech on this Bill in introducing it in the Dáil and on reading his speech introducing the Bill here tonight, that there is a grave omission in one paragraph.  It might be <Col N="1555" /> no harm to read from his Dáil speech so that we could put it on the record of the House.  It appears in volume 256, column 2127, of the Dáil Debates of 16th November, 1971.  The Minister, in introducing this Bill in the Dáil, said:</P>
    <P>This Bill I should explain is basically an interim measure designed to enable the more hard-pressed committees of agriculture to pay their way in carrying on their very important work until such time as a final decision is reached on the whole future of the agricultural advisory and educational service which, as Deputies know, have been under comprehensive review.  The new maximum rate will meet the needs of those county committees which in the immediate future cannot carry on without a contribution in excess of the present permitted maximum. Otherwise, those committees would have to consider curtailing the scheme and possibly the number of their advisory staff.  Such a contingency would not only be highly undesirable but would be seriously detrimental to the interests of the farming community.</P>
    <P>We can all agree with that but the hidden message in it is that the fears that are being expressed by members of committees of agriculture that they are about to be phased out is, I think, evident in that paragraph which the Minister omitted in his Second Reading speech here tonight.</P>
    <P>The leader of the House got a bit annoyed when Senator McDonald indicated that he proposed to ask the Minister to reconsider this figure of 15p. He pointed out that this Bill went through the Dáil in a very short time. I do not wish the leader of the House to think that I am making a threat here tonight but I think we have a democratic right, if we feel that we can in any way improve the Bill, to put down amendments.  I propose to put down an amendment to this 15p mentioned in the Bill because I think it is an inadequate sum.  I know the Minister knows it is inadequate too.  I think this figure should be increased to at least 25p so that it will give a breathing <Col N="1556" /> space to the seven committees, as Senator McDonald has said, that are seriously in the red and who would have had to curtail their services were it not that their bank managers were so accommodating during the year.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to take up much more of the time of the House but there are still one or two small points that I should like to refer to and which I hope I can refer to without incurring the wrath of the Chair.  There are references here to the normal 50 per cent towards the cost of employing adequate numbers of advisory staff.  For the benefit of those who are not <i>au fait</i> with committees of agriculture, the general basis in a number of counties is pound for pound: for every pound put up by the rates the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries put up a pound.</P>
    <P>In the 12 underdeveloped counties the system is different, but as a person who comes from the eastern part of the country we are supposed to be enjoying the 50 per cent, or pound for pound, generally indicated.  I wish to point out that this is not the case and it is something that should be put right immediately. In my county, when we were dealing with the estimates last week we found that we were being short-changed by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to the extent of £1,615 on our 1972-73 estimates.  This arose by reason of the fact that we do not get the 50-50 ratio we are supposed to get.  I believe the same applies in a number of other eastern counties.  It is entirely wrong that this type of Victorian legislation should be carried on into the seventies. I would respectfully ask the Minister and the Department to have a look at that aspect of the matter because this short-changing of the Meath Committee of Agriculture of £1,615 is approximately the equivalent of three-farthings&mdash;if you would pardon me for talking of farthings in this affluent age&mdash; in the £.</P>
    <P>There is one further point I should like to raise and that is the question of the representation of committees of agriculture on the regional development organisations.  I am sure the Minister and his officials are as aware of this as I am.  Where there were applications from four county committees of agriculture to become members of the <Col N="1557" /> regional organisation they were inhibited from doing so because the Department of Agriculture would not sanction the payment of a subvention to the regional organisation.  I believe this applies all over the country.  I do not know what the reasoning behind it is.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify that in his winding up speech.</P>
    <P>I feel that the committees of agriculture have a role to play in regional development and that they should be members of the regional development organisation.  I also feel that, if they are to be members of the regional organisations, they should be full members and that they do not come in merely because they happen to be committees of agriculture who are inhibited from paying any subvention, thus playing the role of the second class citizen on the regional organisations.  I would respectfully ask the Minister to have a look at that and see if there is anything that can be done to enable the committees of agriculture to pay the small subvention of perhaps £100 or £150 that may be demanded in order that they may have full membership of regional organisations.</P>

      <P>I think it would be no harm if the voices of some of the taxpayers who are not farmers were heard in relation to this Bill.  Out of approximately 27 committees of agriculture there are 12 in respect of which the State pays £3 for every £1 put up by rates.  Therefore, the ordinary man who is not a farmer, for every £1 that he pays in his rates pays a further £2 in ordinary taxation to meet the expenses of the committees of agriculture. We are told of the importance of the agricultural community to the nation.  We all accept that.  But it is about time the agriculture community realised that all the time they cannot be at the taking end of the nation's pocket.  Throughout this country there are farms and farms and farms which are growing furze, which are inadequately tilled, which are improperly used and for which the ordinary taxpayer is expected to pay.</P>

      <P>Excuse me.  I did not interrupt the Senator.  If they are to improve those farms, any improvements they do entitle them to substantial grants.  We are now being asked why there should be a ceiling put on the contribution from the rates.  The rates have gone up considerably and now, in most counties, they are up to £5 in the £1.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Any person who improves a small cottage in a rural district in Ireland will have a poor law valuation of £10 or £15.  For every £1.50 he paid before&mdash;he may not even be a farmer &mdash;towards the committee of agriculture, the Bill now entitles the Rating authority to demand £2 from him.  I do not disapprove of that because farming is so important, but in addition to having to pay this £2, an extra 50p in rates, he will have to pay another £2 in taxes.  If he lives in one of the 12 out of the 27 areas he will have to pay a further £3 in ordinary taxes.</P>
      <P>Surely it is time that some regard is had for the ordinary taxpayer when dealing with the agricultural community. Senator McDonald made a very very strong case here that this figure should be increased.  Senator McDonald is a member of the Laois County Council.  The Laois County Council are governed and controlled by members of Senator McDonald's party&mdash;the Fine Gael Party.  At the moment, they are entitled to demand from the rates in old money 23p in the £1 in respect of the county committee of agriculture.  All they demanded last year was two-thirds of that&mdash;16.32 new pennies.  If they had demanded 23p, if all these winter classes are required that he talks about, they could have fixed a rate of 23p.  The ordinary taxpayer would therefore have had to pay a further 23p.  They could have increased by 7p and the ordinary taxpayer who was not a farmer would pay 7p in respect of that and he would pay another 7p in his ordinary taxes.  They did not do that.  If all the winter classes were required there was no trouble in the world, if that was their policy, in having them.</P>

      <P>They demanded 16.32 new pennies.  There must be some limit and there must be some reason in this.  I think it is most important that a limit should be fixed.  The ordinary John Taxpayer, who is not a farmer, for every £1 that is paid in 12 of those, he must pay £3 in his ordinary taxes.  He also must pay his ordinary rates.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons why the rates in the country have gone so high is because the farmers have recently taken advantage of the fact that there are no rates payable when the poor law valuation is under £20.  There is a personal allowance if two people own the farm.  Therefore, a farmer who has two farms with a poor law valuation of £80 puts one of them in his wife's name, £40, he puts one of them in his own name, £40, and there are two personal allowances.  The rates that he does not pay the ordinary taxpayer must meet.</P>

It is nearly time we faced these facts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, even though the increase in the allocation is small.  Anything small will be welcomed by the county committees of agriculture. <Col N="1560" /> All those years they have been living on a shoestring.  By increasing the allocation, the Minister accepts what is indeed a demand from the county committees of agriculture.  This will be of great benefit to the local people because it will enable the agriculture community to continue to get advice at county level.</P>
      <P>It would be sound advice to hold on to the county committees of agriculture and I am glad that the Minister accepts this idea.  Those county committees of agriculture have played a vital part in the development of agricultural policies, for which they have received very little credit.  The advisory staffs attached to the committees have done very valuable work not alone in the advisory field but in the educational field.</P>
      <P>If we become members of the EEC there will be a greater demand by the farmers for more up-to-date knowledge, education and advice and this is what we should expect.  We should continue to improve so that we can get the maximum benefit from the land.  Our country is built on agriculture. Irrespective of what Senator Nash has said, the agricultural community has been downgraded.</P>
      <P>I would advise the county committees of agriculture to employ socioeconomic advisers.  They may not be available at the moment, but they could be easily trained.  At the moment there are many agricultural advisers and many agricultural graduates unemployed. Now we have the opportunity to retrain them and to give them a few months' training on the social side of the business.  With our entry into the EEC there will be many changes and there will be demands for socioeconomic advisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many farmers who have unproductive holdings and who are unable to do anything about it.  They do not know where to go for advice and such advisers would be able to give the farmers any advice they need. They could be advised of the benefits that could accrue from giving up the land, from the long-leasing of that land and from co-operating with neighbouring farmers in order to form a co-operative farm that would be productive. This is the type of information that should be coming from the <Col N="1561" /> county committees of agriculture and would come by the use of a socioeconomic adviser.  We have advisers for agricultural matters, perhaps not sufficient, but in addition we need the socio-economic type.</P>
    <P>The county committees of agriculture, especially in the dairying areas, should employ dairy graduates.  Again in this field there will be re-organisation and the farmers will need advice to prepare them for that re-organisation. In many counties assistance is given by the creameries, where the salaries are half that paid to agricultural instructors. This type of co-operation between the dairies, the creameries and the agricultural advisers in the county committees of agriculture should exist in all the western counties, as well as in all those counties involved in the dairying industry.  The county committees of agriculture would be well advised to consider such advice.  We need to develop our farms because we are nearing the date of entry to the EEC and we should be well prepared for that event.  We need more advice and more production and all the help that can be given through the county committees of agriculture.  The small increase that is to be granted is not sufficient to meet the needs of those committees.  Notwithstanding the small amount granted, I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which will increase the amount the county councils can give to the county committees of agriculture.  I would be much happier, though, if the amount were much greater.  I understand the Department have decided to reconstruct the advisory services with a view to providing a better service for the Irish agricultural community.  When he is having the whole structure examined, the Minister should give every consideration to the retention of the county committees of agriculture as they are at present composed.  I should like to go further and suggest that the Minister should consider giving greater powers to the county committees of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a member of the Cork County Committee of Agriculture for a considerable time and I know the value attaching to these committees and the great work they do for our farming <Col N="1562" /> community.  In 1955 we had only about six instructors in agriculture and horticulture in the whole county.  Today we have more than 30, which is proof of the great changes that have taken place in agriculture and in methods of dealing with it.  We are satisfied that there has been great development and the attitude of &ldquo;what was good enough for my father is good enough for me&rdquo; has gone completely.  Young farmers today are looking for more advice and education and are insisting on getting it.  Therefore, it is necessary to have the best advisory services to meet their demands.</P>
    <P>With the advent of our entry to the EEC, because of competition in the open market it will be necessary to have an excellent advisory service available to our farmers so that they can grow the best possible quality produce and secure the best possible prices.  That means there will be greater need for agricultural advisors.  There is greater need for proper silage testing and for seed selection and all that goes with it.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate our CAOs and our agricultural instructors for the great job that they are doing in very difficult circumstances.  Despite their limited numbers, they have dedicated themselves to helping the farmers in every way possible.  I know instructors in my own county who have worked all day, giving advice to farmers, particularly in regard to the best way of using their farms and machinery.  In addition, they conduct night classes in order to help farmers give a more efficient service.  I should like to see greater powers given to county committees of agriculture.</P>
