      <P>I have received from Senator Quinlan an application ro raise, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House tonight, the following matter:</P>
      <P>Refusal of the Minister for Education to sanction legitimate increases in staff in secondary schools for the coming session as conveyed in letters this week.</P>
      <P>I rule that it is not admissible for discussion on the Adjournment as payment of the increased staff would involve the passing of legislation giving statutory effect to the required Supplementary Estimate.  Advocacy of legislation is not permitted on the Adjournment. The Senator has been notified of my decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose the following amendment to the Order of Business: <Col N="1868" /> That No. 5 be inserted before Nos. 1 and 2.</P>
      <P>No. 5 is the Adoption Bill.  When I raised this matter in the House on Tuesday I asked the Leader of the House when this Bill would be given a First Reading, in other words when it would be published, and he said he would have further information on that next week.  The reason I raise it now as an amendment to the Order of Business is that I have been reliably informed that this House will not be sitting next week.  I think this is an attempt to adjourn <i>sine die</i> and not to give this Bill its First Reading.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Bill has been tabled on the Order Paper and has appeared on it at least six times, and because this is the end of the session, I am anxious that it get a First Reading this term.  I spoke personally to the Minister for Justice and explained the provisions of the Bill to him.  He did not indicate any objection to it, which seemed to indicate that the Bill would get its First Reading without any difficulty.  The normal practice is to give First Readings to Bills.  This does not take up any time, as the Leader of the House will appreciate.  It is very important in the public interest that this Bill should receive a First Reading this session and that it be published during the summer so that it can be commented on by interested persons such as the adoption societies and by various people who may have a contribution to make towards it and who may discuss it and suggest amendments to it.  I am very anxious that we do not adjourn this session without this Bill getting its First Reading.  I would ask the Leader of the House, in view of the changed circumstances in which we will rise this evening <i>sine die,</i> that he would give this Bill a First Reading today.</P>

      <P>Before we start the round-the-houses debate again on this, as is usual with Senator Robinson in any matter of this nature, let me point out that there is no intention whatsoever of the House adjourning forever and ever and ever.  She knows <Col N="1869" /> very well that that is not the position. She also knows very well that this threatening attitude is not going to get anywhere.  I assured her that the matter would receive consideration and that I would be in a position to give her an answer next week.  If by any chance the House does not meet next week, it will meet the following week and she will get an answer.  She will not get an answer by attempting this sort of blackmail.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that in supporting this Members on this side of the House have every right to use the Standing Orders of this House in the same way as Members on the other side.  I do not see any real substance in the objection of the Leader of the House.  In addition, in view of the treatment that has been given to other Bills on their First Reading that, for some strange reason, Bills that have <Col N="1870" /> Senator Robinson's name on them are singled out for special lack of attention in this House, I hope the Government will show that this is not the case.  The only thing I can see that would modify our attitude on this is a definitive commitment by the Government to take the First Stage of this Bill before the Recess.</P>

    <Title>Central Bank Bill, 1969: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 15 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a small point on section 15.  It provides that if the Registrar under the Companies Act considers that a company's memorandum and articles of association contain a provision which might suggest that it is going to carry on the business of banking, it has the right to <Col N="1871" /> refer the matter to the Central Bank and that pending a decision by the Central Bank no certificate shall be issued by the Registrar of Companies.</P>
      <P>I suggest that there might be a hold-up here if a company required urgent registration, and I was wondering if any provision could be made to issue some form of limited certificate which would exclude the right to engage in the banking business, but would enable a company to carry on normal commercial activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a certificate, even if it were feasible, might have to be done by amendment of other legislation, rather than through this Bill.  Even if it were feasible, I doubt if it would be of much use to a company in the kind of circumstances envisaged by Senator Russell.  It seems to me that a company in search of such a grant would be living in a kind of limbo until the final position had been determined.  It would be impossible for a company in those circumstances to get on with its business or to deal with other people in circumstances in which it could transpire that its temporary registration might not be effective later on.  I doubt if this would be of much assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister visualise that the bank would act promptly if it received a request from the Registrar of Companies?  The more bodies and institutions that have to refer to these things, the greater the delay in these matters.  There are occasions when prompt registration of a company is highly desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not visualised that there would be any particular delay in such cases.  What it is hoped to achieve is that by the inclusion of this section the practice which at present exists of including banking as one of the objects of many companies, just as a matter of course, would cease.  However, in cases where it was included, and the Central Bank was notified by the Registrar, what is envisaged is that the Central Bank would immediately get in touch with the promoters of the company, <Col N="1872" /> in order to discuss the matter with them and to determine if it is intended to carry on a banking business.</P>
      <P>I could not give a firm undertaking that in those circumstances they would not be delayed, because I could visualise circumstances in which the discussions between the Central Bank and the promoters of the company might lead to further questions and need for clarification.  By and large, however, it certainly is not envisaged that there would be any delay as a result of this procedure.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 16.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The same point arises again&mdash;where there is a question of a change of companies, the Minister shall consult the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The House may take it that the procedure in this case would be the same as under section 15.  There is no reason why there should be any undue delay in such cases.  Again, it is hoped that as a result of this section the type of cases in which this kind of consultation would be necessary will be few and far between, because of the existence of the section.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 17.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 17 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The section provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An officer of the Bank duly authorised in writing in that behalf by the Governor of the Bank or a person who holds a recognised qualification in accountancy duly authorised in writing in that behalf by the Governor of the Bank may, for the purpose of the performance by the Bank of its statutory functions, upon production of his authorisation, at all reasonable times, inspect and <Col N="1873" /> take copies of or extract from books....</P>
    <P>Does &ldquo;at all reasonable times&rdquo; mean that an authorised officer could walk in at any time without prior notice and begin to inspect the books, or would he be required to give some previous advance notice of his intention to inspect the books of a company?  I presume &ldquo;all reasonable times&rdquo; means times in which the company would be open for business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This phrase &ldquo;at all reasonable times&rdquo; is a very common and indeed a hallowed one in legal terms.  It does not necessarily imply that notice of inspection would be given.  I would visualise that notice in normal cases would be given but certainly there is nothing in the section which would oblige the Central Bank to give notice of inspection.  I would normally interpret this phrase as Senator Russell has interpreted it, that is, during normal business hours.  I could not undertake in all cases that notice of inspection would be given.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 18.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 18 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 18 (1) provides that the bank may ask for information from any of the bodies that they have licensed.  Subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>A person shall not furnish information or returns under this section which he knows to be false.</P>
      <P>That is a bald statement.  So far, I have not found any penalising procedure in the Bill, if such false information is given.  What is the purpose of putting in subsection (2) unless there is some method of penalising the person or company involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Senator to section 58 (1) which reads:</P>
      <P>Any person who contravenes section 7, 14, 17, 18, or 27 of this Act and a holder of a licence who&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1874" /> (a)  contravenes section 19, 20, 26, 31 or 33 of this Act,</P>
    <P>(b)  commits a breach of a condition attached to a licence,</P>
    <P>(c) fails to comply with a direction under section 21 or 22 of this Act, or a requisition under section 23 of this Act, or</P>
    <P>(d)  contravenes regulations under section 24 or 25 of this Act,</P>
    <P>shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding five thousand pounds,</P>
    <P>and, if the contravention, breach or failure in respect of which he was convicted is continued after the conviction, he shall be guilty of a further offence and shall be liable on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding two hundred and fifty pounds for each day on which the contravention, breach or failure was so continued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>In section 18 (1) (i) it is stated:</P>
      <P>at such times as the Bank may specify from time to time.</P>
      <P>What does that mean in effect?  The bank has the sole right to decide when it shall seek such information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What is envisaged is that it could be monthly or quarterly or half-yearly or yearly.  It would depend on the kind of information sought.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear what is meant by the publication of business statements.  Is this a form of account <Col N="1875" /> and if so, is it to be standardised by the bank?  Also, what is the significance of subsection (2) which states:</P>
      <P>Different forms may be specified by the Bank for the purposes of this section in relation to different holders of licences.</P>
      <P>How are these business statements different from the financial statements in that section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the subsection is to give suitable information to the public regarding the business being carried on.  This is regarded as being an important safeguard for the public.</P>
      <P>Section 49 of the 1942 Act, which is being repealed, gives the Minister power to make regulations requiring licensed bankers to prepare and publish balance sheets and to prescribe the form of the balance sheet and the time, but not the manner of publication. These powers were not exercised.  They appear to have been envisaged for statistical purposes and to establish uniformity of presentation of content rather than for the protection of the public.</P>
      <P>The purpose behind this section is the protection of the public and the giving of information to the public rather than the statistical requirements which are dealt with in the previous section.  The reason for the provision in subsection (2) is to enable the Central Bank to specify a simple form of statement for smaller businesses while specifying a more elaborate statement for the bigger banks.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 20.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 20 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The section prescribes that:</P>
      <P>A holder of a licence&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  shall display and at all times keep displayed in a conspicuous place in every office, branch, or <Col N="1876" /> other place in which he carries on banking business and also, if the holder is a limited company incorporated in the State, in the registered office of the company, a statement (in the form required by this section) in relation to the banking business carried on by him, and</P>
    <P>(b)  shall furnish on demand to each of his creditors and, if the holder is a limited company incorporated in or outside the State, to each member of the company, a copy of the latest such statement.</P>
    <P>What about the customers of the bank? Will they be entitled to a similar privilege?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this mean that the non-associated banks will have to have copies of their balance sheets available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As holders of a banking licence they would be so required.  In the case of customers of banks, as was raised by Senator Russell, some of them will be creditors of the bank in terms of having deposits. There may be others in a different position, but those who are creditors will be covered by the provisions of the section.  Those who are not, I presume, on some occasion will visit the premises of the bank and will see the statement of the bank's affairs displayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that a customer of the bank, be he a depositor or a borrower, should have the same right as a creditor.  In other words, on demand, the bank should supply him with a statement of its affairs.  It is only right that he should have it.  I know if he goes into the bank he will see it displayed but suppose he does not go into the bank he has not got an opportunity of seeing the statement of the bank's affairs, which it might be very desirable for him to see.  On demand, he or a person authorised by him, should have the right to be supplied with a statement of the bank's affairs just as a creditor or depositor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle involved <Col N="1877" /> here is that a person who has deposited money with, or is owed money by a bank, is entitled to be kept informed of the financial position of the bank.  I am not sure that the same principle applies to somebody who might be borrowing from the bank.  I do not know any cases where people, having borrowed from somebody, want to repay their loan quickly and get out because the person who lent the money is in bad financial circumstances.  There is a different principle involved here.  Such a person can find out the position at the bank by visiting the bank premises to see the latest statement.  There is a distinction between those who owe money to the bank and those to whom the bank owes money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has touched a point I was about to make.  You can visualise a situation where a person owes money to a bank and has lodged with that bank certain securities.  If the overdraft is not of a substantial nature, of course the securities will be worth far more than the overdraft.  Is there any danger in not informing these people who have this accommodation at the bank of the precise condition of the bank at any stage?  Would the securities be in danger?  Has the Minister accepted the principle that all customers of the bank should be notified?  That would cover everything. I am not sure there is any validity in what I suggest about the securities being in danger, but what Senator Russell has said about notifying the customers of the bank as a whole, might cover everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the point that a bank loan is repayable on demand. Therefore, a person who borrows money, even though he is in the red, has the right to see the statement of the bank's affairs.  If the bank were in such a position that it might of necessity have to call in its loans peremptorily, a borrower would like to know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>He might know it before he would get the statement of account. I should think that where a person has deposited securities as security for an overdraft, that person is a depositor of <Col N="1878" /> the bank and would be entitled to the statement.  I do not think we should oblige banks to give a copy of their statement to every customer.  There is a distinction, in principle, between the depositor and others.  In practice, it is likely that in order to comply with the section banks will supply a copy of their statement to every customer, if asked, but they should not be compelled to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe I am slightly ignorant about this but are deeds of securities, shares and so on, deposited in lieu of the accommodation given by a bank, considered a deposit?  I think that is what the Minister has said, that they are considered as a deposit and the owners would be looked upon as depositors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>There are different forms of deposit, if you like to use that word. The Minister would understand this better than I.  There are different ways in which the bank can hold securities for accommodation given, and with all the different ways that can come under the heading of a deposit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should think that whatever way the documents, or deeds of securities are deposited, whether by formal mortgage or by equitable deposit, in any such case the bank is, subject to its charge on the security, indebted to the person concerned for the documents lodged and would, in any statement of account, have to allow for these as liabilities which the bank have.  On that basis, these people would constitute creditors who would thereby be entitled to the statement envisaged in this section.</P>

      <P>I am not sure that the Minister's statement covers every type <Col N="1879" /> of transaction which comes by way of the bank lending money and receiving securities.  There are many different ways in which this may be done with a bank.  I am still wondering if all are covered by the Minister's statement.  I do not dispute that the Minister is telling me what he thinks is right.  I am just not sure yet whether what he has said covers every type of transaction in lending money to a customer whereby securities are held in different ways. The Minister is a lawyer and understands there are different methods by which a bank can hold securities.  Are they all covered here?  I am dubious about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that if there are cases which are not covered, at least they are covered in the sense that the bank will be obliged to display the statement on their premises.  They are not being completely excluded from all knowledge of the financial position of the bank.  Their security cannot be sequestered by the bank without due notice to them, on the basis of what has been a contractual obligation by the bank.  The section goes as far as possible to cover the situation which is aimed at the protection of people by information, and is, of course, going much further than the present provision.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may have been expecting me to comment on this section.  If one reads it, it can only be contrasted with section 11 which we were discussing last night and with the amendment which I proposed to section 11, which the Minister did not see fit to accept, that there should be recourse to the court.  I note in section 21 the provision &ldquo;where the bank is of opinion that the holder of a licence has become, or is likely to become, unable to meet his obligations to his creditors&rdquo;&mdash;and I would refer the Minister back to section 11 (f).  In other words, there is exactly the same determination here <Col N="1880" /> as we had in section 11 (f).  One of the findings of fact that the Minister referred last night was that the bank may direct in writing &ldquo;to the holder to suspend, for such period, not exceeding two months, as shall be specified in the direction, either or both of the following that is to say, the taking of deposits or the making of payments which have not been authorised by the Bank.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In other words, section 21 is a halfway house to section 11.  The licence would not be revoked, but the bank could direct the suspension of the taking of deposits or making of payments.  There is a remedy in the section of recourse to the court.  The holder of the licence to whom the direction is given under subsection (1) of this section may apply to the court for, and the court may grant, an order setting aside the direction. &ldquo;Court&rdquo;is defined as the &ldquo;High Court&rdquo; in the definition section.</P>
      <P>The bank may apply to the court and the court may, in addition to making an order make any other order as may appear to it to be necessary.  The court is given the discretion in relation to this direction on the basis of the finding which is identical to the finding in paragraph (f).  I should like to ask the Minister very seriously arising out of this why he has seen fit to give recourse to the court here, why he is adamant in his refusal to do so in the more serious circumstance of revoking a licence for identical reasons under section 11 and whether he would reconsider the position.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to have to disagree with Senator Robinson's statement. I do not think the two situations are the same.  Section 11 deals with the issuing of a licence and where a licence was rejected and Senator Robinson at that stage wanted to have the ultimate resort to the High Court.  This involved two points, as the Minister said.  One was the communication of confidential information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11 deals with the revocation of a licence.  The other matter arises later but for the reasons given in section 11 it is identical to the reason in section 21.  The point is he is not granting the revocation of the <Col N="1881" /> licence.  It is the second of the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Senator Robinson will recall that when I was dealing with section 11 I referred to the first eight grounds as being matters of fact and some of them at least would be determined by the court.  I specifically instanced this particular one as one where it was envisaged that the court would make the determination of fact. I specifically said that last night.</P>
      <P>The Senator may also recall that I said the phrase used here is one which is long known to banking law.  It is somewhat similar to the phrase used in relation to bankruptcy.  It is one on which the court makes the determination. It is essentially the same situation here.  The only point involved in what Senator Robinson has said, and she is confirming what I said last night, is that in this and some other cases there would be a judicial determination of the facts related to section 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>We seem to be at cross purposes here.  It is the bank which makes the determination.  Where the bank is of the opinion that the holder of a licence has become or is likely to become unable to meet his obligations to his creditors, the bank may give a direction.  It is only if the holder of the licence to whom the direction is given appeals to the court within the section, and I agree with this. But what I wanted to do in section 11 was precisely the same thing&mdash;that when the bank made that determination, to grant the right to appeal to the court. But it is not the court that makes that finding in the initial stages in section 21. It is the bank.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is analogous to a creditor filing a petition for bankruptcy on the grounds that the person or trader concerned is unable to pay his debts.  This is the statement that is made by the creditor.  But if the trader <Col N="1882" /> concerned knows he is unable to pay his debts he cannot do anything about it.  Then he lets this matter go and the statement by the creditor that he is unable to pay his debts goes unchallenged. It is very much analogous to the situation in which, if the Central Bank is of opinion that the holder of a licence has become, or is likely to become, unable to meet his obligations, the bank gives the direction in writing. If the holder of the licence accepts that that is so and he cannot do anything about it, I presume he will do nothing else.  But if he does not accept this, then he will contest it in the court.  What will then happen will be that there will be a judicial determination as to whether he was unable to meet his obligations.  The failure by the licence holder to take any action in regard to such a direction by the Central Bank would be accepted by any court as clear evidence of the fact that he was unable to meet his obligations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point in support of Senator Robinson's contention is that section 11, paragraph (f), is one of the reasons under which the bank may, with the consent of the Minister, revoke a licence and it reads:</P>
      <P>if the holder becomes unable to meet his obligations to his creditors or suspends payments lawfully due by him.</P>
      <P>The wording in section 21, subsection (1) reads:</P>
      <P>Where the Bank is of opinion that the holder of a licence has become, or is likely to become, unable to meet his obligations to his creditors, the Bank may give a direction in writing to the holder to suspend, for such period, not exceeding two months, as shall be specified in the direction, either or both of the following, that is to say, the taking of deposits or the making of payments which have not been authorised by the bank.</P>
      <P>In the first case there is no recourse to the High Court; in the second case there is.  Surely there is an analogy here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, if I may refer back to section 11, subsection (1) paragraph (f) which reads: <Col N="1883" /> if the holder becomes unable to meet his obligations to his creditors or suspends payments lawfully due by him.</P>
      <P>In section 21 we are talking about &ldquo;where the Bank is of opinion that the holder has become or is likely to become&rdquo;.  We are talking about the Banks' opinion.  In section 11 we are talking about &ldquo;where the holder becomes unable to meet his obligations.&rdquo; What is envisaged there is, as I have indicated, that there has been, in fact, a determination that he was unable to meet his obligations but in section 21 we are talking about &ldquo;where the Bank is of opinion that&rdquo;.  There is a distinction here.  In section 21 &ldquo;the Bank is of opinion&rdquo; but the person may contest this in court.  What is envisaged under section 11 (1) (f) is that &ldquo;he has become unable to meet his obligations&rdquo; and such a determination has, in fact, been made.  There is a substantial distinction between the two situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Should section 21 not come first?  The Bank's opinion is that he cannot fulfil his obligations to his creditor.  It suspends his operations for two months.  The licensee concerned can appeal to the courts.  If, in the final analysis, the courts decide he is unable to meet his obligations section 11 presumably then comes into operation. The Bank then may, with the consent of the Minister, revoke his licence but only after the courts have decided that he cannot meet his obligations.  In fact, the courts do play a part in deciding whether or not he can fulfil his obligations. They do decide it as a matter of law.  Is that not correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to that particular ground for the revocation of a licence, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House on this as I think we are not going to reach agreement on it. Take the last paragraph (i)&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>if, since the grant of the licence, the circumstances relevant to the grant have changed and are such <Col N="1884" /> that, if an application for a licence were made in the changed circumstances, it would be refused.</P>
    <P>It would be the opinion of the Bank that this was so and the Bank would probably be in a good position to have an informed opinion on it, but the person might like to dispute it in the court; similarly if the holder is convicted on indictment of an offence under any provision of this Act or an offence involving fraud, dishonesty or breach of trust.  That is not purely a matter of fact.  There might be quite a difference of opinion as to whether a person had been convicted of an offence involving dishonesty or breach of trust and the person might like to contest that in the High Court.  I still submit that section 21 procedure and machinery is a halfway house to revocation and that in that circumstance a person has the right of appeal to the court but in the case of revocation a person does not have a statutory right to appeal to the court and that is regrettable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Under subsection (3) the holder of a licence has the right to apply to the court to satisfy the direction suspending his operations for two months.  What happens during that hiatus?  There will be a period during which the court has got to sit and adjudicate on his appeal.  Is the bank open or closed at that stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on a number of factors here, including the nature of the banking business.  What is envisaged in subsection (1) is that there would be a suspension of the taking of deposits or the making of payments which had not been authorised by the bank.  That does not necessarily mean a complete closure by the licence holder, although it could mean that.</P>

      <Col N="1886" /> SECTION 24.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 24 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dissatisfied with the powers of the bank under section 24. The section appears to give power to the bank.  It states:</P>
      <P>...that it is expedient so to do, the Bank may, with the consent of the Minister, make regulations requiring every holder of a licence to make with the Bank, in addition to the deposit under section 7 of this Act, a deposit (not bearing interest) of an amount specified in the regulations or calculated in a manner specified in the regulations if and whenever after a date specified in the regulations the assets of the holder within the State fall below such proportion in relation to his liabilities within the State as is specified in the regulations, and to maintain such deposit so long as such assets are below the said specified proportion.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances there would be a requirement to maintain a deposit in the bank, in addition to the deposit under section 7, and this deposit would not bear interest.  What I am not satisfied with then is subsection (2):</P>
      <P>Regulations made under this section may prescribe different requirements in respect of different holders of licences.</P>
      <P>I would submit that it might well be construed that to make a deposit without interest is in some way almost a confiscation of property.  The deposit is not bearing any interest, therefore it is penal in that sense.  To be able to do so by regulation which particularises between applicants for licences would seem to me to be discriminatory.  It would be possible for the Bank's regulations to require a particular banking concern to make a very large deposit without interest.  This could be challenged on the basis that it was a discriminatory deprivation of property in the sense that property would be the interest-bearing possibilities of that amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1887" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a re-enactment of a power already available in section 50 of the Central Bank Act, 1942.  The fact that it provides for deposits which would not bear interest makes it clear that it is intended to be a provision of a penal nature.  The power has not in fact been used so far, but what was envisaged when it was originally introduced was to provide a means of inducing the associated banks to repatriate some of their external assets for investment at home.  As I say, the power has not had to be used but it is a power which could well be of importance at some time in the future in relation to some possible holders of banking licences.  As regards subsection (2) prescribing different requirements in respect of different holders of licences, this would of course have to comply with the rulings of the Supreme Court in regard to the classes of licence holders who would be affected.  But clearly the operation of a penal clause should be confined to people who ought to be penalised and not, because some people ought to be penalised, applied to everybody.  It would not be reasonable to provide that any operation of this section would apply to all holders of licences.  That could not be justified.</P>

If he were running into difficulties and the proportion of his assets were not correct they would be less likely to become correct by introducing the penal clauses of section 24.</P>

It would not seem to me, in the kind of situation he envisages, that the operation of this section would improve it. On the contrary, I think it would make it worse.  I think we may take it that it would not be improved if this section were operated in that kind of situation. There are other remedies available to the bank under other sections, but I would not visualise the operation of this section in circumstances in which a licence holder was in financial difficulty.</P>

      <P>It is not envisaged that the Central Bank as such would operate as a clearing house.  It may be that what the Senator has in mind is section 25, which gives powers to the bank in respect of the clearance of cheques between banks.  It is not envisaged that the Central Bank itself will act as a clearing house.  By its regulations it could apply certain conditions relating to the clearing of cheques.  It could be a condition of the granting of a banking licence that a licence holder would participate in clearance of cheques on certain conditions. This is certainly a possibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I am in a difficulty because I am speaking from abysmal ignorance of the topic.  I had understood that one of the purposes of the Bill, and one of the provisions which was welcomed very much by the non-associated banks, was the fact that the Central Bank would now be in a position to operate as the central clearing house for all cheques because of the fact that heretofore the clearing house had been operated by those banks which are members of the Irish Banks Standing Committee.  We had a situation which existed for a long time last year whereby the members of the Irish Banks Standing Committee engaged in an industrial dispute with their employees and caused what some people may prefer to call a strike but which I call a lock-out, and in the process of which they closed the clearing house, which meant that the financial affairs, not only of their own companies but also of the non-associated banks, were seriously interfered with.  The clearance of non-associated bank cheques did not take place for as long as the dispute lasted.  There is also the situation in which the clearing house, which in effect is a private company operated by the Irish Banks Standing Committee for their own benefit, charge a commission rate of 5p per cheque for clearance of cheques from banks which are not members of the Standing Committee.  I have been given to understand that those other banks were very anxious to see this situation done away with.  If the facts as I have outlined them are correct, surely that is understandable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what the Senator has in mind is substantially correct, except that the Central Bank as such will not operate a clearing system. What is being provided is that it will no longer be possible for a member of the Banks Standing Committee, or indeed any other bank, to refuse clearing facilities to other licence holders or to the trustee savings banks, provided that the instruments are presented by its own customers.  In addition, we are providing for the supervision of the charges for this service by the Central Bank to avoid any exorbitant charges. This is, I think, meeting the point that Senator Boland mentioned.  The only <Col N="1890" /> difference is that the Central Bank itself will not be operating the clearing system but will rather be supervising it.</P>

      <P>Is this situation to continue whereby this private company is operated by a group of licence holders in the country over which the other licence holders have no control?  I appreciate that the Central Bank will endeavour to represent their interests there.  As the Minister has outlined the situation now, the obligation would be upon the licence holder, and in this case, presumably, the clearance house, to clear a cheque provided it was presented by one of its own customers.</P>
      <P>What would be the situation with the clearing house as it exists if a cheque were drawn on one of the non-associated banks and made payable to a customer of another non-associated bank?  Would the clearing house in that case be entitled to refuse to handle the cheque?  What&mdash;and I think this is the most important part of it&mdash;would the situation be in the event of another maniacal decision by the members of the Irish Banks Standing Committee to engage in an industrial dispute as they have done several times in the past five or six years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Boland in the point he is making.  The position is at the moment that the non-associated banks feel that they are being discriminated against.  I understand that they have made submissions to the Minister that the Central Bank should assume a statutory obligation to ensure fair competition and fair arrangements between all the banks who are licensed to operate within the State.  That is a fair request and it would be necessary and desirable that the Minister would ensure that such conditions obtained in the State. I am not in a position to say whether or not the submission of the non-associated banks is correct or if they have been operating at a disadvantage.  They say they have and if that is so this gives the Minister an opportunity, through the Central Bank, to ensure fair and free competition between all the banks who have been licensed or who will be licensed to operate in the State.  That <Col N="1891" /> is what the non-associated banks are seeking to achieve and I consider it a fair request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely what we are doing in this section.  We are ensuring that it will no longer be possible for a member of the Irish Banks Standing Committee, or any other bank, to refuse clearing facilities to other licence holders, provided that the cheques are presented by the bank's own customers.  In addition, we are giving the Central Bank supervisory power over the charges for the service provided by the clearing house.  We are, in this way, ensuring full and free competition under the supervision of the Central Bank.  We are thereby meeting precisely the objections that have hitherto existed in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to labour the point, but surely the situation still obtains, in the event of there being another strike or lock-out, that the Banks Standing Committee would close down the operations of the clearing house.  By so doing they would seriously impede the operations of the non-associated banks which would still be open to their customers for business. They would find it extremely difficult to carry on the ordinary business of banking because of the unavailability of the clearing facilities which are provided by the clearing house.</P>
      <P>Presumably the non-associated banks would like to have a say in the management and control of the clearing house itself.  As things stand at the moment they cannot do this, because the clearing house is run by the standing committee members to the definite exclusion of the non-associated banks. I appreciate that the Central Bank will have control over the operation of the clearing house and I would hope that the suggestion, whereby the standing committee would charge 5p per cheque for clearance of non-associated bank cheques, will be one of the first matters on which attention will be focused.  That still does not overcome the situation where the clearing house will be closed in the event of the standing committee deciding to close their banks during industrial action.</P>

    <Col N="1892" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Boland is quite right in this.  The Central Bank will control the terms under which clearings between the banks will take place but it does not control the actual operation of the clearing arrangements. As Senator Boland has said we cannot tell it to stay open.  It merely controls the operations and the terms under which the clearing house arrangements will operate but it does not exercise complete control over the opening or closing of the clearing house.  That is as I understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, no clearing system can operate if the banks are closed because the transactions concerned cannot be debited and credited and value given.  It should be understood that the clearing system at present is a separate company.  Even if it were controlled by the Central Bank there could be an industrial dispute there. There can be no safeguard against an industrial dispute.  That is the first thing one has to realise.  All of the right is not on the side of the non-associated banks in this case.  We ought to be clear on this.  There is a certain amount of right but, in all fairness to the associated banks, it should be said that the associated banks have branches throughout the country which enable them to provide a clearing system. A non-associated bank which establishes itself with one branch in Dublin and which wishes to utilise the benefits of the whole system should have to pay a great deal more for it than the banks that are providing this service all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is at this juncture that the Central Bank comes in to determine what is a reasonable charge having regard to both of these factors.  It is the duty of the Central Bank to do so and they have the expertise to decide that.  I am saying that because the tenor of the discussion on this section has tended to give the impression of being very much anti-associated banks.  I want to make it clear that there are two sides to this story.  I repeat that in the event of a closure of the banks there cannot be a clearing system.  Of course, there is no reason why, if the associated banks are closed, the non-associated banks should <Col N="1893" /> not operate a clearing system between themselves.  There is nothing to prevent them from doing so.  However, I do not think this would provide any great relief for the customers because the numbers of non-associated banks, their location and the extent of their operations would not be such as to provide any substantial relief for the ordinary bank customers in a situation like that. On the other hand, if banks are closed down no clearing system can operate in relation to those banks which are closed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is accepted.  There is just one remark I should like to refute, and I am sure Senator Boland will agree with me here.  There is no question of any anti-associated bank trend in any submission I have made. We have been dealing with the banks in this country for too many years now not to appreciate the service they are giving to the community.  The point I was endeavouring to make was that if you give a licence to a statutory body to operate a banking system they should be allowed to operate on a par with their competitors.  The Minister made the valid point that the associated banks operate branches throughout the country&mdash;in fact some of them operate too many branches because many of them were established in conditions which are far different from present-day conditions&mdash;but it should also be pointed out that the non-associated banks are prohibited from opening branches.  Therefore, they cannot offer the same facilities.  I accept the Minister's point in that regard.  I want to place emphasis on the fact that there is no question of any anti-associated bank tenor in anything that I have said.  I am sure the same can be said of Senator Boland's contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister was referring to my remarks because I have a tendency to be critical of people who, I feel, are operating in monopoly circumstances.  As the Minister has pointed out, the clearing house is a separate company but, rightly or wrongly, I am led to believe that it is a separate company owned by those companies who form the Irish Banks Standing Committee.  That being the <Col N="1894" /> case, the licence holders who are not members of the Irish Banks Standing Committee are forced to use the services of this company but they are actually using the services being provided by the associated banks.  If the associated banks enter into an industrial dispute that company is affected and the whole system stops because that company is really an arm of the Irish Banks Standing Committee which was set up originally to provide exchange facilities between the branches of their own banks.</P>
      <P>We now have a very different set of circumstances in which there are a very small number of non-associated banks here.  As Senator Russell has pointed out, this is a smaller number than the non-associated would wish.  I understand that there are moves in that direction in the southern part of the country.  The situation is that the non-associated banks would like to see one or other of two things happening. Either they would wish to be allowed to become part-owners or directors of the company which runs the clearing house, or&mdash;and I think this is the reason why they were clapping themselves on the back&mdash;they would like the Central Bank itself to operate clearing house facilities, so that in the event of an industrial dispute closing down some of the banks in the country, the Central Bank would still operate clearing facilities for those banks which remained open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point which, in fairness, ought to be remembered in this case.  A great number of people and business firms suffered grievously in that last long industrial dispute.  Perhaps this is part of the reasons for my unkind remarks about the Irish Banks Standing Committee members.  However, a great number of companies and individuals were only able to continue in financial existence because of the fact that there were non-associated banks operating.  It is as well to realise that they were operating in extremely difficult circumstances because they were not effectively able to clear between themselves, because the clearing house was closed.  They do not want to see this happen again.  Unfortunately, with the best will in the world, as the <Col N="1895" /> Minister has explained the section and its provisions, the section will not provide the Central Bank with the power to ensure that some form of clearing facilities still take place in the event of the Irish Banks Standing Committee members closing their doors to the public again.  I should like the Minister to look again carefully at the point.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Sections 27 to 30, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 31.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 31 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the duties of a holder of a licence on termination of banking business.  Subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>(1)  Where a holder of a licence ceases in circumstances other than those specified in paragraphs (a) to (d) of section 30 of this Act to carry on banking business, he shall, as soon as may be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>I wonder what that is intended to convey.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;notify all persons having deposits (including deposits on current accounts) with him of such cesser and he shall, if any such person so demands, pay to that person forthwith the amount of his deposit together with the amount of any interest accrued thereon.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to explain what that terminology means: &ldquo;as soon as may be.&rdquo;  To my mind, that leaves it very wide open, if a person is going to cease business and must notify his depositors.  Subsection (2) of the same section, says:</P>
      <P>Where a holder of a licence proposes to cease carrying on banking business, he shall notify the Bank in writing of the proposal not less than three months before the date of the cesser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What about notifying his staff or the staffs of the bank?  Is there any provision <Col N="1896" /> made for that?  There certainly is not in this section.  I was wondering if there is any other section.  Everybody seems to know that the bank is going to cease business except the people employed in the bank.  I should like to suggest very strongly to the Minister that some provision should be made for notifying the staffs, if such cessation of business was to arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the phrase &ldquo;as soon as may be,&rdquo; that can be interpreted as meaning &ldquo;as soon as reasonably possible.&rdquo;  In other words, on the one hand, any undue delay would not be complying with it, especially in the sense of operating to the detriment of customers of the bank.  On the other hand, it could not be reasonably required that immediately, that is, within an hour of closedown, action would be taken.  In any case of dispute it would be a matter of interpretation by the courts.  These would be the two extremes that the court would take into account and it would decide that compliance with the section lay in between these two extremes.</P>
      <P>In regard to the notification of the staff concerned, this is strictly speaking a matter for another Bill rather than this.  I cannot honestly visualise, in practice, a situation in which a bank is closing down, has given three months' notice to the Central Bank, in which it has to prepare notices to go to its customers, and in which the staff would not know about this.  Even assuming that there was no approach by the management of the bank to the staff to discuss this, which would be the normal course, I cannot imagine its being kept a secret in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think that &ldquo;as soon as reasonably possible&rdquo; should be included in the Bill, because provision is made elsewhere in connection with the transfer of the business of one bank to another? In that case there is provision in section 38 for the transfer of officers, clerks and servants.  It is considered desirable to make provisions for the transfer of officers, clerks and servants in section 38.  It would be a rather strange situation if the bank staffs and their unions <Col N="1897" /> were not aware of their pending closure. I wonder if it should not be written into the Bill?  If you make provision for the situation arising out of the transfer of one bank's business to another, should you not make similar provision in regard to the staffs where a bank intends to cease trading?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are providing here for a bank ceasing to trade for reasons other than bankruptcy or winding up. In other words, they would be repaying all their creditors in full.  I cannot see in such circumstances the staff being left uninformed, or, indeed, specific arrangements not being made in respect of the staff for either transfer or redundancy payment.  It is inconceivable to me that it could happen in such circumstances. I am not sure that it is relevant to this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not thinking so much of a bank that has been operating perhaps for some years in the country, with local connections as of some outside individual or corporation who, having secured a licence, decided, after a while, to pack it up.  Under this section they just give three months' notice, pay their creditors, collect their debts and off they go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wondering if subsection (1), (a), (b) and (c) are in the right order?  These all deal with the transfer of banks.  Subsections (a), (b) and (c) state:</P>
      <P>(a) the transferor and transferee may, not less than four months before the date on which the transfer is intended to take effect (in this Part referred to as the transfer date), submit to the Minister for his approval a scheme for the transfer,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) the transferor and transferee shall, not less than one month before the transfer date, publish notice of <Col N="1898" /> the transfer in at least one daily newspaper published in the State,</P>
    <P>(c) the Minister, after consultation with the Bank, may, not less than two months before the transfer date, either approve of or decline to approve of the scheme by order,</P>
    <P>Should not paragraph (c) precede (b)? The first thing is that he may submit to the Minister &ldquo;not less than four months&rdquo;.  The Minister then &ldquo;after consultation with the Bank&rdquo; should surely come next with his &ldquo;not less than two months before the transfer date&rdquo; The final thing should be the &ldquo;month' notice that the transfer will take place published in at least one daily newspaper&rdquo;. It seems to me that they could publish the notice before the Minister's two months are up during which he consults with the Bank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is purely a matter of drafting.  I think the reason is that subsections (a) and (b) refer to actions taken or to be taken by the transferor and transferee.  Subsection (c) refers to action to be taken by the Minister.  In view of the fact that the time limits are set out, I do not think that there can be any difficulty or confusion about it.  I do not think that is what the Senator is suggesting.  He is merely talking about tidy drafting.  If he looks at it on the basis of putting together the duties of transferor and transferee, on the one hand, and those of the Minister, on the other hand, he will find that it is tidy enough from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>As it reads, they can publish their notice not less than one month and then a month later the Minister can come along and decline to approve of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because all of these time limits are related to the transfer date.  Under subsection (b) the notice shall be published &ldquo;not less than one month before the transfer date&rdquo;.  Subsection (c), which relates to the Minister approving or declining to approve says he must do it &ldquo;not less than two months before the transfer date&rdquo;. There is not any connection between (b) and (c) in the sense that (c) can only take place when (b) has taken <Col N="1899" /> place.  That is not what the section says.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>There does not appear to be any provision for giving notice to the staff or providing any consultation with the staff before a transfer takes place.  I know that the provision is made for the staff that the terms and conditions of their prospective jobs will be safeguarded and will be the same under the new ownership, but there seems to be no provision here as to when there will be prior notice or prior consultation with the staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I think this is a matter of good industrial relations practice and also is something that I cannot envisage being omitted.  In this section we are dealing with the basic rights which must be given to the staff in any such transfer.  This does not preclude consultations and negotiations whereby rights superior to those laid down here are given to the staff or certain sections of the staff.</P>
      <P>What we are doing here is providing the basic minimum right of the staff in any such event.  I do not think that we can hope to lay down here the precise procedures and the precise terms to be followed and given, so this could well be the result of negotiations which might take place between the staff and the management in circumstances of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think that the staff are not entitled to notice that there will be a change of employer? Their conditions are safeguarded, but there is no provision for telling them that they will have a new employer after a certain period.  I feel that in common justice they are entitled to that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the usual practice nowadays, as the Minister will agree, that if there will be some change in administration of a business the staff are brought in <Col N="1900" /> and it is discussed with them.  The advantages of the change are pointed out to them together with the disadvantages. In this particular case a change could take place without the staff getting any prior notice or any reasons being put forward as to why a transfer was taking place.</P>
    <P>In this day and age the broader the consultation is, not only between directors of respective companies but also between the staff of the companies concerned, the better, and I am sure the Minister would agree with that.  The Minister's answer probably will be, if I can anticipate him, that he could not imagine this thing happening without their unions, if necessary, entering into discussion with the owners of the transferor company and the transferee company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Russell's description of the normal procedure in this case is correct.  I shall go further by saying that I think the management of any bank which proposed to have their staff transferred to another bank without notice and consultation with their staff would be very unwise.  They certainly would not last long in business if they tried to do such a thing.  It is inconceivable that any bank management, be they an old established or even a newly established bank, could do a thing like that without consulting the staff.</P>
      <P>I do not think any staff would accept it.  Therefore, the management would be simply creating enormous problems for themselves if they failed to do so. Most managements nowadays are sufficiently enlightened in their own self-interest not to make that kind of mistake.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 39 to 42, inclusive agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 43.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 43 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most significant sections in the Bill and one that has had a great deal of publicity <Col N="1901" /> and which received quite a lot of discussion in the other House.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the speech made by the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary when he introduced this Bill to the Seanad a few days ago.  What he said is relevant to what I propose to say on this section.  I quote from his speech:</P>
      <P>The 1942 Act also gave the Central Bank the general function and duty of taking such steps as it deems advisable from time to time to safeguard the integrity of our currency and ensure that in the regulation of credit the aim shall be the welfare of the whole community.</P>
      <P>That sentence was repeated later on in his speech.  When he came to consider Part IV of the Bill, and specifically section 43, he went on to explain the purposes of the section.  He said:</P>
      <P>There has been some misunderstanding of this provision.  What is intended is solely a technical change. The existing position is that the 1927 Currency Act established a fixed parity between the Irish pound and the pound sterling.  Under this provision, the exchange value of the Irish pound, while remaining the same as against sterling, automatically follows changes in the value of sterling, <i>vis-á-vis</i> other currencies.</P>
      <P>This position is inconsistent with the obligations arising from our membership of the International Monetary Fund.  At a later stage in his speech he goes on to say:</P>
      <P>The present Bill will remove the contradiction between that Act and the 1927 Currency Act.  As I have already made clear, the question of devaluation of our currency in relation to sterling does not arise.  The Government have no intention whatsoever of changing the existing parity with sterling and the policies we are committed to following will ensure that no such eventuality will arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest with all due respect to the Minister that, if the Government are so emphatic that the situation will <Col N="1902" /> not arise where there will be any change in the parity between the Irish pound and sterling, then it is unnecessary to include this provision in the Bill.  There have been, from time to time, suggestions that we should change the parity of the Irish pound and some years ago there could have been strong argument advanced in favour of this. But with the development of our trade with Great Britain over the intervening years, nobody can envisage that in the years ahead the bulk of the trade of this country will go otherwise than to the sterling area, particularly to Great Britain.  Any doubts there might be about a possible devaluation, or possible change in the parity between the Irish pound and sterling in the future, would be removed if this section were removed from the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister may correct me if I am wrong, but as I see it there is nothing to prevent the Oireachtas, as such, passing an Act at any time if it should be found necessary in the national interest and in the interest of the community as a whole to vary the parity of the Irish pound with sterling.  Returning again to the words of the Parliamentary Secretary, this Bill has been drafted with the interests of the community very much in the forefront of the Government's mind.  I should think the representatives of all the people, that is the Members of the Dáil and the Seanad, should decide if an important step such as this should be taken.  It should not be left to the Government of the day, who may be in office by a small majority.  A drastic step like this should be one which only the Dáil and Seanad should decide by majority vote.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I am not enamoured by the reason given in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech: that it is purely a technical matter.  If we did not write this into the Bill, would it make any fundamental difference?  In view of the Government's emphatic assurance, and I accept this, that no change in the parity of the Irish pound and sterling is visualised either now or in the future, and that the Government are committed to following policies that will ensure there will be no change, I do not see the reason for writing this in.  It gives a <Col N="1903" /> sense of uneasiness; and in our very open economy nothing should be written into the laws of the land which might suggest, in any way, that we were departing from a well-established precedent in regard to our currency.</P>
    <P>While I do not completely rule out in the years ahead, because nobody can attempt to see into the future, the possible necessity of a change in parity, that change should be left to the Oireachtas to decide and to put into effect.  I do not wish to talk too much about the Partition issue but anything that would suggest that we were moving away from the practice in the North of Ireland would be an undesirable step. That would not prevent me from making a change if a change were necessary. The point I wish to make to the Minister is that, in view of the Government's very adamant attitude to any possibility of a change in the years ahead, this section, to my mind, is unnecessary.  It should be excluded from the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are, of course, no grounds for unease arising out of this section other than such as might be created by persons who are either mischievous or ill-informed.  There have been some such attempts by people outside this House.  If I thought there were any serious misgivings, I would certainly delete this section.  There are just a few fringe situations which have arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some doubtful things have happened in this connection.  A certain magazine devoted a whole issue recently to the alleged devaluation of the Irish pound and suggested ways in which this could be dealt with.  One of the ways suggested was to buy silver bullion.  They had an advertisement to that effect. Investigations I made showed that the company offering to sell it was owned partially by the editor of the magazine. This sort of thing is really not worth talking about.  The reason for this section is, as the Parliamentary Secretary stated, a technical one.  There is at present a conflict between section 47 (2) of the Currency Act, 1927, on the one hand, and the Bretton Woods Agreement Act, which was passed in 1957. The 1927 Act has provisions which <Col N="1904" /> make it mandatory on the Central Bank to issue Irish legal tender notes to the same nominal value as British notes presented to them, which maintains a continuing parity with sterling.  Other provisions of section 47 of the Act also have the effect of maintaining the same parity, in that, while they give a permissive authority to the Central Bank to issue legal tender notes, the notes must be issued on the basis of parity with sterling&mdash;for example, the issue of notes to an associated bank against payment in a sterling draft.  In this way, the 1927 Act requires us to change the value of the Irish pound in line with changes in sterling.  That is the effect of the 1927 Act.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, our membership of the International Monetary Fund obliges us to consult with the Fund before making any change in the par value of our £.  The Fund's consent is required to any change.  Our obligations to the International Monetary Fund are as set out in article 4 of the Fund's articles of agreement in sections 1, 5 (a) and 5 (b).  Acceptance of these obligations was approved by the Bretton Woods Agreement Act, 1957.</P>
    <P>In this way there is a conflict between the Currency Act, 1927, on the one hand and the Bretton Woods Agreement Act, 1957, on the other.  Section 43 is designed to remove this conflict.  That is its sole purpose.  It is purely a technical legal matter.  We lived without it before.  We could live without it again and go on with the conflict in our law.</P>
    <P>This is what I would wish to do if I thought that there was any danger whatever but I am quite satisfied that it is now fully understood by everybody who wishes to understand and those who count that there is no question whatsoever of any devaluation of our £ and that this is purely a technical operation to remove this conflict between two of our laws.  That is all that is involved, nothing else.</P>
    <P>In addition to that it is, of course, normal that a sovereign State should have the right to be able to propose changes in the par value of its currency and not have it tied to that of another currency.  This is purely a theoretical point.  The primary problem we have is a technical one that there is a conflict <Col N="1905" /> between the 1927 and the 1957 Acts. There is no other reason for this section.</P>

      <P>I should like to assure the Minister, firstly, that I was not trying to be in any way mischievous and, secondly, I did not read the article he referred to, which I gather was more in favour of my point of view than against it.  The Minister in his reply said that we could, in fact, continue as we are.  Ministers of Finance and Chancellors of the Exchequer have made very emphatic statements from time to time, as we recall, but we will not always have the same Minister.  One does not know what the future holds.  I would rather leave it not to the Government but to the Houses of the Oireachtas to make any change, if such a change is desirable. I do not set my mind against a change.</P>
      <P>The Minister said this is purely a technical adjustment to bring us in line with our obligations to the International Monetary Fund.  I accept the Minister's word on that, but I wish to reiterate my point of view that I would feel happier in my own mind if any change was to be projected that it would be brought about by a majority vote in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It will not happen in this case.  It is the Minister of the day, whoever he happens to be, who will decide it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words in support of the Minister and this section.  Much of the criticism of this section I fail to understand and indeed it seems to be in many ways ironical.  I regard it as an important part of the sovereignty of a state that the state has the power to establish the value of its currency.  In the same way I regard it as an important part of the role of Government to be able to make decisions in this respect.  I disagree with Senator Russell that this could ever be a matter of legislation. Speaking as a layman, it seems to me that anyone looking at a situation in any country where a change of value of currency has been involved, will see that it has had to be a matter of instant Government decision in complete confidence.  The complications which could arise if it were a matter for <Col N="1906" /> legislation would completely defeat the purpose.</P>
      <P>May I also say that I am confident about the Minister's assurances regarding our views on this currency matter. Indeed, it seems that our whole attitude towards entry into Europe shows that we are committed to maintaining the value of our currency.  Another irony in this situation is that the very people who are anti our entry to the EEC are those who are critical of our attitude towards sovereignty and our attitude towards economic matters generally.  It seems that a situation in which we might be fighting a severe economic battle would be if our application to enter Europe should be unsuccessful. and Britain's application successful. Yet the very people who talk, using change in value of currency as an economic weapon, are those who are running the anti-Common Market campaign.</P>
      <P>On every count I am fully behind the Minister and fully support the provisions of this section.  It is a matter of importance where sovereignty is concerned. It is important that the Government's attitude should be supported in this.  Our economic policy shows our commitment to maintaining the value of our currency and the arguments put forward in this House and elsewhere for leaving the existing situation do not hold water at all.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 53 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke on the Second Stage of the Bill about the composition of the Central Bank.  I am not too happy about it.  The Minister spoke of the expertise which the Central Bank would provide for the important tasks <Col N="1907" /> which they would be charged with in regard to the orderly arrangements of the financial affairs of the country and the banking system.  This section proposes to reduce the number of representative directors from the associated banks from three to two, presumably due to the amalgamations that have taken place leaving just two groups of the associated banks, the Bank of Ireland Group and the Allied Irish Banks Group.  Six other directors will be appointed after consultation between the Minister and the Governor.</P>
      <P>I am not quite clear as to the procedure. Is the Governor appointed first, then consultations take place with him? Perhaps the Minister might answer that point in due course.  The point I want to make more strongly is that, if you give representation to the two associated banking groups, in all fairness representation should be given to the other banking interests in the country, such as the non-associated banks, trustee savings banks and other smaller bankers who would be operating under licence from the Central Bank.  If the Central Bank is to represent, control and properly regulate the banking system it should be either one of two things.  It should either be representative of the banking industry, giving all sectors fair representation, or else there should be no banking representatives on it.  It should be composed completely of people with the necessary expertise and experience in banking business outside of the banks altogether. I do not think the scales should be tipped in favour of one sector or other of the banking system.  There is a lot to be said for having no banking representatives on the board.  Possibly those who had been actively engaged in banking and were no longer bank directors should be on it, together with people from other sectors of the economy.  There could be people representing the industrial sector, the agricultural sector or the trade unions and the Department of Finance, economists and people of that kind.  In this way there would be a completely independent board to direct the banking affairs of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you start to give representation to <Col N="1908" /> the banking fraternity, then in equity all sections should be represented.  That may be the Minister's idea.  We do not get from this Bill any hint beyond the fact that the first two directors appointed will be&mdash;at least I assume they will be&mdash;one from each of the large associated banking groups.  But I do not know who the other six will be. Perhaps the Minister might enlighten us on that point.  What are the actual mechanics of the appointments?  First of all, at what stage is the Governor appointed and then at what stage does the Minister consult with the Governor about the other appointments?  Frankly, I am a little in the dark about that section of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Governor is appointed by the President, acting on the advice of the Government.  The other appointments require consultation with the Governor, which would imply that the Governor must be there before the other appointments can be made.  At the moment the non-banking directors represent the kinds of groups Senator Russell has mentioned.  For instance, industry, agriculture, the Department of Finance, are all represented on the Central Bank Board at the moment.  It may not be realised that the provisions of this section are reducing the banking representation on the Central Bank from three to two.  We are not starting to give representation to banks; they have had it all along.  What we are doing is reducing it.  I cannot say at this stage how the Central Bank will evolve and develop.  I am sure that it will evolve and develop and that this Bill is not the last word on the Central Bank, but I cannot say quite definitely yet in what direction.  I certainly would not rule out the possibility of excluding all representatives of commercial banks from the board of the Central Bank. This is a possibility that I could certainly conceive of, although I am not saying that it ultimately will happen because I am not yet sure.  We will have to see how this operates, how the whole system of banking develops in this country, because it is developing and changing quite fast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this question of the representation of the non-associated banks there are <Col N="1909" /> at least two good reasons, in my view, why this should not be done.  Firstly, they are a very diverse group and it is extremely doubtful if they could agree among themselves on one person to represent them because they have such divergent interests.  Even assuming that they could, it yet remains to be proved as to whether this would be a wise step. As of now the non-associated banks in the main are controlled from abroad, are recently arrived in this country, and their head office interests need not necessarily coincide with the interests of the economy of this country.  In those circumstances I do not think that the case is proved yet as to their right, if one might put it that way, to representation on the board of the Central Bank.  This again is something that could well develop in the future. As of now I do not think that a case for making that kind of appointment is sufficiently strong and I would prefer to await the further developments and evolution of the banking system before considering further any such step.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to specifically confine additional representation to the non-associated banks. I mentioned other banking interests, such as the trustees savings banks, which perform a very useful function, as the Minister will agree.  However, I accept his point.  It must evolve.</P>

      <P>It enjoys, and quite rightly, that immunity from takeover. In this day and age even the Bank of Ireland, which is an enormous institution by our standards, is quite a small one in comparison with financial institutions or banking institutions in other countries.  I understand that the same provision does not apply in relation to the Allied Irish Banks group. In this age of the massive takeover I should like to suggest strongly to the Minister that the provisions which relate to the Bank of Ireland should also relate to the Allied Irish Banks group and possibly to some other native banking groups.  There is a greater danger now than there has ever been before that institutions of all kinds&mdash; financial, industrial and, indeed, agricultural&mdash;are wide open to very attractive offers from very powerful interests, particularly outside this country.  We would need to be very wide awake to ensure that these essential institutions, which safeguard our sovereignty to a great degree, are not threatened by these takeovers.</P>
      <P>We are living in very extraordinary times.  The pace of the takeover and merger will increase and the units will tend to become even bigger and bigger, so that these supranational concerns will now be making more inroads into Europe.  This country will tend to offer a very attractive vehicle for entry into Europe if and when&mdash;and I think it is &ldquo;when&rdquo;&mdash;we join the European Economic Community.  I should like to suggest very strongly to the Minister that this is a point which deserves close consideration by him and by the Government. It is all very well to talk blandly about national sovereignty and all these beautiful phrases which are trotted out, not only in the Seanad but also outside.  Unless we protect our financial institutions, political sovereignty can mean very little in this day and age.</P>

      <P>I should like to <Col N="1912" /> support what Senator Russell has said in regard to the Allied Irish Banks and the other Irish banking concerns.  As he has said, political sovereignty is to a great extent dependent on our control as a State and as a Government over the financial institutions.  We know what is happening and what can happen to money.  I would urge the Minister to take an early look at this situation, particularly in relation to our possible commitment to the European Economic Community, because any situation that exists at the stage where we are committed to membership is a situation that we would not be in a position possibly to change.  Therefore, I would urge the Minister to take a look at that situation in relation to the associated banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to approach this topic in an apologetic sort of way because I have to speak very much as a layman on a very complicated and age-old profession.  It would be wrong if I were to allow the last Stage of this Bill, which is a Bill to make further provision in relation to banks and banking, including provision for the licensing and supervision of banks by the Central Bank, to be passed without going into some further detail on my remarks at an earlier Stage concerning the operation of the commercial associated banks in the country.  This Bill gives to the Central Bank in a clear way the power to issue licences and to revoke licences through section 11, subsection (1) (b), which states:</P>
      <P>The Bank may with the consent of the Minister revoke a licence if the holder fails or ceases to carry on banking business.</P>
      <P>We all remember the situation which existed in this country for an absolutely ridiculous length of time, whereby&mdash; and I speak as one without any vested interest&mdash;the ordinary people of the country were deprived of normal banking services because of a trade dispute between those operating the associated banks and their staff.  It was generally referred to as a strike.  In my opinion it was a lock-out on the part of the banks.  Whatever it may be called, it caused great hardship to the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1913" /> This Bill will give power to the Central Bank to step in in a situation like this.  Perhaps the Minister will let us know if he envisages the provisions of section 11 being used, in any future strike or industrial action by banks, be they the associated banks or any other banks, who may decide to withdraw their services for any internal reason of their own, to ensure that the strike will not continue for such a protracted length of time.  I am not, by any means, suggesting that the right to take industrial action either by employees or in certain cases by employers ought to be interfered with or removed.</P>
    <P>The banking service is basically a public service without which the economy and finances of the country cannot operate successfully.  I do not think it is good enough that certain private concerns can interfere seriously with the finances of the people of the country.  I am sure every Member of this House knows of cases where small firms have been obliged to close down with resultant great personal hardship because of the long industrial dispute that took place.</P>
    <P>There are many people in this country &mdash;and people who are now outside the country&mdash;who have cause to remember the bank strike of 1969 and 1970 and will remember it for a long time to come.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on whether he thinks the Central Bank in any similar future situation would be in a position to step in and, by whatever power it receives under this Bill, ensure that some type of adequate banking service will remain available.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken on a section which is related to this field, that is the operation of a clearing house.  I am not too happy with the situation as outlined by the Minister.  I would suggest that the position whereby certain banking interests are not represented in the clearing house company is not in the best interests of the public at a time when an industrial dispute might involve the clearing house and its facilities.  I would suggest to the Minister that he look again at section 25.</P>
    <P>I should be very grateful, at the risk of being boring, if the Minister would explain again to the House how he <Col N="1914" /> envisages section 25 operating and if he would say whether, in the event of a future strike involving the members of the Irish Banks Standing Committee, he envisages the Central Bank setting up a clearing house which would clear the cheques of the non-associated banks so that there might at least be a very limited exchange of cheques drawn on one non-associated bank and made payable to somebody who had an account in another of those banks.  That did not happen during the last bank strike.</P>
    <P>I am not clear on whether the Central Bank would have the power to set up such a clearing house if the necessity arose.  I am also not too clear on whether the Minister feels it would be desirable for the Central Bank to set up a clearing house in those circumstances.  If the Minister would give the House his views on that theme it would be of great interest to me and of interest to the general public who might not take too keen an interest in the Central Bank Bill in normal circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I want to mention which have been raised on this and other Stages of the Bill.  I undertook to have a look at a question that was raised about whether the operation of a credit account with the Tote came within the provisions of this Bill.  I am sure it does not, for two reasons.  Firstly, it would amount to a trade and secondly&mdash;and more importantly&mdash;the placing of a sum of money with the Tote by a customer for the purpose of keeping his account in credit does not constitute the making of a deposit in the sense implied here.  A deposit with a bank is generally regarded as being a sum of money entrusted to a banker subject only to the condition that an equivalent sum be repaid on demand or after an agreed period of notice.  It is not placed in consideration of the performance of a specific service or the supply of goods.  Therefore, I do not think that problem arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I omitted to mention to the House when we were passing section 51 that that section was introduced in this Bill although, strictly speaking, it relates to the Decimal Currency Act which the House passed, on foot of an undertaking <Col N="1915" /> which I gave here at that time.  There was a point raised which dealt with contracts, formal and informal, and I undertook if it appeared necessary, before the changeover period to full decimal currency, that I would take steps to deal with it.  We are not absolutely sure that it was necessary but, at any rate, it has been done in section 51 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the question of the Bank of Ireland as raised by Senator Russell.  The position is that the Bank of Ireland operates under certain Acts and a Charter and some of the provisions are quite archaic and operate quite unfairly to the Bank of Ireland as against its competitors. The object of section 51 is to place the stockholders in the Bank of Ireland in the same position as the shareholders of other banking companies with regard to the management of the bank's affairs and changes in its objects.</P>
    <P>There are restrictions on the stockholders to the extent that stockholders may vote only as individuals at a general court, that is at a general meeting of the bank, and they cannot vote by the size of the stock holdings as is usual in limited companies.  No banking company registered outside the State, which is a stockholder, or carrying on its principal business outside the State, may vote at a general court.  The Governor, Deputy Governor and at least three-fourths of the other directors must be domiciled and resident in the State.  The bank may not absorb any other bank without the prior written consent of the Minister for Finance and the bank may not be absorbed by any bank or other company.</P>
    <P>There are other restrictions which I shall not go into here but which make it rather difficult, if strictly adhered to, for the Bank of Ireland to compete with its competitors.  The effect of section 51 has been to remove these restrictions and to place the Bank of Ireland in the same position as other banks.  This may not be quite what Senator Russell had in mind when he was talking.</P>
    <P>However, I should like to remind him of the provisions of this Bill in regard to the granting and revocation of licences. I should also like to remind him that any <Col N="1916" /> approach that we have to make in regard to the takeover, and so on, of the banking system can really only be operated under this Bill.  There are restrictions on what we can do, but certainly the orderly and proper regulation of banking, which is the phrase used in this Bill, will be the criterion by which the Central Bank will have to operate.</P>
    <P>I do not think that at this stage I need to elaborate too much, but I should remind Senators that in the discussions we had on those sections I indicated that what was involved was, in some cases anyhow, a matter of policy and not a matter of law.  This was part of what I had in mind.  The whole question of the control and regulation of our banking system will now be very substantially in the hands of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Of course there has been a considerable evolution in the role of the Central Bank.  It has been a quiet evolution and one that I think has been quite effective.  Perhaps there are provisions in this Bill and there are powers given to the Central Bank which, if they had been proposed ten, 13 or 15 years ago, might have been regarded as revolutionary. However, they are now accepted because it is realised that it is not the object of the Central Bank or of the State to create havoc in our banking system.  Rather it is to regulate it in the interests of the community and to take powers which may never be exercised but which are there to ensure that in certain circumstances effective action can be taken to ensure that the banking system will operate for the benefit of our own community.</P>
    <P>There has been quite a development and this Bill represents a very substantial advance on what would have been thought possible not so many years ago.  However, I do not regard this Bill as the last word.  The whole system is evolving and it is certainly conceivable that in the lifetime of people here in this House there will be another Central Bank Bill, perhaps giving quite a different structure to the banking system in this country.  We must wait and see how it evolves.</P>

      <P>If I might interrupt the <Col N="1917" /> Minister for one moment, what he has said in no way precludes, as far as I can see, the Allied Irish Banks group being taken over on the grounds of anything that can be done in this Bill, provided that the new owners continue an orderly banking practice.  Is that true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true to say that the criteria which would be applied in any such cases would be such as are set out in this Bill.  I do not wish to elaborate too much on the manner in which it might be interpreted, but I should not exclude the possibility of control under the terms of this Bill being exercised in such circumstances on the grounds that the orderly and proper regulation of banking may in certain circumstances require us to ensure that, say, some very large international banking group would not control a half or more of our banking system.  I am just giving this as an example.  I certainly do not rule out the possibility of this Bill being operated for the purpose which Senator Russell envisages.</P>
      <P>Section 25 gives the Central Bank power to collect foreign cheques.  The Central Bank could have power to set up a clearing system; whether it should do so is quite another matter.  It should be realised that a clearing system is simply an extension of a bank's own activities.  In London, some banks clear cheques by simply walking every day, with the cheques to the other banks.  It could be by post or by computer.  The development of the computer may well abolish the whole clearing system.  The essential thing to realise is that in this Bill we are ensuring that any licence holder of a bank can participate in the clearing system.  We are also ensuring that the charges which will be made for availing of that service will be reasonable.</P>

    <P>However, in the circumstances in which all licence holders are participating in that way in the clearing system and in which, say, an industrial dispute takes place among the associated banks, there is nothing at all to prevent the other banks then remaining open from operating a clearing system as between themselves.  One should understand quite clearly that if the associated <Col N="1918" /> banks are closed, then no clearing system in relation to their banks can operate.  What we are talking about in those circumstances is a clearing system for other banks.  There is nothing whatsoever to prevent that being operated. Whether such banks would want such a system to operate is another matter; if they did, there is nothing here to prevent that happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I would think they would.  There is one final matter to which I should like to refer.  It arises out of something said by Senator Boland, but it has been said by many other people, too.  This is a comment on the industrial dispute in the banks. Many people are schizophrenic about this.  On the one hand, they accept that you can have industrial disputes; that workers have the right to strike or that employers have the right to lock out. That is part of our industrial system. On the other hand, they say that a banking system is essential to the community and should carry on in all circumstances.  These two things cannot be reconciled and we must face up to it.</P>
      <P>If the banking system must carry on in all circumstances, it can only be done by taking away the right to strike, and requiring, say, compulsory arbitration. I have not heard anybody advocate that, but let us recognise this dichotomy: if you are to accept the existing system of industrial relations, free collective bargaining that we have in this country, you cannot guarantee in all circumstances the continuance of a banking system.  We may do a great deal to improve the situation and to reduce the risk of a close-down.  By all means this should be done, and is being done.  However, let us not fool ourselves into thinking that we can guarantee a banking system in all circumstances and at the same time accept the system of free collective bargaining which exists here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Finance Bill the Minister has been unfair to the lower paid workers by virtue of section 2.  This is the only occasion during the last ten years when the Seanad have had an opportunity of amending the Finance Bill, because we have it at least a week or a fortnight before the other House adjourns for the summer recess. Therefore, I look forward to the Minister meeting some of the points we raise.</P>
      <P>With the present rate of inflation it is unfortunate that the Minister has seen fit to remove the concession that the people who are just within the income tax net enjoyed heretofore.  I wonder would the Minister consider reverting to the position that obtained prior to the introduction of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The category of workers that this will affect are the manual workers, especially those in areas where employment is difficult to be found.  The people who will be most adversely affected by this section are those we see cycling many miles to work to such places as Bord na Móna or other hard manual employment. If the Minister was seeking to collect a certain amount of money it would have been more equitable had he sought to get it at the other end of the income scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is the one that seeks to abolish the concession of having the first £100 of income charged at a lesser rate of tax.  The amazing thing about it is that section 2 of the Finance Bill, 1971, is seeking to abolish section 2 of the Finance Act, 1970.  Here was a provision that was introduced with a great fanfare of trumpets by the then Minister.  He, much more eloquently than I could, pointed out what a good provision this was and how much it would benefit the lower income groups because the first £100 of their income would be charged at so much lower a rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1920" /> Just a year later his successor comes along and takes away what was given last year.  One can be forgiven for wondering what section of the Finance Bill, 1971, will be cancelled by a similar section to this in the Finance Bill, 1972. It is an amazing way to run a Government, or to balance a Budget, or to produce the yearly main Finance Bill, to introduce a concession which was generally acclaimed one year and to remove it the following year and to justify the removal of it by pointing out that it was necessary in order to give the concessions that were given in the Budget.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that we are removing a concession of last year's Budget.  This does not seem to be a very efficient way to try to produce the annual Budget.  I should like the Minister to let us know how much money he estimates will be netted because of the cancelling of section 2 of the Finance Act, 1970; in other words, how much money will the Exchequer get by taking away the concession of charging the first £100 at the rate of 4s. in the £ tax.</P>
    <P>The physical task of re-gearing the system last year and the administrative cost of charging the first £100 of income at 4s must have been quite a considerable one, because the existing system was being changed to allow for this new provision.  Whatever that cost was, we surely will get at least an equivalent cost by removing it again and reverting to the old system.  I wonder if the Minister can, first of all, give us his estimate of how much money the implementation of section 2 will net for him, and secondly, if he could put any estimate on the administrative cost of introducing a concession last year, operating it for a year and cancelling it this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, let me make it clear that in the preparation of any Budget, there is no law, no moral obligation or no tradition or custom which inhibits the Minister for Finance from taking such action in relation to changes in the rate of taxation as appear to him to be the most appropriate in the light of the economic circumstances with which he is dealing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1921" /> Secondly, I have referred to the fact that the Budget this year was framed in a context in which it was necessary to reduce the rate of increase in Government expenditure to ensure that no action taken in the Budget would have any effect on the operation of the National Pay Agreement, and, at the same time, to provide reliefs in the sum of approximately £9 million.  Faced with this situation and having examined the various possibilities, it seemed to me that the most effective and appropriate way in which a substantial portion of that £9 million available and required for redistribution could be raised was as indicated in section 2 of this Bill.  Allowing for the concessions which were also introduced and which are dealt with in later sections, the net effect of section 2 and the other sections giving the concessions, will be to yield £5 million in the current year.  This is, of course, a substantial portion of the £9 million which is being redistributed.</P>
    <P>For the reasons which I have indicated, it was not possible to raise this money by means of indirect taxation. It would have been possible to raise it by increasing the standard rate of income tax but there were a number of objections to this.  One of these was that this would, of course, apply to companies whose rate of tax had already been increased last autumn from 50 per cent to 58 per cent.  Weighing all the circumstances together, this appeared to me to be the most appropriate way in which to do it.  I would remind the House that the impact of section 2 will be less than £12 per annum in the case of any taxpayer. Furthermore, it must be weighed in conjunction with the other concessions the effect of which is to remove from the tax net approximately 20,000 taxpayers and to reduce the income tax paid by approximately 40,000 taxpayers. I do not think it can be said, taking these sections together, which one must do to get the financial picture, that there is any great hardship being imposed on anybody.  Nevertheless, it provides for us the bulk of the revenue necessary for the various concessions announced in the Budget.</P>
    <P>To suggest that it could have been raised simply by increasing the rate of <Col N="1922" /> tax for people in the higher income group is quite unrealistic.  Unfortunately, we do not have enough people in the higher income group to make it possible to get that kind of money without an absolutely penal increase in the rate of tax which they pay, the effect of which would be to ensure that the yield went down instead of up. Having regard to the constraints which I have mentioned, this was the only way open to us, but, as I say, it has not operated to create any real hardship for anybody.  In those circumstances, I feel the section is deserving of the support of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>As anticipated by Senator Boland, I do not have a figure for the estimate of the cost of the administrative arrangements which were necessary.  I would remind Senator Boland again that the net yield estimated in the current year from this and the concessions being given in other sections, is £5 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is amazing when one remembers the arguments which were adduced last year by the Government for granting this concession, to hear the same Government now adducing arguments why the concession that was given last year should be abolished. There is obviously a great inconsistency in the arguments coming from the Government.  Last year the rate on the first £100 of taxable income was reduced from 7s to 4s., the Minister said £5 million would be collected.  In the Dáil he said £5½ million.</P>

      <P>£5½ million was the figure given in the Dáil.  I do not understand why within one year, there should be a complete change of attitude, a complete change of arguments.  According to his statement, the Minister is raising £5½ million, not £5 million.  In spite of what he states, the first £100 of taxable income affects the lower income group mostly.  The concession made last year was probably welcomed by most wage-earners. The Minister has stated how valid his arguments are.  I do not know if this is the best way to raise the money he is looking for; it may be the easiest <Col N="1923" /> way; it may require less administration; it may be less expensive to collect the money this way, but I am very dubious as to whether it is the most equitable way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think section 2 of this Bill is the most disappointing section in a disappointing Bill.  As other speakers have pointed out, it takes away a relief which was given only 12 months ago by another Minister for Finance.  If one went back on the record of the debates both in Dáil Éireann and in Seanad Éireann, one would find that there was quite an amount of backslapping and of congratulating the Minister who had given this relief on the first £100.  This section is relieving the lower income group of £12 per year which to the Minister, from his remarks a moment ago, appears to be a very small sum indeed.  We heard mention of &ldquo;it is only the cost of a packet of cigarettes per week.&rdquo;  But the cost of a packet of cigarettes per week means something in a pay packet.  What is the value of discussing the rights, wrongs, merits and demerits of this particular section when the people we are talking about are already having these deductions made from their pay packet under PAYE?  It is a mean provision to seek from the hardest working and lowest paid section of the community the £9 million that the Minister required to balance his Budget and to enable him to give the reliefs that were given can be described as going back on a promise made 12 months ago.  Surely there must have been some other way of doing it.</P>

      <P>The Minister was not the architect of the Finance Act, 1970, but a word with the then Minister would perhaps have elicited how it could have been done and how he could avoid, having given this concession to those people 12 months ago, taking it back now because he could not find another way of reimbursing the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is significant that the only suggestion we had as to how this <Col N="1924" /> money might have been raised was a casual remark by one Senator that it should have been raised from people in the higher income group.  I have already dealt with the unreality of that. Senators deliberately chose to ignore the circumstances in which this year's Budget was prepared and in which it was essential to avoid anything that would endanger the National Pay Agreement; that we succeeded in doing that in this year's Budget and, at the same time, we gave reasonable reliefs to the most necessitous members of the community.  One would think, listening to Senator J. Fitzgerald, that this concession was related solely to the lower paid.  It was not, of course; it relates to all taxpayers.</P>
      <P>Senator Belton referred to a statement I made in Dáil Éireann when I said the yield would be £5½ million. That is in a full year, but in the current year I said it was £5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to say that the considerations which operated in the Budget, and which I have outlined, were and are vitally important to the whole economic future of this country and of every person in it, to both the lower and the higher paid but, particularly, to the lower paid.  The signs are that the policy we are pursuing is beginning to pay off.  We need not have any sense of complacency about it, but the signs are there showing that we are on the right road.  One of the very important factors in this is that this Budget did not interfere with the National Pay Agreement.  This is far more important, particularly to the lower paid workers, than the fact that they will have to pay an additional tax of, in many cases, something under £12 a year.  It is more important to them that we should manage to win the battle against inflation than that they should have to pay less than £12 a year additional taxation.  In these circumstances, I suggest that anybody who gives any thought to this, and who tries to come up with an alternative method of raising this amount of money, will find straightaway that he is coming up <Col N="1925" /> against the problem I have outlined: whatever he suggests is either not going to yield the money or it will have repercussions, particularly on the National Pay Agreement, which could be far more costly than any additional tax imposition on the amount of money raised by the Exchequer as a result of section 2.</P>

      <P>I am in the same difficulty this afternoon as I was in this morning because I have risen only very slightly from the abysmal depths of my ignorance on financial matters having listened to the Minister and his colleagues speaking on the Central Bank Bill.  I wonder if the Minister would explain to the House what were the provisions which operated heretofore in relation to situations such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be noted that the provisions of this section are confined to cessations occurring on or after the 6th April, 1972.  That is the first thing to note.  This is an anti-avoidance measure.  At the moment, on the cessation of a trade or business, the last year and previous year of business are brought into account and the Revenue Commissioners may assess tax on the basis of the actual profits earned in those two years.  There are methods by which, under the existing law, certain arrangements can be contrived to bring a business to an end when there has been in one year a particularly large profit.  Arrangements can be so contrived as, in effect, to pay very much less tax than would normally be payable. The purpose of this section is to extend for another year the period over which the Revenue Commissioners may have a look at what the actual profits were and, if necessary, assess tax on the basis of the actual profits in those years.  The effect of this will be to make it more difficult at least to contrive a situation in which one avails of this to evade tax. The fact that it brings in the additional year makes it less easy for somebody to <Col N="1926" /> contrive this situation.  They may, of course, have the situation brought about purely by chance and one cannot object to that.  What we are trying to get at is the situation in which this was contrived.  We believe that adding on another year will make it far more difficult to contrive this form of avoidance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wondered whether it would be possible that, where a trade or profession ceased because they were not operating successfully and perhaps had returned a small profit in the last year of trading, by this adjustment the provisions would turn out to be more than had applied heretofore. What I envisaged was a situation in which the owner might have been in serious financial difficulties anyway and this was one of the reasons for ceasing and then he would find the tax demand completely inordinate.  Is it possible for such a thing to happen if the Revenue Commissioners want to operate it that way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not think so.  In circumstances in which a business is closing down because of financial difficulties one may take it that the profit is either non-existent or very small.  Of course, the Revenue Commissioners cannot charge tax on profits which have not been earned.  Therefore, the kind of situation which Senator Boland envisages cannot bring about a situation in which inordinate demands of tax are made because the tax must be related to the actual profit earned.  I will not go into all the details, unless the House wishes me, because it is rather complex but I will give a few figures which might illustrate what can happen.  If we assume that a man who is trading on his own earns profits as follows: for the year ended 30th April, 1967: £2,400; 30th April, 1968: £3,000; 30th April, 1969: £12,000; 30th April, 1970: £3,000.  In that case, under the existing law, the tax which he would pay on those profits would total £6,400 whereas under this proposal the tax he would pay would be £15,250.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In each case the tax is related to the actual profit.  In neither case would he be charged tax on profits which he did <Col N="1927" /> not earn but because of this contrivance which relates to the date of cessation, the end of an income tax year, it happens in those circumstances, which I have outlined, that under existing law that instead of paying tax at the rate of £15,250, which is the correct rate of taxation on actual profits earned, he would pay only £6,400.  As I say, unless the House wishes me to I will not go into the actual details of how this works out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which is designed to catch those who are operating overdrafts outside the State and evading tax both within the State and in whichever country they are operating.  There are two questions which I want to ask the Minister.  He probably has not got the answer to the first here.  How many people does he envisage, or how many companies would he envisage would be affected by this and what amount does he expect the implementation of this section would produce in any one year?  Secondly, when one appreciates that what the person has been doing is deliberately and consciously to evade payment of income tax in quite a legal way, does the Minister feel that the allowance of a period of 12 months, up to 6th April, 1972, is not perhaps inordinately long?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first question raised by Senator Boland, it is not possible to estimate how much this will yield.  I should say, of course, that it applies only to individuals and not to companies.  If I may quote something I said in the Dáil debate it sums up pretty accurately all I can say about the estimated yield.  It is from Volume 253, <Col N="1928" /> column 770.  In response to a question on this point I said:</P>
      <P>It is difficult to estimate it accurately, as the Deputy will understand, because all the cases have not come to light.  However, we do estimate at least £20,000 to £25,000 a year is involved in tax.  It may well be substantially more, but we are pretty sure it is at least that.</P>
      <P>In fact, something I have heard suggests to me that it may well be substantially more.  We do not know because since it was not liable to tax it is not possible for us really to estimate it.</P>
      <P>The position is that the extension to which Senator Boland referred is not unduly long because anything else could only be regarded as retrospective.  We did consider that section 4 should not operate in a case in which a debt was incurred in 1971-72 before the legislation was foreshadowed in the Budget speech if the foreign income is applied during the year 1971-72 in satisfaction of the debt but any debt incurred in this way after the date of the Budget speech would be caught.  To go further than that would be retrospective and would be unfair.  As the Senator pointed out somebody doing this was acting within the law so that it would be unfair to make it retrospective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no time for all this talk about &ldquo;retrospective&rdquo;.  Ministers have certain devices which they use to suit their own ends. It is rather like this interpretation of &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  One can always take it that it will be a &ldquo;may&rdquo; interpreted in whichever way the Minister wants it to be and whichever way the Opposition do not think it should.  In the very same way when any Minister wants to make a case retrospective action in legislation is wrong and when he wants to make another case retrospective action is necessary and in the common good. There are a lot of unfortunate people operating quite legitimately within the law who were pretty shocked when the Minister arrived with his autumn Budget last year, which he has referred to here already, and introduced quite a retrospective element of taxation <Col N="1929" /> far as companies operating quite legitimately were concerned.</P>
      <P>Here we have a situation where a number of people&mdash;we do not know how many&mdash;were operating and using a loophole within the taxation code and were doing that to evade payment of taxation.  The Minister, quite rightly, wants to close that loophole.  In fairness, anybody operating or endeavouring to use one of these loopholes will have to say to himself: &ldquo;OK, fair game, I got away with it for so long but he announced in the Budget today that it is stopped and that is it.&rdquo;  To announce that it is stopped but that you are going to give him 12 months to make up for his legal sins of the past is being an overcharitable confessor especially when we see where under other sections people of much more modest means, as in section 2, will be asked to pay it immediately.  Unfortunately, because it was not implemented immediately, we are asked to pay quite a lump sum in one particular month.  That has more or less been got over now, but the sort of person who would be operating this legal loophole would be in quite a different category, probably in the category of a person who would be paying the wealth tax, which the Minister does not want to produce.  To allow them 12 months to remedy their legal sins of the past seems to be just a little bit too generous.  It is, perhaps, something which the Minister might consider in the future.  We all know that in every Finance Bill a certain number of legal loopholes will be closed, and just as soon as they are closed a bevy of gentlemen will leave here to consult the best financial brains in London to see what other ones they can open and which ones they still have available to them, and some of those will be closed in the following year's Bill and so this never ending battle will go on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that when we are closing some of the financial loopholes in the future we accept the fact that we will make people pay tax, which they should have been paying anyway, and which they have been evading.  They ought to start paying it right from the day the closing of the loophole is announced. Admittedly, in this case that would <Col N="1930" /> have been unfair, but to allow a whole year is being over-generous.</P>

      <P>I could not accept any element of retrospection in a matter like this.  I think Senator Nash is perfectly right that anything that was done in this case, or in similar situations, which was legal, is not something for which one is entitled to penalise people.  One can close the loophole all right.  While I do not want to get involved in going back over the old ground about the company taxation, I want to say again, for the record, that in my view there was no retrospection involved in that. It was passed in the autumn and no tax was payable under that provision before the 1st January of this year. Taking it on a straightforward basis, you cannot say that that is retrospective. <Col N="1931" /> I do not want to get involved in that argument, but I accept the principle.</P>

A great deal of this Bill is concerned with people who have a clear liability, not availing of a loophole, but under the law as it stands have not been paying their taxes or have not been paying them promptly.  This is designed to get after them and move them.  I trust that we have the full support of Senator Boland on those issues.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 9.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 9 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to get an opportunity of speaking on section 9 for the very simple reason that it is virtually a carbon copy of a similar section in the earlier Finance Act which allowed a widowed person a housekeeper allowance.  I must admit that it is some time since I read that earlier section but I think this section is more or less modelled on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 intends to allow a housekeeper allowance to an unmarried mother who is engaged in a full-time occupation.  That housekeeper allowance would be paid in respect of a family relative whom she has working for her.  If she can prove that there is <Col N="1935" /> no such relative available, or prepared to live with her, she can claim a housekeeper allowance in respect of some person whom she employs to look after her child.  The same provision applies to a widower who has to employ a person to look after his children while he is at work.</P>
    <P>I want to crave the indulgence of the Chair and the ear of the Minister to make the point that it is quite difficult for a widower to find a suitable person, who has no other source of income, to look after his children.  I have come across a case where, apparently, the Revenue Commissioners are insisting that because the widower employs a married woman he is not entitled to claim a housekeeper allowance for her because her husband is already claiming for her in his allowances.  This man cannot get a single person to mind his children.  If he could he might not want to do so because ideally the best person to mind the children is someone who is a mother herself.  The Chair has been very good in allowing me to make a case on an Act that has been in force for some years.  I hope the Minister will take heed of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. Sheldon) Acting Chairman (Mr. Sheldon)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Sheldon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair trusts the Senator has concluded his reference to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is very trusting. A very similar situation will probably develop in this case.  Let us look at the situation quite seriously.  If an unmarried mother with a child has to go out to work, as most unmarried mothers have to, she could probably not afford to pay very much to some person to look after her child.  It is most likely in such a case that she will not have a female relative living with her who does not have any other source of income.  More than likely she will have to employ a person to come into her home or flat to take care of the child or else she will have to board out the child in a créche or a nursery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion if an unmarried mother was to put her child into a day school or nursery she would not be entitled to claim a housekeeper allowance.  If she <Col N="1936" /> would be entitled to claim such an allowance I would be delighted to hear so from the Minister.  If she boards out her child to some person in the locality who will mind the child in her home it is almost certain that that person will be a married person whose husband has already claimed for her.  While the intention of section 9 is good and admirable&mdash;as good and admirable as the intention of the original section in relation to widowers&mdash;I am afraid that the 1967 section has produced a lot of difficulties.  I imagine this section, from the point of view of the unmarried mother, will be an even more difficult one under which to claim.</P>
    <P>Both of these categories of people are people who suffer a fair amount of hardship.  Perhaps the Minister would consider relaxing this restriction about female relatives and about a person being claimed for twice, if the person happens to be a married person, in these cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to welcome this section and also section 11.  It denotes an awakening of the Government's social conscience.  I should like strongly to support Senator Boland's plea that the Minister should go that little bit further and relax this restriction.  Experience has shown that there are quite a small number of people involved under this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Boland is correct in thinking that what is involved here is simply an extension of section 139 of the 1967 Income Tax Act which provided the housekeeper allowance for a widower, a widow, a married man, whose wife has deserted him, or a woman, whose husband has deserted her.  This is an extension of that provision to an unmarried mother, who is engaged in full-time employment or who is engaged full-time in a trade or profession, and who secures the services of a housekeeper to look after her child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation envisaged by Senator Boland, where the unmarried mother boards out her child during the day with a neighbour, and pays the neighbour to look after the child, is one in which the unmarried mother would be allowed that expense as a claim under <Col N="1937" /> this section.  It is true to say that the married woman neighbour in receipt of this money would have to account for that money.  I think the situation Senator Boland was talking about arises only where a female relative of the applicant is involved.  As he said, whatever about the other cases, it is not very likely in the case of an unmarried mother that the female relative problem will arise.  The problem to which he referred arises more frequently in the other cases under the 1967 Act. It is unlikely to arise in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think that most unmarried mothers will board out their child by day to a married neighbour?  It will not be worth the neighbour's while to take the child, if she has to pay tax on the money she gets.  It is a vicious circle.</P>
      <P>If the unmarried mother gets her housekeeper allowance, and then the other person has to pay tax, it will not induce her to take the child.  It had been my understanding that as it operated under the 1967 Act in respect of widowers, the allowance would not be paid where the person involved&mdash;the person with whom the child was boarded out&mdash;was already being claimed for in respect of her husband, or whoever was responsible for her. In that case the allowance was being refused to the widower and I assume that with the marvellous consistency of the Revenue Commissioners, it would in turn be refused to an unmarried mother in the same sort of situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That arises in the case of a female relative only.  It does not arise in any other case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In the particular case which I recall it was in relation to a person who I am virtually certain was not in any way related to the widower concerned.  She agreed to come to the widower's house each day to look after his children and provide a meal for them during the day.  He was informed by the Revenue Commissioners that he would not be allowed a housekeeper's allowance in respect of her because her husband was already claiming for her. <Col N="1938" /> She was in no way related to the widower.  Would the same situation not arise in relation to the operation of this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that that should not arise if the person concerned was not a female relative.  If the circumstances are as outlined by the Senator, perhaps, he would have another look at this on the basis that if it is not a female relative, then that situation should not have arisen in that case.  I should like to point out that in the case we envisage of the unmarried mother boarding out the child during the day with a married neighbour, the married neighbour would have an allowance of £99 per annum free of tax, earned income relief.  However, we cannot take the view that income derived in this way should be completely exempt from tax. It is the only way that we could meet the point being made by Senator Boland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree with the principle here.  However, I cannot understand why the Minister would not put in a simple section, giving the idea that we do not have to have this type of amendment, year after year, in the Finance Bill.  Surely we all agree that if the old age pensioner gets an increase of 40 new pence or 50 new pence it should not be taken off by the tax collector.  While we all agree with this, would it not be easier to delete the figures altogether, and just replace that <Col N="1939" /> section with the general principle? I envisage something like what is contained in the latter half of the explanatory memorandum.  In this way we should not waste the time of the Oireachtas by bringing in these types of amendments, especially when we all agree with the principle and support the section as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The case was very validly made in the other House.  Contrary to all the beliefs of the Department of Social Welfare, there exist a number of contributory old age pensioners for whom the old age pension is the only income they have.  Of course, I appreciate that a person could have quite a considerable income and still qualify for a contributory old age pension.  The case was made to the Minister in the other House more or less in passing, and it is worth re-emphasising here.  It would be well worth while, if there could be included by way of amendment of section 142 of the 1967 Act, provision for a dependent relative allowance to cover the contributory old age pension as well, where it could be shown that that pension was the only income of which the dependent relative was in receipt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Senator McDonald, while it is true that this relief applies to all categories, nevertheless, the section could be so drafted as to relate, without figures, to whatever the current rate for noncontributory pension was.  I will consider that for the next Finance Bill and draft it in that way.  I think it would simplify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall now refer to the other point about relating it to the level of the contributory pension.  As I explained in the other House, there are a number of reasons why I found it impossible to accept it.  One was the cost and others were reasons of principle.  One must remember that since there is no means test in relation to the contributory pension, we would be departing completely from the basis of this, which is related to means.  We could well find ourselves giving the benefit to people who did not require it, thereby depriving people who would be much more in <Col N="1940" /> need of that benefit.  On the whole, for practical reasons and for reasons of principle, we should adhere to the practice we have been following, that is, to relate it to the level of the noncontributory old age pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not related here to the receipt of a blind pension but rather to the production of a certificate by an ophthalmic surgeon as to the degree of blindness.  The degree required would be that if a person cannot, with correcting lenses, read the largest letter on the standard chart at six metres, then his central visual acuity would be said not to exceed 6/10.  The reference to a limitation in the field of vision means that looking at a central point on a chart used for the internationally recognised Snellan Test, the field of vision is limited on either side of the central point to the degree stated in the section.  This definition is taken from an American statutory definition in relation to a similar kind of thing.  I am advised that it is a fairly generous approach to it.</P>

      <P>The Minister is probably aware that the Minister for Health has visited this House recently and also the other House and has, by dint of numerical strength rather than by logic, taken through these Houses legislative measures which will mean that the same persons who will pay these social welfare contributions will be made to provide £5 million extra to the Exchequer through the health contributions.  They will have to start paying those fairly soon.</P>
      <P>I am a little bit surprised that if the Minister should allow the social welfare contributions to be deductible before tax is assessed why will he not allow the Health Contributions Act contributions to be deductible also?  After all, in equity or even in logic, as the Minister was mentioning the unfortunate people in the limited eligibility health category, they will be saved £700,000 a year and for that privilege they will have to pay £5 million by way of weekly contributions or other means&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It does not mean that the whole of the social welfare contributions are allowed but the portion that I mentioned in reply.  This section provides for additional items that may be deducted, that is, the contribution referable to the death grant and retirement pension.</P>
      <P>I do not know how Senator Boland arrived at the conclusion that health contributions will not be allowed because these health contributions do not exist yet.  When they do, then the matter can be dealt with.  We cannot be making provision for them when they do not yet exist.</P>

Surely it is the final indignity if the Minister will allow a situation to exist for a year when he will be doubly taxed because he is taxed on the health contributions which he is obliged to make under the Health Contributions Act.  In all fairness, it seems to be stretching the tolerance of the middle income group or the limited eligibility category, as they are referred to in the Health Contributions Act, a little bit too far.  In effect, it would amount to £5 million.  Even if the Minister did include it in the Finance Bill, 1972, it would have meant somewhere around £3 million between now and then to the Exchequer.

      <P>I, of course, support the idea in the section which specifically exempts road vehicles.  I wonder if the Minister would consider giving a special concession to firms who would propose to purchase intercontinental road transporters for the purpose of exporting directly to continental Europe or, indeed, to Britain on the ferry.</P>
      <P>Carriers operating cross-Channel or to Europe have a monopoly on our roads here.  This is a type of activity that our own carriers or even CIE should get into.  Especially if we are going into Europe, Irish companies should be seen to take our goods.  Our lamb trade should increase to France and our frozen meat to most of the EEC countries.  If this concession were given, even for a few years, to allow any of our carriers to enter this line of business, the Government would be encouraging expansion.  After all, it is a business and does it really matter what it is as long as our people are employed?  It is of paramount importance that lorries with Irish markings should be seen to carry our goods abroad.  I come through County Kildare every day and all the lorries that I see that are taking frozen meat from the chilling factory in Kildare are all foreign owned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>It exempts road vehicles and I was asking the Minister if he would include road vehicles which are purchased specifically for the export trade.  This type of vehicle is not available here because the continental lorries that I see here have sleeping accommodation and are a very expensive type of lorry.  If our Irish hauliers were to purchase them with the 35 per cent import duty or levy that applies to them, it would place them in a position of not being able to compete with the European or, indeed, the British or Northern Ireland hauliers.  I see no reason why CIE and some of our more progressive private hauliers should not be encouraged to tackle this trade and to have lorries travelling to Britain <Col N="1944" /> and Europe with Irish markings and proudly portraying an Irish image abroad.</P>
      <P>This is very important especially if we are really going after the fresh lamb trade to France.  We are at present exporting a relatively small amount of this commodity to France despite a 20 per cent import tariff there.  If we enter the EEC, there are good prospects for this trade.  Why does the Minister not encourage our hauliers to be on the ball there and to get across with our agricultural exports and not to depend on European carriers to do it for us?</P>

      <P>I agree with many of the points made by Senator McDonald.  Before supporting his argument, I should like to hear the Minister speak on this.  There are many reasons why what Senator McDonald said should be done in this case might be done.  As against that, one could give reasons as to why it should not be done. I should like to know what the Minister has in mind when a 60 per cent allowance can be made for new machinery or plant other than road vehicles.  We all know that in many factories there is total dependence on a certain type of road vehicle.  I am thinking of bulk loaders for cement, for flour, ready-mixed cement, <i>et cetera.</i>  I should like to get the Minister's views on this.  Is this specialised type of carrier included in the 60 per cent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>These kinds of vehicles were never included in the initial allowance and, as Senators have seen from the Bill, I do not propose to include them now.  The principal reason for this is that the cost to the Exchequer would be prohibitive.  If one were to confine it, as suggested by Senator McDonald, obviously the cost would not be so great but it would become impossible to resist claims for similar treatment for different kinds of passenger vehicles.  It is surprising how ingenious people can be.  Once an extension like this is granted, a logical case can be made for a further extension and I would be much afraid that the Exchequer could not afford it.  I certainly could not contemplate this in the present financial year, whatever might be the position in the future.</P>

Those special containers or lorries are really plant because they are very expensive items of equipment and even the lorry cabs are a special job.

      <P>If we are to be able to sell our Irish meat, the packaging is important.  The stock which rolls on and off our ferries should be Irish lorries and Irish registered vehicles.  I should think a dozen applications would be the maximum the Minister would receive because we have only a handful of factories and I do not think all of them will be in the export trade.  Would the Minister then give a concession to the meat trade especially since the export of Irish lamb is so important to the Irish farmers?  The Minister may not be aware that lamb prices this year have taken a drastic nose-dive and it is very important to the Irish agricultural economy that we should boost in every way possible the export of lamb.</P>
      <P>If we had our own vehicles they would be a type of advertisement on the road down to Paris or wherever they might go.  Since the numbers of vehicles will not be great whether it be CIE who take on the service or some of the more progressive carriers that we have who take it on, why leave this type of business entirely to continentals?</P>

      <P>I do not want to argue against what Senator McDonald has said but if I were the Minister I could make a good argument against it. What I mean by plant is having a type of truck that carries ready-mixed cement.  It carries bulk cement.  It is on the road for one purpose only.  You cannot remove the back of it and have a lorry, as you can with a container. You put a container on a lorry and you take it to the port and your lorry may be used for anything else after. You cannot use containers for ready-mixed <Col N="1946" /> or bulk cement for any other purpose.  They are part and parcel of the plant and a good case should be made for the reduction of the 60 per cent.  If the Minister could see his way to do what Senator McDonald has asked in the case of the meat containers that is very good if it will help the export of lamb or any other commodity, but I feel that the lorries to which I am referring are geared for one purpose only and I do not think anybody could try to drive a coach and four through any regulation the Minister might make in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another anti-avoidance measure.  The existing law provides that where in consequence of a settlement income is paid during the life of the settler to or for the benefit of a child of the settler in any income tax year at the commencement of which the child is an infant and unmarried, then the income is to be treated as the income of the settler for tax purposes. In the case of a child born after the 6th April in any year of assessment the parent can, in that year, divert his income by way of a settlement in favour of the child and since the child was not an infant and unmarried on the 6th April that year, the income cannot, under the existing law, be treated as part of the parents' income although for subsequent years it will be.  This section allows a taxpayer, if he wants to arrange his affairs in that way to do so but if the child was born at any time during the income tax year, then the existing law would operate in respect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The device has been used fairly frequently for income tax avoidance and a substantial amount of income tax and surtax could well be avoided in the year of the child's birth by virtue of it.  That is why we propose to close the loophole.  Under this section the test will be not whether the child is an infant and unmarried at the beginning <Col N="1948" /> of the year but whether the child is an infant and unmarried at the time the payment under the settlement is made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>In this instance the Minister is, perhaps, going that small bit too far.  I have had more time to study the explanatory memorandum since Tuesday last.  Nevertheless in the case of an individual who finds that he has been engaged in an activity which is liable to income tax through no fault of his own this 9 per cent will be a penal imposition on him, more especially if he finds he was liable for tax for two to five years back.  I do not know if this is possible but it might happen.  At 9 per cent it would not take more than six or seven years for the demand to be doubled with compound interest.  The 9 per cent is, indeed, a penal interest because even if a taxpayer wishes to avoid paying tax on the nail and invests at 9 per cent, his net tax-free interest will not be 9 per cent.  He will be lucky if it is 4 per cent. The Minister has said that this was to discourage people from investing at a high rate of interest.  This argument does not hold because it is impossible, especially with inflation, to get a net interest rate of 9 per cent.  The amount that the Minister will gain by this will be negligible.  On the other hand, the Bill will be prohibitive to a number of people who are caught up in the tax net, especially if they are assessed with tax on some other activity, the liabilities for which they were unaware of, for a few years back.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at this.  Nine per cent is altogether too high.  As the tax would form part of the taxable income at the interest of 9 per cent, if a person were lucky enough to get a <Col N="1949" /> net interest rate of 9 per cent from an investment it would be compounded. I feel that the Minister is going a little too hard.  In addition, it is proposed to reduce the period of grace from three to two months.  I would remind the Minister again that this year is the first year in a long time that the Seanad will be able to effect an amendment to this Bill by virtue of the fact that the Dáil is still in session.  It will be possible for him to go back there next week or the week after with any amendment that he may accept here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of reducing from three months to two the period of grace for payment and at the same time of increasing by 50 per cent the amount of interest payable from the due date of assessment seems to be unduly penal.  I would envisage a situation whereby people might have to liquidate assets in order to meet the tax demands in these cases.  There was already provision whereby the commissioner could direct that a certain amount of money could be paid pending the termination of an appeal.  I wonder if the Minister would explain to the House why it has suddenly been decided that this provision is no longer effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator McDonald has said, at 9 per cent the rate of tax is virtually a commercial rate.  I do not think the <Col N="1950" /> Minister will catch too many people who could, as he said, have invested their money and be earning fat interest while awaiting the determination of an appeal.  Rather will he unduly harass many small business people who are already up to their ears in trouble because they have got as far as the appeals section, the Revenue Commissioner. If they are also expected to pay 9 per cent interest on whatever amount is eventually decided is due, it could, indeed, be the financial straw that would break many a small man's back.  I do not like this provision either whereby, as the explanatory memorandum states:</P>
    <P>...tax charged by the assessment will carry interest from the date on which it would have been due if there had been no appeal.  Interest will not, however, be charged in such cases if an agreed payment on account has been made within two months from the due date and if any balance of tax found to be due on determination of the appeal is paid within two months of such determination. Neither will interest be charged where a payment which is made without agreement within two months of the due date proves to be not less than 80 per cent of the tax found to be chargeable on the determination of the appeal and where any balance of tax is paid within two months of the determination.</P>
    <P>It is surely very much a case of a reversal of all that has applied in our courts, in our taxation system and elsewhere.  It is the idea that a man is innocent until found guilty.  The effect of section 7 is very definitely that one is guilty unless it happens that the appeal finds one innocent.  Because we have decided a person is guilty the only way he may get any partial remission of this penal interest rate is by paying quite a large sum of money immediately. If the appeal rules that he has paid too much it will be given back.  This does not seem to me to be operating in a very enlightened manner.  I can quite understand why the appeals commissioners would be anxious to see that people of large incomes, who had been evading tax for a considerable length of time and who had well within their <Col N="1951" /> resources the wherewithal to meet the demand, ought be made pay that as quickly as possible.  However, I would suggest to the Minister that the majority of appeal cases which go before the appeals commissioners more often than not concern a small business person who through his own folly or otherwise has not paid this tax, has not paid it for some considerable length of time, perhaps, because he was not aware that he was liable for tax in this regard. Suddenly this person is faced not only with a taxation demand which makes him blench but also with a demand to pay what is virtually commercial interest rates on that figure.  The Minister ought to take a very close look at this.  It could turn out to be one of the harshest impositions that has come before us in any section in any Bill in recent years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be able to defend himself in what he says here, but from what I see year in and year out the income tax code is becoming more complex.  One could nearly devote one's whole education to understanding the income tax code and to advising other people on it.  The more complex a code like this income tax code becomes the harsher the burden will fall upon those who have to pay smaller sums in income tax.  Those companies or persons who have to pay large sums of income tax will, of course, have income tax consultants that the smaller business people cannot afford to pay.  It is the smaller business people or maybe smaller companies which will be caught in the net that is being provided under this section.  That is a point which I would like the Minister to examine.  It may be through ignorance that income tax is not paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even to a man in business who is reasonably well educated the complexities of the income tax code are like cross-word puzzles.  Wealthy companies, companies from whom the Minister is expecting large sums in income tax, can employ special income tax advisers to advise them as to what they should do. The income tax advisers will know the legislation on income tax and will advise these people, but the people who pay small sums in income tax cannot afford to have these income tax <Col N="1952" /> advisers and may be caught in this net that is primarily designed.  I presume, to catch large sums of money.  It will not catch the large sums of money.  it may get money by the imposition of the 9 per cent after two months from the date of assessment.  That 9 per cent which has been explained will, of course, be compounded because it will be taxing tax all along the line, month by month, not year by year.</P>
    <P>That is the point I want to make about this.  It does not apply to this provision that is being brought in this year by the Minister.  It applies generally throughout the code and through many other codes of taxation.  Wealthy companies can afford to employ consultants either to enable them to keep within the law, but only just, or to save them money in certain ways, but a person who is paying income tax at a lower rate or without surtax cannot avoid payment because he will not have that expert advice.</P>
    <P>This is a point which I should like the Minister to look at in this.  All this legislation here is only making money for the boys.  Certain types of legislation that is not consolidating legislation makes money for barristers and counsel. The same thing is happening here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the hardships which Senators have referred to, but the situation is simply this.  To balance the Budget an extra £2 million is required.  This £2 million is lost because some people will not pay their income tax in time.  It may be a hardship on them to have to pay interest on it, but it is a question of balancing the hardship. If they do not pay it, somebody else has got to pay it, and it is subsequently paid by the man who is paying his income tax in time.  You have got to pay more tax to make up for it. Which is the greater hardship?  Who should pay in those circumstances? Obviously it is the man who does not pay in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be completely unfair to put a greater load on the man who pays his tax in time and to say to him: &ldquo;In addition, because some people do not pay their tax in time, you must pay an extra six pence or an extra three pence, as the case may be, in your income tax to make up for them.&rdquo; People who are <Col N="1953" /> earning salaries and wages are really paying their tax in advance.  They are paying every week, every month or every quarter, as the case may be, according as their wages or salaries are paid, in advance before they have got their full year's earnings.  The other person is paying in arrears.  He is assessed on the previous year's earnings. For both those reasons, while I sympathise with what has been said, I think if there is to be a hardship it should be on the man who has not paid in time.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Nash has put very lucidly some of the issues involved here.  I do not think anybody could quarrel with the principles which he has enunciated.  There are one or two other points which I want to mention.  First, I think it was Senator Boland who mentioned the power under the existing law for an appeal commissioner to direct a payment.  The problem that arises there is, first of all, that this is a matter for the commissioner himself; it is not a matter which will be controlled by the Minister for Finance.  Secondly, the commissioner finds himself in the position that in many cases there are no accounts and he is not in a position to say what the amount of the payment should be if he has no figures on which to work. It is for that reason that it is necessary to supplement that power that exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would regard this section and similar sections later as being very important in this whole Bill.  For reasons of justice as between one taxpayer and another, as far as we can reach that outlined by Senator Nash, and equitable treatment as far as we can reach it as between one taxpayer and another, and also from the point of view of the Exchequer itself, it is important.  For every day that tax which is properly due is not paid there is a cost to the Exchequer.  When this is added up, over all the amounts due and not paid, it becomes quite a substantial burden which, as Senator Nash has pointed out, is borne by people who are paying their tax, and maybe by all the people who are paying their tax by deduction and paying in advance.  It seems to me that the principle involved in this is one that all <Col N="1954" /> Members of the Oireachtas must support.</P>
    <P>It is not unduly restrictive on a taxpayer in the sense that he has two months to pay and if he is disputing the amount he can either make an arrangement with the Revenue Commissioners, which will exempt him from liability to interest until the determination of the appeal, and then he had another two months in which to pay, or if he disagrees with the amount being suggested by the Revenue Commissioners he can make his own assessment.  If he pays a sum which turns out to be 80 per cent of what was due, then he does not become liable for any interest and he has another two months from the date of determination of the appeal to pay the amount actually found to be due.</P>
    <P>This is fair treatment for any taxpayer. Add to that the fact that if he overpays he gets back the overpayment plus interest at what Senator Boland has described as virtually a commercial rate.  This is not unfair to any taxpayer. Somebody mentioned&mdash;I think it was Senator McDonald&mdash;the question of the possibility of going back over three or four years and charging interest at 9 per cent on that.  That cannot arise because either the person has already been assessed and should have paid his tax before now, in which case he will be liable to 4 per cent up to the date of operation of this section and 9 per cent thereafter, or, if he has not yet been assessed but the Revenue Commissioners have come across him now and proceed to assess him in the next few months over the last three or four years, he is only liable for interest from the date of assessment.  In that way the kind of situation that has been envisaged will not arise.</P>
    <P>By and large, I do not think that any fault can be found with this provision on the basis of equity or on the basis of the interest of the Revenue Commissioners balanced against the interest of the individual taxpayer and the general taxpayer who is paying his tax and paying it promptly.  The primary purpose in this section and in the other similar sections is twofold; it is, on the one hand, to ensure prompt payment of <Col N="1955" /> tax in the interest not only of the Exchequer but of all taxpayers, and secondly to ensure as far as we can equitable treatment as between one taxpayer and another.  When one considers the situation of a taxpayer who is paying his tax by way of PAYE and compares that with the kind of case we are dealing with here, it can only be agreed that the kind of case we are dealing with here is being very fair and everybody is being generously treated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly should not like to be put down as speaking on behalf of people who do not want to pay their fair share of taxes.  Nevertheless, I often wonder if the Revenue Commissioners, who look to be nice ordinary people, are getting a percentage &ldquo;rakeoff&rdquo; of the total proceeds or whether they are paid salaries in the ordinary way.  I think the 9 per cent interest rate is punitive and I should prefer if such figures were not written into the Bill.</P>
      <P>The bank interest rate is a variable figure; it goes up a half per cent one year, or down three quarters per cent another year, and I would prefer to see this section without the figure put in, or that the Minister could relate the figure to the prevailing interest rates. It may happen that in a year or some time in the future the Minister's 9 per cent may very well be 2 or 3 per cent higher than the prevailing interest rate.  Any of these things can happen if the present rate of inflation continues.  I consider legislation to be bad legislation when we start inserting figures that may be unfair or meaningless in a few years time.  I do not remember if the Minister mentioned what percentage of the taxpayers would be involved in this or what percentage of the taxpayers were asked to pay the 4 per cent interest rate last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Nash dealt, in some degree, with those people who are subject to PAYE.  He made a case for them and I certainly would agree with the case he made.  What about the company or the private concern who collected, free of charge and almost without thanks, the PAYE on behalf of the Government? If, through some clerical error or oversight, that money is not passed on by a <Col N="1956" /> company on the appropriate date is it fair to ask that company to pay 9 per cent interest because of this? Commercial life and business people in this country have saved the Exchequer and the Revenue Commissioners hundreds of thousands of pounds by the work they have put into collecting taxes since the introduction of PAYE.  Indeed, they are getting scant recognition for their efforts and very little thanks.</P>
    <P>I consider this section will place an added imposition on those companies, especially on companies with a high rate of company taxation.  This point has been completely overlooked.  I do not have to remind Senator Nash of this fact because as a businessman with considerable experience he knows all the pitfalls and difficulties in this regard. Whether those people be large or small employers we should not forget the valuable contribution they have made in saving the Revenue Commissioners many hundreds of thousands of pounds through their collection of the PAYE tax throughout the years.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the bank interest rate is a variable figure I would ask the Minister to substitute for the 9 per cent some figure in proportion to the bank rate of the day.  Each year the bank rate goes either up or down 1 per cent or 2 per cent.  I can see the situation now whereby the bank rate should be reduced and those borrowing from banks would be very grateful if it did. The Minister is making a tremendous profit at the expense of people who, through no fault of their own, will be called upon to pay this rather punitive interest rate of 9 per cent.  It is altogether too high, especially when we consider that any tax that may accrue from this money not being paid promptly will itself be subject to income tax.  I think the Minister is trying to get it on the double.  In his efforts to get people to pay their taxes more promptly&mdash;we would all like to see that&mdash;he seems to be coming down too hard on a minority of cases.  We should endeavour, when dealing with legislation of this kind, to ensure that no section of the community will be put to the wall by virtue of a rather heavy imposition of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>The case made by Senator McDonald was that it costs many companies a good deal of money to collect the PAYE tax.  From practical experience it has been found that it takes one expert book-keeper an entire day per 100 employees to calculate the tax, prepare the tax slips, get it deducted and make out the net balance each week.  Senator McDonald contends that in those circumstances the tax which is deducted must be sent on at the end of the month to the Revenue Commissioners. If that tax is not paid by the end of the month it carries an interest rate of 9 per cent.  He feels that that is rather penal in the circumstances because, through illness on the part of one of the office staff or the accountant, through oversight or otherwise, it might easily be overlooked.  He, therefore, considers it as a penal tax.</P>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with him in that respect.  PAYE must be met and you get no leeway.  If you fill in the wrong amount because the bookkeeper is ill, three or four months later you will get the additional assessment with its extra 9 per cent.  Considering this tax is paid in advance there should not be a penal interest like this if it can be established that it was a genuine mistake and that there was justification or an explanation for it.  I can quite appreciate the difficulty of legislating especially for such matters.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that there would have to be a fixed rate of interest and the fixed rate of interest must correspond, more or less, with the rate the Government have to pay on national loans which at present is about 9 per cent. Next year, if we are fortunate enough to be able to borrow at 6 per cent, one would expect this rate of interest to come down in next year's Finance Act. I can appreciate that if 9 per cent is the borrowing rate, you would have to have a fixed rate of interest.  The Minister was absent during portion of Senator McDonald's speech and I have taken the liberty of reiterating what he said, so that the Minister can explain his outlook on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister several questions on this section.  I am sure that the Minister <Col N="1958" /> knows very well, from his present position and from his former heights of glory in the legal profession, that very often there can be a genuine disagreement between the tax inspector and the person concerned as to how much is actually owed.  Under the provisions of this section, even in a case like this where genuine disagreement exists, the only way whereby a person can escape paying this punitive rate of interest is if he pays a figure which subsequently turns out to be 80 per cent of the decided amount after the appeal.</P>
      <P>I should like the House to consider the case of a small shopkeeper, or indeed the case of a small door-to-door van salesman whom I heard about only a few days ago.  He thought that he had settled his affairs with God and the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;sometimes I am not too sure who comes first; we know who comes last because in these cases they affect one in the land of the living and in the hereafter&mdash;and was suddenly asked to pay £85.  Can one picture where a door-to-door van salesman, operating on a daily basis, making cash purchases and selling each day at doors, was going to find £85? If that man had a genuine disagreement with an inspector and he went on appeal, apparently the only way whereby he could escape paying 9 per cent interest rate on whatever figure the appeals commissioners finally decide is if he pays a figure which amounted to 80 per cent of £85.  My financial adviser, Senator Belton, tells me that is £68. This would be quite beyond his means. Can the Minister say if this is a fair enactment in cases where there is genuine disagreement?  Can he say if it is envisaged that there will be a minimum figure below which interest will not be charged, or if so that it will not be charged at this rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take a figure of £1,000.  Those who owed something below that figure and were disputing it and going to the appeals commissioner were probably again those least able to pay out immediately the figure involved.  I suggest to the Minister that the section would have been far more acceptable had a minimum figure been included, below which the interest payments would not have been as harsh as those <Col N="1959" /> now envisaged.  Perhaps the Minister would explain the position to us, first of all, in relation to the genuine disagreement, and, secondly, in relation to the apparent absence of a minimum figure.  As we so often compare ourselves to Britain, I am interested to know what rate of interest is charged there?  In addition, would the Minister consider the case of a trading company who could be placed in serious financial embarrassment because of the provision? Would he explain what the equivalent tax allowable interest rate would be for a trading company on a figure of 9 per cent interest?</P>

      <P>If one takes the case of a trading company operating with certain allowances and making their normal returns, say, in the current financial year but the returns of the previous financial year are in dispute.  Because they are in dispute, they go to the appeals commissioner; and with all the complicated procedures set out in section 17, they end up paying 9 per cent on whatever the final determined figure is.  That 9 per cent is money which they are taking out of the current year's trading figures and out of the current year's operation.  Consequently, it affects the current year's operation also to a greater degree.  Would it be something which could be deductible in the current year's figures?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing which strikes me about Senator McDonald's suggestion to have a current rate.  If the Minister accepted that, it would not be very popular in the country as current banking rates are slightly higher than the 9 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>We also have a Finance Act every year.  If the Minister considered that the 9 per cent was too high, I should hope that he would naturally bring the interest down to the bank interest rate if that was 6 per cent or <Col N="1960" /> 7 per cent.  He must keep it almost in line with banking rates, because otherwise it would only encourage people to appeal every income tax claim and keep delaying it.  It would be easier to pay, say, 6 per cent or 7 per cent interest to the Revenue Commissioners than to pay a high rate of bank interest on an overdraft.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason why he must bring the interest rate up to a realistic level.  The Finance Bill is the one Bill that must be renewed every year.  I know that the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners examine the records before the annual Budget, in order to keep an eye on who is escaping through the net and to try to prevent it.</P>
      <P>Even if Senator Boland's door-to-door salesman had such a row with the inspector of taxes he was always at liberty to go to his solicitor or to an income tax consultant, or he could go to a public representative like the Minister.  Between the three he might have been able to get some satisfaction. The Revenue Commissioners can be human at times.  The Minister has been realistic in this figure because people were using it as another way of securing overdraft accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be clear that there must be a fixed rate of interest. If the taxpayer did not know what rate of interest he was liable to this would be a very unsatisfactory position.  As has been pointed out it is reasonable to assume that in the event of a drop in interest rates with a Finance Bill coming in at least once a year there would be every opportunity to reduce the rate of interest in this corresponding to the drop in the going rate.  If the Minister did not initiate such a change I am quite sure his memory would be jogged in either or both Houses of the Oireachtas. The only statutory exemption at the moment as regards an amount of <Col N="1961" /> tax due not being liable for interest is that interest is not chargeable on an amount of tax not exceeding £1.  That is in relation to a point that was made by Senator Boland.</P>
      <P>I do not think that there should be an approach on the basis that, if the amount due is below a certain figure, what might be regarded as a fairly reasonable figure, either no interest or a smaller rate of interest should be payable.  I am reminding the House again of the fact that we are trying to achieve, as far as we can, equity between one taxpayer and another.  Many taxpayers are paying, as has been pointed out, by deduction in advance. If one wants to get some kind of reasonable correspondence then those who have the advantage of paying in arrears should certainly not be given the further advantage of either paying no interest, if it is overdue, or a reduced rate of interest.</P>
      <P>I understand that the rate of interest charged on unpaid tax in Britain is 6 per cent.  It may be that arising out of this Bill they may change their minds on that, but that is their business.  As far as I am concerned the going rate here is very close to 9 per cent.  The Government actually pay a bit more than that at the moment and therefore the figure has to be at that level.  I would say, in regard to the case referred to, that if there is genuine disagreement, which is justified, then the taxpayer would be found not to be liable for the tax and would not have to pay any interest.  If, however, there is genuine disagreement but he is liable for the tax, then the fact that he has had a long period during the appeal in which he did not have to pay, it should not be available to him to avoid paying the tax and paying the interest on it, again comparing him with the person who has to pay in advance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that there are many appeals taken at the moment which are not <i>bona fide</i> and which are dropped at the door of the court.  The whole object is to delay payment and thereby become liable only to the existing <Col N="1962" /> rate which is 4 per cent and thereby save money.  It is well worth people's while to do this.  We cannot allow this to continue by having a built-in inducement to do it.  It is not in the interests of the general taxpayers that this should be allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>The question was raised if interest paid in this way is allowable as a business expense deductible by a company. It is not and I do not think it should be. Their interest is payable in this way.  It is payable because the company concerned were liable for tax and did not pay it in the due time.  It would defeat the whole object of the exercise if one were to allow this to be a deductible tax expense.  It would effectively reduce the rate of interest very substantially and it would give an advantage to a trading company not available to other taxpayers.  This is intended to be in the nature of a penalty for non-payment of tax on the due date and thereby to induce prompt payment of tax.  To allow it as a tax expense deduction would defeat the whole object of this section.</P>
      <P>Reference was made by Senator Boland to the door-to-door salesman. I was reminded, when he was talking about it, of something that often comes to my mind.  Whenever there is any talk of restraining dividends one is led to believe that all dividends are paid to widows with large families who are completely dependent on the dividends. One never hears of anybody else receiving dividends.  Similarly, in this case, one might be tempted to think that all of the people concerned by this will be the small hard hit people.  Of course, some such will be affected but most of them are not in that category at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the hard case, which as we know makes bad law, and examine it.  In that situation this man got a demand for £85.  Either he owed that money or he did not.  Either it was due for tax or it was not.  If it was not properly due, it was open to him to appeal and to establish that it was not due, in which case he did not have to <Col N="1963" /> pay that or the interest on it; but, if it was due, then it was due on profits which he had already earned.  Although he may not have been well off there are plenty of other people paying tax who are less well off and they have to pay on the dot.  I see no reason why he ought to get special treatment as compared with other taxpayers who are not as well off as he is.</P>
      <P>It may be that he would have difficulty in paying this money.  I would suggest that in such a case he would have to come to an arrangement with the Revenue Commissioners for payment of the money by instalments.  He would, of course, have to pay interest on the money outstanding.  He is already getting a privilege as compared with many other taxpayers who are not as well off as he is.  Although that case may seem hard on the face of it, when it has been examined it does not seem that there is any particular injustice being done to that taxpayer as compared with many others.</P>

      <P>Since a man gets no allowances for business expenses on the 9 per cent if he underpays, may it be assumed that, if he is overassessed, pays too much tax and gets the 9 per cent back from the Revenue Commissioners, he will not have to pay income tax on that?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still not convinced by the Minister's argument.  In section 17 the 9 per cent should not be as definite as it is.  I am not 100 per cent familiar with the paying over of the PAYE but I understand that there is a certain date of every month by which the previous month's tax must be sent in.  The smaller the company, the more they will feel the pinch.  Even a bank holiday can knock out some companies' schedule or if a bookkeeper falls ill or in the event of a strike, is it fair to clap on 9 per cent on a month's PAYE on companies when it is clearly not their wish that it had not been paid or it was outside their control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this section remains as it is it will be mandatory on the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1964" /> to collect 9 per cent.  Surely it is possible to amend this section in some way so that people who endeavour at all times to meet their obligations and are caught out by an industrial strike or even a bank holiday or illness of a person who deals with PAYE will not be penalised?  The Minister must take into consideration situations of this kind because 9 per cent is a fairly heavy burden no matter how much PAYE is being paid.  Would the Minister not have a clause in this Bill that would be enforced only where people consistently endeavour to evade paying?  I cannot see that that would complicate matters very much.</P>
    <P>All these companies are unpaid tax gatherers and I doubt very much if the Revenue Commissioners give any free time to this problem.  Each company have to employ, at their own expense, people to send in the cheque in respect of PAYE each month.  It is a mounting bill in practically all cases and is becoming more complicated with each Finance Bill.  It is a pity the Minister cannot see his way to meet people who, through no fault of theirs, are unable to meet a deadline perhaps one month in the 12.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, as Senator Crinion said, we have a Finance Bill here each year.  I am here for about 11 years and this is the first year that the Minister came before the Seanad in a period when the Dáil was still in session.  The cry then was, &ldquo;We cannot attempt to amend this because the Dáil is not sitting.&rdquo; This year we have two weeks before the Dáil goes into recess and it is possible to put in an amendment. Otherwise there is no point in discussing an annual Finance Bill.  The Finance Bill is never amended in the Seanad and hardly ever amended in the Dáil either.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that 9 per cent is a very high figure and I refute the idea of having a definite figure.  That is bad.  It should be related in some way to the prevailing bank interest if it must be there at all.  Perhaps the Minister might tell us how many people paid the 4 per cent in the last financial year.  If the Minister is basing so much hope on increasing the revenue by jacking up the 4 per cent to 9 per cent he will be aware <Col N="1965" /> of how many people were called on to pay interest at the rate of 4 per cent and the total amount that this figure realised.</P>

This is some compensation for the expense incurred.  Senator Nash made a case earlier where there is a genuine mistake occurring.  He went on to say that, while he felt this was a case that deserved consideration, he recognised there was considerable difficulty in legislating for it.  There is.  Senators will see that if they think about it.  All I can say in that regard is that I will have a look at this and if I think something can be done about it I will bear it in mind for the next Finance Bill.  Without having examined it, it appears to be almost impossible to frame a provision that will cover that case and will not lead to loopholes.</P>
      <P>On the question raised as to what happens when tax is due and the taxpayer dies and there is a delay in taking out the probate or letters of administration, I am advised that when a taxpayer dies during the period of grace, that is, when interest has not begun to run, it is the practice to allow a similar period of grace from the date of extracting the probate or the letters of administration.  During that period the tax may be paid without attracting interest.  But where the taxpayer dies after the period of grace, that is when interest has already begun to run, then the interest charge is maintained up to the date of payment on the basis that the tax should have been paid prior to the taxpayer's death.</P>

      <P>Yes.  In the case where it was not due at the date of death, then allowance is made for the period of taking out the probate.  This seems to me to be the fair and only possible approach to it, because the tax was due before the taxpayer's died anyway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It would seem to me that if you began to charge interest from the date of probate and in addition charged interest for whatever period had elapsed from the time interest became payable <Col N="1967" /> up to the time of the death, that that would be fair, but I cannot see the fairness of including the period from death to letters of administration being granted.</P>

      <P>That is a case I had not thought of but I can imagine in a case like that if a person were dying or if his death were expected his affairs would not usually run too smoothly around that period.  If it were outside the period of grace, when interest was incurred, I know that there would be a number of cases where the executors may not have the power to make a payment to cover the tax without taking out letters of administration or probate.  Anybody who has had the experience of taking out probate or even administration knows the great difficulties.</P>
      <P>I would imagine that some arrangement could be made with the Revenue Commissioners because they will eventually get estate duty and probably death duty.  If administration could be taken out in a week, a month or two months, I could see some sense in it, but sometimes this laborious business may run into a year and it would be a very heavy imposition on a small estate.  It is not just a question of a person dying and executors having to take out probate.  Nobody has the freedom to liquidate the debt with the Revenue Commissioners because they have not the authority to do so.</P>
      <P>I do not know the solution to this problem but there is a very serious injustice built into the idea that if a person has tax outstanding at the time of his death he is outside the period of grace.  This poor man is dead and it is the people who have to deal with his affairs who have the responsibility. You cannot write a letter to somebody and get probate the following day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Honan is quite right in this regard.  The big trouble arises again in the estate duty section. We all know that if an estate is fairly substantial it sometimes takes six or eight months to clear it through the Estate Duty Office.  Before you can do anything else you will be charged income tax, if it is due, plus 9 per cent. You will also have to pay estate duty plus 9 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, but you will not be charged the interest on the estate duty while the case is in the Estate Duty Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  Sometimes a businessman dies, then his auditors come along, take stock, get an up-to-date balance sheet and profit and loss account up to the date of his death. From my experience, if you can get them to do that within five or six months you are doing very well.  You are allowed two or three months according to this Bill.  There is no personal allowance whatsoever when you come to pay income tax on that estate before it is distributed.  It will take 12 to 18 months before you can distribute it. You distribute it very quickly if you do it in 12 months.  There is no personal allowance despite the fact that that man may have willed his estate to a son, daughter or somebody else.  The executor is assessed with income tax on the estate without a personal allowance. The interest paid on estate duty is not allowable as an expense nor is the interest paid on the income tax.</P>
      <P>If during the year the business makes a profit of £600 you pay income tax on the £600 without any personal allowance. If you have also paid as interest on estate duty of £100 you cannot set off that £100 against the £600.  If you could it would help to balance things out.  Likewise, if you could set it off as an expense in the case of a deceased person I think it would help.  I realise the difficulty in drafting for all this. The Revenue Commissioners on their own initiative, with the consent of the Ministers representing Parliament, could make such an allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1969" /> I have found some cases of great hardship.  If something like this could be cone, the executor could go along on his own initiative very often.  He could borrow the money from the bank. He will pay the bank interest.  He is not allowed to set off the bank interest. That is the trouble.  If there could be some way whereby the interest on the estate duty and the interest on the tax, where tax is due, could be set off as an expense against the income from the estate and tax were then chargeable for the year after that on the net income of the estate, it would be much more equitable.  I do not know if it is practicable. I should not like to be asked how you could draft legislation for it. If the Revenue Commissioners could do it on their own initiative it would avoid tremendous hardship.  Perhaps the Minister would have a look at that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <P>I will have a look at the suggestion made by Senator Nash although we should remember that in some cases, maybe not in all, the estate is earning interest until the probate is taken out and the estate is distributed. I should also like to say in regard to a point raised by Senator Nash that the beneficiary under an estate, if he is the beneficiary of the income on the estate, on receipt of the income, can go back and claim the allowances.  A sole beneficiary is normally regarded as being entitled to the allowances as from the date of death.  I will examine this point.  Again, I would remind the House that there is the other side of the coin that interest may be earned during this period when probate has not been taken out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which raised quite an amount of contention in the other House because of the decision of the Minister to ally in one section the words &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; and &ldquo;fraud.&rdquo;  Certain people seemed to feel that cases of neglect, as defined, ought not to be included in the same section and be liable to the same sort of penalty as cases of fraud.  There was quite a lengthy debate on it in the other House.  Perhaps the Minister would again outline why it is equitable to equate fraud with neglect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the question of equating fraud and neglect is only superficially true.  It is equating them for the purpose of section 5 but they are not equated for the purpose of the <Col N="1971" /> penalties which follow from fraud and the penalties which follow from neglect. In relation to other provisions of the law, one becomes liable for much greater penalties for fraud than one does for neglect.  That is the first point I would make.</P>
      <P>The second point is that neglect in the sense meant in this section is different from what is regarded as neglect by the layman.  It does not comprehend what would be regarded as a genuine mistake made by the taxpayer.  This point was raised some years ago when a somewhat similar provision was being made although, in a way, a more penal one in relation to the power of the Revenue Commissioners to go back over the taxpayer's affairs for an unlimited number of years where there has been fraud or neglect.  On that occasion the late Deputy Sweetman raised this point in Dáil Éireann.  In the course of the debate on it he asked the then Minister for Finance, my predecessor, to give an undertaking in his corporate capacity that if it should be held that a case of genuine mistake were to come within this definition of neglect, action would be taken to amend that position in legislation.  My predecessor, in his corporate capacity, gave that undertaking. I repeated it in Dáil Éireann on this Bill and I am now repeating it here in this House.  I am advised that no such interpretation has arisen but if it should arise I am repeating that undertaking in my corporate capacity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the statutory definition of neglect which is incorporated in this Bill taken from section 186 2 (d) of the Income Tax Act, 1967:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this subsection &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; means negligence or a failure to give any notice, to make any return, statement or declaration or to produce or furnish any list, document, or other information required by or under the Income Tax Act provided that a <Col N="1972" /> person shall be deemed not to have failed to do anything required to be done within a limited time if he gives it within such further time, if any, as the Revenue Commissioners' officer concerned may have allowed, and where a person has a reasonable excuse for not doing anything required to be done he shall be deemed not to have failed to do it if he did it without unreasonable delay after the excuse had ceased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems fair enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that is fair.  I would not be so perturbed as some of the people in the other House seem to have been.  The point was made there, and I do not think answered very adequately by the Minister, that where somebody files returns for a tax year and through neglect in the office of the tax inspector, through the forms being overlooked and nothing further emanating from the tax office to the person concerned, it would be very fair on the part of that individual to decide that he would wait until the tax inspector contacted him.  He should not have to contact the tax inspector and find out how much the tax inspector had decided he had to pay.  At the same time, might he not fall into this category, assuming the tax inspector eventually finds his forms&mdash;this can happen because I know of a particular case&mdash; and might he not under this definition subsequently be found guilty of neglect by omission when in fact the neglect was really because of administrative error in the tax office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I could not see such a case arising at all.  Assuming that the taxpayer concerned has made such returns and accounts as are required and that the delay then occurs in the office of the inspector of taxes, the position then is that until the inspector of taxes has disposed of the matter and made an assessment, the man is not liable to pay tax and therefore he is not liable to pay interest on it.  That is assuming the delay is solely due to a hold-up in the office of inspector of taxes.  If, of course, the delay is due to <Col N="1973" /> the failure of the person concerned to make the return or if he has made an inaccurate return, then this question of neglect as defined here comes into play. One would have to examine each case on its merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I put it to the Minister another way?  Supposing the tax inspector is not aware the person is working in the country&mdash;let us say he is employed by a British company and the tax is not being deducted by the British employer&mdash;the tax inspector is not aware of the existence of the person concerned but the person involved eventually contacts the tax inspector himself and says: &ldquo;Look, I am here, in existence, earning money and I should be paying income tax but nobody has ever sent me a form to fill up so I have done nothing about it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What is the situation now?  They sit down together and they get details of his income over the past number of years while he has been in employment. Is he then immediately liable to the 9 per cent interest on foot of the definition of &ldquo;neglect&rdquo;?  Let us take a second example where the same person contacts his tax inspector and says: &ldquo;I am in existence.  I am earning money, will you contact me.&rdquo;  He hears nothing from the tax inspector for perhaps six months and at that stage files his returns for the previous two or three years and again hears nothing more from the tax inspector for six months. In each case there is some element of neglect, whether the man is coming within the legal definition as defined by the Minister or not, in the case of the person involved.  There is also an element of neglect, at least to an equivalent extent, in the case of the tax inspector.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not reply to that; it is six per cent.  I also said at the same time by mistake that ours was 4 per cent and I subsequently corrected that to 6 per cent.  Our existing rate is 6 per cent and so is the British rate.  The Senator may perhaps remember that I said that, arising out of this Bill, I might take a new approach to it.</P>

I wonder what is the necessity for this abnormally high rate of interest?  Is there any particular reason why it is necessary to penalise the local authorities to this extent, seeing that the Minister for Local Government is looking for low-cost housing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, no well-run local authority would become liable to this rate.  What is involved here is the same rate which applies in the case of PAYE, wholesale tax and turnover tax. The reason that it is 12 per cent is that it is dealing with other people's money. It is not their money and if they hold on to it they have an additional advantage. That is the reason why the rate is at 12 per cent.  I am quite sure no well-run local authority will become liable to this interest charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that it is the way in which it was interpreted by the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1975" /> since 5th April.  It is quite on the cards that a number of local authorities will be caught, because there were people working for local authorities who could be described as subcontractors who would have been caught up if representations had not been made and a different interpretation put on it from the one which is being put on it by the Revenue Commissioners. Would that be correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think that is correct.  The misinterpretation was by the local authorities, not by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps that is what happened, but the subcontractor in that particular case was the victim of the misinterpretation of the local authority.  I should like to see the correspondence from the Revenue Commissioners on their demand notes in that connection because they might be partly responsible for the misinterpretation by the local authority.</P>
      <P>When we were discussing this here 12 months ago we were dealing with the subcontractor on the building site.  At that time I prophesied that there would perhaps be a reduction in the output on the building sites, because these people would be inhibited in carrying on in the way in which they were.  They were going to be caught up in the tax net.  A very good case has been made by many Senators and by the Minister, with which we agreed, that a number of these people were not paying social welfare contributions, and in many cases, as a result of illness or perhaps death, the families of employees suffered.</P>
      <P>The introduction of section 17 at that time has meant that perhaps some of the best workers who were engaged in the building industry are not in it any more.  I have some experience of this and no matter how you try to encourage these people to pay their social welfare contributions or to make income tax returns they are not prepared to do it.  A great many of them have left the country and the building trade and housing output have lost out as a result.</P>

      <P>I should like to say, first, that I have not got here the correspondence from the Revenue Commissioners to local authorities but I have seen it in another connection.  I think the fact that only a certain number of local authorities had difficulties, whereas most of them had not, is evidence enough that the difficulties arose on the part of some local authorities and they are being sorted out now.  Those that could be sorted out before were those that could not have been sorted out in this section.  On the remarks made by Senator Jack Fitzgerald I should like to say that I do not know how many of the &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; have left the country as a result of this section.  I doubt if anybody does.  I suspect that it may not be very large because there are similar provisions operating across the water.</P>
      <P>What I do know is that very many thousands of these men, especially in cities like Dublin, Cork, and Limerick who were out of the PAYE system simply as a tax dodge, have gone back into it, where they really should have been.  By going back not alone are they, as touched on by Senator Jack Fitzgerald, paying tax, but they are paying their social welfare contributions and the very difficult situations that had arisen before, when there was illness or injury and they were not paying social welfare contributions, are being avoided. So far as I am concerned the operation of this particular section of the 1970 Act has been very successful in achieving the object we had in mind, despite the forecasts by some people in this House and in Dáil Éireann that we were wasting our time and it could not be done.

      <P>One of the reasons why the Revenue Commissioners were a bit strict on them was that they had been used to PAYE and they had been working satisfactorily.  At one stage they worked for what they got out of it, out now that they are coming into the tax net the first time they will get a tax assessment on 1st January next when they will get a bill for quite a substantial amount.  They will probably not be able to meet that bill because they will not have saved up to meet it.  We had this situation in the mid-fifties, before PAYE, where young people at that time got bills on 1st January for £50 or £60 and they had no hope of meeting such high bills.  In some cases they paid the tax by the week but, in most cases, it was a case of hopping <Col N="1978" /> across the water.  Having had that experience, the Revenue Commissioners felt that, if an employee had not an established contractor, they would have the same trouble arising again.</P>
      <P>My own experience has been that, where a contractor came up with a genuine case, and where he intended to meet his tax commitments, provided he had a letter from his auditor, the Revenue Commissioners accepted the explanation.  The person must make a genuine case to show that he intends to pay the tax.  In quite a number of cases contractors have dodged paying tax and they felt apparently that, if they could get registered, that would provide another way of dodging tax for another few years.  The Revenue Commissioners need to be assured that the man intends to pay his tax commitments.</P>

      <P>I think it is wrong of the Minister to bring into the net local authorities building houses by direct labour.  As the Minister well knows these houses are mainly built by direct Government subsidy or Government grant.  We have the constant difficulty of getting payment of such grants and loans from the Department of Local Government and it can very often happen that a lumper, or one of these small subcontractors, may be pressing the local authority very hard for payment for work done.  It often happens that the county council may, in view of the pressures brought to bear on them, pay off some of these subcontractors out of other funds.  It is unfair, therefore, to charge them 12 per cent on the moneys they would be deducting from these subcontractors or lumpers because the delay is caused by the Department of Local Government which has not received the money from the Department of Finance for the housing subsidies in question.  It is a vicious circle and I think it is wrong; it adds an additional percentage, although the percentage may be small, to the unit costs of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely in the case of local authorities and, indeed, in the case of voluntary building agencies, this 12 per cent could well be waived or dated at least from the date of payment of the grants or housing subsidies.  This is a genuine <Col N="1979" /> difficulty.  Some of these people may very well have to give in to pressure to pay a small subcontractor many months before the Department of Local Government transmits the housing subsidies or housing grants to the local authority. We, on local authorities, have this experience every year; we have difficulty in getting grants.  If the houses are not completed until after Christmas we may very well have to wait until the beginning of the new financial year in April to receive our grants or payments.  This is something that the Revenue Commissioners have overlooked.  Seeing that it is all public money I see no reason why this imposition should be levied.  The present trend seems to be&mdash;I think the Minister for Local Government has made a policy point of it&mdash; that the Department gives sanction more quickly to low unit cost housing than to the traditional type of houses councils built up to this.  There is an anomaly here and the Minister should look again at this 12 per cent interest charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The interest should be due only after the payment of the State grants.  This would hold good for the building societies as well.  Both the voluntary housing societies and the local authorities are very dependent on the two-third State subsidy from the Department of Local Government.  As the Minister knows, his own Department holds up the payment of these grants.  This causes great difficulties in the local authorities and surely this is a case where the 12 per cent could be waived or at least backdated until the day of the payment of the grant or subsidy to the council.</P>

      <P>I do not know what Senator McDonald has in mind.  I do <Col N="1980" /> not intend to follow him up the alley of payments to local authorities by the Department of Local Government and sanctioned by my Department.  We could argue for a long time on that point.  The facts of the matter are that, if this provision for deduction was not there, the local authority would have to pay £100 to a subcontractor.  Because of this provision the local authority will have to pay only £65.  Whatever way you look at it, the local authority is paying less than it would otherwise pay if this provision were not there.  Leaving aside all the extraneous matters, the effect of this will be that the local authority will pay less at the moment out of their allegedly strained resources than they would otherwise be paying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is obviously basing his argument on the fact that there is £100 due to a lumper or subcontractor, and the local authority, because of pressure, pays off the contractor.  They may not have the money to do so but sometimes, if the council makes a good case and the figure is not too high, a small contractor can get paid perhaps an instalment on his money.  This money may not be out of the appropriate grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Minister, by virtue of this section, is putting the onus on the council to pay the remainder of the £100 direct to the Revenue Commissioners before they get it from the Minister's Department.  The Minister is the fly in the ointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of the section up to a point.  I am in favour of the section if the Minister would agree to waive the 12 per cent interest rate in respect of local authority and voluntary housing societies.  The local authority cannot pay out 100 per cent of the cost until the Department of Finance and the Department of Local Government, between them, make up their minds to pay the housing subsidy which amounts to 75 per cent of the cost, in my county anyway, to the local authority.  Sometimes we wait for six to nine months, perhaps a year, for payment. Is it fair to ask a subcontractor to wait that length of time, until the Department of Finance condescend to allow the Department of Local Government to pay the housing subsidy?  It is possible, and in many cases a point can be stretched, to give the subcontractor his 65 per cent.  We would all be agreeable to that.  Would the Minister not give us the concession of not having to pay the 35 per cent until such time as the grants come through from the Department of Local Government? This is a very reasonable request Otherwise, he is going to inflate the estimates.  When you start a housing scheme it is impossible to estimate the exact date on which the grants will come through, especially if the houses are completed in, say, the months of December, January or February.  In those cases, it is most likely that the housing subsidy will not come through until the beginning of the next financial year.  Any Member of the House who has any knowledge of local authorities knows that.  This section is designed to inflate the cost of local authority housing, despite the fact that we are making every effort, at the direction of the Minister for Local Government, to contain the unit cost of local authority housing.</P>

      <P>My experience of local authorities is that if the contractor who is dealing with a local authority mentions to the Revenue Commissioners the amount of work that he is doing and produces a letter from an auditor, <Col N="1982" /> he will have no trouble in getting registered.  I know of quite a few.  They were caught in the month of May and I think every one of them has since been registered.  Normally, they are contractors of standing.  In regard to the subsidy, my experience has been that the local authority is never allowed to go ahead until the loan is sanctioned for the houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see Senator McDonald's point.  The loan is sanctioned. I have acted for contractors many times in this connection.  However, it is one thing to sanction a loan and another thing to collect it.  Frequently, the local authority will not collect its loan until six or eight months after it is due and the unfortunate contractor is out of his money.  Senator McDonald's point is as follows: let us assume that a contractor at that stage, as many of them are &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo;, is due £1,000.  For one reason or another, he has not registered; he is careless and is usually one of those fellows who carries his books in his head.  If in that case before the local authority get the subsidy, in order to help him out, they borrow £650 from a bank and give it to him on account, they should not have to borrow a further £350 to give to the Revenue Commissioners.  In other words, their liability to the Revenue Commissioners should not arise until such time as they get the money from the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, their liability to the subcontractor should not arise either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>It does arise.  The subcontractor <Col N="1983" /> has done his job.  They enter into a contract with him and their liability is to him.  It is no part of the contract that he is not going to be paid unless and until they get the subsidy. The contractor is due his money.  One of the reasons why local authorities at the moment find it so very hard to get contracts at a reasonable price is because they are so slow to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a vast number of small contractors doing work for local authorities at the moment.  They are gravely embarrassed and I have heard many of them say that they will never again touch a contract for a local authority.  Some local authorities realise this, and before they get the subsidy they borrow money from the bank and make a payment on account to him. Senator McDonald's point is that they are making this man a payment on account of half or two-thirds of what is due to him.  If they pay only the £500, they should not right away have to pay another £250 or £300 at that point.  In other words, they should not be liable to pay the tax until they get the subsidy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  They will not get that until six months after a contract is finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But surely the contract provides that the full payment is due to the contractor at a time which relates it to the payment of the subsidy, because his work has to be inspected and passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>The contract provides as follows: periodically his work is inspected by the engineer.  A certificate will be passed to him for 90 per cent of the work done.  Therefore, when he has his work done, when his houses are ready for occupation, he calls on the engineer to inspect them.  The engineer inspects them and passes them at that stage.  Then there is usually 10 per cent or 5 per cent left over for six months, <Col N="1984" /> in order to ensure that there are no defects.  He is entitled to his money then.  In 19 cases out of 20, the unfortunate man will have to wait for a further six to eight months for the subsidy.  Every member of a local authority, including Senator Crinion, will admit that.  This is one grave defect in local authority housing and it is pushing up the cost of it.</P>

      <P>I think that we have gone completely away from the section and I hope that I was not responsible for that, because it was Senator McDonald, Senator Boland and I who initially raised the question. There has been talk about county council &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; or subcontractors. As discussion developed, I find that the subcontractor in this context is a housing contractor who submits a tender in reply to advertisements in a local paper for the building of local authority houses.  He is a contractor and is not a &ldquo;lumper&rdquo; or subcontractor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I submit that we are dealing with two different things.  I was amazed when I heard my colleague, Senator Crinion, trying to confuse the genuine contractor who has a place of residence with the lumper who the Minister submits, has not a place of residence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to a point raised by Senator Nash.  I do not know if Senator Nash is a member of a local authority.  I am a member of one, and in fairness to local authorities, I do not agree that there is any hesitancy on the part of contractors to tender for work of the local authorities because they are slow to pay.  Those of us who are members of local authorities will agree that every effort is made by way of payment to induce contractors to proceed and finish the contracts which they have tendered for.  It is unfortunate that so many contractors have so much <Col N="1985" /> other work apart from local authority work so that the local authority comes second in many cases.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Maoláin passed a remark that I was making a case for those tax dodgers.  I was not making a case for those people described by the Leader of the House as tax dodgers.  I was making a case for their right to register and go to McInerneys, Walls or any of the other big contractors and take a site for houses from them to build by subcontract from the foundations to the wall-papering or to do any other work that they wish to do by subcontract. They should be entitled to register as such.  They should not have to have registered offices.  In that way they would have to pay their taxes because the contractor who had employed them would be liable under PAYE for their income tax.  That is the way I understand the section.  If I am not correct perhaps the Minister will tell me so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, on the suggestion made in relation to this section, I cannot accept it for a number of reasons.  I do not wish to enlarge the scope of the debate but let me point out that, if it were accepted, within a few weeks of the payment being made by the local authority to the subcontractor that subcontractor would be demanding from the Revenue Commissioners a refund of the sum retained by the local authority which would not have been paid by the local authority to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to say that, as far as I know, the cases about which Senator Crinion was speaking were, in fact, genuine subcontractors or lumpers because if they were not the problem would not have arisen.  It was that precise problem which Senator <Col N="1986" /> Fitzgerald spoke about, registration, and it was the registration which Senator Crinion had come up against and had dealt with.  Perhaps I might be allowed to indicate what the broad policy is as it has been operated.  It has been to refuse certificates to labour only subcontractors who, in general, are not more than itinerant tradesmen operating from their homes or lodgings who frequently move from place to place with no established place of business. These are the cases in which there has been widespread evasion of tax in the past.  In some cases of labour only, subcontractors certificates have been issued where the circumstances were exceptional.  These would be, for instance, where the subcontractor has been charged to tax under Schedule D on the basis of regular returns and accounts or where the business was on such a scale that it could clearly be said to be an established place of business.  This was indicated in the Bill and the regulations connected with it.  It has operated as envisaged and it has operated very successfully.  If I may return to the section.  I repeat that the effect of the suggestion being made would be that the Revenue Commissioners would be asked to pay refund tax which in fact they had not received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The areas in the country which are designated as underdeveloped are not really the poorest areas.  This is a wonderful concession and is beneficial to the areas concerned. I was recently reading over the Ross Report published in 1969 and if we are to accept those figures&mdash;the Government have, I think, accepted the Report&mdash;there is no reason why some of the midland counties should not get this investment.  In a midland development region, there are only three counties out of five that are not designated I ask the Minister if he, in conjunction with the Government, would consider designating Offaly and Westmeath, so that the midland regional development organisation area would be an entirely designated area for the purposes of concessions such as this one in section 22.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of what constitutes a designated area is a matter that has to be decided under other legislation.  So far as this provision is concerned, this section applies the investment allowance to areas which have been designated under the Industrial Development Act, 1969.  It is not <Col N="1988" /> feasible for me on this Bill to discuss the designation procedure of the areas in respect of which it should be applied. I cannot respond to the suggestion made by Senator McDonald.</P>
      <P>On this section I wish to refer to a matter which Senator Russell raised with me.  He stated he would not be here for this discussion but he asked me to look into a certain matter and I want, therefore, to say in response to what he said in regard to an investment allowance that section 25 provides that&mdash;</P>
      <P>The investment allowance is to be withdrawn if</P>
      <P>(a)  the machinery or plant is sold without having been brought into use in a designated area, or</P>
      <P>(b)  the machinery or plant is sold within two years of having been so brought into use.</P>
      <P>If the machinery or plant is used in a designated area for two years or more and is then sold, any balancing charge which may arise will not take account of the investment allowance. The taxpayer will be allowed to retain it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that if it is intended to be its terminal date it must be viewed in conjunction with the free depreciation provision in the rest of the country.  The object of that provision is to stimulate investment on a special basis at this time of our preparation for entry into the EEC and in the light of the general economic situation.  It is generally agreed that we need substantial investment <Col N="1990" /> and it is designed specifically to stimulate that.</P>
      <P>There is no intention whatsoever of extending it.  It is intended only to last for two years.  Anybody who wants to avail of it had better get moving.  Apart from anything else we do not think we could afford to continue it for any greater length of time.  In that connection I would remind the House that the cost to the Exchequer the year after next of the investment allowance and the free depreciation provision is expected to be about £6 million.  We could not contemplate its continuance and I would not like anybody to rely on the fact that it might be continued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position is that there is free depreciation in the designated areas, roughly speaking, the western areas.

During that two year period, in order to preserve the advantage of the designated areas, we are applying this special investment allowance.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I am anticipating what might come on a later <Col N="1991" /> section.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>One further question.  If, for example, having done that, they were unfortunate enough, having spent too much on capital, to be forced into liquidation within two years they lose the free depreciation allowance.  Would they be allowed the normal depreciation which then lies at 50 per cent for the first year and thereafter the normal depreciation on machinery?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister mentioned earlier this extends to the whole country the free depreciation which entitles a person to write off his depreciation in whatever manner he thinks fit.  The Minister indicated, when speaking on section 23, that, in fact, this again is a limited provision.  I would like to raise here the point that I feel that free depreciation is so economically desirable under our conditions that the Minister is circumscribing himself and <Col N="1993" /> the economy unduly in limiting this. I think it was the third report of the Capital Advisory Committee, which is umpteen years ago now, which first raised this question of the free depreciation of capital and pointed out at that time the great advantage that this would have, that the State should be content with the great incentive this should be and in the ultimate the State will not lose money on it.  Accordingly, I should be glad if the Minister could give the reasons why he feels that this is something to be done for two years only, as a last preparation for entry to Europe, rather than something that we would hope would be a continued feature of our legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two reasons why this should not continue on a permanent basis.  The first one I have already indicated: the Exchequer could not afford it.  The second one is that already we had been giving very generous depreciation allowances&mdash;I think the initial allowance was 60 per cent&mdash; up to this.  Perhaps it might help to get this in perspective if I remind Senators that in the recent announcement by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer in a context of a massive effort to induce reflation, development and investment, their investment allowances were increased to 80 per cent.  That gives some idea of the perspective of what is being done in this section by giving 100 per cent.  I doubt if, in principle, it would be a good idea that free depreciation should be provided on a permanent basis. I am not ruling that out in principle completely but I have doubts about it as a principle.  I know that the drain on the Exchequer would be extremely substantial if this were to be continued on a permanent basis.  It would certainly involve some alternative form of taxation to replace that revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that, might I ask the Minister this question?  We go back to the hypothetical case of a company which invests £10,000 in a machine.  That £10,000 is written off as a revenue expense the first year.  We will assume the company have made a profit of only £6,000.  Will the company, therefore, for that year be treated as <Col N="1994" /> having been run at a loss of £4,000 so that we get an allowance in the next year as against the £4,000 surplus? For how many years would that continue?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this provision was introduced in whole or in part because of the fact that industrialists complained of the severe impact of the 58 per cent corporation profits tax.  If the Minister tells us now that this provision will be withdrawn in two years time, is there reason to hope that the 58 per cent tax will be reduced or that some other provision will be introduced to lessen the adverse impact on industries of the corporation profits tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, at this stage, I cannot give any undertaking in that regard as to what will happen in two years time, but, equally, I certainly would not close the door on a change of that nature taking place.  I cannot anticipate it but I would point out that the increase in company taxation applied to all companies, not merely to industry, whereas this allowance applies primarily to industry.  Certainly it is primarily of benefit to industry. Effectively, what it is doing is channelling to industry a substantial portion of the reveune which will be raised by the increase in company taxation.  In that light it can be regarded as favouring industrial companies to the detriment of companies engaged in anything other than industry.  I should hope that industrialists would recognise what is <Col N="1995" /> happening and would recognise that a serious effort is being made by the Government to benefit industry but in such a way that industry will benefit itself and benefit the economy.</P>
      <P>I believe that if industry takes advantage of this free depreciation scheme during the next two years there will be a considerable advantage accruing to industry and to our economy.  It could well be that the advantage accruing in that way could of itself provide the economic climate and the money whereby provision of company taxation could well take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little disturbed about the thinking behind this. The idea of this being a two year spurt is something which will not be continued. I agree with the Minister it is highly desirable that we should get as much investment in new plant and machinery during the next two years as possible, but I do not think it ends at that.  Anticipating that we will be members of the European Community, our industry, under those circumstances, has, above all, to be adaptable. This will mean a continuing adaptation of plant and equipment, continuing investment in new equipment.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister is not setting his face firmly against the continuation of an incentive of this type.  The Minister has given as a reason against this that the Exchequer could not bear it.  But if one takes this over a decade any losses which the Exchequer might suffer in revenue would be more than offset by the fact that it is acknowledged that this is an extremely powerful incentive.</P>
      <P>This is one way in which by possible loss of revenue in this particular regard there is an incentive for investment which by all the evidence is more powerful than other incentives on which the State and the Minister's Department are prepared to spend an equal amount of money.  When the Minister talks of the heavy loss to the Exchequer, could he give us some idea of the order of cost involved, any idea of the estimate, of how much this section costs to operate for two years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If we take the two <Col N="1996" /> together, that is, the free depreciation plus the investment allowance in the designated areas, the estimated cost to the Exchequer next year is £3 million and £6 million the following year.  One would assume if it were to continue that it would be £6 million per annum thereafter.  If I remind the House that the gross yield from the income tax changes made in section 2 is £6 million, one would get an idea of the impact on the Exchequer if we were to continue with these allowances.  Alternative means of finding this revenue would have to be devised.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to prolong this discussion. I merely wish to reiterate that it is not intended at all to extend these concessions beyond two years.  I hope that everybody concerned, particularly industrialists, will recognise that if they want to avail of it they have to avail of it during the course of this or the next financial year.  It will not be available to them thereafter.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 27.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 27 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point which applies to sections 27 and 28 but we must take them separately.  The Minister, earlier in the year, mentioned that on 1st January he is introducing an added value tax.  In the countries in which an added value tax pertains at the moment they have a different system from us in imposing taxation on alcoholic beverages.  It is not called an excise duty.  It may be called an alcohol tax but there is also a certain element of the added tax value too.  Will the Minister persist in this excise tax in view of the fact that the added value tax is being designed in the expectation of our getting into the Common Market?  If that is assumed, then the excise tax will have to be altered in general.  Is that not true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, the value added tax would be introduced whether or not we were entering the EEC.  Entry into the EEC makes it imperative but even <Col N="1997" /> if it were not we would still be introducing the value added tax.  On its implementation, it is designed to produce the same revenue as the existing turnover tax and wholesale tax together and they will be abolished.  It is not designed to substitute for excise duty. It is probably true, as Senator Belton says, that in the different EEC countries, as a result of the different approach to the methods of taxing alcoholic drink, in the longer term a certain degree of harmonisation of approach will be necessary.  That is some way away from us and it would be very difficult to foretell at this stage what form that will take.  I think it will end up on the basis of trying to get a common denominator between all other countries in the Community&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It does and it is going to vary even more on the accession of the four applicants.  It will probably end upon on the basis of a common denominator and that can be agreed between the countries.  There may be a sort of balancing of one revenue that would be increased against another that would be reduced so it is really impossible to foretell.  Senators may take it that until we are much closer to that degree of harmonisation we will still live with the kind of customs and excise duties on alcoholic drink that we have at the moment, or even, conceivably, somewhat bigger duties before that day is reached.</P>

The yield from beer last year&mdash;for the year ending 31st March, 1971&mdash;was £33,520,000. That includes customs and excise but, as I have indicated, the bulk of it is excise duty.

      <P>I think those who have occasion to travel in and out of this country will welcome section 29 which will allow the operation of a green channel at the points of entry to the country.  There are a few questions I should like to ask the Minister in regard to this.  What will be the liability on a person who wishes to use the green channel if the person is carrying in permitted amounts of spirits, wine or tobacco?  Is he still entitled to go through the green channel while carrying such items?  What is the value of personal presents which a person is entitled to bring into the country free of customs duty at present?  Is a person bringing in such personal presents entitled to pass through the green channel without declaring such purchases which are intended either for <Col N="2001" /> personal use or for presents for his family and close acquaintances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons using the green channel are declaring that they are not bringing in anything in contravention of the regulations.  Therefore, if they are bringing in personal gifts which come within the regulations they are perfectly entitled and expected to use the green channel.  The quantities allowed for residents of this country coming back to Ireland are 1 lb of manufactured tobacco, including cigars and cigarettes&mdash;that is, 400 normal size cigarettes&mdash;one normal size bottle of spirits, one normal size bottle of wine and ½ pint of toilet waters or perfume.  This may consist of toilet waters or perfume in any proportions. In relation to adults, they may bring in dutiable goods other than tobacco, spirits, wine, toilet waters or perfume to a total value not exceeding £5 if they are returning from Britain, Northern Ireland or the Continent of Europe.  If they are returning from countries outside Britain, Northern Ireland or the Continent of Europe they are permitted to bring in goods with a total value not exceeding £20 per adult and £5 per child.  I am not sure if the Senator requires details of the amounts allowed for visitors from other countries who may come here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to talk about this too.  I have been waiting&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the exact date but it is a considerable time which, I think, is the point the Senator has asked about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's point is that I think we have made many corrections in this House.  The Minister in his capacity as Minister for Finance has made allowances for inflation in very many respects.  I have a suspicion that it is high time, indeed, that these allowances were changed.  The allowances <Col N="2002" /> in regard to the amounts of tobacco were increased somewhat in recent years.  Perhaps, I should cite my own case.  I have a wife and five children and the expectation is, particularly among the five children, that Daddy will bring home something for everybody. Nowadays the £5 does not allow you any scope with regard to buying presents for the family.  Rather than having the position where people returning here would make their own adjustment for inflation on the £5 before going through the green channel, the Minister might consider altering this figure instead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am on the point of the allowances made at present, the Minister said we are allowed to bring into this country one bottle of normal size spirits and one bottle of normal size wine.  I do not want to go into a definition of how many fluid ounces are involved in this but I think the intention here was that a person should bring in a bottle of normal size and not a double-sized bottle.  There are bottles of particular types of liqueurs and of spirits which are slightly larger than the normal size.  I am not sure what the size is.  Say, it is 29 fluid ounces.  Somebody may find that his favourite liqueur or wine in a tax-free shop in a foreign airport is sold only in a size of 32 fluid ounces.  One goes to one of the well-stocked tax-free shops, such as Schipol Airport and sees not just a normal size but a variation of it.  We are not talking about an ordinary bottle of spirits, and a bottle of double size.  At one time people, perhaps, only tended to drink or bring home from holidays spirits from a narrow range.  Nowadays, when one sees a larger variety of liqueurs, people would naturally like to bring in an unusual liqueur, spirit or wine.  If the Minister examined this question, he would realise that a 10 per cent or 15 per cent increase in what is now defined as normal size would obviate a difficulty in this regard.  It is a problem.  I have been in the position of having to consult the card and put a bottle back on the shelf because it was a few fluid ounces above what we are permitted to carry in.  One could get over this by taking a small amount out of it, when coming through customs.  However, it <Col N="2003" /> might be preferable if the Minister could make a slight alteration to the regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator Dooge.  I have been waiting for an opportunity to speak on this section since I saw it in the Finance Bill.  It is quite ludicrous at present to expect anybody to return from a trip, whether it be a business trip or a holiday, with presents which are to total less than £5.</P>
      <P>Unlike Senator Dooge, I have no wife, and consequently no family.  Nonetheless, I still find that I am expected to bring home some presents and, quite frankly, the Minister knows as well as I do, that, if I were to arrive back with presents which came to a total value of less than £5, I might as well turn around on the doorstep and leave again for foreign parts on a permanent basis.  The last time I came back into the country, the Minister received a present from me of a bottle of Irish and a bottle of Scotch whiskey so I do not know how that will balance his Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator had better elaborate on that or it might be misinterpreted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>However, my bottles of whiskey are out there at the airport waiting for him.  Quite seriously, I consider that these allowances are hopelessly outdated.  The allowance in respect of tobacco is very reasonable. To be allowed to bring in 400 cigarettes is as fair as one might expect.  There is not much point really in quibbling about the allowance in respect of spirits but certainly the amount allowed in financial terms is clearly out of date by present day standards.  I am afraid that, of late especially, whether it is by accident or design&mdash;and I have been told this by others coming through the airport&mdash;the customs officers have been unusually diligent in investigating one's purchases and pricing them and querying the price that one tells them has been paid.  I agree with Senator Dooge that we should be realistic about this and increase it fairly substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister explain why the allowance which one may bring back <Col N="2004" /> from outside Britain or continental Europe should, for any reason, be greater than that which one may bring back from inside?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose that somebody on this side may say something. I am inclined to agree that the Minister might take a look at the £5 allowance at some future date because prices everywhere are inflated to such a great extent.  The other items, such as tobacco and spirits, are quite reasonable. They are not based on price but on quantity.</P>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Commissioners on the leaflet they produced about two years ago.  It is a very well set out leaflet giving an explanation of the situation very clearly and is very useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was answering Senator Dooge's query about what could be brought in although I mentioned normal sized bottles, I did not mention that these were given as examples.  The regulation in relation to spirits is one-sixth of a gallon, in relation to wine it is one-sixth of a gallon and in relation to toilet waters or perfume it is a half pint.  These are at least as generous as the internationally recommended allowances for such cases.  It is true that the figure of £5 has remained for quite a long time.  In that connection I shall ask Senators to remember two things: firstly, we have a land frontier with the six counties and this complicates the issue somewhat.  Secondly, I should remind Senators that duties have been falling steadily under the free trade area agreement and this has made an adjustment in relation to the fall in the value of money in the sense that if people have to pay duty on items coming in, the amount of duty they have to pay has gone down very substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The answer to the problems outlined by some Senators is to do what I have done.  It is rather ruthless but I have managed to train my family not to expect anything when I come home except myself.  I should remind the <Col N="2005" /> House that the object of this is to protect our industries and the workers in them against loss by undue imports. We try to balance that by giving a reasonable allowance to people returning from abroad.  However, any undue increase in this could have serious effects for some of our industries and I know that no Senator would want to see that happening.</P>
    <P>Although it does appear that there has not been any change in regard to the £5, as I have mentioned there has been an adjustment which has not increased the amount the person returning may take in but has reduced the amount of duty which somebody returning would have to pay if he exceeds the allowance I have indicated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>But because of inflation abroad the retail price of the items abroad happened to go up as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to look at the question of the size of a bottle.  It would be difficult for one to go round the airports of Europe looking for a bottle that was one-sixth of an imperial gallon.</P>
      <P>In Continental airports the size of bottles which are permitted to be imported into Ireland are listed at the same figure as that for many countries but it is less than that for some countries and less than the normal size of bottles for certain types of liquor.  I should be glad if the Minister would examine that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I talked about retrospective legislation in terms of imposing a new charge.  I said that I could not justify retrospectively applying taxation to people who had heretofore been acting within the law.  Clarifying and confirming the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;death duties&rdquo; is involved here.  The term &ldquo;death duties&rdquo; has been used as a general term to cover estate duty, legacy duty and succession duty.  It has also been used in various statutory instruments, for example, in relation to the transfer of Government securities in payment of death duties.  The term was defined as having this meaning in section 13 (3) of the Finance Act, 1894, but only for the purpose of that section.</P>
      <P>Some doubts have arisen as to whether it would necessarily be interpreted in the same sense elsewhere.  It is almost certain that it would but to remove any such doubts it is proposed that the term &ldquo;death duties&rdquo; be defined for all statutory purposes as having the meaning assigned to it in the 1894 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2007" /> To the extent that there is any question of retrospection here, it is merely confirming what the position was but it is not imposing any new charge, obligation or duty which did not exist before.</P>
    <P>Speaking on this section, Senator Russell had a query which I undertook to look into.  In reply to his query I wish to say that it is a fact that there is a shortage of trained staff in the Estate Duty Office.  This is due mainly to the leakage of trained personnel which is a problem common to all tax offices, both in this country and abroad.</P>
    <P>However, the Estate Duty Office was reorganised over a year ago and recruitment since then has been satisfactory so that the existing problem should right itself in the near future.  I want to make it clear that interest on duty is not charged for any period of delay in dealing with cases in the Estate Duty Office.</P>

Any of us who have been keeping an eye on the public Press recently will know that farms of 100 to 200 acres have been fetching from £40,000 to £150,000 consistently over the past few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With agricultural income and agricultural profits as they are, I do not think it would be possible for a farmer to be able to pay 41 per cent estate duty on a 200 acre farm unless he was <Col N="2009" /> lucky enough to be in the bloodstock business, but that is a different matter altogether.</P>
    <P>I am more interested in the ordinary farmer engaged in ordinary crop husbandry be it dairying or tillage.  The price of land has appreciated so much in the past two years that the assets of these farmers have skyrocketed but their family farm income has not kept pace with their assets.  While agricultural prices remain depressed this will cause hardship to quite a number of the farmers with 200 acres and more. This may not be appreciated by the urban population.</P>
    <P>Those who have been looking at farm prices recently, especially in the Leinster area, in the better-off parts of Kildare, in Meath and even in my own county, will find that a farm of 150 acres, if it is well situated, goes on the market for anything over £100,000.  In the event of the death of the owner of such a holding&mdash;it may be an old holding, the ownership may be changed or the property may be passed on to the son&mdash;it is not possible, with the farm economy as it has been for the past ten years and with the not very bright prospects for the immediate future, to pay £41,000 in estate or death duties.  The scale of increase here is too steep and until we get the agricultural position ironed out and until the price of land is levelled off many farmers will be in dire trouble.</P>
    <P>The Minister, on Second Reading, said that this legislation would only affect 10 per cent of the entire farming population.  I must take the Minister up on this figure.  In my own county, for example, there are 1,800 farmers whose valuation is in excess of £33, that is, 1,800 farmers who are liable to full rates.  These people contributed £452,000 in rates last year, while the rest of the community, which includes over 3,000 small farmers, contributed only £440,000 approximately.  There are fewer than half a dozen farms in my county in excess of 400 acres.  There may be one or two stud farms and, perhaps, some farms with a limited number of bloodstock or cross breeds but most are ordinary commercial holdings. When the owner of such a farm dies his family will be compelled, under this <Col N="2010" /> legislation, mainly because of the appreciation of their assets, to sell out the old holdings, whether they be old family holdings or not, because it will be impossible for them to meet the death duties which this Second Schedule lays out.</P>
    <P>If this legislation was left unchanged for one decade, practically every good farm would be scuttled.  When Mansholt came over here first, perhaps, the tune has changed somewhat since then, he was talking about larger and more economic units.  I believe that even the Land Commission appreciate that the time has come for a change in the size of a viable agricultural holding.  The Government have not given sufficient thought to this problem.  They should have been dealing with such problems over the past year if they are serious about letting our farmers compete with the European farmers.</P>
    <P>The Minister must, as a matter of urgency, consider some way of relieving ordinary agricultural holdings of this imposition.  Farmers and their sons are not like other sections of the community in that not many farmers' sons are paid wages or salaries.  They are members of a family unit or business. Some of them get pocket money depending on the amount of liquid assets available.  They work to improve their lot and their holding.  A farmer does not look upon the farm as his own personal property.  He looks upon it as a family concern.  One seldom hears a farmer say: &ldquo;This is my land or my horse or my plough&rdquo;, and this is where farmers differ from the rest of the community.  Farmers must have some concessions otherwise there will be a number of properties for sale.  There are very few farmers in this country who will be able to pay for and compete with the Europeans in the purchase of these holdings.</P>
    <P>I should like to warn the Minister that unless Irish farmers are left in their holdings, we will have, in this country, within the next decade a land war which will be fought more intensely than any we have had in the past.  The present legislation will adversely affect medium-sized farms.  Just because a farmer has what are the remains of a Georaian mansion, be it <Col N="2011" /> for good or evil, it has been fashionable to look upon him as a west Briton.  This is very far from the case.  In every county there are many farmers who have a few hundred acres and a reasonably well preserved house and even though the property has appreciated, they cannot possibly face the death duties and the charges that are in the Second Schedule to this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McDonald did a good deal of looking over at me when he was speaking.  We were both very active in the Young Farmers Association back in the fifties and the cry at that time was to get the father to sign over the farm to the son.  This is one of the best incentives for not holding on to the farm for too long.  In signing over a portion of the farm he is thereby spreading the load.  Under section 41 if the son is getting married the father would have an incentive to sign the farm over to him.  It may seem quite a sizeable amount but the number of people who are getting caught are quite few.  If one looks at the recent wills which appear in the newspapers one will see very few farmers.  One may see the odd retired farmer but they are mostly company directors.  I have often been surprised that more of them are not mentioned.  The farmer is a wise man and he has a way of spreading the load which very often the businessman has not.  He cannot divide his business unless he sets up a company and makes his family directors of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator McDonald has stated, even a farmer with 200 acres can go to the Land Commission and get that farm divided into four and if it is under one receivable order the Land Commission will accept four divides on it.  If he has four members in his family the farmer can portion it out.  Most farmers I know of with farms of that size have got two or three receivable orders because their farms have been built up over the years.  Quite a few of those farmers pride themselves on the fact that each generation added a little bit to the farm.  Farmers have been able to avoid being caught by death duties by signing over Murphy's farm to Johnny.  They usually bear the name of the person from whom they were <Col N="2012" /> originally bought.  Another farm might go to Mary or some other member of the family and one farm may quite likely be left to the wife, who usually gets the first one.  In that way a farmer cuts down his load and he also cuts down the rate of duty he would be assessed on.  Instead of having a 200-acre farm a farmer might have only 100 acres or even less depending on the way he divides it out.</P>
    <P>As the value goes down so also does the rate of income and the rate of duty payable.  We have a provision in this Bill where the widow is cleared of the first £1,500 of duty.  That would cover a £17,000 farm for the widow herself and £750 for every dependent child.  If you have a few children it can go up to about a £30,000 farm.  A farmer can sign over some of the farms to his wife and possibly to the son who will inherit, not necessarily the home farm but a farm adjoining the existing one.  If he has bought a big farm of 200 acres that is in one receivable order, which I doubt, he can go to the Land Commission and get it subdivided into several portions. They will always accept a farm of between 50 to 55 acres as an economic holding and will allow it to be subdivided and portions offered to the wife or son.  In that way he can save himself from being caught in the higher bracket. This is what farmers have been doing over the years so as to escape the very high death duties.</P>
    <P>In assessing a farmer's death duties one must take the debts first but if the farmer was paying a rent, which most farmers are, the rent still owing on the farm is taken off.  If he has got land projects or fertilisers under the credit scheme that is all deducted from the value of the farm plus whatever debts he has at the time of his death.  They all count.  The farmer has debts that are not usually accepted, particularly fertiliser, rent and if he had land improvements done.  An ordinary business has not.  I feel that the farmer has a fair case and has a chance of spreading his load in the ways I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not any farms and if Senator Crinion is in any difficulty he can get in touch with me and I will facilitate him.  On the Second Stage I referred, and would like to refer <Col N="2013" /> again briefly, to the situation regarding the percentage rate of duty once an estate exceeds £5,000.  It is free under £5,000 and there is a measure of duty depending on whether it is just a widow or a widow with one, two or three children.  I think I am speaking on behalf of the very large number of people who never become very wealthy but do make the effort to acquire a house of their own.  When the time comes for estate duty everybody will admit that today there are very few houses under £5,000 so that the rate of duty is almost automatically coming in.</P>
      <P>It would be excellent, of course, if the first £5,000 could be free of duty, but this would probably be a heavy burden on the Exchequer.  I would urge the Minister to take a look at the situation bearing in mind the sort of estates that run between the £5,000 and perhaps up to £20,000 or £25,000, with the idea at some future stage of considering stabilising the rate of duty on the first £5,000. By that I mean that the rate of duty starting over £5,000 is 1 per cent.  When it reaches over £20,000 it is 14 per cent. That is the thinking I should like to see in relation to this, particularly in view of the fact that the element of the population who provide their own homes must now become assessable almost automatically.  If they have saved throughout their lives to buy a home they are now assessable because of the value of their home.  If, at some future date, the Minister could consider a situation where the rate of duty up to say, £25,000 on the first £5,000 should not exceed 1 or 2 per cent rather than jumping to the 14 per cent, this would encourage a very large element in the community to buy their own homes and make provision for themselves.  They are the element in the community who gives us that sense of confidence in family selfrespect which is very necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The estate duty levels proposed here leave the existing rates unchanged up to £55,000.  Above that level the rates are increased rising from a maximum of 55 per cent on estates exceeding £200,000 in value.  The current scale with the maximum rate of 40 per cent on estates exceeding £100,000 in <Col N="2014" /> value has remained unchanged since 1961.  When they were changed at that time the maximum rate was 53 per cent. There was a deliberate policy decision taken to reduce them at that time.  The maximum rate here was fixed at half the maximum rate in Britain.  This was to test the theory which had been strongly advocated that by reducing or abolishing estate duty we would have a massive inflow of capital into this country.  The results of having half the maximum rate of the British rate do not show that that is so.  There was no noticeable result from having that rate.  However, we are only increasing the rates for estates of £55,000 and upwards.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the rates we are increasing above that value are below the effective British rate introduced this year.  If we make any comparison between our rates and those of Britain or any other country which has estate duty one has to allow for our abatements in respect of widows and dependent children referred to by Senator Crinion.  This trend of abatements does not exist anywhere and it is, in my view, a very progressive approach to this kind of tax or duty.  If we take into account the increase provided for in another section here in widows' and children's abatements, the effect of exemption limits under this Bill would now be as follows: where the widow is the only beneficiary, £15,300, that is an estate up to that would pay no duty at all. Where the estate passes to the widow and two dependent children the effective limit would be £21,429; in the case of a widow and four dependent children, £28,125; in the case of a widow and five dependent children, £33,343.  It will be seen from this that the limits are certainly not unreasonable in cases of that nature.  The case described by Senator Brugha would probably in the normal way involve a family where the children had grown up and there was only the widow left.  In that case the effective limit would be £15,300.  I agree that there is a case for considering the threshold at which duty becomes payable. Indeed I have in mind to examine this in the course of the present financial year to see if some improvement can be made in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the case made relating to <Col N="2015" /> the liability of farmers Senator Crinion has indicated some of the ways in which farmers would not become liable for estate duty&mdash;he has not indicated them all but he has indicated some of them. I would remind the House that in cases where farmers become liable for estate duty the law provides that for farmland, and not for any other kind of property, the duty may be paid by eight yearly or 16 half-yearly instalments, so that the idea of a farm to the value of £100,000 having to pay 41 per cent straight away, as Senator McDonald envisaged, does not arise.  In the rare case where such a farm becomes liable to duty the duty may be paid by instalments over eight years which is a concession which is not available in respect of any other property.  There would be interest payable.  In view of what was said not alone by Senator McDonald but by other Senators in this context I would like to say that the Revenue Commissioners do not know of any case whatever in which a farm had to be sold solely to pay duty.  In all cases in which farms were sold and duty was paid other things were paid too.  There was a share out to members of the family or debts were being paid, but they know of no case in which a farm had to be sold solely for the purpose of paying duty. Indeed this is understandable in the light of what I have said about the facilities of being able to pay by instalment.</P>
    <P>Senator MacDonald was sceptical about what I said concerning the number of farmers who pay duty.  If he listened carefully to Senator Crinion he will have gathered some of the reasons why what I said is true.  But let me tell him that an analysis of cases coming before the estate duty office in the years 1966, 1967 and 1968 gave a number of interesting statistics but the ones in which the House would be interested are these.  The farmer cases in which duty was paid as a percentage of dutiable cases was 3.6 in 1966, 3.2 in 1967 and 3.6 in 1968.  The non-farming cases in which duty was paid as a percentage of dutiable cases also were 96.4 in 1966, 96.8 in 1967 and 96.4 in 1968.  There are some other statistics but they all tell the same story.  Whatever the reasons, <Col N="2016" /> that is the position that has been obtaining.  It may be that Senator McDonald would say that with the increase in the value of land in recent years the percentages will change.  I will concede to him that this is possible but one can see from these figures that they would have to change enormously and radically before any real impact would be made on the farming community or call for any alteration in the rates of estate duty.  This should be borne in mind in any discussion of this or any other section in relation to farmland and its liability for duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I am forced to take a lot of what Senator Crinion says with a grain of salt because he knows right well that it is not possible for a farmer to apportion off or divide his land without the explicit permission of the Land Commission.  In addition, it is not possible even for them to create an economic viable holding.  Therefore you would want to have a great farm to settle 100 acres on each of half a dozen sons.  You would want to have 600 acres because the Land Commission will not divide farms into units of less than 100 acres at the present time.  It is with great reluctance that they will even divide a site for a plot.  Also I am not surprised at the Minister's figure of 96 per cent of the total who are paying estate duty.  I am not surprised at this figure because it is exactly what I expected.  The Minister is admitting at last that the farming community are not as wealthy as the urban dwellers would lead us to believe.  That is what is frightening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McDonald is worried about the liability to estate duty of people who are probably worth £100,000 and upwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmers do not want to move from the places in which their families have lived for generations and they are being forced to squat on the one spot.  Unfortunately we do not all live in Kildare and this is the snag. The Minister might look sympathetically at the case of widows of 65 years and <Col N="2017" /> over.  People in that category are pensionable and if their partner in life dies at that stage perhaps the Government might forego estate duty for a few years so that the widow would have a comfortable income.  While I know there is a reasonably generous allowance for widows, would the Minister consider in addition to that giving a special concession from an age point of view? There is not much point in skinning an old widow of 70 years for estate duty and leaving her not so financially well off for the remainder of her closing years.  It is something that we might do something about.</P>
      <P>The ordinary people who have made a sacrifice and built their own homes, perhaps with the aid of a mortgage over their working years, deserve a little better consideration.  The State bends over backwards with regard to the poorer sections of the community.  We should give better recognition to those who put their backs into the work and provide decent homes for themselves and their families.  In this context I agree with Senator Brugha that the £5,000 is not very generous a figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McDonald referred to me with reference to dividing up the farms.  From my recollection of big farms, and I know two counties reasonably well, very few of these farms have only one receivable order.  It was only the old landlord farms that would have those.  Most of the other big farms have been built up over the years by buying a piece of adjoining land here and there or a little bit down the road from them.  The percentage under one receivable order would be exceptionally small.  For that reason, whether the farm has only 20 acres under the receivable order or 100 you can transfer the one receivable order.</P>
      <P>In that way the father is always able to apportion some of the land, usually the piece outside and not the actual receivable order on which the home is built.  In that way he can pass on some of it to his wife or to his family. Farmers on the whole have been very conscious of estate duties and death duties over the years and that is why they have all made provision for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2018" /> Another aspect is that when you own property you have a duty as well.  The farm provides another job for the successor just by his right of being the son or nephew of the owner of the farm. If a person was in the position of having roughly the same income in a factory or in a business his son would not have the right to succeed to his job.  Take the case of a farmer who is getting £1,000 out of his farm.  His son or newphew, or whoever he gives it to, automatically gets that.  If he were working in industry the son or successor to his estate would not get that job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just making the point that there is an obligation on a person who owns property to look to whoever is going to succeed him and in that way few of them are caught in the net.  Although some estates have a high valuation many of the people who are liable to be caught in that high net of anything from 33 per cent to 55 per cent still make the provision of passing on part of the farm so as to spread the load.  That is why the percentage is small.  With 3 or 4 per cent of the amount that is paid, even allowing that it increases a little with the increased value of land, they still have a long way to go to become even 50-50.</P>

      <P>This is a technical section really.  Basically what it involves is this, that an executor is liable to account for duty in respect of any assets he has received as executor.  There can be assets which he does not receive as executor which go to a trustee as a trustee and so on.  If I could take an example: a person is domiciled here and he makes revocable settlements of personal property and appoints a foreign trustee.  There is no way of recovering duty on the property except by an action against the Irish executor. If the personalty which comes into the hands of the Irish executor is small he cannot pay, or cannot be expected to pay, any more than he receives.  Therefore, he cannot pay the duty.  In fact, it is an anti-avoidance measure more than anything else that is dealt with here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This six-year period is analogous to a number of other similar periods in the estate duty code.  For instance, all property when assessed to duty by the Revenue Commissioners, is, in fact, provisionally assessed, unless there is a special assessment and there is a procedure for that.  For six years after the death that assessment can be re-opened by the Revenue Commissioners and increased or decreased. There is also a similar six-year period in respect of the artificial value in relation to agricultural land.  It is a kind of common period that runs through the estate duty code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for asking that question is that six years seems to be a rather long period within which the case can be re-opened. Family circumstances could change very rapidly in less than six years and the family might discover that they were seriously financially embarrassed and had no option but to sell the objects of national, scientific, historic or artistic interest in order to remain solvent.  Does the Minister not think, on that account, that the length of time is pretty harsh?</P>

In those circumstances, and having regard to what I said about the six year period in other connections, I do not think it is unreasonable.  In the genuine case there is no effort to evade duty.  If the property is sold, duty is paid on the value and the person is not complaining because he is not trying to avoid duty.  The person who would be complaining is the person who has been using this exemption to try to evade liability for duty.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this section is to counter a device for avoiding estate duty whereby the property is transferred to a donee and then leased back to the donor by the donee.  There were provisions to deal with this kind of operation in different Acts in the past, starting with the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1891.  Arising out of the various changes that have been made, including those made in the Finance Act, 1961, a situation arose where the effect of section 28 of the 1961 Act was to leave section 2 (1) (b) of the Finance Act, 1894&mdash;one which taxed interest ceasing on the death&mdash;to operate on the cessor of any interest ceasing on the death of the deceased. Instead of duties being charged on the entire property transferred, duty is chargeable on a slice of the property, the slice being that proportion of the <Col N="2022" /> capital value of the porperty which the income derived from the property bears to the total income of the property.  I do not know whether that is clear.</P>
      <P>If we take an estate which is yielding an income, say, of £5,000 a year, the person who has the interest in which we are concerned is getting from that property an income of £1,000 a year. For the purpose of estate duty he is deemed to have property worth one-fifth. If the capital value was, say, £100,000 of the capital value this would amount to £20,000.  This was done on the basis of providing relief but it can be availed of to avoid duty by the grant and lease back device.  If A gives property to B and B leases back the property to A for a fixed term and A survives that grant by five years there is no interest limit to cease on the death of A, coming under the 1894 Act and section 28 of the 1961 Act which prevents a claim attaching to the entire property.  If, therefore, the owner of the lands conveys them to his son, who then leases them back to the father for ten years, the lands are liable to duty only if the father dies within five years of the original gift.  If the father survives the gift by five years he dies possessed of the unexpired period of the lease only and this may have practically no value for estate duty purposes.  The man has a valuable property; he is nominally giving it away, but he is having the full use of it for his life and it remains, for all practical purposes, his property.  However, when he dies virtually no duty is payable.  This is one example, but there are other examples of the kinds of things that are being done in this way. The object of this section is to close that loophole which has emerged, and has been used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>In this particular section the Minister has an opportunity of substantially amending this legislation, which would save us a lot of bother later on.  By improving the ceiling on the artificial value and increasing it from the present £2,500 upwards, the Minister would perhaps exclude a number of farmers from the scope of the death duty net altogether.  Holdings, the value of which, calculated on the artificial value is less than the figure of £2,500 are not even considered for estate duty at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he is really serious in continuing this.  The rural cottages of his colleague the Minister for Local Government at present are costing in excess of £3,000. What type of a farm, including chattels, goods and assets totalling only £2,500, does the Minister visualise?  It is quite obvious that the Minister wants to bring in everything in excess of the value of an agricultural labourer's cottage. Perhaps the Revenue Commissioners want to keep themselves extremely busy and keep their jobs.  However, if they are sincere they will dispose of a lot of cases that are obviously cluttering up their desks at present.  This artificial value should be drastically increased. There is no point in having highly paid and highly qualified civil servants wasting their time, harassing unfortunate people whose total assets are only slightly in excess of £2,500.  The four <Col N="2024" /> walls of the house will cost that much, then add goods and chattels to that.  If the Minister agrees to multiply that figure by at least four, we might then be able to talk business and he would be bringing the figure in line with 1970 perspective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I queried this six-year provision in an earlier section and I think it applies again in this section.  The Minister had the case made to him by Deputy Clinton in the other House, in relation to a problem that is rather peculiar to County Dublin, and that would be the five-year revisions of the development plan.  Land which would have only a very definite value now, by virtue of the action of the local authority in five years time in deciding to redesignate land usages, might be changed in value to a ridiculous degree.  Can the Minister see any way around that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The value in question is the value of the land at the date of death.  If something occurs after the death during the six-year period which enhances the value of the land, that does not enhance the amount of duty that has to be paid.  The duty has to be related to the value of the land at the date of death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if the land is sold within the six-year period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  On the general questions raised I should like to point out that this limit&mdash;by the way it is £2,000, not £2,500&mdash;was fixed in 1969. I should also point out that it is not a question of people having property valued at less than £2,000; it is an artificial valuation and follows the formula of multiplying the Poor Law Valuation by £25, deducting the capitalised value of the Land Commission annuity and also deducting any debts which exceed the value of, say, the stock and so on, or if there was an overdraft, the deficiency in the personalty. If then the end result brings you under £2,000, that is the value of the property for that purpose.  However, if it does not bring you under £2,000, the market value of the land comes into play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2025" /> I do not wish to delay the House now, but contrary to what Senator McDonald thinks, duty has been evaded.  In the discussion on this section in Dáil Éireann I gave them some examples.  I shall briefly mention four cases in which I do not think that there was any deliberate attempt at evasion. There may have been, but I do not think there was in these cases; there were others that were more blatant.  The first case was one in which lands were sold for £18,800 and the net value of the estate was £17,500 but no duty was paid.  In another case estate duty was paid at £98, where the real value of the lands was £22,000.  In a further case no duty was paid and the lands were sold, within two years of the death, for £17,050, and in a still further case no duty was paid and the lands were sold within two years of the death for £110,000.  In these cases I do not think that there was an effort to avoid duty. The situation is worse where the effort was made to avoid duty, so let us not run away with the idea that this artificial value only applies to very small farms.  It is clear that it does not.  This, in addition to some of the things mentioned by Senator Crinion earlier, explains why so few farms become liable to death duties.  The reason for the proposal in this section to charge duty, if the land is sold within six years of the death, is that this particular artificial valuation has been in the law for a long time with the purpose of helping to preserve the family plan, and to preserve the family on the land.  This is a purpose to which we all subscribe and would wish to continue.  However, if the land is transferred, say, from a father to a son, and within six years the son sells it then the whole object that was being sought to be achieved&mdash;to retain the family on the land&mdash;is defeated.  The son has sold the land, he has got the proceeds of the sale in his pocket and I do not see why he should not pay duty the same as anybody else.</P>
    <P>As long as the object of the exercise is being achieved, that is, that the family are being retained on the land then, by all means, this artificial valuation should apply for that purpose.  If that is not being done, there is no reason why the duty should not be paid as in every other case.</P>
    <Col N="2026" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister to a point.  Several times he has mentioned Land Commission annuities. At least three-quarters of the Land Commission annuities will be paid in full within this decade.  This may sound high but under the older Acts under which the vast majority of the farms are leased from the Land Commission, the 1924 and the 1933 Acts, annuities are petering out in this decade, so that in any one farm the amount outstanding would be only a matter of pounds.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, even if there is a new bungalow on a small farm the valuation on the buildings alone will be in excess of £20.  This multiplied by 25 brings it up to almost half the amount and then add the chattels to that, such as a tractor, a few implements and a cow which would command a price in excess of £100 at present.  The Minister's figure of £2,000 is inadequate.  People are being brought in and being subjected to unnecessary worry.</P>
      <P>If the person who inherits the place has no interest in it and wants to live it up, by all means, he should pay his fair share of taxation.  It does not matter whether he pays duties or customs and excise, he should not be allowed to spend it free of tax.  This figure is altogether too low and it does not take into account improvements and the cost of machinery and the cost of stock.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly detest the idea of writing solid figures into legislation of this kind.  Obviously the commissioners and the civil servants and the draftsmen, the Minister and his Department are all unaware of the high rate of inflation.  Inflation for the past couple of years has been running to at least 10 per cent.  This time next year that figure, if it is possible to hold it at the present 10 per cent, will only be worth £4,500.  The year after that it will only be £4,000.  The Minister is cutting things altogether too fine.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Government want to treat the rural and farming population with dire contempt.  Even with the explanation we had on the Second Schedule it is still not sufficient to meet the present demand.  If this egislation is to serve for even two years, unless the Minister agrees to recommendations Nos. 1 and 3, he will be causing a completely unnecessary burden on a tremendous number of farmers in the Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would all hope to see Irish agriculture entering the EEC on a reasonably sound basis.  Yet the Government have made no effort, good, bad or indifferent to assist farming.  We have had no legislation over the past year to <Col N="2029" /> bring our policies into line or to assist the industry.  The inadequate provisions in section 41 have failed to realise the fast appreciation in the value of land throughout the Republic.  This will cause trouble to thousands of farmers during the next couple of years.  With a rate of 10 per cent inflation only, this £5,000 will be gone in three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my interjection at the beginning I cannot agree to these recommendations.  I have indicated very briefly the reason for this. Let me point out that the figure of £5,000 is in line with the general estate duty exemption limit of £5,000 which was fixed under the Finance Act, 1961 and the special exemption limit of £5,000 provided by section 24 of the 1965 Act in respect of death benefits payable to a widow or a dependent child under a superannuation scheme.</P>
      <P>This limit here differs from those other limits I have mentioned in one very important respect.  If those limits are exceeded, the entire estate or death benefit under superannuation becomes liable to estate duty.  If, for example, the total estate is £10,000 or the total death benefit is £10,000, the entire £10,000 becomes liable to duty.</P>
      <P>In the case of gifts made in consideration of marriage, it is only the excess over £5,000 which becomes liable.  This is a very valuable concession. A gift which is not made in consideration of marriage becomes fully liable to duty and agregatable with the rest of the estate, if it exceeds £500.  A gift in consideration of marriage is free from duty and from aggregation, unless it exceeds £5,000.  If it does exceed £5,000, the first £5,000 of the gift will be, as I indicated, free from duty and aggregation.  This is a very valuable concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that there are few people in our community who are in a position to make gifts of £5,000 to each of their children on marriage or otherwise, so that we are here concerned with a tiny fraction of our community.  Even then we are concerned only with those who make such a gift and who die within five years of making it.  That is, if they live for <Col N="2030" /> five years, then there is no duty payable. So we are concerned with a tiny minority of a tiny minority.  The suggestion that all the farmers will go to the wall because of this is just ludicrous and I hope it will not be repeated.</P>
    <P>We have already indicated that estate duty on farmers is minimal, but the impact of this on farmers is far, far less, for the reasons I have mentioned.  I suggest we ought to see how this limit of £5,000 operates in practice and if it transpires at a later stage, because of a fall in the value of money or otherwise, that it should be increased, then we can have another look at it.  At present the limits imposed here are not ungenerous and I could not agree to accept these recommendations.</P>

      <P>It may be the Meath way of doing it but some of us still have to put some work into it.  It is not just a matter of a gift.  If you work for 40 years in a place without wages, without a union card and all the other benefits workers usually have, it is a horse of a different colour.  You cannot equate a farmer's son with a worker, the way of life and the background is completely different.  Farmers have a different outlook on life.  They work to improve their holding, to improve their home and the pious hope of most farmers is that when they pass on they will leave their ancestral home in better condition to those following them than it was when they inherited it.  This penal clause in unnecessary.  As the Minister places little value on it and keeps repeating that so few people are involved why is he bothering with this section of the community at all?  I think only 3 per cent of farmers are paying at all.</P>

The Minister has already conceded that the high rate of inflation will make that figure ridiculously small, even in two years time.  We have an opportunity of effecting an improvement here because the Dáil will be sitting for the next <Col N="2032" /> two or three weeks and it should be possible for the Minister to have the recommendation agreed to.</P>

      <P>Senator McDonald mentioned the farmers' sons staying at home on the farm and getting pocket money.  I think that day is gone.  He is thinking in the past.  If the farmer's son is not getting much the same in wages as his counterpart in industry, he will not stay on the farm.  He must have the same facilities as his friends with whom he associates.  The farmer will have to make some settlement early on, if he wishes to keep his son on the farm.  Speaking of the £5,000 it must be remembered that this pertains to marriage.  He can still sign over the farm quite cheaply at the 10s stamp duty.  He would have to pay the big stamp duty if he were signing over the farm at another time.  The dowries we used to hear about are not so much in evidence now.</P>

      <P>The girls are more independent.  They go out to work and are not so tied down.  The dowry was some compensation for the work that the girl did in the home before she got married.  It was a payment.  It also made her prospects more attractive if the word got around that there was a certain amount of money there for whoever married her.  The dowry also had the function that it would settle a sister or brother living on the farm she was marrying into.</P>

      <P>With modern times it has become more realistic.  People want to be independent and have their own life and their own money.  You no longer have sons of 24, 25 or 30 asking their father for a few quid and going off somewhere.  This would have been more practical about ten or 15 years ago than it is today and it has not the same bearing.  Now with the existing high rate of duty the father will have settled some of the land on his son at an earlier age.</P>

It is to avoid very wealthy people taking advantage of a situation where a child is getting married.  They settle on him a large slice of their property.  They know that if they die the very next day no duty will be payable. It is to deal with that situation, but to preserve the <i>status quo,</i> we are doing it.

      <P>Of the bulk of gifts made in consideration of marriage these in three recent years have averaged 81 a year and do not exceed £5,000....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words the gifts made in consideration of marriage are averaging 81 a year and they do not exceed £5,000. If that is the case, surely the Minister is anticipating that the gifts made in consideration of marriage which do exceed £5,000 would probably be less than that. If the Minister is able to give us the information that they averaged 81 a year under £5,000 for the past three years, why can he not give us the information <Col N="2034" /> as to what they averaged over £5,000?</P>

If we were only going to get £1 out if it, the point is that we should not allow people to avail of this, which is designed for another purpose, to get out of duty where other people have to pay it.

      <P>In subsection (2), line 26, to delete &ldquo;£1,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£2,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>By and large, the argument in this instance is the same.  In this case this should not be a definite figure on account of the inflationary trends and the ridiculous state of the health of our economy.  This figure should be related in some way to the galloping inflation we have got.  Even if the Minister thinks that £1,000 is all right this year, it certainly is going to be much less next year and in three or four years we are back at square one again. Therefore, this figure should at least be doubled or, alternatively, that figure should be tied to some other scale, either to the value of the £ or find some other vehicle to maintain the concession the Minister says he is giving but which I find very hard to see.

      <P>I have to display my abysmal ignorance in these things.  Is it not usual for the section to lay down the fact that a penalty of up to this figure may be imposed by the courts on conviction?  As the section stands some mythical body is going to impose the penalty.  When I read it first I thought the Revenue Commissioners were going to be given the arbitrary power to start imposing penalties in relation to their own cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>To verify what I have said I would refer the Senator to subsection (8).  It says that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners may in their discretion, mitigate any <Col N="2037" /> penalty under this section, or stay or compound any proceedings for the recovery thereof, and may also, after judgment, further mitigate or entirely remit the penalty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's order of priorities again appear to be rather wonky in this case because they provide for penalties of no less an order than of £500.  Even in various pieces of criminal legislation we do not have penalties of that magnitude. Money appears to be the only thing that is dear to the Minister's heart and to the heart of the Government.  This is a great mistake.  Seemingly it is now a much greater offence to delay paying one's death duties&mdash;for instance, if a bank manager makes a mistake or is caught off-side in one of these transactions&mdash;than it would be to be negligent and contravene the Firearms Act, where the penalties are not as high.</P>

      <P>I cannot undertake to do that in relation to this Bill.  It is a somewhat changing situation in that, although there are a number of people from whom tax is being deducted week by week, there are also many thousands who have gone back.  I think when it has been operated a little longer it will have settled down to a certain pattern. At that stage I would undertake to suggest to the Minister for Social Welfare that he might look at the possibility of applying this suggestion then, when the scheme is working clearly.</P>

      <P>This is an unfair request from the Leader of the House. Since the Minister does not need the Bill until mid-August and the House will meet before then it is unfair to ask not only Members, but also the staff, to work on indefinitely.  Since the Minister has three weeks before he needs the Bill, it is unfair to rush it through now.</P>

I made it quite clear to everybody that the House intended to finish these Bills.  The discussion we have had, and its quite wide scope ought to be satisfactory enough and I would suggest that Opposition Members ought to be reasonable in the circumstances.</P>

We have met the wishes of the Leader of the House by carrying on the business, but Senator Alexis FitzGerald should be given a chance to deal with matters which he raised on Committee Stage and hoped to deal with later.

      <P>It may be necessary to recommit the Bill in regard to one particular section and I should like to raise that point now.

      <P>This has arisen because the House moved from section 29 to section 30 before the fact had been adverted to.  It is a relatively simple question which had been asked of the Minister and has not been answered.  It is a question which, surely, he is willing to answer.  I think the most appropriate way in which to do this is to recommit section 29.</P>
