    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 8, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made a number of points on this section.  I have a few more points to make on the section and I will deal with these points in any way the House would prefer.  I propose to make all my points on the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="952" /> The first point is, I think, the most important point.  I direct the attention of the House to subsection (5), which states:</P>
    <P>Where, in relation to a unit trust scheme, there is a contravention of or failure to comply with a provision of an order under this section (other than a provision relating to a matter specified in paragraph (f) or (i) of subsection (2) of this section), the manager and the trustee under the scheme and, where the contravention or failure relates to the publishing of any document, the person who publishes the document, and any person who procures such publishing, shall each be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>I cannot make this point without inviting the House to look also at section 20.  If I understand that section correctly it means that the offence will also be committed, in the case of an offence by a body corporate, by any director, manager, secretary, member of any committee of management or other controlling authority of such body or official of such body.</P>
    <P>This section contains provisions for the making by the Minister of orders prohibiting or regulating the publishing by or on behalf of the manager of advertisements or documents containing any statement with respect to the sale price of the units and various other matters, unless the advertisement or document in question also contains a statement of the yield from the units and statements giving such information in relation to such other matters, if any, as may be specified in the order.</P>
    <P>There is another paragraph of subsection (2) which similarly requires to be complied with in any advertisement which is published.  This is to break into new territory and to render it obligatory on newspapers or any other media which may be used to communicate an advertisement with regard to the unit trust, to be informed in a specialised way with the provisions of the Unit Trusts Bill, and in a specialised way with any orders or regulations made by the Minister under it.  This is completely new ground.</P>
    <P>I should like to direct the Minister's <Col N="953" /> attention and the attention of the House to the very careful language used in the Companies Act which provides for offences where prospectuses do not comply with the requirements of the Companies Act.  The persons who are liable in relation to these offences are the director or other persons responsible for the prospectus, in the one case.  In the case of a crime&mdash; that is in section 44&mdash;the liability is on any person who authorised the issue of the prospectus.  There is no question of a newspaper editor, or the director of a newspaper company, or the manager of a newspaper company being required to know anything about company law; or being required to know whether the law with regard to comcompanies is being complied with when they take an advertisement for the publication of a prospectus.</P>
    <P>As this section is drafted I am confident that this is what was intended. It would seem to me that an offence will be committed if in fact any person publishes a document which does not contain the information that the Minister requires should be in the document, or which contains any information which should not be in the document. For example, any person who procures the publication, the agent who might be employed, the director or the manager of this company&mdash;might all be rendered guilty of offences by this section.</P>
    <P>The instinctive reaction of people who do not think in this way&mdash; Senators with my training happen to&mdash; is that they may say: &ldquo;This is all rot; they are not going to be prosecuted for this; it will be the people who prepared the advertisement who will be prosecuted.&rdquo;  That is all very well, but they will be guilty of offences. They will be liable to be prosecuted and susceptible to receive the punishments which are set out in another section of the Bill, section 19, into which I need not go.  However, I should like to make this general comment: there is a variety of different types of offences capable of being committed by a breach of section 8. There is no variety in the fines or other punishments which may be meted out to these persons who commit those <Col N="954" /> offences.  This is a matter of importance and is also a matter very easily remedied. It is simply a question of amending the language in subsection (5) to deal with that particular point.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer.  Perhaps there is no harm in making a point which will make it clear that my interest in this matter is entirely one of having good legislation.  I am in no way concerned with making life easy for the managers of unit trusts.  There is no provision in this section or in this Bill&mdash; it seems to me that it is on this section that I should make this point&mdash;for rendering civilly liable a manager who makes an untrue statement, misleading the public in making an advertisement. The Jenkins Committee report on these matters recommended strongly that there ought to be a civil remedy.  I would therefore recommend that investors in units trusts here get the benefit of the best and most up-to-date advice in regard to this.  They have such remedy available to them if they subscribe to shares that are issued by an Irish public company here; they can take action against every person who is a director of the company, every person who has authorised himself to be named in the prospectus as a director, every person being a promoter of the company, and every person who authorises the issue of the prospectus.</P>
    <P>I am not going to trouble the House with the full and unreasonable reading of section 49 of the Companies Act, except to say that this section&mdash;a most carefully drawn section&mdash;provides protection for persons who were innocent of the mistakes which had given rise to the civil remedy.  There should be civil remedy, but civil remedy along the lines of section 49 of the Companies Act, 1963.  The civil remedy which is in this Act is paralleled by a similar provision in the Northern Ireland Act of 1960, and by a similar provision in the 1948 Act in England, and is recommended to be in new legislation with regard to unit trusts in Britain.  We ought to take advantage of their experience.  I cannot see any reason why they should have less rights than people who invest in public companies. Indeed, I should have thought <Col N="955" /> that these smaller people, being less in touch with people who give them good advice, should if anything have greater rights.  They certainly should have equal rights.  People who invest in unit trusts should be given all the rights that persons who invest in public companies do not have.</P>
    <P>My third point is in reference to subsection (2), paragraphs (c) and (d). Here the Minister is taking power to provide that advertisements or documents should contain various kinds of statements and so on.  I should like to know why we do not now have before the House what these statements are going to be.  We would have the advantage of being able to debate them. When the Companies Act was being enacted the two Houses debated it very fully and comprehensively.  As a result of their debate, they produced a very much better piece of company legislation than prevails in Britain.  We would now be able to debate the statements which should be contained and which will be in the order.  There is no good saying that the order can be annulled when we know that the order will not be annulled.  Let us face a political fact.</P>
    <P>Having made an order no Minister can come into this House and allow it to be annulled, unless there is something utterly crazy in it.  We are not going to expect such to be the position. Now is the time for us to hear from the Minister what matters ought to be in the advertisements, and now is the time to have a debate on them.  I should like to give the House an idea of the sort of things that might well be in the advertisements.  At this point I should invite anyone who has anything else to do to go and do it, because I shall be going on for quite a while. Unfortunately, the Minister has his obligations which I know he will perform.</P>
    <P>The advertisement should contain a specimen portfolio of the equity securities, together with a statement of the proportion to the other securities in which it is proposed to invest.  Or if it does not contain that, it should contain a statement setting out the investment objectives and proposed methods <Col N="956" /> of achieving them.  For the information of anyone who wants to follow this, it is useful to get a short summary of this on the record.  I have referred to it already in my Second Reading speech. It is the <i>Rules of the Association of Unit Trust Management in the United Kingdom.</i></P>
    <P>The second point is that, where there is an invitation to the public to subscribe to what they call a block offer&mdash;that is one which would be issued after the first one&mdash;which contains any reference to one security or another security, it must give the complete list of securities.  When you think about that you see the wisdom of it, because you could pick out your star performers and tell the public that you had invested in these and be very quiet about the ones in which you lost money.  This is more or less what all those who talk about the stock exchange do: they tell you about their successes and they do not tell you about their failures, which very often outweigh their successes, particularly the people who are given to talking about their stock exchange investments.</P>
    <P>The third point is that the advertisement should contain a statement of the objectives of the trust.  Capital growth, for example, would be one objective; another trust might be income; another trust might be a balance of both.  Another point is that the advertisement should not suggest that if you do not come in quickly you will not be able to get units; in other words, implying that there is a scarcity of available units, encouraging people to get excited by the news that there is a terrific new trust and to get in quickly. The advertisement might contain, for example, a statement to the effect that the price of units and the income from them may go down as well as up, reminding the public of what many of them may need to be reminded of.  This is not law here, but it is a stock exchange requirement, and in that sense it has the same effect as law. When you are issuing a prospectus you have to put something on the top of it to the effect that statements or expressions of opinion quoted in any advertisement must be those of the whole board of the managing company. <Col N="957" /> Everybody is responsible and anybody who does not agree, if he is in a minority, off he goes before that statement carries his name in support.</P>
    <P>If the quoted yield as is proposed under the Bill is an estimate, as presumably it must be, it must state its nature, whether it is a gross yield or a net after tax yield.  Where you have a block offer, which is to say that for a particular period the units are available at a particular price, the offer should contain a statement to the effect that, after the current price closes, units may be bought at the current daily price.  In other words: &ldquo;Do not worry about this block offer; you still have an opportunity of buying these at the current daily price which is quoted for the units in question.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another point which might be provided for in this Bill, as I think it ought to be, is that the name, style, title or description given to or required by a unit trust is not or does not become misleading to the public in relation to the objectives or portfolio of such unit trust.</P>
    <P>A further point of considerable importance is that every statement should contain a proposition to the effect that units trusts are medium-or long-term investments, that this is not a suitable vehicle for people who want to get their money back very quickly.  This is not equivalent to a deposit, and if they want their money back they will run the risk of getting less back than they put in.</P>
    <P>Finally, with regard to what might be in the statement, no advertisement should contain any disparaging reference to another unit trust.  Neither should any comparison be made with another unit trust or other unit trusts unless the comparison distinguishes between the differing objectives and portfolios of the unit trust or unit trusts under comparison.</P>
    <P>I have taken the liberty of giving these absolutely derivative propositions merely to indicate that this is the sort of thing which I should like to see in an appendix to this Bill, so that we would then be looking at the language in which it is all expressed. Different Members of the House might have different ideas as to what ought <Col N="958" /> to be in the advertisement or in what would be the equivalent of a prospectus, and the House would be able to have a full debate on it.  This would be advantageous to the measure itself and enable it to be a better measure.</P>
    <P>Might I, fourthly, refer to subsection (2) (g)?  This is a small but valid drafting point, which, I think, requires a follow-through throughout the document. I hope I am correct in this.  Section 6, subsection (4), includes in a unit trust scheme something other than a trust, and the Minister described what he had in mind with regard to that&mdash; the sort of arrangements they have in certain places on the Continent where you can have the equivalent of trusts but where, generally, trust is an idea of the Anglo-Saxon system and is not a continental one.  But you could have something which was equivalent to a unit trust, though organised in such a way that it did not create a trust.</P>
    <P>May I refer the House to subsection (2) (g) where the Minister by order:</P>
    <P>may provide that the deed in which are expressed the trusts created in pursuance of the scheme shall make provision, to the satisfaction of the Minister, in relation to such of the requirements of the order as may be specified in the order.</P>
    <P>Surely, if that paragraph is to remain, or if it is desired that it should remain, the words: &ldquo;the deed in which are expressed the trusts created&rdquo; should go on to say: &ldquo;or the legal instrument giving rise to the arrangements which under subsection (4) (c) of section 6 are regarded as a unit trust scheme&rdquo;? There may be no deed.  If you have something which is a unit trust scheme because it is deemed to be such under section 6, there may be no deed of trust at all, but the Minister may want to provide that whatever is the legal instrument containing the equivalent of the deed will contain certain matters. My thinking on all of this is that we should set out as much as possible in the Bill, but the Minister must retain residual power to add further burdens on the managers of unit trusts.  This seems to me to require a change in drafting and worth referring to.</P>
    <P>With regard to subsection (4) (c), frankly, I am not sure that I understand <Col N="959" /> what is here intended.  I think I understand it as meaning that a registered unit trust in being obliged to conform with the provisions as to the proportion of the assets to be invested in Irish securities can look at securities that are not Irish and invest in them, provided they carry on part of their business in Ireland.  If they do carry on part of their business in Ireland, the Minister will determine what proportion of that business constitutes the proportion of the holding of that company which can be regarded as Irish.  I think this is what it is.  If that be so, I have a small point to make.  Should it not include &ldquo;subsidiaries of such companies&rdquo;, the shares of which might in fact be available to be taken up by the manager in question under perhaps special arrangements he might make with the parent?  This is not a point which I should emphasise too much because, quite frankly, I lack the understanding of the intention of paragraph (c).  Therefore, I may be completely wide of the mark with regard to what I have just said.  That was my point.</P>
    <P>It is not clear to me as to what is intended in subsection (4) (c) (iii).  What is meant by the word &ldquo;issue&rdquo;?  My understanding of it is that it is construed differently according to the different places in the Bill in which it is found.  For example, does it mean that a nuclear company can come over here and issue their shares by sealing them in Dublin.  I should like to get some clear information on this.  In my opinion it is important.  With regard to subsection (4), where the Minister makes an estimate under paragraph (b) and expresses an opinion under paragraph (c), how does he make the estimate? I have already expressed that point, so I will not dwell on it, but I have not made this point with regard to paragraph (c).</P>
    <P>For example, can the Minister vary that opinion from year to year?  On what basis can he vary it?  How is the unit trust manager to know what proportion of the business the Minister is regarding a particular company as conducting in this State?  I do not think what is proposed is anything other than a liberal approach to the problems of the unit trust manager.  I should have <Col N="960" /> thought that the manager must be given notice if the Minister's opinion has changed in regard to the proportion of the business as having been conducted in the State and, therefore, the proportion being available for investment as being Irish.  What degree of notice must the manager get of this change of opinion.  It is only fair that he should get some notice of the change of opinion, as the company could be conducting their business on a very extensive basis during the year and, as we know, they could curtail their business very sharply.  Therefore, the manager should be given ample notice of the change of opinion, because what he previously regarded as the percentage would be a much lesser percentage.</P>
    <P>I have two more general points regarding this section, but I am afraid that I am repeating myself in referring to them.  It should be set out in as clear a way as possible what the unit trust managers have to comply with.  Paragraph 309 of the Jenkins Report states:</P>
    <P>In our opinion it was not unreasonable, in early attempts at control, that these wide discretionary powers should have been vested in the Board of Trade since it would probably have been very difficult at that stage to devise clearly defined and limited statutory rules.  Moreover the present system has in practice worked reasonably well and the Unit Trust movement has an enviable record of fair and honest dealing over the whole of its life.  We also think that the Board of Trade have exercised their wide powers with moderation.  Nevertheless, we have come to the conclusion that the present system is open to objection to two counts.  First, on principle, we doubt the wisdom of leaving control completely within the unfettered discretion of the Board of Trade; we think that it should now be possible for the latter, with the experience of the last thirty years, to draft precise rules for unit trusts which would be of general application and subject to Parliamentary approval.</P>
    <P>The precise recommendation of the Jenkins Report with regard to this matter is that this should be done by <Col N="961" /> statutory instrument.  I do not think that this invalidates the point I am making with regard to Irish practice in connection with statutory instruments. They do not receive the kind of debate that this kind of Bill receives.  The Jenkins Report continues:</P>
    <P>Secondly, in practice, we think there is some substance in the complaint of the Association of Unit Trust Managers that these absolute powers have led the Board to concern themselves too much with the detailed arrangements of the unit trusts.  This, it is said, tends to embarrass the managers owing to delays in the settlement of matters of relatively minor importance and uncertainty as to the new requirements which the Board may think fit to impose from time to time.  For example, we do not think it necessary to require, as a condition of authorisation, as the Board of Trade have informed us that they do, that trusts should distribute dividends to unit holders at least twice a year.</P>
    <P>In a particular kind of unit trust the investors might not be interested in receiving a dividend at all; it may be that they are only interested in getting it to grow in value, and this would simply add to the cost of the administration of the scheme.  The paragraph is to argue support for the general proposition that we should have here in perhaps a Schedule or Schedules to the Bill what the Minister's mind must now be on with regard to what is to be required of unit trusts, which we hope will be established and be successful here.</P>
    <P>Finally, on this section, I will repeat a point which is so important that, having said it at the beginning of the section, I wish to say it again at the end.  It is this: if a UK or non-Irish trust of any character performs better because they are operating under a less restrictive type of code than Irish trusts are, then the inevitable consequence of this will be that money will flow out from the Irish trusts to the UK trusts, because the news with regard to the performance will get around.  Therefore, the proportion should be determined on the basis of a real desire to make the unit trusts in Ireland succeed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> There has been some degree of confused thinking with regard to this.  We understand that there has been a considerable outflow of money to UK unit trusts.  This is undesirable.  We all agree that we must try to harness Irish savings to be invested to the highest degree possible in the Irish economy. We have to live with the facts of life. I do not believe that section 7 will be operable; I do not believe it will be possible to hide anything from the Irish investors.  They are quite well able to discover, in various ways, what the news is about performance abroad and if it is better than it is here.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a natural patriotism here which can be invoked and which will come in support of Irish unit trust managers.  The Minister, in his Second Reading speech, referred to a gentlemen's agreement.  He can have another gentlemen's agreement for the managers of these trusts.  I am sure he will find that the managers of these trusts will want to invest as high a proportion as they can in the Irish economy.  Many of the managers of these trusts will be people whose own profitability will be determined by the success of the Irish economy; they will want the Irish economy to succeed and will want the savings to be harnessed to profitable ventures here.  It should be the Minister's approach that he ought to try to establish something that leaves the matter as flexible as possible in the hands of the managers and, at the same time, have a constant exchange of views between him and them as to their policy and the reasons why they have to put such a proportion elsewhere at this time rather than at another time, and so on.</P>
    <P>If as a result of such a policy we have a Bill which makes the unit trust movement in Ireland successful we will be doing more good to the economy and retaining more savings than if we tried to retain too much by specifying too high a proportion as a result of which the unit trusts here may not perform well or may not perform as well as their UK counterparts.  The result of that would be that the outflow which the Minister and his advisers desire to dry up and stop would continue.</P>
    <Col N="963" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree very substantially with what Senator Alexis FitzGerald says, particularly in his concluding remarks.  Indeed, on the Second Stage I made somewhat similar observations myself.  I should like to emphasise again to the Minister&mdash;who quite rightly has laid emphasis on this from the very beginning of this debate&mdash;the absolute necessity for safeguarding the interests of the investors in the Irish unit trust movement. Nobody in this House would cavil at the Minister's attitude in this regard.  Certainly, I would be very anxious that every possible safeguard would accrue to the Irish investor, but I think the Minister himself would be the first to agree that, unless you have a successful unit trust movement, you are not going to have the investors to safeguard.  That is why I want to support very strongly Senator Alexis FitzGerald's remarks on the absolute necessity for ensuring that this unit trust movement will get off the ground successfully and will, we hope, within a comparatively short space of time expand from perhaps modest beginnings into a very successful means of investing capital and of retaining Irish capital in Irish securities and property. Again I should like to emphasise the point which I am sure the Minister is probably tired of hearing, but I do feel as a businessman with some experience over the years in various types of businesses, and some in investments, that the Minister should, if anything, err on the side of generosity, or, certainly of a liberal policy, in regard to the proportion that may be invested in outside securities.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask one or two questions in order to clarify a portion of section 8, which is really a very important section.  Paragraph (a) of subsection (4) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may by order provide in relation to all registered unit trust schemes or a specified class or specified classes thereof (denoted by reference to such matters as the Minister considers appropriate) or in relation to all such schemes other than a specified class or specified classes thereof (denoted as aforesaid) <Col N="964" /> that not less than a proportion specified in the order of any property for the time being subject to any trust created under a scheme to which the order applies shall be Irish securities or other property in the State.</P>
    <P>That is clear enough and then it goes on to describe the proportion.  Paragraph (b) says:</P>
    <P>A proportion shall be calculated, for the purposes of this subsection and orders thereunder, by reference to the value, estimated by the Minister, of the property concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise the words &ldquo;of the property concerned&rdquo;.  In this case property can mean securities, in other words shares, or fixed property, such as buildings I take it.  Does that mean, in effect, that the Minister will estimate the value of, say, a block of offices, which are a popular form of investment in this country at the present time by certain interests, and does it mean that if the value of this property, in this case buildings, increases or decreases it will affect the proportion of money that can be invested in the Irish unit trusts?  If that is so, is that not going to make the position extremely difficult for the Minister and his Department?  It is easy enough to estimate the value of securities because presumably they are quoted on the Stock Exchange or else they are easily assessable; but property, <i>per se,</i> is something on which the Minister's valuers and other valuers may have divided opinions.  Perhaps I do not see the sense of this but as investment in property is an integral part of this Bill, I think it is something that might be cleared up.</P>
    <P>Then paragraph (c) goes on to enumerate the types of securities in which the unit trust will invest and which the Minister will review when calculating his proportion.  Subparagraph (i) of (c) states:</P>
    <P>in case any of the securities are shares or debentures, or rights or interests (described whether as units or otherwise) in any shares or debentures, of a body corporate carrying on a business the whole of which is, in the opinion of the Minister, carried <Col N="965" /> on in the State, the whole of those securities,</P>
    <P>In other words, that particular type of security will qualify 100 per cent.  I should like to ask the Minister what, in fact, is an Irish security.  Is there any reference to the shareholdings in a company that might be called Irish because it is registered in the State?  A company could be registered in the State and, at the same time, have a majority of its shareholdings outside the State.  Would that be an Irish security as set out here?  Subparagraph (ii) goes on to say:</P>
    <P>in case any of the securities are shares or debentures, or rights or interests (described whether as units or otherwise) in any shares or debentures, of a body corporate carrying on a business a proportion only of which is, in the opinion of the Minister, carried on in the State, such proportion of those securities as, in the opinion of the Minister, is equal to the proportion which, in the opinion of the Minister, is carried on in the State of the business of the company.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Minister will decide what proportion is carried on in Ireland and what proportion is carried on outside, in the UK or elsewhere. That proportion, of course, is liable to change.  Does that mean that the Minister will have some watchdog, for the want of a better expression, who will from time to time watch how these proportions change and the Minister will then adjust his order accordingly? The final subparagraph (iii) is clear enough.  It says:</P>
    <P>in case any of the securities are securities other than those specified in sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph, such of them as are issued in the State,</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, when replying, to clarify that position further, because it seems to me that that subparagraph reads&mdash;and it is very difficult to see how it could read otherwise&mdash; that the Minister and his Department would have to do considerable and regular checking up if the requirements are going to be rigidly enforced.  The <Col N="966" /> proportion of Irish securities which he may, by order, require may be altered quite considerably by the manager of a trust.  I would not like to suggest for a moment that the managers would be doing this to circumscribe the Minister's order in any way, but good business practice may require that certain changes take place in the type of business.</P>
    <P>For instance, they will buy a property and sell a property.  Every time they buy and sell property is the Minister to check to ensure that the value of the property brings them inside the order he has made?  I hope I am making myself clear.  It seems to me that, unless the Minister adopts what I would call a reasonably liberal attitude to this minimum requirement of a buyer securing a property, he and his Department will encounter a great deal of trouble.</P>
    <P>I should like to support Senator FitzGerald and other speakers on both sides of the House who suggested that the Minister, in the early stages of this unit trust movement, should be as liberal as he possibly can in the requirements as regards the investment in Irish securities.  There is the point, as mentioned by Senator FitzGerald, of the question of payment of dividends. Some of these trusts do not pay dividends. They issue a certificate to advise the holder that the value of his holding has increased by a certain proportion.</P>

      <P>In replying to the discussion we have had so far, I should like to start off where Senator FitzGerald finished.  In his general overall summary of the position he called for flexibility in determining the amount of money that the unit trust manager and trustee would re-invest within the State. As I saw things during the course of the discussion on section 8, which has provoked the greatest discussion, the Senator, in using the word &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo;, made it a point of justification for my not having written into the Bill a specified amount that should be re-invested. It has become quite obvious, arising from the discussion we have had here and the comments from outside, that in connection with this legislation <Col N="967" /> there is a need for some degree of flexibility and some degree of movement with regard to the regulations for re-investment within the State of the savings, or the funds accrued through savings, under a unit trust scheme.</P>
      <P>I could not agree more with the Senator when he says it has transpired that quite an amount of money flowed out of the State in this way.  This is a measure, as I spelt out originally on the Second Reading, to try to ensure that some of this money will be kept at home and re-invested in the State. I stated in reply to the Second Reading debate that this is only blocking up one of the pipes, or one of the channels of outlet in this regard and that it would be impossible&mdash;and I do not intend doing so in this Bill&mdash;to outlaw the investment by investors here of moneys in outside unit trusts.  I agree with Senator FitzGerald when he says that section 7 will not prevent this outflow of money, but the intention behind that section is that the Minister will do what he possibly can to curtail, limit or control this outflow in some shape or form.</P>
      <P>I want to say quite frankly that Senator FitzGerald contribution to this Committee Stage debate was extremely helpful and enlightening.  I noticed that he found himself apologising earlier on for consuming so much of the time of the House.  I appreciate that he goes quite exhaustively through each section and there are a number of points that he has made in the sections we have dealt with up to this in regard to which I have already indicated that, between now and Report Stage I would, of necessity, need to give consideration with a view to the introduction of amendments.  I think the contribution made by Senator FitzGerald covering each section will help me to avoid the possibility of making mistakes in relation to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome Senator FitzGerald's contribution in this regard.  On the other hand, let me say the Senator has made a number of points in relation to section 8 to some of which I should like to refer.  He began by dealing with <Col N="968" /> subsection (5), referring to the possibility of endeavouring to change the reading of subsection (5), with particular emphasis on the fact that under that subsection the person who publishes a document can be prosecuted. Senator FitzGerald feels that it is unfair to expect publishers of this nature to be aware of the provisions of this Bill.  Then he refers to the more careful phrasing of the Companies Act. I have not got the Companies Act with me but one of the points the Senator made was that the people who can be held responsible are directors or any person responsible for issue of the prospectus.  This Bill defines a person who can be prosecuted as &ldquo;the person who publishes the document&rdquo;.  I feel that the person who publishes the document, as set out in this subsection, certainly would come in under the description of &ldquo;any person responsible for issue of a prospectus&rdquo;.  If it was rephrased to read &ldquo;or any person responsible for issue of the document&rdquo; it would also cover the publisher in this instance.</P>
    <P>I do not think that this subsection is any more exhaustive in getting after the printer or publisher of the document than the section which the Deputy quoted in the Companies Act. Maybe this is only my way of interpreting it but I feel that the person who publishes the document certainly would come in under the description of &ldquo;any person responsible for the issue of a prospectus&rdquo; or &ldquo;any person responsible for the issue of a document&rdquo;.  In any case, it is not intended that newspapers would be caught under this section.  They, in fact, would be caught if they offended under section 7.  However, I will ask the draftman to look at it again for fear that it may be going further than I intend to go in this regard.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald, in what he described as his No. 2 point, quoted the comparison between the holder of a unit trust and the shareholder in a company.  In reply to that point let me say that a shareholder cannot withdraw his shares unless he sells them on the stock exchange, but a person can sell units in a unit trust.  The ordinary <Col N="969" /> law of contract is adequate to give a civil remedy.</P>
    <P>The Senator's third point referred to subsection (2) (c) and (d) and made some suggestions regarding advertisements. He read from the handbook of British unit trust managers and suggested a sort of an addendum, or an appendix to the Bill, setting out a number of the recommendations that could be made to managers in this regard. We naturally expect that many of the things which the British managers are advised to do would also be done by Irish managers.  Under the powers that I am taking under this section I can control this position by order and I do not feel it is necessary to have an appendix spelling out this.  On the last occasion we discussed section 8, Senator FitzGerald referred to the number of things which I, as Minister, am empowered to do by order under subsection (2).  The Senator implied that the report of the Jenkins Committee recommended that these matters should be stated in the Act.</P>

      <P>This was an impression I obtained at the time, but this Bill goes further in stating the requirements in the legislation itself than does the British Act, and it goes further than the Jenkins Committee recommend.</P>
      <P>The Senator mentioned section 8 (2) (g) in relation to trust deeds.  The scheme as mentioned under section 4, to which the Senator referred, could not register unless the arrangements were changed to include a trust as such.  In relation to subsidiaries, which were also mentioned by the Senator, these are covered under section 8 (4) (d).  The Senator also asked what subsection (4) (c) (iii) referred to.  This covers gilt-edged securities such as Government securities.  The complete paragraph (c) of subsection (4) spells out the answer to the question that Senator Russell raised on what are considered to be Irish securities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the functions of the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="970" /> to make orders, let me say that I would hope it will not be necessary for the Minister to be inflexible or dictatorial in this regard.  This is technically a new piece of legislation to deal with a unit trust which has not got off the ground.  Senator FitzGerald has already drawn my attention to the fact that I had been quite quick to point out, in replying to the Second Reading debate, that this was not a unit trust promotional Bill.  Neither, I hope, is it a Bill to kill the prospects of the development of unit trusts.  The two main objects of the Bill are to protect the investor and to endeavour to keep, if possible, a sizeable proportion of our money at home.  There is a place for unit trusts so far as the small investor is concerned and I do not want to make orders that will make it impossible for a unit trust to operate.</P>
    <P>I totally agree with the Senator in his final remarks in so far as I want so to design this piece of legislation that in giving the enabling power to myself or any successor to make orders under this Bill, the object is to protect the investor and to keep as much money as possible at home for local investment.  On the other hand, I do not want to have orders so prohibitive as to prevent the development of unit trust schemes.</P>
    <P>In answer to the Senator's appeal that the Minister be flexible in this regard, this is my intention and this was probably one of the greatest reasons for amendment No. 8, where subsection (4) (a) is being amended in order to allow that bit of flexibility, whereby the Minister has, under that amended section, to determine different amounts for specified classes.  It would appear from the trend of the debate that the House appreciates this position and is anxious to co-operate in this respect.</P>
    <P>Finally, from my point of view I welcome any observations made in relation to any of the sections in this Bill.  I am most anxious to ensure that this Unit Trusts Bill will be as comprehensive as possible and, at the same time, be as flexible as possible, with the overall idea of fulfilling the two objects which I stated were my aim in relation to this Bill: the protection <Col N="971" /> of the investors and to ensure that the maximum amount of investment would take place in the State.  Bearing those two factors in mind, I am very anxious and quite open to listen to any observations that any Senator has to make in relation to any section of the Bill.</P>

      <P>On a question of procedure, will the same order apply to all unit trusts&mdash;the order will not be varied for different unit trusts?  Say the Minister makes an order requiring that 25, 30 or 40 per cent of the money invested shall be invested in Irish securities, will that apply to all unit trusts that apply to be registered?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">

      <P>Amendment No. 8 gives the Minister power to prescribe different percentages for different classes of unit trust.  It also gives the Minister power to exclude a specified class from the scope of such an order.  In other words, this class would be allowed to operate without any obligation in regard to percentage investment in the State.  The class envisaged here is a unit trusts scheme linked with a life assurance policy.  This is the reason behind this amendment.</P>
      <P>The Senator referred to this gentleman's agreement which is at present in existence with regard to life assurance companies.  At the present time we have about 70 per cent re-investment within the State and by 1977 or 1978 there is an arrangement whereby the investment of these life assurance companies will be up to 80 per cent.  As I see it, a unit trust linked with an assurance company of this nature&mdash; why I have this amendment is in order to allow me, where there is an assurance company with an associated unit trust with a combined investment of 70 per cent within the State, not to pin the unit trust scheme, management or trustee, down to the prescribed limit that I should be laying for another sort of licensed unit trust operation.</P>

      <P>I do not want to say very much except that when the Minister has made an examination of the language of the Companies Act, 1963, he will find that the language is much narrower as to the persons who are caught as regards offences under that Act.  It clearly excludes the publishers of newspapers, cinema proprietors, Radio Telefís Éireann or anybody else who might be taking advertisements.  If the language of the Companies Act in any of these sections had been used in this section, that particular worry of mine would be at an end.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not correct in saying that a subscriber to a unit trust will have his ordinary rights at law if he has been misled into making an investment because there has been an untrue statement made.  It was necessary to give this statutory right to persons in the Companies Act, introduced as far back as 1890.  In the case of an untrue statement which is not fraudulently made, the only remedy available to the person who has been misled by it is to get his contract rescinded.  If he cannot get his contract rescinded because something has happened which has made it impossible to do it, and if he is getting back only half the money he put in, he is left with no remedy in damages.  He has got that remedy in damages under section 49 of the Companies Act, 1963, and he should have a similar remedy under this Bill.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Minister's remarks in connection with the Jenkins Report and the recommendation on statutory orders, I think that that must be looked at in the context of the fact that everybody who runs unit trusts in England knows what is the current practice of the Board of Trade.  Does anyone in the House know what is the current practice of the Board of Trade? I do not and I should like to have a debate on it, based on some information which it might be possible to get, if we knew what it was proposed to order.  I imagine if there is a new Unit Trust Act in Britain, it will contain the kind of stuff that is in the Companies Act, setting out in length what is in the prospectus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to subsection (2), paragraph (g), I should like to say that I <Col N="973" /> do not agree with the Minister that subsection (4) saves the situation.  If the arrangements of subsection (4) constitute a unit trusts scheme, they do not constitute trust, but they are a register of a unit trust scheme under this Bill.  If there are provisions which the Minister wants to put into a trust deed, where there is a trust deed, there should be provisions which the Minister is entitled to put into an instrument which is not a trust deed but is a registered unit trust.</P>
    <P>To repeat, I take the Minister's point with regard to subsection (4) paragraph (c) (iii)&mdash;I am grateful to him for pointing out that this is intended to catch gilt-edged.  A UK company could come over here and issue securities here and there would be Irish securities under that provision.  I do not know if the Minister intends that, but we ought to know what our policy is and draft our legislation in the light of that policy.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have anything more to say except that I must repeat that I am grateful to the Minister for his correction in regard to subsidiaries, which I had not observed.  The Minister ought to take careful note about this question of the expression of his opinion and the amount of notice that he should, under statute, be obliged to give to unit trust managers, if he varies his opinion as to the proportion of the business which is carried out in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer again to subsection (4), paragraph (c).

      <P>I said already, when replying to the Senator, that the ordinary law of contract was adequate to give a civil remedy and the Senator pointed out that this was not so.  The Senator mentioned this previously on the Second Reading.  I had the matter checked with the Parliamentary Draftsman. He thought that the section might give some sort of protection.  During the Second Stage debate the Senator suggested that the Bill might include a section protecting depositors innocently misled by statements contained in the advertisement which induced them to invest in a unit trust.  This case has again been made today.  He thought that the section might give the same sort of protection as a person would get if he invested in a company pursuant to a prospectus containing a statement that was wrong but not fraudulently wrong.  This is the point Senator has made.</P>
      <P>On consultation, the Parliamentary Draftsman said that the relevant section of the Companies Act, section 49, was not the best model, as it is a very elaborate provision designed to deal with the individual liability of various persons, including directors and experts, such as auditors and accountants, in relation to misstatements in a prospectus.  In any event, he held that under the ordinary law of contract a unit holder who was innocently misled could have the contract rescinded and obtain a refund of the amount that he had invested.</P>
      <P>An examination of the documentation of the Council of Europe Committee of Experts on Investment Funds indicates that the laws of European countries on investment funds do not include a provision of this kind.  I can have this particular matter looked at again because it was one of those that struck me during the Second Reading. As I have said, this was my information, but in view of the further reiteration of the statement by the Senator I certainly will have it followed up further with the Parliamentary Draftsman to try to ensure that the investor be properly covered in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Just one final point on that.  I know nothing at <Col N="975" /> all about the continental laws on this matter.  There may be other reasons why there is no special provision in the codes regarding civil liability because there may be a general civil liability of a run through statement innocently made anyhow under these continental codes&mdash;generally Napoleonic. There is not here.  As I understand our law, and I should be glad to be corrected on the spot, you cannot get a contract rescinded unless you can put both parties back in the same position they were in before they entered into the contract.  You cannot do that. If you put your money into the unit trust, then all the unit trust investors are affected by your money having gone in.  You cannot take it back without affecting them as well.  You cannot restore the position to the one you would have been in if you had not made the investment.  If that is the position you have no remedy by way of recision.  All you have back is half the money you have put in.  You have no right to damages, which I think you should get.</P>

      <P>Unless I am grotesquely wrong&mdash;and I am encouraged to think I am not by the fact that I had an accountant countercheck my calculation on this&mdash;the section, as expressed, is likely to achieve the opposite of what I am certain the Minister intends.  I think that, instead of the word &ldquo;less&rdquo;, there should appear the word &ldquo;more&rdquo;.  If you have 100,000 units at the bid price of a £1, then the value of the units at the time being issued calculated by reference to the price is £100,000.  The section is complied with if this £100,000 is less than the assets in the unit trust, which might be £200,000.  I cannot see how, if the underlying assets are worth £200,000, the manager should have a buy back price for £100,000 but he <Col N="976" /> cannot have a buy back price for £300,000.  I think I should like to leave that one with the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of how one reads.  My assessment of this was that the section provided that the assets held under a trust shall not be less in value than the value of the units issued. The purpose, in itself, is to secure that assets will not be removed from the fund which should at all times correspond to the value of the units issued. I have the feeling that the Senator is suggesting that more should be proposed there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it this is designed to deal with block offers because under the ordinary practice of unit trusts the manager would be selling them daily.  Presumably, he is not required to produce a document daily.  If he did he would be running a rather expensive unit trust if he had to pay £1 a day as a registration fee under a later section.  If it applies to a block offer only, I think it should be, in fact, so described.  I think there should then be something in the nature of a definition of what a block offer is appearing in the definition section. This is clearly what is intended to be covered, that it is intended to be block offers, but it could catch any document that might be circulating from the manager and he would be obliged to register that and pay £1 every time. Perhaps the Minister would consider what I have said on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea behind this is <Col N="977" /> to send in a statement to the Registrar. If somebody comes in seeking to buy units it is necessary to have a document prepared that he can hand out.  It is not a particular prospectus which the manager is expected to issue daily; it is a report or statement of the situation which the manager is expected to submit to the Registrar at suitable intervals, intervals as is spelt out in a later section, as you mentioned that intervals be determined or spelt out in a later section.  I do not think it could be described as a block offer.</P>

      <P>There will be flexibility. It can be safely assumed that the requirement of sending in a document daily to the Registrar will be unlikely <Col N="978" /> to be insisted on.  One of the things that is spelt out in connection with unit trusts is that you do not have substantial daily variations.  It might be necessary to send this documentation in to the Registrar possibly once a quarter.  You could put in an addendum that this would be subject to variation.  It would be a dated document.  That document would be issued to a prospective buyer or seller of units for a period of maybe two months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing that I want to say with regard to this section is that it is important to be clear as to its meaning.  At a certain point in time the Minister, under an earlier section, may want to get a new manager.  He may have difficulty in getting a manager if the circumstances of the fund are such that he may be guilty of an offence under section 11 unless he can buy back the units in the scheme.  For instance, if through imprudent management an excessive proportion of the sums in the unit trust has been invested in non-quoted securities which are not readily realisable, or are invested in property which is equally not readily realisable.  The Minister must see that there is no section in this Bill which could create any difficulty in his getting, in a badly run scheme, a manager who would not take any risks.  If this section could give rise to a statutory offence some limitations on the rights of unit holders&mdash; which, I understand, are usual in unit trusts&mdash;should be written into it.  For example, a unit trust holder should not be able to march into the office early <Col N="979" /> on a Monday morning, demand his unit back to pay for his Saturday gambling debts, and be without his certificate, which would seem to be a precondition for the statutory obligation to apply.  The evidence of the ownership of the unit trust holder should be provided to the unit trust manager.</P>
      <P>Also, many unit trusts will not take units which are less than a particular size.  There should not be a statutory right to a unit holder in a unit trust scheme, which is designed to be based upon units of £100, £1,000 or even £5,000, to pay him back an amount which would reduce the amount of his investment in the fund to other than what is the specified size of the unit in the fund.  The section should contain some indication of the liberty of the manager.</P>
      <P>For example, to take an ordinary case, where one might not have non-quoted securities or property investments, one might only have quoted securities.  The manager should have at least a sufficient number of days after the settlement of the account in the stock exchange when he actually gets cash which will enable him to pay back the unit trust holder.  If we are giving rise to a statutory obligation we should be very careful of the conditions which would have to be complied with before the statutory obligation is breached by the unit trust manager so as to create an offence by him which is punishable under another section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not take offence at what I will now say.  One unit trust manager on reading this Bill said it seemed to him much more like a police bill than a company bill.  Whatever way this section will be redesigned, it must be seen that there can be no possibility of an offence unless the person holding the units complies with reasonable conditions, for example, regarding the production of a certificate. This seems to me to be an outstanding condition, as it gives the manager the time necessary to realise and pay back the sum of money.  Also, take the case I have given of the unit trust holder who invests £5,000 on a Monday, and who cannot be allowed <Col N="980" /> come back on Wednesday week and look for £4,000.  He could say: &ldquo;Well, I am relying on section 10 and you are obliged to give me back £4,000 of my money.&rdquo;  The Minister may be satisfied that that particular instance is not valid.  Maybe the answer will be that the bid price would be of the unit and that the size of the unit would preclude this anyway.  I should like the Minister to look at it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the conditions of the unit trust scheme would be that the managers would prefer to manage only on the basis that no unit is to be less than £5,000.  They have geared their whole operation on the basis that they will only need such and such a size of staff because the number of certificates they will have to prepare will be limited, and the size of the registers will be small, and they will be dealing all the time in larger units and, therefore, on a much less expensive basis.  This is why generally one can get such sums.  It is better to get into schemes with the larger-sized unit than those with the smaller-sized unit; they are less expensive to run.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 12.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 12 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of points on this.  The first is that the manager must be allowed to share in the brokerage in the event of his selling the shares and he is given an allowance on the brokerage.  I can tell the House that he always gets his share of the brokerage and this might be precluded by this section&mdash;his entitlement to retain it&mdash;and I gather it is one of the valuable sources of the income of the manager without which he will not be in business.  He gets a share of the brokers' commission on the buying and selling of securities. Sometimes it is more convenient for <Col N="981" /> the manager, instead of doing a deal in the stock market, to do a private deal with somebody who has got a block of shares to sell, and they do a deal on some particular basis or rather with regard to the price, and it can be made attractive to both of them.  In such a case it is, I understand, usual for the manager also to get a commission which is similar to the sort of commission that a banker would get on a similar type of transaction.</P>
      <P>That is the first point on that section. The second point is this, and it is in a sense not running counter to what I have just said: it is to suggest that the provision may not go as far in the direction which the Minister wants it to go as he would like.  I will give you, for example, part 3 of the Rules of the Unit Trust Managers Association, which apply now by that sort of authority that a well-established association has.  Its members get great benefits from being recognised members of the association and they have to abide by the rules.  Under part 3:</P>
      <P>A member of any Subsidiary Company of such Member, shall not sell or deal as Principal in the sale of investments to trustee of any Trust managed by him for account of that Trust and every member shall also use his best endeavours to procure that no such sale or dealing shall be made by an associated Company of his or by any purse or corporation holding or beneficially entitled to 10 per cent or more of the share capital of the Member or by a Director or senior executive officer of the Member or of any such corporation, provided that where a Trustee is of the opinion that such a transaction would be in the interests of unit holders, such a transaction may take place.</P>
      <P>I do not suggest that in a matter of statute law we should go as far as that, but I think we should take in the position of directors and the position of subsidiaries of other holding companies of which the manager himself may be a subsidiary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are just one or two more points I should like to make on that section.  In most trust deeds&mdash;I am told <Col N="982" /> that where the money lies is in the management of these trusts&mdash;the manager is empowered to retain the adjustment of the issue price of units.  That is, the amount added to round off the price to the nearest threepence, or 1.25p.  That source of reward arises from transactions or assets in the trust, this reward, using the word &ldquo;gravy&rdquo;, is wherein the gravy lies for the manager. This section would stop that flow and effectively stop the manager undertaking the management of a scheme if he found himself in that situation.</P>
    <P>The fourth is a very small point that I even hesitate to make and that is whether the word &ldquo;himself&rdquo; is right there, considering it cannot be &ldquo;himself&rdquo;. It must be &ldquo;itself&rdquo;, but perhaps one of these interpretation Acts takes in that.  They probably do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator in dealing with this succeeded in approaching it from two completely conflicting points of view.  In the original instance he spoke about the manager being allowed a sort of brokerage facility similar to what applies to, say, a bank manager who is acting as a broker or agent in business of this nature and this is in fact what I was endeavouring to exclude by this section.  The Senator, when he approached it from his second point of view, approached it from the point of view of ensuring that the manager would not be tempted to do any fiddling himself, or itself, in relation to dabbling.</P>
      <P>The impression I got from the Senator's remarks was an impression of a manager being involved in some sort of a back-handed arrangement in relation to buying a block of shares.  Certainly, in speaking on this subject previously, a number of Senators, including Senator Nash, referred to section 12 and there was the reference to the insertion after &ldquo;himself or a subsidiary&rdquo; of an alternative, &ldquo;or on his behalf&rdquo;.  I am very anxious to try to ensure that the manager would not be involved.  I think it is necessary from the unit holders' point of view that the manager should not be allowed to be involved in a sort of arrangement whereby he could siphon off additional gravy, as Senator FitzGerald remarked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He spelt out that there is a difference <Col N="983" /> between the sale price and the purchase price of units and that this is where the management expenses, if you like, are derived from, but certainly I would be inclined to err in this regard from the point of view of being rather too strict on the manager than by being too lenient.  I am inclined to feel, and have already conveyed this, that there is a necessity for an amendment in this section by the possibility of the addition of &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo; or the addition of &ldquo;or somebody on his behalf shall not carry out transactions for himself or on his behalf or make a profit for himself from transactions&rdquo;.  It is necessary that the spirit of this section be adhered to in any amendment that I might propose to introduce.</P>
    <P>It struck me from the Senator's statement that the original point he made was to enable the manager to do some sort of scheming on his own behalf.  I am not too sure whether this was the Senator's intention or whether he presented it as two opposite points of view.  From my point of view I am more than anxious to ensure that the manager would endeavour to run the scheme for the benefit of the unit holders and that he should not be involved, or no subsidiary acting on his behalf should be allowed to be involved. If this were allowed it could be used to siphon off profits which could accrue to the unit holders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make myself clear on this.  I completely agree that there should be a control on the profit and the remuneration which the manager gets, but it ought not to be expressed, as it is in this section, so that it excludes the type of profit which managers get and which justifies their going into the business of management. Their earnings are going to be known to the Minister because they will have to be contained in the reports they have to make to him, and the Minister will be in a position to control them.  At the same time, not merely do I want the manager controlled but I want the manager of the subsidiary controlled. I would not recommend, in a statue, going as far as the association goes in imposing control on its own members with regard to allowing people with, <Col N="984" /> say, a 10 per cent shareholding, from making any profit from the transactions. I will read the Minister &ldquo;The Holder's Right of Say&rdquo; which is taken from a very reputable and very well-known unit trust.  I am not going to go through the whole document but I will quote just a few sentences:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Save during the two months immediately prior to the termination of the trust, the managers shall at any time during the life of the trust, on receipt by them or by their duly authorised agent, of a request in writing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Indeed, I might have mentioned that earlier as one of the conditions a unit trust holder might have to comply with when making his request to have money back.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by a holder, purchase from such holder on the subscription day next following the receipt of such request in writing, or on such earlier day as the managers may agree, all or any part of the units comprised in his holding and the price per unit and proportionately in respect of any fraction of a unit ascertained&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  By dividing the value of the property on the day by the number of units then in issue or deemed to be in issue;</P>
      <P>(2)  By deducting from the resulting quotient such a sum as the managers may consider represents the appropriate allowance for duties and charges in relation to the realisation of the deposited property; and</P>
      <P>(3)  By adjusting the resulting total downwards by not more than 3d, 1.25 new pence or 1 per cent, whichever is the lesser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That last item is the profit, or remuneration, the managers get from transactions in which they are engaged and would be prohibited by this section.  I understand that this is quite a normal trust deed.  I did not envisage any backhand transaction, resulting in profit.  In fact, if we deal with a London stock-broker&mdash;and certain people do register themselves as entitled to get shares with a commission&mdash;we would get <Col N="985" /> shares with a commission and we would be entitled to hold on to it.  It is not a thing which is done in Dublin Stock Exchange yet, but I understand it may come about&mdash;that there will be a share in the commission presented to the people who do the business for their clients.</P>
    <P>The managers of unit trusts get a share in that commission, too.  It is regarded as fair by the Board of Trade and regarded as fair by their association. In addition to that it may be that the best deal that can be made in the assets for the benefit of the unit trust holders is not to have a deal in the stock exchange at all.  If you happen to have a block of Australian securities to take and you want to get out of Australia and somebody else wants to get into Australia, this is the cheapest way you can do it&mdash;a price which takes it all in&mdash;and it is probably an operation which will be profitable to both parties.  In this situation, when managers do that they get the equivalent of a banker's commission.  I merely want the Minister to look at that section.  I am not going to draft an amendment to it, but it seems to me that this is one point which can be covered by the addition of words such as &ldquo;with the consent of the trustee&rdquo; or something of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section that I am slightly worried about because of this question of profit for the managers from transactions.  One would be inclined to claim that this could not be treated specifically as a transaction for himself.  On the other hand, if he himself were to make a profit out of this, which is what would be visualised in this type of arrangement, then it could be covered specifically under &ldquo;making a profit for himself from the transaction&rdquo;. My idea was not to cover that type of arrangement.  I was looking at the section from the point of view of the danger of a subsidiary operating, or the manager being able to manage or arrange for a subsidiary to be able to do that type of business on his behalf.  I think I should not have a section in a Bill which would actually encourage that type of arrangement.  I will examine this section with a view to introducing an amendment if I find <Col N="986" /> this necessary.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 13.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 13 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reiterate the same point that the Minister said he would look at with regard to section 8, subsection (2) (g). What is the position of people who are the equivalent of trustees under a trust deed where there is not a trust deed but there is an arrangement whereby, presumably, somebody would be performing the functions which a trustee would normally be performing and someone would be performing the functions which the manager would normally be performing?  I am referring again to section 6, subsection (4), which brings into the definition of a registered unit trust scheme something which falls short of being a trust but is treated as if it were a trust for the purpose of being required to be registered under this Bill.  It would not be a trust.  By not being a trust and not having trustees it would seem that it would not be caught by section 13, where trusts that are registered unit trusts but are not arrangements deemed to be trusts are caught by section 13. The language here has to be looked to.</P>
      <P>I am not going to delay the House by reading a long section of the Companies Act but I would refer the House to section 93 of that Act.  Section 13 of this Bill corresponds to subsection (1) of section 93 of the Companies Act.  It is almost the same.  The language is slightly changed but not so as to affect the meaning of subsection (1) of section 93.  There are, in other subsections of section 93, provisions which the Minister might well think appropriate to imitate.  This section renders void any provision which would have the effect of exempting the trustee under a scheme, or indemnifying him against liability for breach of trust where, having regard to the provisions of the trust deed conferred on him any powers, authorities or discretions he fails to show the degree of care and diligence required of him as trustee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" /> Section 93 relates to trustees' debentures for holders who are the equivalent of trustees for unit holders.  The trustee can be released from the burdens of the earlier subsection, which is the equivalent of this section, if three-quarters in value of the debenture holders, representing a majority vote to let the trustee off the hook. This is a usual provision also in unit trust deeds.  The unit trust holders, if satisfied, can release the trustee, even if he has made a mistake, without rendering him liable to the statutory offence which is here, the consequence of his having been neglectful.  There is a difference between neglect which falls short of a crime and something which is a crime.  We are all negligent from time to time, but we would not like to think that we could be brought into the courts and pursued with having committed offences.  We would hope that the persons who suffered as a result of our negligence would not discover their civil rights against us, but that is another matter.  Here, we are going a but further in depriving unit trust holders in a sufficient majority of the right to release the trustee.</P>

      <P>Let me say in reply to the Senator's first remark, in connection with the correlation between section 13 and section 6 (4), that no arrangement can be registered without a trust deed.  If there are drafting details in section 13 I can have them looked at.  Section 6 (4) refers to any sort of arrangement which is not a trust.  No arrangement may be registered without a trust deed.</P>

I understood subsection (4) as capturing things that fell short of trusts and contemplating that such would be registered.

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This section contains a provision for the appointment of auditors to a unit trust scheme.  It does not seem to contain any provisions for the removal of an auditor to a unit trust scheme.  As I understand the provisions of this Bill, you have a manager and trustee.  They will both be body corporates.  They could each have an auditor and the auditors of each of these companies could be removed because there are provisions for this under the Companies Act.</P>
      <P>Then you could have a third chap who would not be the auditor of the manager and who would not be auditor of the trustee, but who would be the auditor of the unit trust scheme itself. There seems to be no provision for removing him.  It may be that in practice the auditor is, in fact, the auditor of the manager or the trustee, as the case may be.  There should be provision in this Bill that, if he were not the auditor of the manager or the auditor of the trustee, he could be removed. One would expect this power to be invested in the trustee because the trustee would need to be satisfied that the right person was auditing the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Minister could have a look at the language of subsection (2) (b).  I will read the subsection&mdash;this whole section is the equivalent of section 162 of the Companies Act and the language of subsection (2) has been based upon subsection (1) of section 162.</P>
      <P>A person shall not be qualified for appointment as auditor of a registered unit trust scheme unless&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  he is a member of a body of accountants for the time being recognised for the purposes of section 162 (1) (a) of the Companies Act, 1963, by the Minister; or</P>
      <P>(b)  he is for the time being authorised by the Minister under section 162 of that Act to be so appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To be so appointed to what?  There is no power in section 162 of that Act &ldquo;to <Col N="989" /> be so appointed&rdquo;.  There is no power in section 162 to recognise somebody to be appointed as auditor of a registered unit trust scheme.  There is only the power to have him appointed to be auditor of a company.  I think the word &ldquo;so&rdquo; should be left out.  It should read: &ldquo;to be appointed as auditor of a company &rdquo;.  That is a drafting point which can be left to the draftsman.</P>
    <P>I know subsection (3) is a copy of subsection (2) of section 162 of the Companies Act, which is an extremely bad subsection.  I do not think it should be in the Companies Act or in this Bill.  If an auditor is convicted of a criminal offence arising out of, or connected with, the performance of his duties or his conduct as an auditor, he should not be qualified for appointment as auditor of a unit trust scheme under any circumstances.  You may say that is a personal viewpoint, but that should finish him as the auditor of a unit trust scheme, no matter what a judge of the High Court thought otherwise.</P>
    <P>There is reference in this section to officers.  Who are officers?  We have officers of companies.  Who are officers of registered unit trust schemes?  The draftsmen of the Companies Act were not satisfied that somebody could be called an officer and that ended the matter.  They had a definition of what an officer was.  It is to be found in section 2 of the Act.</P>
    <P>Officer in relation to a body corporate includes a director or secretary.</P>
    <P>We should have, either in the definition section or in section 14, the words &ldquo;officer in relation to a registered unit trust scheme includes a director or secretary&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>With regard to the subsection here which gives the auditor right of access and an entitlement to require from the officers of the manager or trustee, information and explanations as he may think necessary, if I did not like to be approached by the auditor of a company with questions about some activities of the company, I think I might get off the board.  I would cease to be an officer.  I would become a past officer and, as a past officer, there <Col N="990" /> would be no power in the auditors of the registered unit trust scheme to require me to give any information or any explanation if I did not like to.  I suggest that, in addition to the word &ldquo;officers&rdquo;, there should be included the words &ldquo;or past officers&rdquo;.  The effect of this section is to amend section 163 of the Companies Act.  We should not have an amendment which is implied without being expressed. This is undesirable.  Section 163 tells you the people who can attend meetings of the company.  This is going to give an additional person the right to be present at a meeting of the company, that is a person who is the auditor of a registered unit trust scheme of which the company is the manager or the trustee, as the case may be.  The fact that it is an amendment should appear.</P>
    <P>On section 1, I suggested that subsection (9) should appear in section 1, and I also suggested that the definition in the Companies Act, 1963, is not as good a definition as the definition in the Northern Ireland Act, 1960.  In the Companies Act there is a section obliging a company to keep books of account and to enter all sorts of things in it.  Is there anything here which obliges the manager of a registered unit trust scheme to keep books of account?  He must keep books of account of his own performance, but he would be doing something else, he would be managing the affairs of a unit trust scheme.  It seems to me that there ought be a clear obligation to keep books of account appropriate to the unit trust scheme of which he is manager.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with section 14, the Senator mentioned that there is nothing in this particular section which provides that an auditor be removed in the event of his not doing his work properly, or that there is no statutory right under the Bill to remove the auditor.  It is doubtful if it is necessary to provide in such instance that an auditor may be removed.  The trustee would surely select the auditor and if he found that he did not measure up he could remove him without any statutory power.  It need not be written into the Bill that an auditor who mishandled the business had to be <Col N="991" /> removed.  The trustee, who is technically his employer, would see to that.</P>
      <P>In relation to the phraseology of subsection (2), (b):</P>
      <P>a person shall not be qualified for appointment as auditor of a registered unit trust scheme unless...</P>
      <P>(b) he is for the time being authorised by the Minister under section 162 of that Act to be so appointed.</P>
      <P>The Senator suggests that we leave out &ldquo;so&rdquo;.  I do not think that there is any great problem about that; it is a matter that can be attended to.  He then referred to subsection (3):</P>
      <P>If an auditor is convicted of a criminal offence arising out of or connected with the performance of his duties or his conduct as an auditor, he shall not be qualified for appointment as auditor of a unit trust scheme without the permission of the High Court.</P>
      <P>He said that this was taken specifically out of the Companies Act and that he could not see why any auditor who was convicted of a criminal offence in connection with the performance of his duties or his conduct as an auditor should be allowed as an auditor of a unit trust scheme and that the question of getting permission from the High Court should hardly arise.  It is a legitimate point, but looking at it objectively, without any axe to grind, and accepting the fact that this is being taken from the Companies Act, it is quite possible that a young man of 25 years of age, who is an auditor is convicted of a criminal offence arising out of or connected with the performance of his duties or his conduct as an auditor.  If this little qualification did not appear here and if this man gets himself straightened out and, in due course, becomes a reconstituted man, I think he should be allowed to reingratiate himself or re-establish himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many reasons why such an individual might go astray and he might subsequently correct his ways. There was obviously some reason for including that in the Companies Act and I believe that if the man gets <Col N="992" /> straightened out, presents his case to the High Court and re-establishes his credentials his former misdeeds should not be held against him.  I should therefore be inclined to agree with that and stick with the thoughts behind its inclusion in the Companies Act.</P>
    <P>The Senator finished up by saying that there was nothing in this section which required the manager to keep books.  As I see it, section 15 fulfils this requirement in so far as the manager shall have to make returns to the Registrar.  I do not see how he can make those returns without keeping proper books and section 15 will probably cover what the Senator is aiming at here, because books of account, as such, are not required by the Bill but returns are required under sections 14 and 15.  This meets the Senator's point.</P>

      <P>This amendment provides that the manager of a unit trust scheme shall furnish to the Minister and the Registrar at quarterly intervals a statement of the composition of the fund, its value and the number of units issued.  This provision for what is regarded as part of the minimum information which should be made available quarterly was inadvertently omitted from the original Bill.  It means the deletion of the subsection (1) as included originally in the Bill and the substitution of this more elaborate form.</P>

      <P>I think I understand what is going to be achieved by the amendment and, subject to what I have to say with regard to it, I would support the change which is proposed here.  I should like to press the Minister very strongly indeed on one point, and that is that the returns should not be made quarterly but made half-yearly.  It is going to add a great deal to the administrative cost of administering an Irish registered unit trust.  They are under no such obligation, as I understand it, in the United Kingdom.  They would be the competitors of the Irish unit trusts.  Why <Col N="994" /> should the Irish unit trusts be asked to bear this additional cost?  If the Minister gets half-yearly accounts, I am sure that by the time he has read them, with all the other things that will be pressing on him to do, the next half-year will be around.</P>
      <P>I would also suggest that there should be some limitation on the period after the end of the quarter, or rather, as I would have it, the half-year, within which the information is to be furnished. Any of us who have anything to do with business know how hard it is to get your information together. No doubt the Minister will make a sensible order on this when he comes to deal with it.  I think, incidentally, the information he is looking for is not all that exacting.  I am prepared to say that.  However I think the Minister should add: &ldquo;such period be not less than 21 days after the end of each half year or financial year&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The figures most Irish companies issue half-yearly are the best figures they can give.  They are a fair summary of the situation, as the directors of the company understand it then to be, but they are not audited figures.  If the figures are audited once a year this ought to be enough for the Minister. It also will make it much easier for the unit trust to get this information to him.  I am not able to suggest any language which would be appropriate to use here but I do think some language, which could be got from the rules of the stock exchange, would be appropriate for this&mdash;such figures as would not mislead, as would represent a fair and accurate summary on the best information they have.  But they must be audited at least once a year. That ought to be sufficient from the point of view of the intentions behind this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister recognised in his reaction to some of the points that were made on our earlier debate on section 8 the difficulties that are going to arise from the Minister's determination of the value of property, in the case of property other than securities. That would be under subsection (4) paragraph (b), where the Minister is determining the value.  When does the Minister determine the value for the <Col N="995" /> purposes of the return that is to be made under this section?  When he is making the amendments I feel sure he will introduce to section 8 with regard to that, a consequential amendment will be found to be necessary to subsection (1) paragraph (b) of this proposed amendment.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what is in mind here with regard to the requirement that the manager shall furnish to the Minister and the Registrar, and in any case where the Minister so specifies, to the holders of units of the scheme certain information.</P>
    <P>Then, subsection (2) of the section, which it is proposed to amend, states that &ldquo;The Minister will lay before the House such of the particulars furnished to him under this section as he thinks fit to lay before the House&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Any one of us or any unit holder can go down to the register and inspect it at any time.  Therefore, if the information is furnished to the Registrar, it is available to the public.  As I understand the section, there will be no question of his being able to specify that there was to be a non-disclosure of some of the information because one can get it in the register anyhow, unless I am wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>One can.  The only thing about it is that there is a consideration. You have to pay the registrar something if you want to go down and have a look.  This is out of courtesy to the House.  It is always provided and laid on the Table of the House free for the benefit of anybody who wants to look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am mindful of the Senator's overall remarks in connection with this amended section.  I felt myself it was rather exacting of the Minister to write this into the Bill&mdash;this question of supplying quarterly particulars.  I was influenced in this regard by the unanimous view of the Committee of Experts on Investment Funds of the Council of Europe that, in addition to the annual accounts, information should be made available at quarterly intervals to protect the interests of unit holders.  Naturally, it would not be <Col N="996" /> reasonable to require audited accounts at such frequent intervals, but it is intended that this section would be used and supplemented, if necessary, by orders under section 8, subsection (2), to provide the minimum information esential for determining how the scheme is progressing.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald appealed strongly to me not to look for the suggested quarterly, six monthly or half-yearly reports of this nature.  He admitted that the type of information being sought was not demanding&mdash;in fact it is a statement on the composition of the fund, its value and the number of units issued.  The Senator remarked that unit trusts on the other side submit annual reports.  In this we are again endeavouring to look after the unit trust holders' interests.  The requirement that would be proposed to be laid down by the Minister would not be as demanding as it would appear.  It could be under this section, but the fact still remains that I am being guided to the fullest extent by the unanimous view of this committee of experts.  I am fully conscious that one cannot possibly expect audited accounts at frequent intervals.  I know that the Senator may say that perhaps the Minister intends to be reasonable on this, but what a Minister says in the House on the Bill is not something that will eventually be written into the Bill.  A less reasonable Minister might eventually succeed the present one and might see things from a different point of view.</P>
    <P>There are many regulations in the Companies Act, and if the Minister were to insist upon adherence to those that are laid down it might prove very difficult.  Even though there is a statutory obligation, they are not always adhered to.  The Senator made a number of suggestions regarding amendments, some of which I fully accept and some others at which I will have another look, but he did stress, in this instance, that he would make the case strongly to me.  It would be improper for me at this stage to convey that I would be inclined to change this. Eventually, it will depend on how necessary it will be to insist on the sending in of quarterly returns.  There is a certain amount of room for flexibility <Col N="997" /> in regard to what is written into the Bill.  For instance &ldquo;within such period after the end of each quarter of the financial year as the Minister may from time to time specify&rdquo; could provide a certain amount of elasticity. I would not be anxious to change the format of the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that approaching the matter in that way would simply be a device not to operate the section of the Bill that the Minister wants to operate?  Is it not the clear meaning of the amendment which the Minister is proposing now that the particulars should be furnished within a particular time at the end of each quarter?  If the phraseology here is used in order not to implement that, it is only being used as a device not to implement the section which the Minister is asking the House to enact.  I see the Minister's point of view but I must say as a practising lawyer the point which Senator FitzGerald made appeals to me.</P>
      <P>I know the difficulties companies of one sort or another, even in what one might regard as comparatively simple returns, may come up against in gathering information.  It may be that they have to await a letter or report from a firm of accountants and that the particular accountant in the firm may be on holidays or may be ill.  The same situation could arise in connection with the lawyers.  All of these things do consume a certain amount of time.  It may very well be that to fix in the Bill that the particulars must be furnished quarterly could create difficulties later as regards implementation.  Perhaps the Minister would consider my suggestion that if he preserves the intention that it should be quarterly but allows himself a certain amount of discretion, it might meet both points of view.  Perhaps the amendment could be altered along these lines in subsection (1):</P>
      <P>The manager under a registered unit trust scheme shall, within such period after the end of each quarter of any financial year of the scheme or at such time as the Minister may from time to time specify....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, put into the Bill now <Col N="998" /> that the Minister will have discretion to vary that rather than that the Minister should be driven to seek, in the wording of the section, a device which would enable him to vary it&mdash;that discretion could be allowed to the Minister but the main guidance of &ldquo;quarterly&rdquo; should still remain.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald is quite right in his remarks with regard to section 15 (2) that there does not seem to be any point in the Minister not giving the full particulars to the House or laying the full particulars before the House in a situation where possibly unit trust holders, and certainly the Registrar, will have the particulars, and where those particulars can be obtained through the register.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be quite content if the Minister would accept what Senator O'Higgins has suggested such as &ldquo;being not less than a quarter&rdquo; or something of that kind, as he might from time to time specify. I understand how he could be impressed, as I was, when I heard him mention the commission of experts' advice on this.  He should not take up an inflexible position on this merely because of that advice if the effect of it at this time would be to make an Irish unit trust manager carry heavier weight than his counterpart in the UK who, so far as I know, does not seem to have followed the advice given by the commission of experts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say two things on a point which the Minister made in regard to the non-enforcement of the provisions of the Companies Act.  First of all, I do not think that it is a good thing to have sections in an Act which are not enforced.  It would be desirable if they were enforced.  It would not be good for Irish commerce if the company returns are not up to date.  If the Minister would study the Companies Act he would find that the nature of a penalty which is applicable does not go as far as the penalty which would apply in this case.  I imagine we could all get our annual returns in on time if being guilty of not doing so we could be, on conviction on indictment, liable to a fine not exceeding £5,000 per day. There is no doubt about it but we would have to get up very early that <Col N="999" /> morning.  The Minister should take the power to himself to vary it from time to time.  I suggest that, if he does exercise that power, it should be half-yearly but still recognising the value of the advice of the commission of experts.</P>

      <P>Having heard the House on this I can give serious and sympathetic consideration to the amendment suggested by Senator O'Higgins. I shall try to devise an amendment which will leave it optional for me not to insist upon quarterly returns.  In the event of it being discovered during the operation of the business that quarterly returns are too demanding, I may be able to arrange for a suitable amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that the amendment might go a little further than it does.  I would draw the Minister's attention to section 171, subsection (1) (c) (i) of the Companies Act, 1963.  Other sections of this Act are being adapted to this unit trust scheme.  Under this amendment, if there is a prosecution there is provision for the recovery of expenses to the extent that the court orders.  But under the subsection to which I refer, the Minister is given power, in a case where there is no prosecution, to make an order after the inspector's report, to the effect that somebody has to pay the expenses of the investigation.  He may do this without being required to bring a prosecution.</P>
      <P>It is a difficult thing to prove in a manner which will satisfy a court that a crime has been committed.  The amendment puts the Minister in the position that he can recover the expenses of this investigation only if he has got such evidence that will convince the court that the offence has been committed.  He is entirely dependent on his ability to do that to enable him to recover any of the expenses of the investigation.  The Companies Act contemplates that there might be facts short of being sufficient to prove that a crime has been committed or could be proved, yet in which it would be desirable that, from the facts which emerged, the Minister could say of a person or person: &ldquo;He or they shall bear this proportion of the expense or the entire of the expense or the expense to the extent that the Minister determines.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment ought to be enlarged to include this additional power in the Minister so that he does not have to get the Attorney General to bring a prosecution.  The inspector's report <Col N="1001" /> makes it clear that somebody has behaved badly and yet the inspector's report will not justify a successful criminal prosecution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem in this respect is that if an inspector appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce finds something wrong and is not able to substantiate this and secure a conviction following the institution of proceedings, it is difficult to argue that I, as Minister, could justifiably charge certain or all of the expenses of the inspector against the manager of a company operating the unit trust.  This is working on the basis of allowing myself to be associated with the idea of claiming that the defendant in this case was guilty until I would put him in a position of proving himself innocent.</P>
      <P>The Senator has made a legitimate point in so far as in the course of investigation it could transpire that agreement could be reached that the management of some unit trust scheme might accept that the scheme was not operating in accordance with the regulations and that he might promise to mend his ways.  It would be improper of me to put myself in the position that all of the expense of that investigation should be borne by me.  It is a legitimate observation of the Senator to suggest I should alter or amend this amended section to protect myself in this regard.  With that in mind, I intend to take another look at this amendment with a view to improving it from my own point of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given a very good illustration of what I think the subsection to which I referred actually means.  In a case where a settlement of the expenses could be made without the burden on the Minister of having to get the Attorney General to institute a prosecution&mdash;I may be wrong, as this is a very difficult subsection to construe&mdash;my understanding of it is that you could have a set of facts short of proving a crime, yet which should prove where the blame lay and where the body corporate would have to pay.</P>

      <P>It seems to me there might be a danger if the Minister has powers here that he could find himself acting unconstitutionally.  In the type of situation mentioned by the Minister and Senator FitzGerald, it would be by agreement that the person&mdash;not the guilty party but the party who had done something which was not quite correct&mdash;would agree to pay the expenses.  But to take power to force him to pay expenses might create an unpleasant situation for the Minister.</P>

If, on examination, my understanding of a difficult subsection is found to be wrong, I will withdraw the point.  The Minister seems to be given this power in a subsection of an Act which was enacted 30 years after the Constitution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this section, the Minister may appoint inspectors.  He is not obliged to do so. This carries forward into this Bill a provision which is in the Companies Act code, section 165.  It is never used and is disapproved of.  It is thought that &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be used instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo; in certain circumstances.  I do not agree wholly with the critics of section 165 but I would recommend to the Minister for consideration an analysis of this section and some other sections which is contained in the <i>Irish Jurist,</i> Volume 4, Part 1, New Series, Summer 1969, which is produced under the editorship of my colleague, Senator Kelly, and which should be ordered by every Department of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to that, I would add that paragraph 322 of the Jenkins Report suggests that the new Act which they <Col N="1003" /> are recommending should be enacted should provide for the appointment of inspectors by the Board of Trade to investigate on their own initiative the affairs of a registered unit trust or, on application, by the manager or trustee, or by holders of at least 10 per cent of the units in issue, provided the Board of Trade are satisfied that an application by the latter is not merely vexatious.</P>
    <P>In this connection, perhaps it is pertinent to observe that the operation of this section should be effected in the realisation that it would be impossible to have an inspection&mdash;that is why section 165 of the Companies Act is not used and has not been used&mdash;without the inspection causing damage to the trust in question.  Once you start the investigation that is very bad news for that unit trust and that is why the Jenkins Report recommends that the Board of Trade should have the power to do it if they want to do it, but in effect they should do it only if there are unit holders whose managers consider them to be lacking in trust in the administration of the scheme.  In other words, the Minister should be slow to do it unless he is asked to do it because he will realise that the very initiation of the investigation will be extremely damaging to the unit trust in question.</P>
    <P>There is another point that I should like to make on this section and it is important, but I am rather diffident in making this and some other points.  It certainly was the position before the enactment of the 1963 Act that when an inspector was appointed to investigate the affairs of a company he could put his questions only to the company.  The inspector found frequently that his ability to discover the truth was affected by his inability to ask a subsidiary of the company, or a holding company of the company, or another subsidiary of the holding company, or another holding company of a subsidiary, about the matter.  Accordingly, there is in that Act, section 167, in which, when inspectors were appointed, they were given the power also not merely to look at the manager and the trustee, but the manager's and the trustee's subsidiaries, the holding companies <Col N="1004" /> or associated companies.  If he wants the investigation to be an effective one, to be useful in bringing home the truth, he must take this power.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a further observation in regard to this section. It is not in the UK Act, which was not an Act designed particularly for unit trusts but was concerned with fraudulent trading.  Neither in this Bill nor in the UK Act is there any power taken to investigate the affairs of a trustee.  The powers proposed here are to investigate the affairs of a manager only.  In addition, this section proposes that when the inspectors make their report they forward a copy of it to the registered office of the company. I should like to draw Senator Ryan's attention to this, without wishing to pick him out in any disagreeable fashion.  I know absolutely nothing about criminal law.  It has been suggested that where criminal proceedings are contemplated or have been instituted as the result of such an investigation, the requirement to send a copy of the report to the company could well be embarrassing.  Nothing has been done about it yet, but the Jenkins Committee recommended that the obligation to send the report to the company could be embarrassing to the success of a prosecution which might later require to be taken.  I am unable to make any observation about it except to say that this point was made.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask another question in regard to the section.  Say the Companies Act is complied with by the manager and by the trustee, but the Unit Trust Act is not complied with, because they disobeyed some of the orders in some particular, or in some fashion acted wrongly as deemed by the inspector.  There may be an answer to be found in the general structure of the Bill, but where is the offence? Section 170 of the Companies Act, 1963, provides for proceedings on foot of the inspector's report.  The proceedings can be not merely criminal, but also for the purposes of recovery of property that may be due to the unit trust holders.  Must the entire portion of that section of the Act not be adapted and made use of for the <Col N="1005" /> purposes of this Bill.  In the operation of the investigation provisions of the old English Act of 1929 and such as there was of that in the Act of 1908, it was found that the inspector's report was not admissible in evidence.  There was a special provision enacted, which we have in our Act, admitting the inspector's report as evidence in proceedings brought under section 170 of the Companies Act.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to see the privilege which is saved for solicitors by section 173 of the Companies Act in relation to privileged communications made to them similarly saved in any investigation under this Bill or any proceedings brought pursuant to it.  I should also like to see bankers similarly saved in relation to the information they have as to the affairs of any of their customers, other than the company whose affairs are being investigated under the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the Senator said in relation to this section that he would advise caution, from the point of view of the Minister, in ordering an investigation.  Once an investigation is ordered, it means that people automatically start being rather suspicious of the body corporate whose affairs are being investigated.  I fully accept this point.  When we were dealing with this on the Second Reading, reference was made to the tying in as a requirement both paragraphs (a) and (b) in this section 16, subsection (1) the requirement that</P>
      <P>The Minister may appoint one or more competent inspectors to investigate and report on the administration of a registered unit trust scheme or a unit trust scheme the registration of which under this Act stands cancelled if it appears to the Minister&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) that it is in the interests of holders of units created under the scheme to do so, and</P>
      <P>(b) that the matter is one of public concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think reference was made to this and this is specifically why it is written in here that both of those requirements would need to be met or the Minister would need to feel that both interests <Col N="1006" /> were concerned before he would order an investigation as is spelled out under this section.  This, in its own way, indicates an acceptance of the fact from my point of view that an investigation of this nature should not be lightly ordered.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that this section also should be more embracing in that I should also take the power to investigate a subsidiary body or a parent body or various other connected bodies in addition to the actual body operating the unit trust scheme, I am not too good on my sections under the Companies Act, but I think Senator FitzGerald mentioned that this section here compared with section 165 of the Companies Act, an unused section I think was the term he used, which gives power to the Minister to have companies investigated in this way.  As I see it, there would be nothing to stop the Minister, if he felt that the power he had under section 16 of this Bill to investigate a unit trust scheme was not comprehensive enough, looking into the affairs of the subsidiaries.  I presume that I, as Minister, could use this unused section 165 to have a go at the subsidiaries.  Maybe he will come back at me on that one because I am just using this section as interpreted by him.  I have not looked into it.</P>
    <P>In addition, he wants to know why I have not taken power to investigate the trustee and why I am taking power to investigate only the manager's end here. In fact, I am not specifically taking power even to investigate the manager as such: I am taking power here to have competent inspectors to investigate a unit trust scheme.  I feel this is really the power I require because I am satisfied that that power is sufficient. It is the scheme that may need to be inquired into.  I think that is sufficient power to take in this regard.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the Senator does not feel that my reference to the question of the power in the Companies Act to look further than where I am going here is sufficient, but towards the end of his contribution he made a few points that were new from my point of view and would need to be examined in relation to this section.  I shall certainly look into this question of the <Col N="1007" /> power he feels I should take to tie in any sort of subsidiaries or connected firms with the proposed investigation of a unit trust scheme.  I would be hoping, of course, that this section would be left as unused as section 165 of the Companies Act, but nonetheless it is extremely necessary in order to protect the investors and the public interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for what he has said, particularly as the language of subsection (1) supports entirely what he says that the investigation would be into the affairs of the scheme.  The Minister, having examined the other references that I have made, might look at the language of subsection (2) which states with regard to the sections referred to:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... with the substitution for references to the company or other body corporate and its affairs of references to the manager under the scheme and to the administration of the scheme&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This misled me into thinking the trustee was being excluded.  I do not know whether any amendment of that language is needed to make quite sure that you could ask as many questions of the trustee and all the officers as you could ask of the manager.  I will just leave it at that point.</P>

      <P>I would remind the Minister of my remarks on section 10.  I think section 10, on being clarified, probably will make it unnecessary for me to suggest any amendment to section 18, but if we had daily documents to go in at £1 a go it would be very expensive.</P>

      <Col N="1008" /> SECTION 19.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 19 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two points only to make on section 19.  The point relates only to section 9 and not to section 10.  The manager could be guilty of an offence under section 9, if I read section 9 correctly, without the trustee being guilty, but if there is a contravention of section 9, under section 19 the manager and trustee are both to be held guilty of an offence. Under section 10 the trustee must approve of the document.  Presumably in his own interest he is likely to make his disapproval known in a public fashion to the Minister, make his own decision quite clear; but certainly in relation to section 9 and possibly in relation to section 10, the manager could be guilty and the trustee not.</P>
      <P>The second point is in relation to offences and punishments.  I know these are generally put together in the one section.  As we have so many different types of regulations to be made if this is to be the system maintained&mdash;I still hope it will not be and that we will have things spelled out in appended phase or schedules&mdash;I think that the fines and punishments ought to be carefully distributed around to the different sections because there is a world of difference between making a mistake innocently misleading and engaging in criminal fraud.  There may be a world of difference in the Minister's mind as to the sort of things he would regard as grave and those he would regard as not grave.  Therefore, if this can be done without being too great a burden, I should like the offences to be fixed into the sections to which they relate. I know there is some attempt to do this in the section.  I realise that, but it does not seem to me to be quite sufficient. I do not wish to press the Minister on this because it seems to me to depend altogether on the decision he is to make on the general case that we have been making that there should be more expressed in this Bill than there is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer specifically to the first point the <Col N="1009" /> Senator raised and that is this straightforward subsection (1), which states:</P>
      <P>Where in relation to a unit trust scheme, there is a contravention of sections 9 or 10 of this Act, the manager and the trustee under the scheme shall each be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>The Senator does not agree that the trustee can be guilty of an offence under section 9 but he agrees he could be guilty of an offence under section 10.  Section 9 requires that the value of the assets of the scheme which are held by the trustee in trust for the unit holders must not be less than the value of the units issued by the manager. That being so, I feel that both the trustee and the manager are equally responsible in this regard.  Section 10 requires the trustee to approve the prospectuses prepared by the manager and issued to prospective purchasers of units.  That does tie in both manager and trustee, but I do suggest that section 9 also places a dual responsibility on the manager and the trustee.  I have indicated I will look at a number of points raised by Senator FitzGerald throughout the Bill.  He has conceded that I need not comment at the moment on other points he has raised, so I do not propose to so do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two points to make in aid of the Minister. In section 10, if the manager could issue the document without the consent of the trustee, then the manager would be guilty of an offence under the section but the trustee would not.  One of the requirements of the section is that the trustee must approve.  If the trustee is not asked to approve but the manager goes on why should the trustee then be liable for an offence?  That is one comment on it; I imagine by now I have forgotten my second.  It should cheer up the House enormously if I tell them that I have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have recalled my other point, and it is this. I do not know enough about unit trusts to know if managers and trustees both keep daily valuations or if one <Col N="1010" /> depends on the other.  It would be frightful if we do know that and we enact a requirement which would have the effect that, to be quite sure that neither of them was in breach of the provision concerning keeping the proper proportion in Irish securities, they both have to keep constantly revaluing and so on.  I do not know the procedures. But one of them must do it and it is the one who does it wrong who should be guilty of the offence.  If, in practice, they both do it, then I have no comment to make on that.  But to have it so that an Irish unit trust would have an expensive practice of double valuation, when a UK trust does not have to, would obviously add to expense.</P>

      <P>I would recommend to the Minister for his consideration that before the word &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; in the third line of the section the word &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; should appear or such other word as would make it something more than a casual breach which would lead to a criminal offence. I am not sure that I am recommending the right word to the Minister but &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; seems to be the sort of word that I should like to see in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to suggest that the Minister take the power to bring this Bill into force without necessarily bringing section 7 into force so that we can get unit trust legislation, which we want, and the people who are thinking about forming unit trusts can learn, as soon as possible, the obligations they will have to comply with without the Minister having to go through what I anticipate will be an exhaustive process of consideration with the owners of papers circulating in this country, as to whom he will exempt and will not exempt.  He will find himself in the embarrassing position of awaiting the conclusion of his negotiations with these foreign newspapers before he is able to bring this whole Bill into force.  It is highly desirable that as much of this Bill will be brought into force as soon as possible so that people who wish to establish unit trusts will know if it will be possible for them to do so having regard to the obligations imposed by the Bill and the protections offered to investors in Irish unit trusts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1012" /> Perhaps it is not inappropriate to make a point here which I could have made earlier.  One of my hopes regarding to the whole thing would be that, if we had an encouraging legislation which would also protect the depositors and the investors, it might encourage the inflow of capital into well-managed Irish unit trusts.  There may be difficulty in getting capital from Britain, but there is a certain square in Edinburgh &mdash;I think it is Charlotte Square&mdash;where there are people whose judgment on financial affairs is listened to with the greatest of interest thousands of miles away.  There may be such successful unit trusts in Dublin that people from abroad would be attracted to invest and we ought not to exclude this as a possibility.  Again striking the note that there should be a general scheme of encouragement, I should like to see the Minister empowered at least by the terms of this section not to necesarily bring every section into force when he brings every other section in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that section 23 (2) of this Bill shall come into operation on such day as the Minister may appoint by order.  I take it that the Senator's contribution just now has been on the basis that I may be slow to appoint a day when it would come into effect by reason of the fact that I will be held up for quite a time by negotiations or discussions in relation to conceding the exclusions that are visualised in section 7.  I said, speaking on the Second Reading, that I would not give those exclusions easily.  In fact, I hope to have that matter cleared up before the present unit trust operations have been adjusted to conform with the Bill. This is the reason I need this subsection here.  It will not be necessary for me to make provision for the exclusion of the operation of section 7. I am very anxious that I should be able to operate section 7 despite the fact that I am conscious&mdash;and the Senator reminded me of this today in his opening remarks&mdash;that the operation of section 7 will only be closing off one of the many outlet pipes for a cash flow from here to the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister <Col N="1013" /> may not think it is desirable to specify section 7 as being a section he need not bring into operatíon.  That might have undesirable effects for him in his negotiations or discussions with newspapers but he could take the general power which one sees in so many Acts whereby different sections can be brought in at different times.</P>
      <P>With regard to what the Minister has just said, there are the existing unit trusts that one knows about and, presumably, there will be a method of communicating to them what the Minister's intentions are as regards what is to be complied with.  However, no regulations can be made under this Bill until this Bill comes into operation. There are bodies other than the existing unit trusts who might want to establish unit trusts, whom the Minister may know nothing about.  I think he will find section 7&mdash;repeating what I have said <i>ad nauseam</i>&mdash;impractical.  I should like to see him in a position to bring this Bill into operation and to get people to study the regulations they will have to comply with&mdash;better still if he can write them into the Bill.  Then they will know right away and this can start. Your first step, I presume, if you are starting a unit trust is you say &ldquo;What is the law relative to the matter?&rdquo; and then: &ldquo;Now we have to study it.&rdquo; There is an awful lot of work to be done after that.</P>
      <P>The postponement of bringing this Bill into force and the effect of the regulations not being made means that people who are perhaps laying plans will not know what regulations they have to comply with.  You cannot bring this Bill into force until you know where you will be with regard to section 7.  At least, that is my understanding of the situation.  The moment you bring this Bill into force, then no foreign newspaper can circulate in this country except with an advertisement of a unit trust that is not regisered under this scheme unless it is exempted by the Minister.  Incidentally, the Minister cannot exempt it until he has brought this Bill into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How will he manage that?  Get up very early one morning and make an order that will exempt the papers that are sent the night before or early that <Col N="1014" /> morning?  I just do not know how it will work at all.</P>

If the Minister is to have skilfully drafted a number of the amendments that I would <Col N="1015" /> want I should be satisfied; but if he is rejecting others&mdash;it depends on the importance of them&mdash;I should like to have an opportunity of putting down amendments on Report Stage.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to provide for the registration of private employment agencies, the approval of the fees they may charge and to require such agencies to furnish returns of their activities.</P>
      <P>The business of employment agencies is defined in the Bill in very wide terms in order to include all persons or bodies engaged in recruiting workers for employment for others.  It will, for example, include agencies which employ workers directly for hire to other employers.  It will not, however, affect the liberty of an employer to recruit his own workers for employment in his own business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any person who proposes to carry on the business of an employment agency is required to apply for a licence and to satisfy the Minister that the premises he proposes to use are suitable and that he is a fit person to operate an agency.  He must also have the fees which he proposes to charge approved by the Minister.  A licence may be revoked where the conditions under which it was granted are no longer fulfilled.  Where the Minister <Col N="1016" /> refuses to grant a licence or revokes an existing licence the aggrieved party may appeal to the courts.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission are expressely excluded from the provisions of the Bill; also excluded are agencies operating under the direction of a Minister for State, for example, the national manpower service.  There is power to exclude any particular class of employment agency.  It is intended to use this provision to exclude agencies conducted by charitable and other bodies which do not charge fees for their services or which only charge such amounts as may cover their expenses.</P>
    <P>Power to make regulations generally for the control and supervision of employment agencies is contained in section 8.  In addition, specific provision is made for regulations dealing with the keeping of records, the furnishing of returns and the recruitment of persons for employment abroad.  These regulations may require an advertisement for a situation abroad to give the name and address of the employer, and may prescribe special requirements in respect of persons under 18 years whom an employment agency seeks to place in employment abroad.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for the appointment of officers to ensure that the provisions of the Bill are complied with and for the imposition of fines for offences under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 85 of the Public Health Acts (Amendment) Act, 1907, has been the only piece of legislation under which any control could be exercised over employment agencies.  This section enabled certain local authorities to make regulations concerning the conduct of employment agencies engaged in the recruitment of female domestic servants.  In fact it was not a very effective provision and applied only in the cities of Dublin and Cork. It is proposed to repeal this section.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of fee-charging employment agencies carry out their functions in a responsible manner and provide a service for which many employers are prepared to pay.  There have, however, been some complaints <Col N="1017" /> over the years about the activities of certain employment agencies.  There have also been a few complaints about fees charged.  There have been some complaints about agencies which recruit workers for employment abroad; in some of these cases the complaints related to inaccurate or incomplete information about conditions of employment; others related to failure on the part of agencies to make proper inquiries about living or working conditions for young women who were going abroad for employment.</P>
    <P>So far as fees are concerned, it is proposed to require agencies to give particulars of their fees which must be approved by the Minister for Labour. It is not intended to impose a common scale of fees&mdash;obviously the circumstances of the various types of agencies may differ considerably.  My intention, in seeking power to approve fees, is to prevent unfair exploitation of job seekers and employers who make use of agency services.</P>
    <P>The provision regarding advertisements for employment abroad, which is aimed at the elimination of misleading advertisements, has been discussed with representatives of the daily and provincial newspapers and they would welcome it.  They feel that such a provision would strengthen their hands in dealing with doubtful advertisements from agencies or any other source.</P>
    <P>Plans for the development of a free national manpower service are well advanced. It is intended that this service will cater for all classes of workers from the unskilled to the professional and administrative classes.  The new service will be the organ through which information on manpower availability and demands on a local, regional and national basis, will be channelled.  The implementation of the Government's manpower policy necessitates the provision of full and detailed manpower statistics on a continuing basis by the manpower service.  Information from private employment agencies about their registrations and placements is an essential part of the manpower scene. The regulation of these agencies will enable the required information to be obtained.</P>
    <P>I should like here to refer to the <Col N="1018" /> International Labour Organisation Convention No. 96 concerning fee-charging employment agencies.  We are one of the few countries in Europe which have not ratified it so far but the provision of this Bill should enable us to do so.</P>
    <P>In defining fee-charging employment agencies, the Convention distinguishes between employment agencies which are conducted with a view to profit and agencies which, although charging in some form or other for their services, are not conducted with a view to profit. Ratification of the Convention would require member countries to introduce some system under which fee-charging employment agencies would be registered. The Convention specifies in particular that agencies shall be subject to control in respect of fees and the placement and recruitment of workers abroad.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill was published a certain amount of criticism of it has appeared suggesting that it involves undue interference with existing agencies and gives excessive powers in relation to fees, inspection, etc.  I do not think that any well-conducted agency has anything to fear from this Bill.  I can assure Senators that the power to approve fees will only be used to prevent charging of excessive fees.  There is nothing unusual in the inspection powers&mdash;they are on similar lines to those in the Factories Act.  I do not see how the Bill could be enforced without powers of inspection.  I have told the Irish Federation of Employment Agents that I will be prepared to meet them and discuss any difficulties of detail which they see in the Bill before the Committee Stage is taken.</P>
    <P>In brief, the primary purpose of the Bill is to safeguard our workers and employers against unfair practices by employment agencies, including excessive fees, and to protect our workers from advertisements for employment outside Ireland which are misleading or inaccurate or inadequate in content. The furnishing of returns of the activities of agencies will also help my Department in the implementation of the Government's manpower policy. Finally, if this Bill becomes law the Government will be enabled to ratify <Col N="1019" /> the International Labour Organisation's Convention No. 96 and our practice in relation to employment agencies will be brought into line with that of most western European countries.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House for adoption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EvelynOwens" hpid="Miss Owens Miss Owens">
      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>May I first say, on behalf of the group I represent here, that we welcome the introduction of this Bill by the Minister for Labour. The news that he has just given us, that this Bill will enable our Government to ratify the ILO Convention No. 96, is very welcome.  We are a bit backward in our application of ILO Conventions and, so far as I am concerned, this is a step in the right direction. I hope that shortly we will be hearing from the Minister for Labour that we will be able to ratify Article 100 on equal pay and Article 111 on equal opportunities for women.  This is one of the most commendable aspects of the introduction of this Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill is long overdue.  In many respects if we had a proper employment and placement service in this country we probably would not have to depend on private enterprise to organise our employment agencies, although I have the very highest respect for many of the employment agencies operating here.  The Minister is to be commmended also for the fact that he requisitioned a report and survey on the placement and guidance services.  The Institute of Public Administration have published a document which sets the guidelines for the establishment of a national employment agency.  I hope that the plans are well advanced towards the implementation of the recommendations contained in that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Bill itself, there are a few problems I have on reading it.  I am sure the Minister will be able to clear them up in his reply.  I agree that all employment agencies should be licensed. I think it is a very good idea and licensing of these agencies is long overdue.  In section 3 it says &ldquo;shall cause to be published in not less than one daily newspaper&rdquo;.  This seems to me to mean that if I want to open <Col N="1020" /> an employment agency in Dublin I can advertise the fact in the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, which is a daily newspaper. I really cannot see the intention behind this phrasing &ldquo;one daily newspaper&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I know this is a provision that generally applies in legislation of this type but there is a flaw there which might be easily corrected.  It is not quite clear what the purpose of this advertisement is under section 3 because there is no provision for objections.  Presumably the idea of advertising it is that, if anybody knew I would be liable to run a bad employment agency or exploit the situation, they could object to the Minister.  There does not seem to be any provision for objections to be lodged with the Minister.  This would defeat the objective of advertising in the daily newspaper.  I would be interested to hear what is the purpose behind this provision and why there is no provision or time set out&mdash;as there is, say, in the Planning Act&mdash;where there is a specific statutory time for lodging objections to a person proposing to erect a premises, for instance.</P>
    <P>My next problem is with section 5, where the Minister, if he intends to refuse permission, has 21 days in which to do so.  This seems reasonable, except that the assumption would be that, if I apply to open an employment agency and do not hear within 21 days, I am OK.  This seems a rather negative way of putting it.  It would be better to say that the Minister's time for considering applications is of a specified period and that there are times in which objections can be lodged.  This is not clear to me.  It seems unreasonable to leave people in doubt as to whether they can proceed with the opening of an agency.  Is it the position that the Minister could take three months to give an affirmative reply, although he can only take 21 days to give a negative one?  I am sure the Minister will be able to clear this up in his reply.</P>
    <P>Under section 6 (2), the Minister may:</P>
    <P>...if he so thinks fit, by order grant exemption from this Act or a specified provision thereof in respect of the carrying on of the business...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1021" /> This really puzzles me.  I have no legal training and I am not sure whether, under this Bill, an order and a regulation mean the same thing.  Under section 11 it is said regulations will be laid before the House, but I am not sure if this includes an order.  If it does not, how are we to know what exemptions have been granted under the Bill?  We should have some way of finding this out.  I had my problem about fees and, as the Minister mentions in his opening remarks, we have all been circularised by people who have definite interests in this, and I am satisfied about this.</P>
    <P>A situation which is of great concern is where a large number of girls are recruited as <i>au pair.</i>  This is not necessarily covered by an employment agency but is one of the areas of employment outside the State which should be looked into.  I am sure every Senator in the House is aware of some of the abuses which have occurred where young girls, often under 18 years, are recruited to go to a European country.  They have genuine reasons for going.  They want to become proficient in a foreign language.  They want to get the experience of living in a foreign country, but they are and have been exploited.  Some have benefited greatly by this but they are the exceptions which have been highlighted in the newspapers.  I should like to see this situation regularised in the Bill.  The advertisement is very often not done through what would normally be called an employment agency, but it is recruiting people to work outside the State.  We have to ask the question.  Is an advertisement for one person to act as <i>au pair</i> covered by the terms of the employment agency?  It probably is and the advertiser should, in fact, have applied for a licence.  I am sure the Minister would agree with me that the objective of the Bill is to cut out this type of exploitation and to regularise the position.</P>
    <P>These are the main problems which I have on the Bill.  I welcome it generally and am pleased to hear the Minister say he is prepared to meet the Federation of Employment Agencies between now and the Committee Stage. It is always a good thing, in introducing <Col N="1022" /> legislation in a new sphere, to have both employer and employee represented: it leads to a better understanding of what Government means.  I feel confident the Minister will clear up the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is reasonable to ask, in relation to any legislation which is proposed to be enacted, what is the mischief which the legislation is designed to cure.  It is not unreasonable in the case of a Bill such as this to ask two questions relative to it.  Firstly, and I hope the Minister will not misunderstand me, there was a somewhat casual reference in his introductory speech to abuses and grounds justifying the legislation.  I should have thought that, before we enact legislation which will add further to the cost of administering the affairs of this country, we would have had published some analysis by somebody competent to carry it out, telling us what the mischief is, its extent, its duration, whether it is getting worse or getting better.  I do not find myself informed on this.  I have had assistance from any of the Departments of State with which I dealt.  I have had assistance from the Minister's own Department in relation to everything that has been published concerning this, but I have not found anywhere any account of the abuses which the Bill is, presumably, designed to cure, to curb and to eliminate.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his speech referred to an important matter, as also did Senator Owens.  That is the International Labour Organisation Convention No. 96.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
      <P>We are one of the few countries in Europe which have not ratified it so far, but the provisions of this Bill should enable us to do so.</P>
      <P>I initiated a search for this when I first heard of this Bill and when I first heard of the existence of the Convention of the International Labour Office and did finally get it.  The Convention was revised in 1949, came into force, in effect, in 1951 and has not yet been enacted here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a confession of ignorance on <Col N="1023" /> my part, but the Minister should do us the service of telling us what is the background thinking to this Convention. The Convention is very strongly worded in its general directive against employment agencies.  For example, the Minister has not chosen to tell us if, when this Convention is to be enacted by this member country, we are going to accept the provisions of Part 2, which provides for the progressive abolition of fee-charging employment agencies conducted with a view to profit; or the provisions of Part 3, which provides for the regulation of fee-charging employment agencies, including agencies conducted with a view to profit.  Perhaps this is implied in the terms of the Bill, but I should have preferred more expressed and more explicit declaration of Government policy on this.  I do not like seeing us as a dog hungry for meat and taking any bit of a bone that is thrown at us from Europe.  I should like to know the background thinking to this.</P>
    <P>I do not think that this Convention has been ratified by the United Kingdom. In many ways our circumstances are more similar to the United Kingdom than they are to many other countries in Europe.  We should be circulated with the basis for the thinking behind the Convention and we should be able to make up our own minds as to whether it is justifiable.  I am not saying that I would not finally conclude that the Convention should be adopted or that it should not be adopted in the manner proposed by the Minister. However, I should like to know if on the Continent of Europe they have not got abuses of a kind that we have here, or if they have abuses we have not.</P>
    <P>I am going to be critical of some of the provisions of the Bill.  I should like to make my own position clear on it by saying that I think there is some mischief here and there is a justification for legislation with regard to this. The employment agency field does give scope for abuse and it is a field in which people can be exploited.  This is particularly true where the recruitment is for persons in this country for employment in another.  We appear to be far behind the United Kingdom in <Col N="1024" /> relation to this particular issue.  In what is now a broken up country council&mdash;London&mdash;there have been in existence regulations for employment agencies since 22nd November, 1921. These were made under the London County Council General Powers Act, 1921.</P>
    <P>It might be useful to the House if I read out bye-laws 11 and 12, which are contained in this scheme:</P>
    <P>An agent shall not propose or arrange for the employment abroad of any female person under the age of 18 years without first obtaining the sanction in writing of her parents or lawful guardian and unless he has satisfied himself that suitable arrangements have been made for the welfare of such person during the continuance of such employment and for her return to this country on the conclusion of such employment and that such employment is legal in the country in which the employment is to take place; and on making an engagement with such person he shall furnish to her free of cost a written document containing the provisions of this bye-law and stating that such provisions have been complied with; and he shall keep on the premises the written sanction of the parents or guardian for a period of 12 months from the date of the making of the engagement and shall, when required, produce such written sanction to any inspector or duly authorised officer of the council. The agent shall in any particular case, if so required by the council, furnish the council with full particulars of the arrangements.</P>
    <P>Regulation bye-law No. 12 states, and be it noted that this applies in every case, whether it be a female person under the age of 18 years or not:</P>
    <P>An agent shall, in every case in which he arranges for the employment abroad of any person or of the employment in this country of any person resident abroad, furnish such person free of charge with a copy of the contract, or other document showing the terms and conditions of such employment drawn up in a language understood by such <Col N="1025" /> person and he shall keep a copy of such contract or other document on the premises for a period of 12 months from the date thereof and shall, when required, produce such copy, contract or other document to any inspector or duly authorised officer of the council.</P>
    <P>These seem to be bye-laws which I could, very happily, accept as part of our statute law.  The bye-laws were originally made in 1921 and subsequently revised.  I do not know if these particular ones were made in 1921 or were subsequent amendments.  Some provision equivalent therefor to section 8, subsection (2) (i) would be welcomed. I would prefer if we had in this the English habit of spelling out what the law is rather than the Irish habit, which is developing, of the Minister taking power to tell us later on what the law is going to be, without our knowing yet what the law is going to be and without having been given any opportunity, other than the slight opportunity of annulling the order, of discussing the matter.</P>
    <P>It is a slight opportunity.  Could the Chair tell the House when an order made by a Minister of State was annulled and what use is the debate about the annulment of an order? This is the time to have the debate. Now is the time for the Minister to declare to us what is in his mind.  If provisions of the type I read out&mdash; not that language but any language he cares, perhaps something adapted to our own circumstances&mdash;were proposed to us, I, for one, would not object.  This is one field in which there is possibility of abuse.  All countries appear to recognise this.  It is strongly set forth in the Convention which, the Minister tells us, it is proposed to adopt.  There is a long and terrible history connected with employment for abroad, about which we all know. Apparently, we have been dependent on the provisions of the Health Act, 1907, to protect people concerned.</P>
    <P>Another kind of abuse is clear and that is that accommodation may not be adequate, and may be very undesirable. The London bye-laws relating to this go into the matter in a detail which would be embarrassing to <Col N="1026" /> the House and I shall not dwell on it.  Apart from the question of whether it is desirable to have provisions such as they have with regard to sleeping accommodation, I should like to know what are the deficiencies in our Offices Act.  Forgive me, but I am unable to produce the name of the statute.  There is a statute which has been applied to myself, so I know that it exists.  I am referring to the type of people who come in and say whether in the accommodation we are providing there is enough space for any given employee, whether a simple amendment of the offices Act would not deal with this question of accommodation.</P>
    <P>I also think, just to concede another point in favour of this measure, that it may be desirable to require the licensing of persons who charge fees to employees.  Anyone who charges fees to employees is putting himself into a category in which, in my view, the State ought to intervene to protect such a person engaged in such a business. As to the rest, those who are not engaging in making arrangements for employment abroad or being engaged in such know exactly what they have to comply with, that is to say, that they have got to give a copy of the contract to the applicant and keep a copy of the contract available for inspection and see that it is translated and that the terms are truly and well known to the individual.  I think all of that is reasonable and I would be in favour of it.</P>
    <P>Despite the provisions which I note the Minister is proposing in the Bill to have for exemption, I am a little disturbed to note the language which he uses with regard to exemption.  The Bill is not going to apply to anybody on the State level.  There is power to exclude any particular class of employment agency.  I find the words used here very worrying indeed.</P>
    <P>It is intended to use this provision to exclude agencies conducted by charitable and other bodies which do not charge fees for their services or which only charge such amounts as may cover their expenses.</P>
    <P>If that is the limited intent of the Minister, all I can say is that I think that the overall effect of this Bill, if <Col N="1027" /> enacted, will be bad.  I agree there are persons requiring to be curbed.  I agree there are persons requiring to be protected. I agree there are situations in which the State should have every right to intervene and to intervene effectively. But you can cast a net so wide that you can catch persons who, in fact, are providing a very useful service.  I hope we will find the Minister as ready to listen to suggestions for amendments as we have found one of his colleagues today&mdash;and indeed, I must say, on many other days recently others of his colleagues.  I am going to suggest to the Minister that he ought to re-examine the provisions with regard to exemption. First of all, I do not think it should be limited only to these extremely worthy charitable bodies that he has in mind to exempt.  It should also be extended to other people, other persons who are rendering very useful services to this country and to this economy.</P>
    <P>Before I go into some discussion about the kind of persons who will be affected by this, may I say that I think that, where there are provisions for exemption, as there are provisions for exemption, there should be the like sort of provisions with regard to the revocation of exemption as there are provisions with regard to appeals in connection with the licences.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I am sure, is well aware of the Bill which was introduced in 1966 in the British House of Commons by Hugh Jenkins &ldquo;The Employment Agencies (Regulation) Bill&rdquo; to regulate fee charging employment agencies and which was, so far as it went, what I would describe as a socialist measure and yet does not go as far as this Bill goes in relation to the powers taken by the State.  Many matters are, if I may say so, more expressly set forth in that Bill than are set forth in the Bill before the House.  I would invite the Minister to consider the provisions of that Bill which was never enacted.  I think the Minister if he does exempt, as I think he should exempt, should not be free to exempt without giving appropriate notice to the persons exempted of his intention to exempt or to withdraw the <Col N="1028" /> exemption and that he should specify the reasons for his intention to withdraw the exemption.  He should give the exempted person an opportunity of appealing against his decision to the court just as under similar Bills we have recently been discussing there are rights of appeal which are necessary for the protection of people in the conduct of their business.</P>
    <P>There are a number of very distinguished, very expert and professional firms engaged here in consultancy business. In addition to those who are industrial or management consultants, there are a number of the larger firms of accountants who give great service to their country and great service to their clients&mdash;and through giving good service to their clients give good service to the economy&mdash;who have management selection divisions and all of whom will now require to look for exemption, or if not, be subject to the provisions with regard to inspection contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The most important thing I want to say about this Bill is this.  It cannot come as a surprise for me to present the proposition to this House that Dublin is not London.  There is a very distinguished citizen of Dublin holding an august position, constantly in the news, generally in an unfavourable light who is recorded as having once said to someone, who reported it to me: &ldquo;Dublin is a tricky little city&rdquo;. Dublin is a tricky little city and, if you tell three people, you have told about 96 people before you have gone home that evening.  The confidential nature of the information received by people who are engaged in the business of getting suitable employees for companies looking for them is the absolute rock on which their business is built.</P>
    <P>These professional firms and these consultants&mdash;many of them, may I say, are only engaged in management selection as part of the service which they are rendering the companies where they are clients&mdash;find it essential to make the most elaborate arrangements to preserve the confidential nature of the information they receive.</P>
    <P>May I say how very serious it is that this right to inspect files should be given, and we seem to be giving it <Col N="1029" /> here.  I am going to present the view to the House that it is, of course, of prime importance that we should be producing skills.  That is of the first importance, but next in importance to the production of skills is the distribution of skills&mdash;to see that the right people are in the right jobs. Therefore, anything which impedes getting the right man into the right job is a bad measure.  If the position is, as I understand it to be, that in relation to top jobs in this city and in this country, senior civil servants and high ranking employees of semi-State companies are sometimes in a preponderance in the applications for the positions, we are creating an impediment to the mobility of skilled labour which is very bad for the economy.  One thing on which Marxists and the defenders of the capitalist economy are agreed on is that the production of wealth is essentially a matter of the organisation of men.  The Marxists' claim is that this can only be done by direction from the top along the complicated nature of the Marxist theory.  The capitalists say that the best way of organising labour is through the free operation of the market.  I suggest that if we protect those who are seeking employment abroad, if we protect the young and give these other protections which we think should be given, we can let the market determine what is the best way of getting the skill into the appropriate jobs.  The ones who are not any good will be found out soon enough and those who are good will progress and improve their position.</P>
    <P>A person in the Civil Service or in a semi-State body must not let his colleagues know that he is unhappy in his job and is thinking of moving elsewhere.  There may be people, not present among the personnel of the Department of Labour, but some future members thereof, who would be very interested to know what their colleagues were doing and their inspectors might be very interested to know. There is one thing that most Irishmen will not risk and that is their existing position for the chance of getting a better one, or their improvement and progress therein and the confidence of their employers in them.  If an <Col N="1030" /> employer hears that an employee is looking for another job he is the one the employer is the least enthusiastic about from that moment on.  All the plans for the organisation of that business from then on are based on the proposition that he may go at any time unless some major deal is done with him.</P>
    <P>In looking at the higher executive jobs upon which the performance of a whole company depends it is essential that the right man gets into the right job.  If the House will permit me to continue on this line, a personal history sheet must be filled in by an applicant for one of these jobs.  Following on this personal history sheet he has perhaps two interviews in which he goes into his family background and any difficulties or marital problems there may be.  He is subjected to psychological and other tests, the interpretations of which might be very embarrassing and the interpretations of which he might not even know are being made.  These are recorded under the present arrangement by the people who have their reputation to protect because it is in their business interests to have it so and for no other reason.</P>
    <P>If I understand this Bill rightly they are being capable of being disclosed. It is not sufficient to be told that this is the situation already in operation in London.  London is not Dublin; it is a much bigger place than Dublin.  Has anybody ever walked through a London street and noticed anybody looking at him?  Has anybody ever walked through St. Stephen's Green without everyone looking at him and without him looking at everyone because he is expecting to meet two or three of his friends before getting from one corner to another? Nobody in London ever expects to see anybody whom he knows so therefore he does not bother to look.  It is important to remember that London is not like Dublin and that Irishmen are not British people.  Irish people have a long history of painful unemployment and inability to get jobs and are very shy about disclosing their ambitions. We have all had the history of concealing from our landlords any improvements we carry out because the rent would go up.  If anybody thinks <Col N="1031" /> that this information can be procured it is a very dangerous thing.  A higher civil servant in a Department who is looking for a job in, say, Aer Lingus, will think the information will be known to his colleagues in the Department through the reports of the inspectors. Despite the high reputation of service I do not see how this will be removed or eliminated.  I do not believe it will be.</P>
    <P>The techniques applied in discovering who is right for what job were developed during the last war when tasks of very great moment had to be performed by some people and they could not take the risk that a person might not have the adequate ability for it.  These are the techniques which are now being used by the companies, the quality professional firms, to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is enacted we will find that there will be a falling off in applications to these bodies and as a result a decline in the quality of the service given to the companies who are looking for a particular person.  Everyone accepts that an engineer or an accountant is a professional man but it must be agreed that nowadays there are new kinds of professions in existence which are rendering very important services.  This business of the quality of performance always precedes the elaboration of regulations and rules as to what is a quality performance in the profession itself.  Good practice precedes rules providing for good practice and the good practice of the successful professional people who are engaged in this operation preceded the regulation of their affairs in any way.</P>
    <P>Before they know what sort of person they are to look for they must decide for what sort of organisation he is required, what is its existing structure, what procedure is there in it for reaching decisions, how frustrating will it be for a particularly talented young man to go into a place where the decision making process is bad?  They want to know the reason for the appointment. Here is a point at which service is very often rendered to the employee.  One of the revelations that develops with these people is that, where they find a high <Col N="1032" /> turnover of staff in particular companies, they begin to realise that the flaw lies with the employer.  They protect a particular employee and see that he does not go to the employment being offered by such a person.</P>
    <P>They also must know the exact responsibilities that the employee is going to have.  They will also want to know, for his sake, and to be able to tell him what will be his expectations of promotion. This business of mobility of labour, by the way, is very important because, not merely is it a good thing for the employer to get the employee, but very often it is a good thing for the employee to get out of existing employment and to get to the right employer. The employer may find&mdash;and this is one of the skills which is in fact developed by these people&mdash;that a certain person is capable of far more productive work than he is being asked to do in the job he has at the moment. At the end of this type of consideration they have got to specify what the job is and then, in the end, the service may be one which is rendered to an employer and it may not even consist of getting an employee for him because they may discover, within his own organisation, someone who should get promoted to the job that has to be filled.  They have to develop interviewing techniques.  This very often means that they bring in knowledge of the particular trade to supplement their ordinary routines to be quite sure that the person concerned has the kind of knowledge or experience which is right for it.  I have had some experience of this myself.  I have looked in certain instances for someone to fill a job and nobody paid any attention to my advertisement, because I did not know how to word the damn thing.  But then I asked somebody who did and he worded it in a completely different way and we got the person we wanted.  In this business, therefore, there is a matter of having skill in drafting the advertisement to look for the people you require.  There is another job they do, that is, they counsel managers on how to handle people.  Foreign managers very often coming in here need to be counselled on how to manage Irish people and this is a service which is <Col N="1033" /> being rendered by people who are carrying on employment agencies&mdash;not necessarily as the prime part of their job but as one of their jobs, as part of their general job of advising an industry or an industrialist or someone engaging in commerce.</P>
    <P>Another type of skill which they require is a knowledge about what is the price for the job, what is to be given by way of salary.  I find it very hard to understand what they are saying to me about fringe benefits, profit-sharing schemes and so on.  But an employment agency of the kind I am speaking of has a kind of skill which is completely different from that which is offered by certain other employment agencies.  The Minister should express himself in the Bill in a way in which I think he has in his opening speech. He should express himself firmly in the Bill, in a manner in which Jenkins proposed to express himself in a Bill that did not get enacted.  &ldquo;The powers to make regulations&rdquo;&mdash;section 5 of Jenkins&mdash;&ldquo;conferred by the two preceding sections shall include power to make different regulations as respect different classes of employment agency or as respect the same classes of agency in different circumstances.&rdquo; There is a full and complete recognition in that Bill of the point I am making about the different quality of the service.</P>
    <P>I also think that the Minister may have received complaints about excessive charges.  We read in the paper that people are awarded certain sums for doing certain services and everybody is shocked at the figures they see.  But, of course, this may be totally to mislead the reality of the reward because the fee that may be awarded is to cover all sorts of different outlays and the maintenance of an organisation of a highly expensive kind during a time when they may not be earning fees of that kind.  Therefore I suggest to the Minister that his advisers are not likely to be anything other than shocked if they are told that someone is paid £500 to get an employee at £4,000 per annum, or something of that kind.  They will regard this as a grossly excessive fee but they will not understand the nature of the service <Col N="1034" /> which the company in question has rendered for that £500.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy about the provision with regard to the control of fees.  I would understand the provision with regard to the notification of fees as this would keep the Minister informed, but any question of demonstrating what the fee or scale was for a particular instance would be entirely wrong and I agree with the views expressed in a document which everybody in the Seanad, including the Minister I imagine, has received on this particular point.</P>
    <P>On the matter of regulations regarding the conduct of the agencies, I concede that there should be some obligations assuming you have bodies that are not going to be exempt.  If these bodies are not to be exempt, it is wrong, but if they are not to be exempt the matter of the confidential nature of the information they receive during the period of their exemption&mdash;if it is an exemption&mdash;must be looked at very closely indeed by the Minister.  It is interesting to note that the Jenkins Bill provided in a much more limited way. It simply required persons holding licences under the preceding section to keep books, cards or forms showing the business conducted by the agency and prescribed the form of such books and the entries to be made in them.  All that is not too bad but I would prefer if the Minister would open his mind to a general exemption of a much more extensive character than that he has indicated.  I would say that the question that I might properly put to the Minister is this: can modern Ireland, dependent so much on the proper organisation of industry for its future success, afford to be without an efficient system of getting executives of the highest quality into the positions of the greatest responsibility?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as a particular safeguard for those people who need to be most protected, namely, those who have only their skills to offer, their labour to offer.  I feel, however, like Senator Alexis FitzGerald, that the Bill is rather wide and I hope that at the Committee Stage the Minister will be prepared to make some <Col N="1035" /> amendments in this regard.  In his opening speech the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>It is intended that this service will cater for all classes of workers from the unskilled to the professional and administrative classes.</P>
      <P>If a person of the administrative and professional classes is to use his own abilities and his own skills to the utmost and if he is not to feel constantly frustrated, he must have the capacity to seek other employment. With a person of that nature it is of the utmost importance that any application he makes, or any wish on his part to change his employment, must be a matter of the utmost confidence. The Bill provides that records will be kept and I take it that these records, as a matter of prime or normal necessity, would include records of persons who are applying for employment and also records of persons looking for employees.  From both points of view if these were to become public they would greatly damage the ability of certain firms in business, or certain professional groups, to get the most suitable persons.  They would damage also the prospects of men of high administrative ability and of professional men to use their ability and their capacity to the best advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, in section 9, (3) (b) of the Bill it is provided that not only may such books and records be inspected but that the inspector who goes to the employment agency may &ldquo;take copies of any entries in such books or records&rdquo;.  Certainly in regard to the professional and administrative classes the employment agencies dealing with these&mdash;particularly if the fees are paid by the employers&mdash;should either be excluded or the Minister should be in a position to give us an undertaking that they will get exemption as a matter of routine.  In most professional bodies &mdash;whether it be my own, which is the legal profession, or whether it be the medical profession or otherwise&mdash; usually the council or governing body of that profession know the standards and requirements of various firms.  They also know the standard and abilities of <Col N="1036" /> various members.  Very frequently they provide this service for their members. If they are to be classified as employment agencies and if they have to keep these records, put up notices and so on, then in my opinion this would gravely stultify their ability to carry out a very important function.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, where fees are paid by the employer and not by the employee it should not be necessary to publish the scale of fees, or indeed to have any particular scale of fees.  I know from experience that on occasion firms, with which I have been associated, have paid anything from £400 to £600 to get the type of man they required.  They got very good service from time to time.  Even from the time you make the application to a firm of consultants to select a person for you to the time when the selection is ultimately made, additional work has to be done.  Perhaps the services of an industrial psychologist were required.  Additional expenses had to be incurred and additional advertisements inserted and the fees rose from what was probably an original estimate of £300 or £400 to double that figure.  Even if the fees are doubled, very frequently, by getting the person you want, the person who will improve your business and you have got very good service for your money.</P>
    <P>I cannot visualise how people of that nature could be expected to publish the scale of fees seeing that their fees will vary from case to case and from employer to employer.  The fees are paid by the employer.  He is not going to pay unless he feels he is going to get value for his money. These people, if they are to be on the penny-in-the-slot system, will not give the service which one requires if one is to obtain high administrative officers and people of professional standing.</P>
    <P>I should like to see all professional bodies and organisations exempted even if they give this service to their members.  I should also like to see industrial consultants&mdash;and all employment agencies where fees are collected only from the employers&mdash; exempted from the requirement to publish their scale of fees.  I feel this would frustrate them in giving the service to the employer which the employer <Col N="1037" /> may require.  Subject to these reservations&mdash;and for which I hope the Minister will introduce the necessary amendments on the Committee Stage&mdash;I welcome the Bill most heartily. It is long overdue and I congratulate the Minister on introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion so far as I have heard it has taken us away from what, I thought, was the purpose of the Bill.  I am aware that, apart from the question of recruiting highly skilled people to industry, the professions or some other highly skilled occupation, there have been, in the past, a number of employment agencies recruiting labour over which there was no control.  We see advertisements of employment agencies in the newspapers every day.  These people come to Ireland, set up their headquarters in one of the better type hotels in Dublin, and recruit people for employment abroad, employment over which we have no control.  This situation became so bad that in my own county it was considered necessary to set up a social service organisation to advise people beforehand on what type of employment they should take up and on what the standing of the people recruiting them was.  It is no secret that many people were induced to take up employment which was entirely outside their own environment, totally undesirable to their parents and not in their own best interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I agree with what Senators FitzGerald and Nash have said, I understood that this Bill was confined to the type of agencies who demand considerable remuneration from people whom they eventually guide into very unremunerative employment.  In the western counties special organisations had to be set up to safeguard people from accepting offers from organisations who purported to be guiding them into special employment.  There is a great difference between these two opinions and I presume that the Bill is directed towards preventing people from being guided into employment which is the least suspect.  Many employment agencies are not suspect but this Bill is a protective Bill to ensure that young people are not attracted away from their own environment <Col N="1038" /> where they may be able to obtain good employment, by lucrative offers which often turn out to be very misleading. If this is the purpose of the Bill it deserves the support of the House. I have no doubt that, if a situation arises where responsible bodies looking for people at managerial level, are prepared to offer remuneration in proportion to the ability of those who are likely to attain these positions, that is admirable.  I understood this Bill to be a protection for the ordinary people from being imposed upon by irresponsible persons who proclaim themselves as being employment agencies and who misguide people into unsuitable occupations.</P>
    <P>If my reading of the Bill is correct, it is not for the purpose of limiting the recruitment of high level staff.  It is for the protection of ordinary young people from being attracted from their homes by very promising occupations which often turn out to be the reverse.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to say very much on this Bill.  Both the contributions of Senator FitzGerald and Senator Nash were very much in line with my own views.  I do not think Senator Honan is quite correct in his statement.  The Minister made it clear in his opening remarks.  I quote:</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to provide for the registration of private employment agencies, the approval of fees they may charge and to require such agencies to furnish returns of their activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I interpret that correctly, it means that any agency charging a fee will come under the provisions of this Bill. I should like to agree with the views put forward by Senators Nash and FitzGerald in regard to what I might call specialist types of employment agencies.  Other Senators, beside myself, have had experience of some of the professional or specialist types of agencies who cater for senior or professional type of staff.  I think they are doing an excellent job.  They have a reputation to maintain.  From what I know of their premises, these are first class.  If they do recommend somebody <Col N="1039" /> to you&mdash;this is my personal experience &mdash;and that applicant turns out not to be satisfactory, they will undertake the task of reviewing a further lot of applicants, and substantially reduce their fees on the second occasion.</P>
    <P>If it is made obligatory on this type of agency to publish their fees, they may adopt a hardline attitude and say &ldquo;Our fee is £300, £350 or £500 as the case may be.  We are sorry the person recommended was not satisfactory and we are quite prepared to do the job again at the same fee as published and as known to the Minister's Department&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The relationship between this type of agency and the employer or firm seeking the particular type of professional person is very close and does not come under the type of category which the Minister is rightly seeking to control. It should be possible in this Bill to achieve what the Minister wants.  I have not heard any statistics or any reliable information in regard to the alleged abuses in the employment agency business.  We hear some extraordinary stories of the most tragic occurrences where girls are recruited for various types of employment, mainly outside this country.</P>
    <P>So long as we have a high unemployment rate, good employment agencies, properly controlled and supervised, have a useful purpose.  I am sorry it is necessary to have them, but if a young man or woman with or without qualifications cannot get employment here they are entitled to get the best job possible outside the country. If these reputable agencies can assist in this they should get every encouragement to carry on their business.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister and his advisers will be able to introduce some amendments to this Bill to provide for the type of situation that has been emphasised by some of the Senators and myself in this regard.  The enormous increase in the number of these agencies over recent years amazes me. It must be a profitable occupation and the Minister is right to require that they should furnish their fees.  I should like to see reputable agencies operating under reasonable control, doing a good <Col N="1040" /> job and getting suitable employment for people who cannot obtain employment at home.</P>
    <P>If the dubious type of agency exists, it should be put out of business.  In encouraging the better type of agency, the Minister should be ruthless in stamping out the type of abuses that apparently do occur.  It should be possible to achieve both those aims within the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I hope you will forgive me, Sir, if I repeat some of the things that have already been said.  I welcome the Bill and my strongest complaint is that it does not go far enough. This Bill is intended for the people who are being exploited while trying to find employment and is not meant to deal with the one-in-a-million jobs some of the Senators have talked about.  A lot of that work is done through accountancy firms.</P>
      <P>The Bill pays too much attention to two things.  I do not object to the first, which deals with the kind of person applying to the agency and the sort of person running the agency.  I do object to the fact that, when a licence is issued, it seems to last for ever.  Therefore, when the original owner of the agency dies, any unscrupulous person could be running the agency.  A great deal of attention is paid to the premises. If you saw half of the solicitors' offices in Dublin, you would not worry too much about this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them.  I said &ldquo;half&rdquo;.  However, subsection (1) of section 3, where it sets out to try to catch out one of these, deals with papers &ldquo;circulating in the State&rdquo;. That should be amended to &ldquo;circulating in the area&rdquo;.  You could get papers circulating in the State such as <i>The United Irishman.</i>  It is circulated in the State and it might not be read by everyone and it might not be read by the person who might want to object to these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two further points I should like to make.  One is in relation to white slave labour and the exploitation of young boys and girls.  This did exist and still exists.  There are <Col N="1041" /> British newspapers circulating in this country which publish advertisements for youths.  They hold interviews in hotels in Dublin.  I should like to quote Senator FitzGerald, perhaps out of context, but he was speaking on 19th February on the Unit Trusts Bill, and I learned a lot from him.  He is reported at column 820 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>You will find the greater part of Sunday papers, if examined, will be found to be the same as the equivalent circulating in England.</P>
    <P>I remember buying <i>The People</i> on the occasion when Sir Roger Casement's body was being taken home.  On the headline it said: &ldquo;Irish Claim Patriot's Body&rdquo;.  That evening I met a friend on a plane from Edinburgh and he had a copy of <i>The People</i> with him and it said: &ldquo;Irish Claim Traitor's Body&rdquo;.  There is a significant difference between the contents of these two papers.  I am using Senator FitzGerald's quotation to bring out this point.  I know that he was speaking of Irish Sunday papers.  Why are English Sunday newspapers allowed to continue to circulate in this area and to advertise as against the agencies here?  Until their circulation is forbidden, this legislation will be ineffective in its real purpose.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to one important matter and that is the powers given to the Minister's representatives who will be appointed to inspect the premises, files, and so forth.  Unless these people have wider powers and have the powers to inspect the places of employment, particularly when people go to work abroad, to inspect living accommodation and the conditions in which these people are living, it is very easy for anyone to supply unreal reports of their conditions to an agency here.  It is very easy for these people to apply for, say, 100 employees; they arrive and the employer says: &ldquo;I am sorry, we have room for only 50, but we can get the other 50 placed somewhere else.&rdquo;  All these gimmicks can be used.  The powers should be extended in this case, so that the inspectors would have powers, if it is feasible, to travel outside the State to see where these employees ultimately end up.  That is the purpose of the Bill. <Col N="1042" /> That is what the Minister had in mind when he introduced it, and not some of the other matters that were put forward here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to welcome the Minister.  This is the first time he has introduced a Bill in the Seanad.  Senator Gallanagh said that one is bound to do a bit of repeating. In my experience, going back over a number of years, what we really needed in this country was to know what sort of employment agencies one could direct Irish people to abroad. This is an area in which, up to a few years ago, we as a society were falling down completely.  I have had some considerable experience of this in Britain and I know that, due to our own ignorance, many Irish emigrants have found themselves in dead-end jobs.  They had plenty of talent and ability but nobody seemed to know, neither parents nor educators, where to tell them to go.  Apart from our internal situation, that raises an aspect that is of considerable importance.  That is, the matter of reputable employment agencies in Britain and what their situation would be under this Bill.  I think the Minister referred to it.  It is mainly a question of sorting out what sort of agencies overseas you would allow to advertise here, that is, those who seek employment for Irish people in Britain.</P>
      <P>However, I am assured by the people in the business here that there is need for control and regulation of employment agencies and for the laying down of the minimum regulations and standards.  I do not know enough about the position within the State but I have been assured of this by people who are engaged in this business.  If there is abuse here within the State, it would be necessary for the Minister to have these powers.  The most important aspect is to ensure that young people, particularly those going abroad, should be protected from exploitation.  In order to protect them the Minister should have power over advertisements in both Irish and foreign newspapers offering employment to young Irish people abroad.  That is the the most important aspect that occurs to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be concerned to some degree if this Bill were to involve the State <Col N="1043" /> in a very high cost of inspection, because I am not aware of any great abuse within the State.  We all know that there is a tradition of employment in Britain and that there are agencies operating there.</P>
    <P>What appealed to me in the Minister's speech was his reference to a manpower service.  If the intention of the Minister in seeking to inspect books is to tie in with a manpower service, which is the responsibility of the Department of Labour, this would be justifiable.  However, I would be concerned on the question of confidentiality. I do not agree with Senator FitzGerald who seemed to think that the names of applicants would get around Dublin.  I know things do get around Dublin, but it would surprise me to hear that any officers of the Department would disclose names.  I do not think that this would happen.</P>
    <P>Where an agency seeks fees from a potential employee, I agree that the Minister should have some knowledge of and give approval to such fees.  I have some considerable doubts regarding the desirability of determining fees in the case of the better type of employment agencies who may be regarded as consultants, who do not charge the employee but who charge the employer, and I have considerable experience in this area over a number of years in employment here in semi-State and different organisations in which I am voluntarily engaged and in which we have had regularly employed consultants to find the right type of person.  This is a highly confidential job.  I have even been involved in this area in semi-State business and here you are in a very sensitive area in which you are dealing with applications from people who could not afford to have it known that they were applying for such positions.  It is very important that that area of confidentiality should be fully protected.  I do not think that the Minister's representatives would in any way break confidentiality but in this particular area I do not see why the information regarding the people concerned should have to be made available except, of course, in cases where there was thought to be a breach of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1044" /> I query the reason for exemptions but I have not enough knowledge on this.  I should like the Minister, when he is replying, to explain what sort of agencies are exempt because, again, if this is being tied in with the Department of Labour's manpower service then the more information that would be available to the Department the better.</P>
    <P>The main points I should like to again emphasise are the exploitation of young people through the advertising by foreign agencies for employment to attract young people abroad.  I have considerable knowledge of a number of the consultants here who are highly specialised.  I have over the years come to the conclusion that you can never tell until you have seen a man working what he is going to be like. I think it is invariably a gamble but, nevertheless, I&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, some bets are better than others.  It is surprising what can go wrong.  I have a considerable respect for quite a number of consultant agencies in Dublin.  I have seen them operating and I have seen the results.  This is an area in which the Minister should exercise great care because I believe it is in this area, where specialist and highly skilled employment is made available, that we will need to be strongest whether we become members of the European Economic Community or not.  I am not dealing with State employment or the ordinary employment agency level here.  I am dealing with the highly skilled, talented individual that you want to be able to put in the right position because, irrespective of whether we enter the European Economic Community or not, we are going into a very highly competitive life in the future and we will have to be able to provide the best human material possible to make a success of our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me confess at the start that I view this Bill with rather mixed feelings.  I can appreciate the case that can be made for a Bill of this sort but it seems to me that, as in <Col N="1045" /> the case of so many other Bills, when a Bill is drafted and introduced in order to deal with a particular matter which the Minister has in mind, the Bill very frequently is of such a scope that it can catch within its net many concerns, many aspects of business that it probably is not the intention of the Minister to capture at all.  At the risk of boring the House by repeating views that I have expressed frequently on Bills, it is not, I think, for Members of this House or of the other House to assume that the same Ministerial policy will be operated indefinitely.  Even though the present Minister may make it quite clear in the course of this discussion that he regards this Bill as being enacted, when it is enacted, for the purpose of dealing with particular agencies and particular situations, nevertheless if the Bill is of such scope as to bring in other ventures, other businesses and other agencies, then I think we have got to deal with it on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got to ask ourselves is it proper that the powers and functions which are to be given to the Minister in this Bill should apply not merely to the agencies which he may indicate that he has in mind but should apply also to other businesses and other agencies.  I am concerned, in particular, with regard to a question raised by Senator Alexis FitzGerald in relation to the Bill and that is the application of the Bill, as drafted, to consultants&mdash; if we can call them agencies, of a sort which probably is not in the Minister's mind at all.  It does seem to me that where you have a particular system in operation which is valuable for finding employees as well as finding employment but, in particular, viewing it from the point of view of finding employees of a highly expert character in the management or consultant class, where this agency &mdash;and again I am using that term in the framework of the Bill&mdash;get information, which it is necessary for them to get, of a highly confidential character in relation to the particular person that they may be trying to place or in relation to the particular job which they are trying to fill, that we should solemnly enact a piece of legislation which is going to give officers of the Minister authority to inspect the <Col N="1046" /> private and highly confidential files of that concern.  It seems to me that under the Bill as it is drafted that consequence will follow as a legal consequence of the enactment of this Bill. Because in section 9 (3) (b) of the Bill, which deals with the power of entry and inspection, one of the powers given to authorised officers is to inspect such books and records relating to the business of an employment agency as are required to be kept under this Bill and to take copies of any entries in such books or records. Therefore, not only is there power of inspection but there is the power to take copies of any books or records.</P>
    <P>It is possible that I am over painting the picture when I speak about confidential files and records.  That is a matter I am prepared to examine more closely before we discuss this Bill at Committee Stage.  The reason I may be over painting the point is that under that particular subsection it might be argued against me that the kind of confidential information of which I speak may not be the information which is required to be kept under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Going back to section 8, which deals with the general powers which the Minister has in the making of regulations, I do not think there is any limitation at all.  Under section 8 the Minister may make regulations for giving effect to this Bill and generally for controlling and supervising the carrying on of employment agencies.  It is made quite clear at the commencement of subsection (2), where various powers regarding regulations are listed, that all of these are without prejudice to the generality of section 8 (1) which specifically refers to the controlling and supervising of the carrying on of employment agencies.</P>
    <P>Anything the agency are entitled to carry on during the course of their business may be the subject of supervision by ministerial regulation.  In the course of that supervision the Minister may, for reasons that may seem perfectly proper to him, make a regulation authorising the inspection even of matters which would ordinarily be regarded as confidential between the firm and the person whom it is seeking <Col N="1047" /> to place, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the firm or person who has the vacancy.  I feel that, by and large, this Bill as it now stands, taking it in its widest construction, can extend far beyond the limits of the ordinary employment agency we know of and that we think of when we think of employment agencies.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I missed the Minister's introductory speech because I was at another meeting but I gathered from one of my colleagues that the Minister has indicated that it is not intended the Bill should apply to businesses that are not operated for profit.  Perhaps the Minister could give an indication of whether I am right in that.  If I am wrong in it and if the definition of employment agency contained in the Bill will stand, then it strengthens my view that the Bill goes too far.  I can think of many examples, and I am sure many of my colleagues can think of others that will come into the definition section although they are not in any real sense of the term employment agencies at all.</P>
    <P>For example, I could think of the situation which might arise if the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland were approached by a firm of solicitors and because they were so approached they endeavoured to find a suitable solicitor to fill a vacancy in the office of that firm of solicitors.  Under the definition section as it stands, it would seem that they would then be engaging in the business of an employment agency even though there is no question of any fee being charged.  The definition as it reads is:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this Bill the business of an employment agency means the business of seeking, whether for reward or otherwise, on behalf of others, persons who will give or accept employment and includes the obtaining or supplying for reward of persons who will accept employment for others.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of the example I have given, the last few words of that definition section can be forgotten about but the beginning of it is very definitely relevant.  For example, the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland would <Col N="1048" /> then be seeking, otherwise than for reward, on behalf of others, persons who would give or accept employment and that would fall directly within the definition of an employment agency under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure the Minister has no intention of regarding the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland in such circumstances as an employment agency.  Nevertheless, as I see it, the definition section would make them an employment agency in those circumstances and all the legal consequences which would follow from the Minister making regulations would then apply to them.  They might find on their doorstep one fine morning an authorised officer seeking to inspect various records and other things in relation to solicitors' offices and so on.  I would be very much up in arms against that.</P>
    <P>I wish to query in a general way if the Minister is the right person to be the licensing authority at all.  I must confess that I have not thought this through.  I know that the pattern in this country so far as licences or permits of one sort or another are concerned, is that the Minister, as head of a Department, though not necessarily this Minister in the Department of Labour, has been the person who should issue licences or give permission to issue permits.  I wonder if it would not be better that the licensing authority should be the local authority in the various areas where employment agencies of the ordinary kind exist and whom the Bill is designed to deal with. In that way a certain amount of the additional machinery and administration that is bound to arise under this Bill might possibly be avoided if the authority to license or withhold licences were to be vested in the local authority. The machinery for such inspections as might be necessary would already be there.</P>
    <P>One thing I do welcome in the Bill is the procedure for appealing from a Ministerial decision either to refuse a licence or to revoke one.  I think it is right that there should be an appeal from that decision and I think the appropriate appeal would be to the courts as provided for in the Bill. Another point that worries me slightly <Col N="1049" /> about this Bill is section 7, which vests in the Minister, to put it bluntly, the right to fix the fees which may be charged by employment agencies.  I know that the wording of this does not put it as bluntly as that: it states:</P>
    <P>No employment agency may charge any fees except in accordance with scales which are to be approved by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister is the approving authority rather than the fixing authority, but I think it is six of one and half a dozen of the other because if the Minister does not approve he can continue not approving until he has his way, until whichever scale of charges he has decided upon comes up to him from the employment agency in question, and then he approves.  So that, in actual practice the right to fix the fees is being vested in the Minister under section 7 of this Bill.  I do not know how the Minister is to approach that particular task.  He has conceded in his opening speech, which I have read, that it is not intended to fix the same scale of fees for every agency, and obviously it would not be possible to do that because the nature of the services offered by different agencies might differ very materially and allowance has to be made for that.  On the other hand, I do not know whether one gets very much further if one has a situation where agencies which render, generally speaking, a similar service, may be subject to a situation where a different scale of fees is to be approved in relation to them.</P>
    <P>There is also the point that in this Bill at the moment there is, as I read it, a requirement of the agency to keep posted the list of fees that have been approved by the Minister.  I could understand that kind of provision if we were talking about a situation where the Minister was saying to us: &ldquo;Listen, I am going to have one scale of fees and this is going to be applicable to every agency&rdquo;.  Then there would be no reason at all why the scale of fees should not be posted up in a prominent position on the premises of every agency.  But where you have quite the opposite situation, where the Minister says to us that he is introducing the Bill, that will be the <Col N="1050" /> position.  It will not be a question of a uniform scale of fees applying to all agencies.  There will be different scales applicable to different agencies.  I am not sure that it does not create an unnecessary source of embarrassment, at least to the agency, that they should be then required in those circumstances, when there are to be variations as between one agency and another in their scale of fees, to post that up publicly so that their competitors may go in and see which scale has been allowed in case A as against case B.  That is a matter which the Minister might possibly think of again.</P>
    <P>Also in connection with section 10 dealing with offences, I would urge the Minister to consider at least some amendment of subsection (2) when he comes to deal with this in Committee. Subsection (2) sets out that:</P>
    <P>Where an offence under this Act is committed by a body corporate and is proved to have been so committed with the consent or approval of, or to have been facilitated by any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary, or other officer of the body corporate, the director, manager, secretary or other officer shall also be deemed to be guilty of the offence.</P>
    <P>Senator Nash, I feel sure, will be with me on this because I think it was due in no small measure to his assistance that we succeeded in getting another Minister to amend a similar kind of provision in another Act where it was pointed out that neglect may be neglect of a sort to which no culpability at all attaches and neglect could mean, for example, the secretary of a company failing to open his post in the morning and only opening it in the afternoon.  And if through some innocent neglect of that sort an offence was facilitated, strictly speaking, under the terms of this subsection, an offence against the law would have been committed and it is not a defence to say in those circumstances: &ldquo;Well, I did not know that I was committing an offence.  I did not intend to commit any offence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister in the other Bill met that point of view when it was <Col N="1051" /> advanced here and he modified the provision which made the facilitating of an offence by means of neglect, by putting in &ldquo;wilful neglect&rdquo;.  I think the particular Bill was the Fuel Bill.  Even in connection with the question of an offence which is proved to have been committed with consent or approval of officers of a corporate body, I feel that it is still a bit wide as it stands in subsection (2) of section 10.  It may be proved that a secretary or other officer of a company consented to or approved of a particular course of action and that that particular course of action was an offence under this Bill, but if he did that innocently, if he did it without knowing that an offence was committed, I certainly would feel that it is a bit hard on him that the full penalties provided for in this Bill should then be visited on his head.  I feel that, even on the question of something being approved by an officer of the company, it should depend on his state of knowledge and I would suggest to the Minister that he might insert there something like this:</P>
    <P>Where an offence under this Act is committed by a body corporate and is proved to have been knowingly so committed ...</P>
    <P>I think that would still preserve the intention of the Minister under the section and would go a long way towards meeting the objection which I have made.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered, in general, the remarks I had in mind to make. I do not know whether Senator Brugha was correct in saying that this was the first time the present Minister has introduced a Bill in this House.  If it is, I should like to welcome him.  I should like to urge him to adopt the same approach, in dealing with Bills in the Seanad, as that adopted by some other Ministers we had here recently.  It is only fair to say that our experience in recent weeks has been that the Ministers who had occasion to introduce Bills here were prepared, not merely to listen to the views expressed, but in very large measure to meet, by <Col N="1052" /> way of amendment, various suggestions which were made on both sides of the House to improve the Bill.  I hope the approach of the present Minister will be the same.  If it is, we may succeed in improving this Bill before it goes to the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the general trend of the speeches on the Bill was one of welcoming the Bill.  Every Senator seemed to recognise that it was an essential Bill, that there was a need for it, and that it was justified. Then they went on to give it what might be described as Committee Stage treatment.  This is understandable because it is a short Bill and the overriding purpose of the Bill is fairly evident.  It does not call for any great deal of argument or debate one way or another.  The question of whether the Minister is taking too many powers, or is likely to infringe on the rights of individuals, has been raised by practically every speaker.</P>
      <P>One Senator asked me to spell out the abuses we sought to eradicate or correct and thereby explain to the House the real purpose of the Bill. Apart from the need for a Bill of this type to regulate employment agencies in the future, I have had in the past couple of years at least ten questions in the other House regarding employment agencies.  Some of them related to the abuses in recruitment of female staff for employment abroad and the purposes for which they were employed on getting there.  Others dealt with the excessive fees being charged.  Some dealt with the fly-by-night type of agency that collects fees in advance in the hope of providing employment and then ceases to be an agency.</P>
      <P>Apart from these questions in the other House, I had other complaints, personally, from some of our religious agencies in England regarding the sending over to England by agencies here of people who were not properly briefed on or properly prepared for what they might find at their destination. One does not need to emphasise these matters because it has already been agreed, by all speakers, that there is a need to acquire some control over existing employment agencies.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  I will not delay the House too long.  At the moment there are not many employment agencies, relatively speaking, in Ireland.  We have some 60 agencies in all and 90 per cent of these are in Dublin.  Only a percentage&mdash;about 35 per cent or less&mdash;are in the federation which was formed some time ago.  I have already met the federation, rather hurriedly, and I advised them that they should call to see me before the Committee Stage of this Bill.  They assured me that they welcomed the Bill.  They felt that something of this type had to be done.</P>
      <P>The question of what one should do in regulating employment agencies is not so easily solved, without taking certain powers which may seem to be a bit extreme.  One is dealing here with human beings, the human element. It is a rather sensitive area and it is only natural that one has to move rather warily.  At the same time, in order to regulate employment agencies, it is necessary to licence them.  To acquire power to licence agencies one must set required standards. To have the required standards one must have some powers of inspection in order to find out whether the standards are observed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to do these things the provision of the Bill may seem to be encroaching on the rights of the individual. I am perfectly aware of this and I will be discussing this later with the federation.  If I can I shall accept amendments which will set at ease the minds of people who may think that these powers will be abused&mdash;as the last speaker, Senator O'Higgins, said, other Ministers at other times might have different approaches&mdash; I can accept amendments without taking away the real purpose of the Bill and without inhibiting the proper operation of the overall principle of the Bill, I will certainly do so.  If I <Col N="1054" /> can have amendments which would still ensure that abuses would not occur in the future I would certainly be prepared to consider them.</P>
    <P>The debate was mainly a Committee Stage debate dealing specifically with some of the sections.  Before I deal with some of the points which Senators raised, I should like to say that we are approaching the time in this country when the need for training and preparation of manpower for the types of work for which they have aptitudes and are suited is being recognised by everybody.  The Department of Labour have laid the foundations of a training system and of a placement and career-guidance service, which is being operated by our manpower section.  In the future I hope that the placement service will be properly handled, not merely by those of my Department who will be entrusted with the task but by those agencies operating privately who will have a similar job to do.  I hope that they will do that job very well.  There may be many abuses prevalent among existing employment agencies, but I do know we have a number of excellent agencies operating here.  It is the better type of agency which welcomes control over employment agencies generally, thereby giving a better standing and prestige to those which will be permitted to operate.  They will have no complaint, I hope, about the way in which my Department will handle the provision of licences.  There are those agencies who when a potential employee approaches seeking employment, immediately charge a fee for taking particulars and registration. Agencies may also be set up for a specific purpose for a few months to recruit persons for a particular area, perhaps abroad.  In recent years many people who obtained employment abroad through agencies were very disappointed with the conditions under which they had to work and in many cases returned home.  These are the type of agencies which should be eradicated or made to work according to proper standards.  This is the aim of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition we must look to the future when the need for proper placement <Col N="1055" /> and the handling of persons in accordance with their skills will require more specialised treatment than has been given up to now.  We have no intention whatever of trespassing on the rights of individuals, or of interfering with what is a legitimate or properly conducted business.</P>
    <P>The first speaker, Senator Owens, referred to the possibility of a notice appearing in one newspaper only.  The Senator thought the purpose of the notice might be to give persons a chance to object.  This is so.  Another purpose is that the Department would know that an agency was being set up. We could then move in and see that the proper standards were provided. For this purpose one advertisement would be sufficient.</P>
    <P>The Senator also complained about the 21 days' notice.  This is a statutory period which is inserted in all Bills. Regarding the question of notification of exemptions, there is no necessity to have exemptions laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives power to the Minister to investigate every type of agency or person who recruits for employment. This is necessary in order to get at those types of agencies which would try to avoid the provisions of the Bill by having an agency as part only of their business or having an agency under some other guise.  It is necessary to be able to encompass everything that is likely to be used as an employment recruiting agency.  On the other hand nobody would hope to have the Incorporated Law Society registered and licensed as an employment agency.</P>
    <P>In some of the universities, there is student recruiting which could possibly be regarded as a recruiting agency. There is the <i>au pair</i> system, but this is not regarded as employment in our sense of the word, but there would be the power to deal with this, if necessary, if somebody sought to use it for the purpose of escaping the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We are not worried about the agencies with high standards.  However, those who want to run an illicit type of agency could find many ways of doing <Col N="1056" /> so if we had not wide power.  In my opening statement I said that, to allay the fears of those who might think we would control religious agencies, we would use exemption powers so far as they are concerned.  There are also charitable agencies who deal with emigrants and who do not charge fees or, if they do, it is merely to cover running costs.  These agencies could also be exempted.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins suggested that power could be left to the local authorities. Section 85 of the old Public Health Act gave some local authorities power to deal with recruitment of female domestic labour.  That is the 1907 Act.  There were many abuses in that field in those days and it was necessary to give power to local authorities to deal with the situation.  This section of the 1907 Act was not used very much, if at all.  It would be cumbersome to give this power to the local authorities because if there is any infringement on the private records of people, the fewer people likely to be involved the better.  Public bodies such as local authorities are better kept aloof from the inspection that could take place in this situation.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of inspection, the number of agencies will not require many inspectors.  This is obvious and Senator Brugha need not be worried that they will cost too much.  I should hope that the inspectors would be people of absolute integrity, who would be committed to treating everything in utmost confidence.  Like the Revenue Commissioners, they would not be prepared to divulge the private business of any individual or to look at their records except where specific complaints are made.  Statistical information would be the first requirement of an inspector from any agency.</P>
    <P>I feel that when our manpower service is operating there will be a good liaison between themselves and the private agencies.  I mean by a good agency an agency that will assemble the proper particulars of each applicant, and verify all the facts in relation to the qualifications of the person by the production of the necessary documents, check on all the information supplied and will, therefore, be able to <Col N="1057" /> place that person in employment suitable to his qualifications, which qualifications are established by the agency after proper perusal.  The agency that does that is doing a good service, doing extra work, and for that reason is entitled to charge higher fees than the agency that is not concerned with doing such a proper assessment.</P>
    <P>Some people were worried about a flat rate of fees.  I set that out in my opening speech because it was one of the things about which I was worried myself.  It would not be possible to have a flat rate of fees nor would I like to indulge in fixing of fees.  I do not like using the word &ldquo;fix&rdquo;.  The fees being charged are submitted as the proper fees to be charged in accordance with the service given by the particular type of agencies.  There are many types of agencies, some dealing with domestics, some with professionals and some dealing with particular categories of employment.  They all do different work and they may all have a different scale of fees.  The question of approving the fees, if not excessive or exorbitant, would be a simple enough matter.  I would not expect the Minister to engage in fixing a flat rate of fees at all.</P>
    <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald over-emphasised the question of trespass and of secrecy breaching, the confidentiality of persons seeking employment to the extent that it would interfere with the mobility of labour and of employment generally.  I would be prepared to accept any amendment that would allay that feeling or prevent it happening.  The confidence of individuals registering with private agencies would not be exposed to the general public or to any other section of the Department.  I would hope that nobody would trespass on the legitimate business of any licensed agency to the extent of finding out, for the information of the woman next door, who was seeking a job or was likely to leave employment in the Civil Service or somewhere else.  I should not like that charge to be made at the start of efforts to control employment.</P>
    <P>Senator Nash said it would be bad if particulars of persons who wish to change their jobs were published.  I do <Col N="1058" /> not think that we could regard as publication the necessity for an inspector to look at an individual file.  That should not arise except in the case of a specific complaint, and I do not anticipate many complaints being made by the persons who are using the agencies.</P>
    <P>Most Senators were concerned about different fees being applied.  I do not think there are any other points I need go into now; I shall have an opportunity of dealing with the Bill section by section at another time.  I do not think I have anything else to add at this Stage except to emphasise that we have reached a stage where we find it necessary to take some control of employment agencies.  Many people referred to what is happening in England. They are speaking about legislation there at the moment to enable them to ratify ILO Convention No. 96.  Apart from that, they have had a proliferation of employment agencies in recent times out of all proportion to what they had a few years ago.  It is obvious that it will be necessary for them to do something about it.</P>
    <P>No matter what legislation one brings in there will be loopholes.  It will not always be possible to eradicate completely the abuses that can occur in the sending of persons abroad to undesirable occupations, or to employment the nature of which they may not be properly aware of before they go. This legislation will give the reputable agencies a prestige and standing which will enable them to do a better job; and we shall make it unprofitable for others to compete with them if they do not reach the same standards.</P>
    <P>The federation made that quite clear when they had a brief talk with me a few weeks ago.  They were glad that standards were being set.  They mentioned a number of matters on which Members will have already been briefed.  One such matter with which many were concerned is insisting that employers publish their name in the advertisements when seeking workers. They find objections to that.  They say that many firms would not wish it to be known that they are looking for particular staff.  They prefer it to be kept secret.  That is why they use <Col N="1059" /> agencies.  They will not be in favour of the rates of fees being displayed because in many cases it is the employer who pays the fee.  They do not always like the job-seeker to see the potential bosses' fees because they might judge what they are worth from seeing what he is prepared to pay. There are a number of reasons why they are opposed to the display of fee charges.  We should be able to overcome this at Committee Stage but it is necessary to have some system of control whereby there will not be agencies taking a look at the person who comes in, wondering how much he will be worth in order to have him registered for employment, and charging in accordance with what the client is likely to pay.  That is the idea behind the proposal to have fees displayed.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered everything sufficiently.  I am very grateful for having had the time extended in order to permit me to finish tonight.  I am very pleased with the approach which <Col N="1060" /> Senators have to the Bill, all having recognised the necessity for it, but many expressing fears that it might go too far or give too many powers to the Minister.  When we have finished the Committee Stage we shall have allayed all those feelings and I hope that, if other Ministers come here, you will find them equally amenable to your suggestions.  A Fianna Fáil Minister is always prepared to accept a good suggestion.</P>
