      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 11, after &ldquo;hereby amended,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(a)&rdquo; and to add after &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; in lines 13 and 14 the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) by the addition, after the definition of &lsquo;prohibited weapon&rsquo;, of the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;the expression &ldquo;prohibited substance&rdquo; means and includes any substance capable of exploding whether or not it may be detonated by the addition or admixture of some other substance and capable on explosion of being dangerous to life or <Col N="594" /> property except such substance as may, by regulation made by the Minister (which he is hereby authorised to make), be specifically excluded from this category as having in his opinion a common and legitimate use such that the application to it of section 17A (1) of this Act would be unreasonable.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the staff of this House, and the printers who are employed by them, on their baffling efficiency in getting the amendments, which I gave them only late yesterday evening, checked, typed, set in type, printed, posted and delivered to the houses of Members living in Dublin at eight o'clock this morning. I would not have thought it possible, and I think they deserve the compliments of the House for that performance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I admitted that the amendment which is now replaced by amendment No. 1 was too broad.  I tried to cure this defect by extending the amendment which I spoke about yesterday by providing the Minister with power to exclude from the category of prohibited substance whatever he likes.  I admit that this is, in a sense, taking the easy way out, because I have not got access to a complete list of dangerous substances, but I take it that the Minister has and that it would be easy for him, guided by expert advisers, to provide a list of substances which are potentially dangerous but have a normal or usually innocuous or legitimate use such as to render their inclusion in this category unreasonable. I am not in favour, on the whole, of delegating ministerial powers more than is necessary, because as much as possible should be done on the floor of the Parliament.  However, in a case like this, particularly when an amendment from this side of the House is concerned, I am suggesting something which is not unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the House will look at what I now propose the House will see that the amendment section of the Principal Act is proposed to be extended by an <Col N="595" /> additional clause defining a prohibited substance as something</P>
    <P>capable of exploding whether or not it may be detonated by the addition or admixture of some other substance and capable on explosion of being dangerous to life or property except such substance as may, by regulation made by the Minister (which he is hereby authorised to make), be specifically excluded from this category as having in his opinion a common and legitimate use such that the application to it of section 17A (1) of this Act would be unreasonable.</P>
    <P>The only bearing which this amendment has is on the amendment for which it is preparatory, namely, amendment No. 2 in which my suggestion, which I pressed here yesterday with as much force as I could, is that the State ought to impose some penal measure on persons who procure, incite or organise in some way the importation of lethal weapons, including explosives and prohibited substances, into the North of Ireland by whatever route they can devise.  I had great difficulty here yesterday in getting across to the Minister what I had in mind.  The Minister does not have the name of being unintelligent and I cannot believe that he did not understand the point I was making.  He repeatedly came back to the law about exporting arms from this jurisdiction into the North.  I am not talking about that matter.  He then spoke about another matter, namely, the futility, as he described it, of attempting to control offences which would be committed outside our jurisdiction.  I was not talking about that matter either.</P>
    <P>What I wish to be done is to make it an offence for someone within our jurisdiction to conspire, within our jurisdiction or while inside our jurisdiction, or incite or procure the importation of lethal weapons into the North of Ireland.  I shall deal in a moment with what I have discovered to be the legal aspect of this matter.  Before I do so I want to say something on the Minister's point that it would be futil to make such a provision.  The statute law of this country is full of futilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> There are statute acres, or Irish acres, of law which are futile and therefore are dead letters.  They are never used. When, for instance, was a prosecution last instituted in respect of the exportation of documents or pictures contrary to the 1945 Act?  I do not think there ever was such a prosecution.  I could spend a day naming statutes, and sections of statutes, which have been dead letters and futile.</P>
    <P>If we want an instant example of futility, let us look at this Bill now before us.  It provides a variation in penalties which, so far as the variation is downwards, is utterly needless and represents, in no respect, a public demand or even a sectional demand.  In so far as the variation is upwards it is not going to deter the kind of people we have in mind.  It is already within the jurisdiction of a district justice to impose a nominal sentence or to apply the Probation Act for an offence charged under the 1925 Act.  Justices regularly do so, as the Minister very well knows, having been in practice as a solicitor himself.  In the vast majority of criminal offences tried in the district courts the maximum penalty is not imposed.  There are cases of mandatory penalties, but in the vast majority of cases in which a justice has a discretion to vary, up and down a scale, he does not impose the maximum sentence and he has jurisdiction to impose a minimal sentence.</P>
    <P>It is a waste of the time of this House, and of the time of the civil servants who have to prepare these documents, to come in here asking us to split firearms into categories for the purpose of reducing penalties in one particular category.  I cannot see the point in that and there is no public demand for it.  The Minister did not even pretend there was a public demand for it.  There is not even a sectional demand for it and it is utterly futile.</P>
    <P>Now go to the other end of the scale, where we have the increase in penalties in the case of the more dangerous or military-type firearms.  Does the Minister seriously think that the kind of people in this country&mdash;and they exist unfortunately&mdash;who possess unlawful firearms and intend to use <Col N="597" /> them unlawfully will be stopped by this bit of paper?  Does he seriously think that the kind of prosecution which can be brought on foot of it, or the threat of such a prosecution, will stop them?  If so, he is an optimist.</P>
    <P>As I said on the Second Stage, this section 3, together with section 5 which deals with firearms dealers, is just so much camouflage intended to distract attention from the guts of the Bill which is in section 4.  The purpose of that section is something with which I agree.  My criticism all along has been that it is not enough to put section 4 into the reformation of our firearms code at a time of national danger such as exists at present.  It simply does not go far enough.  The Minister has described my amendment as a futile one, but, if passed, it is far more likely to be an offence which will be regularly committed than many of the things which are in our statute law already.  I think this is unworthy of this Minister or of any Minister.</P>
    <P>I cannot refrain from expressing the view that the Minister's attitude towards my amendment is governed by pique of some kind, whether that pique be his own or that of somebody advising him.  I cannot see why my amendment should not get a rational discassion and why I should not get straight answers to the straight questions which I posed here yesterday. The Minister still has not given me any straight answers.  He pretended to misunderstand the purpose of this amendment. For example, yesterday he said that we could not take it upon ourselves to control matters which happen outside our jurisdiction.  In putting it like that I am stating his case even more strongly than he stated it himself.</P>
    <P>Certainly, we cannot control things that happen outside our jurisdiction absolutely, but we can go some distance towards controlling them.  What I am suggesting, and what this side of the House would like to see, is an extension of this Bill so as to make it unlawful for someone in our jurisdiction to procure or organise the importation of deadly weapons or substances into the North of Ireland.  What is futile about that?  The offence which I pose is that of conspiracy, incitement <Col N="598" /> or procurement of weapons for importation to the North of Ireland.  I am not seeking that Irish courts should be asked to try the offence of actually landing these weapons in the North of Ireland.  We are talking about the offence of organising or procuring such a landing committed by somebody within the jurisdiction of this State.</P>
    <P>I know I will not have an opportunity of repeating this, because this is not a Committee Stage, but I hope I have said enough on the matter to make it clear to the Minister, beyond any possibility of sheltering behind a pretence of not understanding it, that what I am getting at is a conspiracy or an attempt to bring arms into the North of Ireland by any route be it by balloon, a helicopter, a fishing smack or a trawler.  Even though the arms do not go through this jurisdiction, the offence would be constituted by activity within this jurisdiction.  That activity could include the making of telephone calls, the holding of conversations or the writing of letters.  The Minister knows perfectly well that there was a trial in this city a few months ago of a similar kind in which conspiracy was the main count, the only count I think, in the indictment. The alleged offence, if it had been established, would have consisted of just such matters.</P>
    <P>As I said yesterday, I am not trying to trip the Minister up as lawyer to lawyer.  I did not expect him, off the cuff, to answer the legal problems arising here.  I did not ask him to do so. I mentioned this matter eight days ago. If this House is not going to be taken seriously, to the extent that serious speeches which are made on the Second Stage are looked into in the expectation that they will provide material for amendment at later Stages, then I think we are wasting our time having a Second Stage to Bills at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned phrases such as public international law and private international law.  I have not seen the written report of his speech and I could not be positive about the phrases he used until I see them in black and white, but the impression I got from them was that he felt there might be some rule which would make it wrong or impossible for a State to <Col N="599" /> legislate in regard to a conspiracy or an incitement to commit an act which would take place outside its own borders.  Yesterday I gave the Minister my opinion off the cuff, without claiming that it was necessarily right, that if somebody in this State conspired to murder somebody outside this State that it would be an offence triable here. I have since established that I was speaking the truth.  It is an offence in this State to conspire in the murder of somebody outside the State.  It is an offence by statute and it has been part of our law for the past 110 years.  The Minister will find it in section 4 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, the larger proportion of which is still in force in this State.  Some sections of it have been repealed, but section 4, according to the index of legislation prepared by the Statute Law Reform and Consolidation Office, which is under the Minister's charge, is apparently still part of the law, unless it has been changed in the last three years.  I am willing to be interrupted and contradicted at once if I am wrong about this, but if I am right about this the law certainly was, until 1968, and so far as I know, still is, as follows.  I hope the &ldquo;republicans&rdquo; on the far side of the House will not laugh at the references to &ldquo;her Majesty&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>All persons who shall conspire, confederate, and agree to murder any Person, whether he be a Subject of Her Majesty or not, and whether he be within the Queen's Dominions or not, and whosoever shall solicit, encourage, persuade, or endeavour to persuade, or shall propose to any Person to murder any other Person, whether he be a subject of Her Majesty or not, and whether he be within the Queen's Dominions or not shall be guilty of a Misdemeanour, and being convicted thereof shall be liable, at the Discretion of the Court, to be kept in Penal Servitude for any Term not more than Ten and not less than Three years&mdash; or to be imprisoned for any Term not exceeding Two years, with or without Hard Labour.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for the reference to the Queen.  If the Soldiers of Destiny had not liked this they could have repealed <Col N="600" /> or amended this section specifically.  I hope I will not get any facetious references to the Queen hereafter.</P>
    <P>That has been part of our law for 110 years.  In other words, if I conspire with the Minister or with anybody else to murder somebody in the North Island of New Zealand, which the Minister mentioned here last night, that is a very serious offence under the law of this State, or so I understand it unless the law has been changed in the last three years, and unless section 4 of this Act no longer applies.  Certainly, as late as 1968 it would have been a very serious offence for me so to conspire to murder, although the murder, if it came off, would have taken place in the North Island of New Zealand.</P>
    <P>That is a statutory instance and as far as I have been able to discover overnight&mdash;and my library in this regard is not big&mdash;there is doubt as to whether in the ordinary common law, apart from a statutory offence, it is possible to try a conspiracy.  As far as I can gather there is doubt as to whether it is indictable in this jurisdiction or in Britain to conspire to commit crimes the effects of which would be felt in some other jurisdiction. But there is certainly no doubt about this&mdash;that there is a legislative precedent still on our Statute Book after 110 years which does make it a very serious offence indeed to conspire to commit an offence which will take effect outside our borders.</P>
    <P>Therefore, that part of the Minister's argument&mdash;and I myself do not see that it has any real relevance because this is a sovereign Assembly as the Minister reminded us the other day&mdash; falls to the ground.  We have a clear precedent here of a case in which conspiracy or even advocating the commission of murder outside the jurisdiction of the State is a serious offence.</P>
    <P>I have here a reference to a case which would illustrate the workings of this Act.  It is a case reported in 1881 in which the defendant was a man by the name of Most.  He was indicted under section 4 of the Offences Against the Persons Act, 1861.  The encouragement and endeavour to persuade to murder proved at the trial was the <Col N="601" /> publication and circulation by him of an article, written in German in a newspaper published in that language in London, exulting in the recent murder of the Emperor of Russia, and commending it as an example for revolutionists throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The jury were directed that if they thought that by the publication of the article Most did intend to and did encourage or endeavour to persuade any person to murder any other person whether a subject of Her Majesty or not, and whether within the Queen's dominions or not, and that such encouragement and endeavouring to persuade were the natural and reasonable effect of the article, they should find him guilty.  It was held that such direction was correct.</P>
    <P>I am not interested in the Emperor of Russia; I am interested in the people in the North of Ireland, and that is the kind of law we should have in their regard.  For the Minister to speak about them as though there was the slightest resemblance to our situation <i>visá-vis</i> them and our situation <i>vis-á-vis</i> the North and the South Islands of New Zealand shows what a sham, what a bogus set-up has existed in this Government all along in regard to the North of Ireland.  They take an interest in it only when they have to.  When they do, I admit, it is sincere enough because they are human beings like the rest of us and do not like to see people being killed or hurt.  I accept that unreservedly. But they have no real interest in it.  I charge them in this Bill, which goes almost no distance to forestall violence in the North, with showing that sham to the world.  I do not want to be part of that.</P>
    <P>When I go abroad, to England or elsewhere, I have to defend this rotten Govvernment. I have to stand up for them and I have to say that we are doing our best&mdash;and by &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean all the parties in both Houses and the whole Irish people and their political representatives&mdash;to keep peace in the North. That is what I have got to say.  How can I say it with an easy conscience when I find that in a Bill like this pique&mdash;that is all it is&mdash;on the part of the Minister or his Department allows him to describe a seriously intended <Col N="602" /> amendment as, first of all, a piece of party political rhetoric and, secondly, as a piece of lawyer's codology?  How dare he speak like that about a serious amendment?</P>

      <P>I have put down an amendment, as I am entitled to do in this House, and I expect it to be dealt with seriously.  Of course I am annoyed when the Minister does not deal with it seriously.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Minister to take that article seriously and I want him to apologise for talking about the North and South Islands of New Zealand.  We have it in our power to make at least a gesture towards reducing the possibility of violence in Northern Ireland, a gesture which would be less futile than some of the things which are already in this Bill.  I cannot see why <Col N="603" /> we cannot get a serious answer, a straight answer, on law or on the facts from the Minister in regard to the points which I have advanced in connection with these two amendments.</P>
    <P>This House is entitled to a sober statement from the Minister of why he feels that we have no power or no right or that it would be in some way in conflict with some immutable principle of international justice&mdash;which it is not &mdash;to prohibit the organising within our territory of the bringing of arms into the North by any route or means whatsoever. Anything the Minister said here yesterday, and he said a lot, does not come within a million miles of persuading me that he is willing to face up to this point.

      <P>I have listened to Senator Kelly and I accept that he is sincere in putting down this amendment. He has a tremendous knowledge of the law, but all too often, with due respect to everybody in the legal profession, you could get carried away up to the point where professionals are catering for the professionals.  This is not the spirit of any legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill is an improvement on the law.  It achieves its purpose and tidies up the law.  You could go a long way with a lot of the arguments put forward, but you have to ask yourself when will you stop in regard to explosive substances.  You could finish up by making it an offence for a man to carry a can of petrol to his car if it broke down.  That is an explosive substance.  A man could not go out on his farm with a bottle of weedkiller. There is no end to the trend of imagination here.  There must be a balanced approach to this matter as in every other matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a glance anyone can see that the measures proposed here are sound and straightforward and easily understood by the people to whom this measure <Col N="604" /> would apply, and this is the point.  You can speculate as much as you like, but I believe that the purpose of bringing in the Bill is to make it crystal clear to the public in general, and especially to those who may be involved in committing an offence where they stand.  The question has been asked: what does the Minister mean by giving an amnesty for 14 days? To me it is quite simple and quite easily understood.  It means that anyone who has arms or illegal weapons in his possession and gives them up within a period of 14 days will not be prosecuted.  But that same intention does not mean that a man can throw a machine gun in the back seat of his car, drive from Cork to Donegal and say: &ldquo;I intend to give those up.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister has made this crystal clear for those who want to understand it.  I would rather hope that everyone who looks at this Bill and reads it will understand for whom the Bill is intended and what its aim is.  I am satisfied that you could accept this amendment and indeed you could accept many more amendments, with &ldquo;ands&rdquo;, &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; and &ldquo;buts&rdquo;.  It is really an entanglement right through, and I say in all sincerity to Senator Kelly, whom I respect as being serious: &ldquo;Forget about these umbrella provisions and aim at the section of the people whom it is necessary to cover.&rdquo;  That is my non-professional attitude, but I think it represents a fairly wide section of opinion and that that is the view held by those who will be affected by the amendment and the changes proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I supported this amendment put forward by Senator Kelly yesterday because I thought it would be desirable in the circumstances to avoid the offence of a conspiracy or a soliciting here to have arms sent from another country to Northern Ireland.  This is necessary to close the loophole which Senator Kelly has persuasively argued exists in this Firearms Bill.  For that reason I, too, spent some time last night looking into the legal aspects of it and I would agree with Senator Kelly that it is an offence <Col N="605" /> to conspire to commit murder abroad. It is an offence to conspire or to solicit or to procure bigamy.  These are extra-territorial crimes.  I think the Minister would accept that we can borrow our thinking in the criminal law from the principles set out in Archbold which relate to the English law, because our principles are similar.  In the latest edition of Archbold it is clearly set out that a conspiracy to commit a crime abroad is not indictable in England unless the contemplated crime is one for which an indictment would lie in England.</P>
      <P>One problem here is that the movement of arms from a foreign country to Northern Ireland would not be indictable here.  Substantially I think that is what the Minister was saying yesterday, but it is also clear from a House of Lords case in England, the Board of Trade against Owen in 1957.  May I just briefly summarise the facts of that case?  It is analogous to the position for which we are trying to cater.  The conspiracy charged in that case was a conspiracy to defraud authority established by the Government of Western Germany to control the export of metals by causing that department to grant licences for export of metals by fraudulent misrepresentation that the metals would be supplied to and consumed by Irish manufacturers, well knowing that such metals were in fact to be exported to eastern European countries.  The evidence showed that the representations were designed to be made in Germany and the licences obtained there.  It was held by the House of Lords, affirming the Court of Criminal Appeal, that though such conspiracy was to be regarded as a conspiracy to obtain a lawful object by unlawful means rather than a conspiracy to commit a crime no indictment for such conspiracy would lie in England since the unlawful means and the unlawful object were both outside the jurisdiction.  But this case did reserve and reopen the position whether a conspiracy in England intended wholly to be carried out abroad may not be indictable in England on proof that its performance would produce a public mischief in England or injure a person in England by causing him damage abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" /> It is in this area that it would be very easy to argue that the importation of arms from abroad to Northern Ireland, on a conspiracy or solicited from here, would definitely cause a public mischief in aggravating the tension in the country, in providing a potential source of trouble, in creating friction in the two communities.  We would not be in conflict with private international law or public international law in asserting jurisdiction in these circumstances to declare that if there was a conspiracy in this jurisdiction or if there was solicitation or incitement to a person from abroad to import arms into Northern Ireland, that affects the community here.  It affects the stability of the community, it affects public order here and we would be perfectly entitled to assert this jurisdiction in respect of the offence committed abroad.  I give this opinion with certain deference because, like the Minister, I do not consider myself to be a legal expert in this.  However, it is an important point and if it is open to us to assert the jurisdiction, if it is possible to have the offence of a conspiracy here as set out in the amendment, then it is very well worth doing because it would prove our desire to prevent arms being imported into Northern Ireland since the original impetus came from the South.</P>

      <P>I am glad a number of speakers intervened between Senator Kelly and myself because it mellowed me.  Almost from the time he started, I was trying to think of what I could say politely in reply.  Basically I have nothing more or less to say on these amendments than I had to say last night on the corresponding amendments <Col N="607" /> on the Committee Stage.  What I believed then and what I said then, I still believe and must repeat.  There have been some minor amendments made in the Committee Stage amendments by Senator Kelly inasmuch as in the first of the amendments he now sets out that the Minister by order can exclude certain substances and mixtures from what he defines in his amendment as prohibited substances.  I gave the example last night, and Senator Kelly agreed with it, that an offence would be committed, for example, by a man driving his motor car from Dundalk to Newry because he would have petrol in the tank of his car.  I would have to exclude in the order that Senator Kelly would seek to have me make, petrol in tanks of motor cars.  It is only when you consider that sort of situation that you discover what else would have to be done.  If a housewife in Newry decided that she would do her weekend shopping in Dundalk and, in the course of her shopping, buys a quantity of sugar and drives back to Newry by bus or car, she would be committing an offence because sugar is a substance which would come within the definition of prohibited substance as set out in Senator Kelly's amendment.  Sugar is a substance to which something can be added which could cause an explosion.</P>
      <P>These are two of the more obvious examples which come to mind and if I or any of my officials were to sit down and make a comprehensive list of all the different things that I would have to exclude by order from Senator Kelly's definition of prohibited substance, it would run into pages and pages, if not to volumes.  An enormous number of household substances in common household use every day would probably have to be covered by it.</P>
      <P>A type of blanket provision such as this with something added on to it at the last minute, saying &ldquo;This is very wide all right, but the Minister for Justice can take whatever he likes out of it&rdquo;&mdash;that is not the sort of drafting that one should expect in a Bill or an amendment that should be passed by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may go on to the second point <Col N="608" /> the Senator was making, the disputed point about crimes committed outside the jurisdiction, etc.  The most effective answer that could be given to Senator Kelly on that was Senator Robinson's statement.  While she does not disagree with Senator Kelly, at least she acknowledges freely that there is very considerable doubt as to whether or not any such provision is open to us at all.  There must be doubt apart from the doubts that exist under public and private international law.  There must be constitutional doubt on this point.</P>
    <P>Professor Kelly cited at great length statements on murder cases and, in particular, a murder case in England some time in the last century.  He is unquestionably correct, but what Senator Kelly unfortunately did not go on to say is that it is well recognised in almost every jurisdiction that murder is an extra-territorial crime.  It is in a completely different category to most other types of crime.  It is a pity that Senator Kelly would not make this clear because the provisions relating to murder are different to the provisions that relate to other crimes and have always been so and so far as I know, are so, in every common law jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to murder is that because we recognise it as an extra-territorial crime, if a murder is committed any place in the world and the perpetrator of the murder happens to find himself within our jurisdiction, it is open to us to charge him and it is open to our courts to try him.  We normally would not do this because we would not be able to adduce sufficient proof.  Witnesses would have to be brought from possibly some remote part of the world and this might not be possible.  The prosecution would not take on themselves a futile exercise of that kind.  If the country where the crime took place issued a warrant for the murderer's arrest, we could extradite him to that country to be tried.</P>
    <P>This amendment is put down and is pushed very strongly by one Senator who happens to be a Professor of Law, which is by the way, and it is pointed out very rightly by another Senator, who also happens to be a Professor of Law, which is by the way, that there <Col N="609" /> is at least considerable doubt as to whether the thing is feasible at all. Senator Kelly, in all fairness, leaving aside this feeling against me he seems to have, should recognise that any Minister with any sense of responsibility cannot accept a sweeping amendment such as this, where there is the gravest doubt as to whether it is legally acceptable, apart from any other implications or complications.</P>

      <P>I sat without interrupting for 20 minutes and listened to a most extraordinary kind of low pettiness from Senator Kelly this morning. There is a great deal more I might well be provoked into saying but I choose not to say it, notwithstanding the provocation.  I have said enough to show that by any standards these amendments are unacceptable.  They are futile.  My saying this will probably cause Senator Kelly to go into orbit once more, but the fact is they are futile.  Any amendment that seeks to require me to make an order to say that a woman can buy a pound of sugar in Dundalk and bring it over to <Col N="610" /> Newry, and that if I do not make the order she will commit a serious criminal offence for which she can get a couple of years in jail is the height of nonsense.  For Senator Kelly to go on in the sanctimonious, sneering way that he does about this sort of silly amendment and make a major issue out of it, I think tends only to bring the House into disrepute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who is extremely unlikely ever to plead before the Supreme Court, I still find it incumbent on myself to do my duty here as a legislator.  Senator McGowan suggested that in this debate we were concerned with &ldquo;professionals catering for professionals&rdquo;.  Let us come back to reality.  We are Irishmen and Irishwomen legislating on matters that affect Irishmen and Irishwomen, North and South of the unfortunate border.</P>
      <P>I have listened to the discussion this morning, as I listened to what was said last night.  Apart from the question of the inclusion of explosive substances, with which I am not concerned, but paying attention to this question of an act of conspiracy, incitement or procurement within our jurisdiction, it appears to me that the Minister had one answer only to give to the argument put forward, and that was to say that Senator Kelly had been answered by Senator Robinson.  I was disturbed when I heard the Minister say this so confidently.  I was disturbed because I felt that I must have completely misunderstood what Senator Robinson said.  I was somewhat relieved to find her protesting that she, herself, believed that it was open to the Minister to make this sort of thing an offence in our law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may well be that there is some doubt on this question.  It may well be that the Minister would be able to tackle this problem better if he had more time.  However, it was not this side of the House that wanted the Report Stage taken last night and, if not last night, first thing this morning. We have here a serious issue.  It is said of us by many people in the North, in the course of propaganda, that the attitude of many of us in the South, in the Legislature, towards Northern <Col N="611" /> Ireland and to certain sections of the people there is best described by the quotation that &ldquo;we are willing to wound, yet afraid to strike&rdquo;.  This accusation is laid against us.  If we do not take seriously the proposition that is being put before us today, we are tending to lend support, and we are certainly leaving ourselves open, to that charge being laid against us again.  It is an extremely serious matter that anybody within our jurisdiction here should be concerned with any attempt to bring arms into the northern part of this country.</P>
    <P>The organisation of the transport of any arms to Northern Ireland would do great damage to the fabric not only of our State but of our whole nation, and that damage would be independent of the route by which those guns travel.  We must realise that what this Bill is trying to do is to make sure that nobody within this jurisdiction is guilty of any act of any type whatsoever which will cause damage of that sort.  To my mind this is the net point which is being brought forward here, and it has not been met by the Minister. If the Minister looked at this issue, with more time and away from the atmosphere of this House, he would realise that this part of the amendment which is concerned with making it an offence to do any act which ultimately results in the importation of firearms into Northern Ireland is in line with what he set out to do when he brought in the whole of this amending Bill.  It is extremely unfortunate, when the matter has been brought forward, that the Minister has set his face against it so totally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>When I started to make my contribution on these <Col N="612" /> amendments that are being debated together, I indicated that I did not intend to concern myself with the question of explosive substances.  However, I was concerned about the point of the commission of acts within the State and I went on to make the case on the basis that I was going to talk on the question of firearms, and on that question alone, so as to exclude this other point which is also a matter of contention.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2, as I read it here, seeks to make it an offence for anybody to do certain things which result in the sending into Northern Ireland of any firearm, ammunition, or prohibited weapon.  That is what I am concerned with here this morning. The proposal that we should prohibit acts which result in any of these things being sent to Northern Ireland is something that we must take extremely seriously.  Whether we add other prohibited substances is a second question. It is unfortunate that because of the way in which these amendments are brought we have two net points here in amendment No. 2.  I suggest that we leave aside this question of prohibited substances.  In saying that I am not saying that I agree with the Minister and that I disagree with Senator Kelly.  All I am endeavouring to do is to focus attention on the remaining point: that it is equally harmful to the citizens of this country.  By whatever route arms, ammunition or other dangerous substances travel into Northern Ireland, the political, physical, social, and psychological damage will be equally real.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not said anything here this morning which would remove my particular concern on this point. I am not concerned with this, as a professional lawyer but listening to the debate, I feel that a case has been made and the case has not been answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that I speak first of all as a pacifist.  I believe that only our Creator can give human life and therefore a man who takes the life of another is, to a great extent, taking the power of the Creator.  It is only in the most extreme circumstances that human life <Col N="613" /> can either be taken or maimed.  That is my personal, firm conviction.</P>
      <P>History has proved down through the ages that force of arms has always created more problems than it has solved, whether in European wars, world wars or otherwise.  Having said that may I say that it seems to me, listening to this debate, that to a great extent we have been arguing in a vacuum?  The first amendment of Professor Kelly is undoubtedly proposed with the <i>bona fide</i> intention that explosive substances of any kind or substances that can cause damage should be included in the prohibition. I sympathise with the difficulty and the problem he has had in trying to frame the definition, because so many simple substances when added to one other item can be made into a very dangerous explosive substance.  For example, most detergents, sugar, petrol, zinc powder and hundreds of others when added to one other item can make a most dangerous explosive substance.</P>
      <P>The whole matter is covered much better in the definition of the Principal Act than in this amendment.  I shall read the definition of the Firearms Act, 1925, which is incorporated in this Bill:</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;ammunition&rdquo; (except where used in relation to a prohibited weapon) means ammunition for a firearm but also includes grenades, bombs, and other similar missiles whether the same are or are not capable of being used with a firearm, and also includes any ingredient or component part of any such ammunition or missile;</P>
      <P>This seems to me to cover a whole range and makes it clearcut.  It removes the possibility of government by ministerial order and it enables the citizens of the State to know exactly where they stand.  It includes any missile capable of exploding whether the same are or are not capable of being used with a firearm, and it includes every ingredient or component part of any such ammunition or missile. That is something that is clearcut, something that is not vague.  Above all criminal law must not be vague, it must be clearcut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the second amendment of Professor Kelly I shall again quote <Col N="614" /> from the Principal Act the portions that are not amended by this amending Bill now before us:</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is section 16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>It says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  It shall not be lawful for any person to consign&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  for export from Saorstát Éireann, or</P>
      <P>(b)  for removal from one place in Saorstát Eireann to another such place,</P>
      <P>any firearm or ammunition&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Ammunition is included in the definition I have given.  I also submit it includes everything Professor Kelly has set out in his amendments.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;unless such export or removal is authorised in writing by the superintendent of the Garda Síochána of the district from which such firearm or ammunition is consigned for export or removal.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every person who consigns for export or removal as aforesaid any firearm or ammunition contrary to the provisions of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this Act and shall be punishble accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The penalties under the Act include an indictable offence.  A conspiracy to commit a crime of that nature is in itself a crime.  There is no necessity to pass special legislation for that purpose. Punishments are provided for in section 25 of the Principal Act, which states:</P>
      <P>Any person who commits an offence under this Act in respect of which no other punishment is provided by this Act shall be liable in respect of each such offence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment with or without hard labour for a term not exceeding six months, or to both such fine and such imprisonment; or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  on conviction thereof on indictment, to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment with or without hard labour for a term not exceeding <Col N="615" /> two years or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>A conspiracy to commit that offence is, in itself, a crime.  Section 4 of this Bill states:</P>
    <P>For the removal of doubt it is hereby declared that in section 15 of the Principal Act references to life and property include references to life and property outside the area of application of the laws enacted by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Once that is included as a crime a conspiracy therefore to export arms, whether it is to the North of Ireland, France, Germany, England, or Scotland, for the purpose of endangering life or damaging property is in itself a crime.  Perhaps somebody would enlighten me because I cannot see the necessity of introducing special amendments. I have the very highest regard for Professor Kelly as a professor in his own chosen subject but I find it absolutely impossible to understand the underlying purpose of the amendment if it is something to prevent and to strengthen the powers of the authority in prohibiting or preventing the export of arms to Northern Ireland or to anywhere else for that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Nash at least paid me the compliment, which the Minister did not do, of trying to meet my points in a rational way, even though I think his arguments are wrong.  We covered most of the ground dealt with by Senator Nash on the Second Stage and on the Committee Stage.  Very briefly, the answer to what he said in regard to ammunition is this. The definition of ammunition, as I have already said on the Second Stage, only includes components of a missile or things which can be put into a missile. If we are removing doubt, as we are in section 4, this would be something to remove doubt about.  What I am doubtful about is whether six sticks of gelignite with a detonator attached to them put in a suitcase and left in an entrance hall of a house is a missile. My own feeling is that it is not, but I know that it is arguable.</P>

      <P>Or other similar missile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, or other similar missile.  The genus which obviously it is intended that bomb should be part of is a missile.  It is arguable&mdash;and, since we are removing doubt, doubt should be removed here too&mdash;that a substance which is placed in such a way as to cause personal injury or damage and which is not a missile of any kind at all may be outside the definition of ammunition.  If Senator Nash were right about this, then I would freely admit that my first amendment would be superfluous, but I do not think he is right about it.  The word missile implies that anything which does not achieve its lethal effects through being discharged through the air is not covered by the definition of ammunition.  The Minister&mdash;he did not meet any of my points rationally &mdash;did not make that point, nor was he advised to make it, although it would have been an obvious point to make if his advisers had thought it an adequate answer.</P>
      <P>We also covered, on a former occasion, some ground mentioned by Senator Nash in connection with section 16.  I repeat now, for the seventh or eighth time, that the point of this amendment is not to catch merely the question of exporting guns over the land border here to the North of Ireland. I accept that that is already caught by section 16.  Anyone reading the section for the House, as Senator Nash has done, would see that immediately. What I am trying to catch, in spite of the Minister's idea that it would be futile, is the organising by people, within the boundaries of our jurisdiction, of the importation into the North of Ireland of deadly weapons or substances by any route, whether it be over our land frontier or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not an expert on how easy it is to import guns into the North of Ireland otherwise than by our land frontier, but I know there is a substantial amount of guns in Northern Ireland and they did not all come over the land frontier.  I am perfectly certain that some of them arrived in the North <Col N="617" /> of Ireland with the connivance of people within this jurisdiction.  I went out of my way yesterday to say that I do not mean this is done just on one side.  It may very well be that there are people in this jurisdiction using this jurisdiction as a refuge for organising the supply of arms to people on the other side of the Border, on either &ldquo;side&rdquo; of the political confrontation in the North.</P>
    <P>The reason for this amendment is to extend the effects of section 16 so as to penalise the procuring or bringing of deadly weapons into the North of Ireland if that procuring is organised by somebody inside our jurisdiction.  I will not have an opportunity of making that point again.  I realise that Senator Nash is making an honest and polite attempt to deal with my amendments, and I hope that I have shown him that his replies, on both these points, do not cover the loopholes which I am trying to cover.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan's intervention was also polite, except for his reference to the tendency of lawyers to argue about things which, he felt, were less than real problems.  I have to observe, month in and month out, this persistent attempt, on the part of the party to which Senator McGowan belongs, to blacken the legal profession.  It does not stop them from recruiting into their own ranks as many of the legal profession as they possibly can by giving them State work and State jobs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It seems to me that the only kind of intervention from this side of the House which is tolerated on the other side is one of harmless congratulation of Ministers for bringing in Bills.  We are not here to do that sort of thing. <Col N="619" /> Whether the Minister believes me or not, there are other things I would rather be doing than working my way through this Bill in an attempt to get decent legislation for this country and, ultimately, in an attempt to replace the present Government.  That is by no means the first love of my life.  I am doing it out of a sense of public duty and I make the allowance that other Members of this House are doing it for that reason as well.</P>
      <P>I dislike being told, when I make a forcible criticism of a Bill and when that criticism is not answered, that I am acting out of animus towards the Minister.  I think the Minister is in some respects not a good Minister.  I hope he does not mind my saying that and I hope he can take that kind of remark without undue offence.  If I were in his boots, I can imagine what would be said to me if I brought in a Bill like this.  I can imagine what Senator Ó Maoláin's view would be if he were sitting on this side of the House, or, if I were in the Dáil as a Minister, what Deputy O'Malley would say about it.</P>
      <P>I do not see why, just because my feelings on this matter are strong and I do not hide them, I should be described in the way I have been described from the far side of the House.  It sickens me to realise that there is only one posture tolerable to the Fianna Fáil Government, and that is one of congratulation and handing bouquets to one another.  I am not here for that purpose and I am not going to play along with that kind of thing at all.  There are Senators here, most of them on the far side of the House, who regularly congratulate Ministers no matter what they are doing. Whether the Bill is good or bad they are thanking them and falling over themselves to lick their boots&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not want to raise the temperature of this debate any higher than it is already but, from an intervention the Minister made while Senator Dooge was speaking, it seemed <Col N="620" /> to me that he had not yet bothered to read the second of these two amendments. Maybe I am doing him an injustice in saying that, but he intervened while Senator Dooge was speaking to say that the amendment referred only to explosives.  The second of these amendments, which the Minister ought by now to have read or to which his attention ought to have been drawn, governs or attempts to deal with all deadly things, not only the things governed by the Principal Act but also what I tried to describe as prohibited substances and also incendiary devices.</P>
      <P>I realise that a difficulty has been created by the way in which I phrased the first section but I do not accept the Minister's facetious reference to the housewife's shopping basket.  There is a limit on the number of things in the world of chemistry which will produce an explosion.  It would be no bother for the Minister and his Department to produce a list of these innocuous substances to which the application of the proposed amendment would be unreasonable.  I am perfectly certain that his Department, with the assistance of the State chemists and the Garda, could turn out a very workable list in a couple of days.  The Minister spoke of an enormous number of common household substances.  That is nonsense. Certainly, there are some household substances, such as sugar, weedkiller, some detergents and methylated spirits, which might have to be excepted.</P>

      <P>A day's work would compile such a list.  I do not accept, for a moment, that the Minister is entitled to brush this aside as being impossible.  There are many Acts in this country which contain lengthy Schedules of a technical kind.  That is what officials are there for and they do the job extremely well.  No one is asking the Minister to do it himself. His officials are well able to do it and if they are not able to do it the Minister should get people who will be able to compile a list of dangerous substances and substances that are safe. He has introduced in the Dáil&mdash;<Col N="621" /> although it is not yet printed&mdash;a Dangerous Substances Bill.</P>

      <P>It was on the Order Paper of the Dáil as getting its First Reading.  I am not criticising the Minister because the Bill is not yet printed and I do not wish to make a point about it.  All I am saying is that I cannot say what is in that Bill because it is not printed yet.  It would make my job here easier if I could see what is contained in it.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to make fun of this first amendment by saying that he disliked the job, if I understood him rightly, of having to take things out of a blanket provision.  In fact there are plenty of precedents in our legislation of such a kind.  One that springs to my mind immediately&mdash;I am sure I could add to the list if I had an hour to look things up in&mdash;is the situation under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, which entitles the Minister for Local Government to exempt from the application of that Act whatever he likes; and we know how that was used in the past.</P>
      <P>There are other examples which could be cited and which I could give the House if I had time and an opportunity. The Minister is misleading the House if he pretends there is anything new or strange about a Minister being given a blanket authority and allowed to chip away the area of that blanket authority by excepting or exempting regulations.  There is nothing new about that, and well the Minister knows it.</P>
      <P>It seemed to me that the Minister did not understand what Senator Robinson was saying, and that he completely misunderstood it.  I do not fault him necessarily for that.  It is hard to catch something the first time.  Whether Senator Robinson's intervention helps the Minister's case or not, the case which Senator Robinson mentions is a modern English case which again, as the Minister well knows, is not binding on the most remote district court in Ireland as an authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="622" /> Furthermore, even if it were in some respect binding by reason of a doctrine of precedent which does not exist in this country to that extent, it would be within the powers of this Oireachtas to change the law.  The fact that murder is an extra-territorial crime in most, if not all, civilised countries has got absolutely nothing to do with this at all.  I have cited the Offences Against the Persons Act, 1861, as an example of a statutory provision which perfectly clearly makes it an offence to organise the commission of a crime in or outside our own territories.  There is nothing in the Constitution, and so far as I know there is nothing in international law either, which inhibits or prevents this Oireachtas from extending that category of offence.  That is what I want this House to do.</P>
    <P>I have spoken long enough about this.  I know there are other things on the Order Paper that need attention and I will not hold the House up any longer.  I want to repeat, if I can do so for the last time, solemnly and soberly, that the Minister has simply not dealt with the question whether so far as our firearms code is concerned it ought to be permissible for someone in this jurisdiction to organise the importation of deadly things into the North of Ireland.  He has just avoided that question, in part by abuse and in part by facetiousness.  He has not persuaded me, although when I first opened this Bill I had no preconceived ideas about it, that the Government are really serious in their intent, which I accept at bottom to be sincere, of diminishing violence in Northern Ireland, or at least making a gesture to show the people up there that we mean what we say about wanting peace in the North.</P>
    <P>That is the only importance this Bill has.  The rest of it is all rubbish. It might as well not be there; it will have no effect; it will be a dead letter.  The only thing in it worth having is section 4 which says to the people in the North: &ldquo;We think your life and limb is just as valuable as our life and limb.&rdquo;  It says that and I think section 4 is an admirable section. What I complain about is that the principle behind section 4 is not <Col N="623" /> being further extended.  I have not got a satisfactory answer from the Government as to why that is not being done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2 to add to the section the following new subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  If a contributing employee is or was dismissed by reason of redundancy between the 17th day of May, 1967 and 1st day of January, 1968 and employment with the same employer is resumed within 34 weeks, continuity of employment shall not be broken by the interruption.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In moving the adoption of this amendment I should like, first of all, if I am in order, to make a very brief general statement about all the amendments tabled by the Labour Party Members.  I do this in order to help the House and the Minister and to expedite the business before us, especially in view of the fact that it has been indicated that we may finish at 5 o'clock this evening.</P>
      <P>In all, we have submitted 28 amendments and frankly we find ourselves in somewhat of a dilemma.  The Minister made it perfectly clear last week in this House, as he had previously done in the other House, that under no circumstances whatsoever would he entertain any amendment providing for retrospection to any degree in respect of any matter coming within the ambit of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our difficulty now is that if we invite or if we open up a protracted debate on each of the 28 amendments, including quite a few dealing with retrospection, <Col N="624" /> we run the very grave risk of holding up the implementation of the new legislation. This is precisely what we do not wish to do and it is precisely what workers and trade unionists everywhere have specifically asked us not to do.  In all the circumstances, therefore, and in view of the fact that many of the amendments are self-explanatory, we do not propose to go into all of them in very great detail. It is not to be taken, however, from this that we do not regard them all as very serious.  That is not so.  We feel very concerned indeed about each and every one of them.  We hope that the House and the Minister will give favourable consideration to them all.</P>
    <P>Coming specifically to amendment No. 1, the purpose of this is very clear and I do not think I need to say a great deal about it.  The purpose is, of course, to give retrospection to actions taken between 17th May, 1967, and 1st January, 1968, that is in the interim period between the publication of the Principal Act and the date of its operation&mdash;a period of 34 weeks. During those 34 weeks a few employers &mdash;and I stress a very few employers&mdash; in the knowledge of the legislation to come and in anticipation of it took action which broke the continuity of employment of their workers.  I want to stress that my experience of employers down the years is that they are very anxious to do the right thing, to treat their employees properly. However, there are a few, and there always will be a few, who will take advantage of any legislation or any facility to deprive their workers of their just rights.  That is what happened in this case.  In the interim period between the publication of the Bill, as it was at that time, on 17th May, 1967, and the date of operation of the Bill, many workers were deprived of their rights and this amendment simply seeks to put that right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of Senator Kennedy on this amendment, I should like to add the point that I think that when the Principal Act was going through the House it was felt that the 26 weeks proviso would cover the period between the introduction <Col N="625" /> and the passing of the Act.  I counted it as 34 weeks, so that there was the eight week period which is not bridged by the Principal Act and which, as Senator Kennedy pointed out, gave rise to some people being deprived of what I would agree was the intention of the drafters of the Principal Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Senator Kennedy's introductory statement regarding the overall question of retrospection and his reference to my statement here last week.  Indeed I, too, should like to get the Bill finalised and brought into operation at the earliest possible date. I would say as regards this question of retrospection that there is a lot involved here and a good deal of estimation, which may or may not be reliable, in regard to what the fund might be able to bear.  I am afraid that events since the circulation of the Bill on the 22nd January do not give me any greater enthusiasm for retrospection. Apart from that, the principle of retrospection is not good.  It is difficult administratively to get retrospection to a date which would be satisfactory to everybody.  No matter which date we might fix, somebody would feel that we should go back somewhat further.</P>
      <P>We have an amendment here which suggests that the Bill should become effective from the date when it was circulated when employers would first know its provisions.  I can see a certain force of argument in that.  Another amendment suggests as a commencement date the date when it was finalised in the Dáil when employers might know even better what exactly it was likely to contain.  The same objection applies to both of these dates and I have set my mind against accepting retrospection.</P>
      <P>The only concession I would make to that is that I would have the possible costings fully examined and see if on Report Stage it might be possible to give any measure of retrospection. That is the only concession I would make on this question of retrospection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the amendments have appeared in the Dáil in some form or another.  Anywhere I thought that a <Col N="626" /> Dáil amendment merited consideration or had some useful function in relation to the improvement of the legislation I accepted or brought in an alternative one.  I think that we have already screened the provisions of the Bill pretty thoroughly.  We have had much discussion with both sides in employment on this&mdash;we must consider two sets of people concerned in this legislation, the employers and the employees.  It is not always correct to assume that the employees are always right and the employers are always wrong.  The employer is an important person too.  We must be careful not to make it unreasonably difficult for him, while at the same time making it possible for the employee to gain the greatest possible advantage in accordance with the spirit of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Sometimes one is tempted to legislate for the most awkward situation that could conceivably arise, in other words, to take into consideration an employer who would be out to circumvent the provisions of legislation by every conceivable means.  If we had to legislate to that effect I am afraid we would be creating for the good employers&mdash;thank God they are the vast majority&mdash;obstacles and difficulties that could hardly be justified in order to try to tie up the odd exceptional case of one who would deliberately set out to circumvent the provisions of the Bill with regard to his responsibilities.  This type of employer, so far as he may exist, will always be a problem anyhow.  I think we must keep in mind the more reasonable approach of persons who will try to co-operate.</P>
    <P>Getting back now to the specific provisions of amendment No. 1, I understand&mdash;and I put a lot of examination and study into this legislation which was introduced by my predecessor&mdash;that in the interim period between the possibility of applying the 1967 legislation to the period between the introduction and the circulation of the Bill and the passing of it in 1968, the period which is sought to be covered here by the retrospection proposed in this amendment, was carefully considered.  The specific cases sought to be provided for here were examined <Col N="627" /> but on examination I am afraid they did not support the accusation that the employers concerned deliberately took action to anticipate the provisions of the Bill.  Indeed, the argument could also be made on the other side that during the interim period there were persons who held out until the Act became operative so that the provisions would apply to employees.  For that reason I did not find any sound reasons for going back to cover that interim period.  I went over all this in the Dáil. I would not consider accepting this amendment for that reason.</P>
    <P>There was an allegation made that my predecessor was incorrect in a statement made by him on Committee Stage of the 1967 Bill in the Seanad, 29th November, 1967.  Deputy Hillery, my predecessor, said on that occasion that the question of laying off people and re-employing them for the purpose of breaking continuity of employment was covered under the Schedule, that it was provided that such a period would have to be at least 26 weeks.  I want to put that on record in order to correct the allegation made.  He added that to disemploy people for a week or two would not break continuity and that they were protected by the Bill as it stood.  The specific point which Deputy Hillery was making was that employers who might resort to the device of interrupting the employment of their employees for a short period specifically to break continuity could not succeed and that the provisions of the Schedule fully protected employees in that situation.  He was correct in that.</P>
    <P>It is now being suggested that because the period which elapsed between the date of publication of the Bill in 1967 and the commencement of the Act was a little longer than the period specified in the Schedule, there was a loophole by which employers could break their employees' continuity. Labour Senators, no matter what their opinion may be of the integrity of employers, would need to have a high opinion of their ingenuity and foresight to say they could within that short transition period arrive at means and devices whereby they could circumvent <Col N="628" /> the provisions of the legislation. I could not accept that it happened. I do not think it is necessary to say anything further on it.</P>
    <P>I have covered the whole question of retrospection as it was approached, in a reasonable way, by Senator Kennedy. He is aware, too, of the amount of discussion and consideration we have put into this in the Dáil.  I have had the costings worked out.  I will have them worked out again and if I think it could be justified on any grounds I will have the matter discussed on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2.</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following new subsections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  If an employee was or is in continuous employment on or subsequent to 22nd January, 1971 and his normal weekly hours of work in the period of 104 weeks ending on 22nd January, 1971 were not less than 21 hours, but were reduced below 21 by reason of redundancy, or in periods of redundancy, that employee shall be deemed to have been employed for at least 21 hours per week on 22nd January, 1971.</P>
      <P>(4)  Payments (if any) to employees affected by subsection (3) by reason of redundancy before the commencement of this Act shall be made from the Redundancy Fund.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 seeks to do in respect of this Bill what amendment No. 1 sought to do in respect of the Principal Act.  In other words, we are suggesting that, for practical purposes, the Bill should operate from the 22nd January, 1971, that is the date of publication, rather than from July or August of this year.  We do not know when it will come into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In replying to what we said in respect of amendment No. 1, the Minister stressed the question of costings.  I have no way of calculating what the adoption of amendment No. 2, or all the amendments for that matter, would cost, I do not know what effect it would have on the Redundancy Fund. <Col N="629" /> I doubt whether it would have any great impact on the credit balance of £1¾ million which the Minister said was in the fund at the end of the last financial year, but even if it wiped out the credit balance altogether, would this be a great tragedy?  What is the purpose of the fund?  Is it to help workers who become redundant and who are, therefore, unable to maintain themselves and their dependants in decent comfort?  Is the purpose of the fund to assist workers to seek alternative employment or to train themselves for other work?  Is the purpose of the fund to enable workers to re-adjust themselves and their families and dependants to an entirely new way of life?  Is it the purpose of the fund to help workers to migrate or to emigrate in search of alternative employment?</P>
    <P>In my view these are some of the principal purposes of the fund, not to enable the Minister, from time to time, to claim that there is a substantial credit balance and so on.  The fund is there to be used when and where necessary.  Personally I see no great merit in building up a fund for no purpose, especially where there is great need for its use.</P>

      <P>I am not too worried about not having a nest egg in the fund.  I am worried at the erosion of the surplus.  This can easily take place.  One must keep an eye to ensure that the income of the fund is sufficient to met the outgoings and if they get out of line the present surplus would be very quickly eroded by improved payments. We must always see that outgoings are kept in line with the income to the fund.  The surplus can be easily eroded in a short period and we would find ourselves having to impose extra contributions and this is something I wish to avoid.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" />&ldquo;(5)  If a contributing employee is dismissed by reasons of redundancy before attaining the requisite period of continuous employment in section 7 (5) of the Principal Act (as amended) and employment is subsequently resumed with the same employer within 104 weeks, continuity of employment shall not be broken by such interruption but the period of interruption shall not be reckonable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not propose to say much on this which is self-explanatory.  We are seeking to ensure that if anybody becomes redundant before attaining the requisite period of qualification and is re-employed within a period of 104 weeks, he will not lose the service he has.  We are not seeking that the interrupted service be reckonable for a payment from the Redundancy Fund.  It is a reasonable request.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is related to part of an amendment that came up in the Dáil.  It is, in my opinion, the more reasonable part of an amendment we discussed in the Dáil.  It has a certain amount of merit.  However, I should like to say to Senator Kennedy that where a person's employment is interrupted and he resumes employment with the same firm, this amendment seeks to permit the period during which he had previously worked to be allowed as part of the required continuity of employment to qualify for redundancy, without counting, of course, the lapsed period during which he was not working.  One could take the wrong view of employers, or of an employer who had not the best interests of his employees at heart, but this amendment could react to prevent a person re-employing employees whom he had employed previously, if he wanted to avoid paying them redundancy money at some stage.  He could instead take on new employees who would not be qualified for the benefit. At the same time, I can easily see where a firm that may have gone out of production for a time, and reopened, would require the expertise of the workers they had previously employed. There is a certain amount of validity in this argument.  I should like to have a look at the whole question on <Col N="631" /> Report Stage and, perhaps, bring in an amendment to meet it.  I would not agree to the 104 weeks&mdash;that is rather a long period.  If I bring in an amendment it will involve a much shorter period.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following new subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() A person who is or becomes insured for all purposes under section 4 (1) of the Principal Act on or after the commencement of this Act shall not cease to be insured for the purposes of this Act (unless he opts out of insurance in writing) until he attains the age of 70 years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We consider this amendment to be a very important one.  I referred to it on Second Stage.  It would give an enticement to people who are at present insured under the Social Welfare Acts to continue on for the purpose of redundancy payments.  I am particularly thinking of the non-manual worker who goes over the £1,600. When the Principal Act was being debated in this House the Minister seemed to be sympathetic to a degree. At that stage the limit was £1,200, but he made the point that redundancy payments were a new concept in Ireland, that he would like to get the Bill through and that he would possibly look again at this point before any further amending legislation.  Now we have the amending legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I seriously submit to the Minister that because a person's annual salary is £1,600 or over there is no guarantee that he will not become redundant.  In other countries the tendency now seems to be very much that the white collar worker and what one would call the middle management class are becoming redundant.  This happens very often <Col N="632" /> where there is a merger of companies. In addition, these are the people who are not entitled to unemployment assistance or to any social welfare benefit.</P>
    <P>Another point to which I should like to refer is that in arriving at&mdash;and the Minister probably has heard of this in another area&mdash;the £1,600 figure for deciding if a person is liable for social welfare contributions, what is termed normal and regular overtime is taken into account.  People whose basic salary is less than the £1,600 but who have to work normal and regular overtime are now also being excluded from social welfare benefits and, therefore, from redundancy payments.  There is a case such as this before the tribunal at the moment.</P>
    <P>Non-manual workers tend to be better provided for by pension or retirement services, or are covered by separate schemes.  This is particularly true of the Civil Service, local government bodies or semi-State bodies. However, there are many small employers whose clerical workers are earning over £1,600 and these are people who may be in a very vulnerable position during the next few years.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to consider seriously this amendment for the reasons I have stated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I could not accept this rather strange amendment.  In order to permit opting-out arrangements it would be necessary to set up elaborate machinery.  I wish to point out to the Seanad that when this Bill was introduced the limit for insurability was £1,200.  The period in which non-manual workers were permitted to continue in benefit under existing legislation was two years, and that was increased to four years.  In the meantime the insurance limit has been increased to £1,600 and we still left in the Bill the four years which I consider to be adequate cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions sought in this amendment would not be justified, particularly as the opting-out arrangement could be rather complicated and would involve the setting up of unnecessary machinery that would hardly be justified.  The four years after <Col N="633" /> which insured persons reach the income limit of £1,600 is adequate cover and it is not necessary, therefore, to accept this amendment.  In connection with this, I should like to mention that the social welfare limit of £1,600 is most likely to be abolished eventually.</P>

      <P>The Minister made a point about the problems of the administration on opting-out.  However, there is provision already under the social welfare code where if you go over the £1,600 limit and you wish to remain a voluntary contributor for widows' and orphans' pension purposes, there is a system for doing that. I could not accept that the administration problem would be too difficult to operate.  If the amendment point is valid, the administration could be looked after.  However, in view of what the Minister has said&mdash;unless he would like to elaborate further on it&mdash; it appears clear that the social welfare limit of £1,600 will be removed.  That means that non-manual people would be covered by redundancy payments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" />&ldquo;(3)  Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section or paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 7 of the Principal Act a person who at the date of the termination of his employment had attained the age of 70 years and had completed a period of 40 years of continuous employment as defined in Schedule 3 of the Principal Act shall be a person to whom this Act and the Principal Act applies provided that immediately prior to his attaining the age of 70 years he was an employed contributor in employment which was insurable under the Social Welfare Acts 1952 to 1966 or had ceased to be ordinarily employed in employment which was so insurable in the period of two years ending on the date of his attaining the age of 70 years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to add a new subsection to section 3.  The position under the Principal Act, clarified under section 3 of the Bill, is that a person over 70 years of age who becomes redundant does not qualify for any benefits whatever.  There are many who consider this to be unjust, particularly in the case of employees with 30, 40 or 50 years service with a company or organisation.  In my amendment I am trying to change this position.  Briefly, the amendment seeks to ensure that when a person over 70 years of age becomes redundant, if he has 40 years of continuous employment he will qualify for the benefits of the redundancy scheme.</P>
    <P>This is a very modest proposal and I hope the Minister will accept it.  The injustice of the present position was highlighted by the case of an old Dublin firm which decided to close down.  A number of their employees had more than 50 years service with the company but they were over 70 years of age.  After such long and faithful service, they should be entitled to the ordinary benefits.</P>
    <P>In the firm I worked for in Dundalk there were two men over 70 years of age, and there are others approaching 67 and 68.  Those men are retained because they are skilled craftsmen. However, the two men who are over 70 years will probably be laid off at <Col N="635" /> the end of 1971.  As the Bill now stands, they will be outside its scope and there are no pension schemes to cater for them.  They will have to fall back on their old age pensions.</P>
    <P>If the Minister examines this&mdash;and he should not find any serious implications in the amendment because the number of people concerned would be relatively small&mdash;he will find the only provisions in the amendment are that the persons I am seeking to bring into the scheme be over 70 years of age, must have 40 years of continuous employment and must have been in insurable employment on reaching 70 years of age.</P>

      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with the amendment but I do not see that there could be any exception made for persons over 70 years of age.  I should like to remind the Seanad that originally in the Principal Act, when it was introduced as a Bill, the age limit proposed was 65 and this was afterwards raised to 70.  We are rather inclined to compare legislation with that in Britain and sometimes the Six Counties.  The age limits there are 65 for men and 60 for women.  There is a scaling down in both Britain and Northern Ireland of the amounts that are paid.  The only thing that would arouse compassion in me is the suggestion that the amendment would apply to persons who have worked for 40 years with the same employer.</P>

      <P>The amendment says 40 years in continuous employment. This is a very good record and it would narrow down the number of cases to whom the amendment would apply. There again one must ask the question: should we legislate for a few people? Yesterday I was at the launching of a booklet by the Economic and Social Research Institute which was produced after years of research on occupational pensions by Professor Kaim-Caudle and others.  We were discussing the merits of the question of occupational pensions schemes.  The amendment we are discussing rather touches on the whole question of retirement.  I should <Col N="636" /> hope that we will move more rapidly towards having more occupational pension schemes in which persons of the type Senator Farrell refers to would be adequately covered in addition to any other State pensions that they might be entitled to or any other provisions of a Bill of this kind.  For that reason I would be slow to accept this. I am impressed by the fact that the 40 years continous service would reduce the number involved.  I shall have a look at it before Report Stage.</P>

    <P>( )  The Minister may by Regulations add additional paragraphs to subsection (2) and section (5) of the Principal Act shall apply to Regulations made or to be made under this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If in the opinion of the tribunal the employee was dismissed in circumstances that were not stated in the section, paragraphs (1) (b) to (e), the tribunal might be able to come in and decide the cause for dismissal.  The other portion of the amendment is to allow the Minister to add regulations and the regulations would be covered by what is laid down in the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem is that we find it difficult to foresee all types of redundancies. Workers themselves have this problem.  It is to broaden the scope of this definition of what is specified in subsections (b) to (e).  If this problem arose then the matter could be referred to the tribunal and they would then have power under this amendment to decide whether it was redundancy or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid we must legislate on the basis of present knowledge.  One of the main functions of this Bill will be to redefine redundancy as was originally intended before the High Court decision on a specific case now known as the Limerick-Ryan case.  Everybody accepted that the definition of redundancy in that case, while it might be in accordance with the letter of the Act, certainly was not in accordance with the spirit of the Act.  We have righted that in the Bill by defining clearly what was intended by redundancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator's amendment proposes to give the tribunal and the Minister authority to have further amendments <Col N="638" /> if at any time we felt that the occasion arose when a further definition was necessary.  I do not think that such a power should be imposed on the tribunal or the Minister.  Redundancy as now defined in this Bill has a fairly wide scope within the spirit of the whole legislation.  One could hardly visualise an instance arising where any further clarification would be necessary. I could not accept it on the basis of the possibility of some need arising at a future date.</P>

      <P>The purpose of these two amendments is to extend the expression &ldquo;employer's conduct&rdquo; to include <Col N="639" /> managerial conduct and industrial conduct.  We can all envisage a situation in which a worker may become redundant by leaving his employment as a result of the employer's conduct as an individual.  Sometimes it happens that a worker becomes redundant in these circumstances because of the corporate conduct of management or industry.  We have put down this amendment to ensure that there will be no legal loophole in this respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 8 deals with two separate points relating to section 9 (1) of the 1967 Act.  It sets out the circumstances in which an employee is taken to be dismissed by his employer.  Amendment No. 9, which is also in two parts relates, to section 10 of the 1967 Act.  It specifies the circumstances in which an employee who is under notice of proposed dismissal or redundancy by his employer may, without forfeiting his right to redundancy payment, anticipate expiry of an employer's notice by leaving his employment at a date earlier than that specified in the dismissal notice.  Again we had similar points in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The first part of amendment No. 8 seeks to extend the definition of an employer's conduct to section 9 (1) (c). It specifies one of the circumstances in which an employee is deemed to be dismissed for the purpose of the Principal Act.  The provision in section 9 (1) (c) was included in the 1967 Act&mdash;and this is important&mdash;to ensure that an employer, where redundancy was in prospect, could not avoid his obligations under the Act by acting so unreasonably towards an employee as to make it necessary for the employee to leave the employment.  Cases in which this provision has to be interpreted invariably come before the Redundany Appeals Tribunal, which are called upon to decide whether an employer's conduct was unreasonable or not.  I think that is ample safeguard. The phraseology used in the term &ldquo;employer's conduct&rdquo; allows full discretion to the tribunal to determine disputes that come before them.  They have regard to all the circumstances in each particular case.</P>

      <P>May I interrupt the Minister on that point?  Why this arose is that &ldquo;employer's conduct&rdquo; has tended to be interpreted as his personal conduct only.  It was to clarify that matter that we wanted these additional words included to spell it out more clearly.  It has happened, evidently, at tribunal level, that &ldquo;employer's conduct&rdquo; has been interpreted as his personal conduct only.</P>

      <P>I am not quite clear what the Senator has in mind.  I am not aware that that tendency has been creeping in and I certainly will have a look at that matter and see if that is the case.  The second part of amendment No. 6 introduced again a proposal which I rejected, in another form, in the Dáil.  It is also the subject of a later amendment put down by Labour Senators&mdash;amendment No. 13 which we shall come across later &mdash;and it states that employees should be free to terminate their contracts of employment in anticipation of redundancy and still qualify for redundancy payments.</P>
      <P>I stated in the Dáil that I had some sympathy with the position of workers who leave existing jobs to take up other employment when they feel the jobs they are already working in are in jeopardy and that redundancy may be around the corner.  I stated that a proposal of that kind would be wide open to abuse because workers who voluntarily left employment, for any reason, could tend to argue that they left due to the uncertainty of their existing employment.  I do not think we should take the risk of leaving it open to that kind of abuse.  I also held that it would create greater difficulties for management and it would lead to innumerable appeals generally.  Although it might help in the small number of hard luck cases, any advantages that would be derived from such a provision would be outweighed by the problems which it would cause. I indicated, therefore, that I could not accept the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two parts of amendment No. 9 are different in certain respects but I consider that they are open to the same main objection.  I do not think it is necessary for me to go into the precise <Col N="641" /> points of difference.  The two proposals, briefly, contained an amendment that in two different sorts of situations in which employees terminate their contracts of employment the provision of section 10 of the 1967 Act would apply. From my examination of the matter, I am satisfied that these proposals are both inappropriate and unnecessary.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, section 10 comes into operation only where an employer first of all serves a notice of proposed dismissal on an employee and the employee wants to anticipate the expiry of that notice.  The type of situation to which the amendment seeks to apply section 10 is completely different.  It is concerned with cases where employees themselves are taking the initiative.  They realise what is involved.  The question of the legislation is very complex but I am afraid that the amendment makes no sense and I must, very definitely, reject the amendment in this case.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following new subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( )  Where an employee is or was employed by a sub-contractor who (under contract or otherwise) is liable to another person (in this section referred to as the principal) and that employee is subsequently employed by the principal, the employee's continuity of employment shall have effect as if the sub-contractor and the principal were the same person.</P>
      <P>&lsquo;Contract&rsquo; includes a contract or arrangement&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to carry out work or operations of any kind,</P>
      <P>(b)  to be answerable for the carrying out of such operations by others, whether under sub-contract to him or under other arrangements made, or to be made by him, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="642" /> (c)  to furnish his own labour or the labour of others in the carrying out of such operations.</P>
    <P>( )  Where before, on or after 1st January, 1968, an employee was employed by a company which was wound up, liquidated, sold or otherwise ceased business or ceased to employ the employee, and the owner, or a director, or a person who had a controlling interest in that company, dismissed an employee in circumstances of redundancy and within 52 weeks renews the employee's contract of employment or re-engages the employee under a similar or new contract with another company of which he is the owner, director or has a controlling interest, the employment of that employee shall be deemed to have been continuous.</P>
    <P>( )  Payment (if any) to employees affected by this section who were dismissed by reason of redundancy before the commencement of this Act shall be made from the Redundancy Fund.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is similar to one introduced in the Dáil.  From reading the Minister's reply in the Dáil, it seems that he is very concerned about the transfer of the liability of one employer to pay redundancy to another employer. Of course we on this side of the House are far more concerned with the worker's right to maintain his continuity of employment.  To meet this point about the transfer, we put in an addendum that all the payments would be paid out of the fund.  I read the Dáil debate very carefully and I can see the Minister's objections on this point and his problems about it.  There is a lot of sub-contracting going on, particularly in the building industry, and it might be very difficult for some of these people to work up the required continuity of service as specified in the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has made the arguments for and against this amendment.  I indicated in the Dáil that I could not accept the proposals in the first part of the amendment. I gave a number of reasons for that viewpoint.  It was mainly because it would be unfair to compel employers legally to assume liabilities towards <Col N="643" /> employers or subcontractors over whom they had no control.  Such employees are already safeguarded in the 1967 Act.  I have examined this matter again and I am still convinced that it would not be reasonable.  We must have regard for the employers and it would not be fair to saddle them with responsibilities for circumstances over which they have no control.</P>
      <P>In the debate in the Dáil on what is now the second part of amendment No. 10, I indicated that I was opposed to the amendment on a number of grounds.  Apart from the serious implications which acceptance of the amendment would have for employers, the amendment was objectonable in principle for two reasons.  Firstly, it was objectionable because it would be contrary to the concept of limited liability which is basic to company law and, secondly, because it would impose liabilities with retrospective effect. This question of retrospection has reared its head again.</P>
      <P>The other more definite point which I tried to develop in the Dáil was that it could penalise good employers who seek to do the best they can by their employees who lose their jobs; they may try to help them by placing them elsewhere.  I am convinced that this part of the amendment would do more harm than good and I am afraid I cannot accept it.</P>

It provides for two specific categories of persons who should receive redundancy compensation retrospectively&mdash;firstly, persons dismissed for redundancy on or after 22nd January, the date the Bill was circulated and, secondly, persons dismissed for redundancy on or after 1st January, 1968, the date on which the Principal Act came into effect.  I am not going to reiterate this argument about retrospection, but I said I would re-examine the costings and would look at the whole question of the possibility of any measure of retrospection which I opposed completely since this Bill was introduced.

    <P>&ldquo;( )  Where a contributing employee is or was dismissed for reasons of redundancy between 21st January, 1971, and the commencement of this Act and he was not entitled to the appropriate amount of redundancy payment calculated under this Act solely because this Act was not in operation, the Tribunal may pay to that employee out of the Redundancy Fund a sum <Col N="645" /> equal in amount to the sum to which he would have been entitled if the Act had commenced on 22nd January, 1971.</P>
    <P>( )  Each rate of contribution prescribed by or under section 28 of the Principal Act is hereby increased by 1p as and from the date of the next variation on contribution under the Social Welfare Acts to the date of the next following variations, for the purpose of defraying the cost of operating this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These all give rise to retrospection, and in view of what the Minister has just said we do not intend to have any long debate on it.  The real reason for these amendments, both in the other House and here, is that we feel there has been this problem about the employer knowing the rules and being able to operate them to his benefit, whereas the employees are not in a position to do that.</P>
    <P>We put in a proposal&mdash;I am not too sure which amendment it is&mdash;to try to meet the extra cost.  I cannot find it at the moment.  It is in there somewhere. We propose a temporary increase in the contribution of one penny from now until the next time the Social Welfare Acts would be altered.  This was an effort to meet the Minister's point of view.

      <P>What I am seeking to do in amendment No. 19 is to have the improvements which the Minister proposes brought into operation as and from the 2nd June, 1971, that is the day the Bill was passed by the Dáil. As I am seeking to make the benefits operative from that date, I think it is only logical that I should make the provisions regarding rebates operative from the same date.  I know the Minister has not been anxious to make this Bill retrospective.  I do not think, however, that bringing the provisions regarding improvements and rebates into operation from the day the Bill went through the Dáil could be classified as retrospective.</P>

I do not know whether this is so or not, but I do know that a number of people are vitally concerned in these increased benefits being made available from the day the Bill left Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to have to try and explain to them that it is still not law until it goes through the Seanad. Therefore, I would urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>It is hardly necessary for one to say more on retrospection. What I said already applies to all of them.  I did not intend to say anything further.  It was a very clever effort on the part of Senator Farrell to think that there is no retrospection but to say that many people thought that legislation need not go to the Seanad is certainly denigrating the importance of this Chamber.  However, much of what was said may have boosted up the argument the Senator was making in favour of his amendment.  It was a fairly subtle effort.  However, I cannot accept that it would not be retrospection to go back to the date when the Bill passed through the Dáil.</P>
      <P>As I have already said, I will have a look at this matter again.  The question of imposing an additional penny suggested by Senator Owens is one of the matters about which I am not too enthusiastic either.  I am not too clear whether the Senator intends the penny to be payable by both employer and employee.  If so, it would be two new pennies per week, and that would be quite an addition.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="647" /> To add to the section the following new paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(d)  Where</P>
    <P>(i)  by reason of his employer's conduct an employee terminates his contract of employment in circumstances of uncertainty in which it is reasonable for the employee to anticipate dismissal for redundancy (whether or not he has received notice of dismissal or protective notice of dismissal or lay-off) or</P>
    <P>(ii)  if it is reasonable for the employee to expect that his remaining in the employment would seriously prejudice his prospects of obtaining suitable alternative employment which became available and was unlikely to remain vacant,</P>
    <P>and the employee has received an offer in writing from the employer and on a reference to the Tribunal it appears to the Tribunal, having regard both to the reasons for which the employee sought or seeks to leave the employment and those for which the employer requires him to continue in it, to be just and equitable that the employee should receive the whole or part of a redundancy payment, the Tribunal may determine that there shall be paid to the employee&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the whole of the redundancy payment to which the employee would have been entitled to, or</P>
    <P>(b)  such part of that redundancy payment as the Tribunal thinks fit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In this amendment we are trying to provide for two different sets of circumstances. The first one is the case of an employee who terminates his employment because of the conduct or attitude of his employer.  We want to ensure that his case is reasonably examined.  The second case is in respect of an employee who feels that by remaining in the particular employment he will jeopardise his chances of securing better alternative employment.</P>
    <P>We simply ask that the tribunal should be given greater scope to deal with cases of this kind.  This is all that the amendment seeks.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to this amendment when we were discussing amendment No. 8.  Basically it is a matter of trying to get fair play.  I am not in any way putting any sort of bad connotation on an employer's conduct. The main trouble is that the employer is in a better position to know how his business is going.  He very often would not be in a position, for very good business reasons, to tell his workers that he could foresee redundancy. This might be rather suddenly sprung on the employee.</P>
      <P>As the Minister knows, there is a similar provision in the North of Ireland.  It would give discretionary power and we feel it would give fair play in the matter of redundancy payments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is much the same case, as was mentioned when dealing with section 8, of persons leaving their jobs voluntarily.  I sympathise with persons who leave jobs voluntarily and by doing so lose their right to redundancy payments.  I could not accept the Dáil amendment, so I am afraid I must oppose this one also for the reasons I have already stated when discussing section 8.</P>
      <P>The inclusion in the legislation of provision to allow workers leave their jobs because of doubts as to whether these jobs will continue to be available and to get redundancy compensation would lead to a situation in which workers who decided to change jobs for any reason would be encouraged to claim redundancy payments.  They could always make the argument that they had good grounds for leaving. That is one of the reasons but there are a number of reasons why I think this is not an acceptable amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever that it would help in cases where there is some inequity, and where a person would genuinely leave employment and by doing so lose the right to redundancy which he has built up.  There are many reasons against this amendment. I do not like the principle of partial payment or imposing on the tribunal the problem of deciding on partial payments. We have tried to resist that.  In the drafting of the legislation we should <Col N="649" /> provide for payments only to persons who are qualified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>Both sides contribute in this and I think that things are a little bit loaded against the employee in this particular matter.  We thought that this would be a good amendment to try and achieve a balance.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems to be reluctant to extend the powers of the tribunal in any way.  This has come through in what the Minister has said.  The tribunal is fairly well-balanced.  We feel that the tribunal should probably be given this discretionary power.</P>
      <P>I understand there could be objections to the question of the partial payments too, but again it was to give the tribunal more discretion in their powers.</P>

      <P>To add to the section the following new paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e)  If an employee has given a notice under section 12 of the Principal Act, and the employer did not offer the period of employment in section 13 of that Act, and it appears to the Tribunal that the employee was laid-off wholly or mainly for the reasons specified in section 11 of that Act, it shall be presumed that the employee was dismissed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is quite a problem, in fact, and I am not too sure how best to explain it to the House.  Section 12 was amended.  This is the time limits.  Basically what is behind this is that we want to prevent many notices becoming dismissals. We have this problem that if an employer&mdash;and I am not saying that there are many who would do this&mdash; gives a lay-off notice and the employee notifies him of his intention to claim redundancy, the employer could very rapidly fill that vacancy and then say it was not because of redundancy because of lay-off but that the employee was dismissed.

      <P>To add to the section the following new paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f)  If a notice given to an employee for the purposes of section 11 of the Principal Act, is not a written notice or if in the opinion of the Tribunal the notice does not clearly state that the interruption is of a temporary nature, it shall be presumed that the employee was dismissed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to cover the point that written notice is not necessarily required under section 11 of the Principal Act.  Even if it is given, as often happens, the written notice may be of such a vague nature that it is not quite clear whether the interruption is of a temporary nature.  Following on from what we spoke about in previous subsections, this amendment is designed to give the tribunal the right to presume that the employee was, in fact, dismissed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks to provide that if a notice of lay-off is not in writing, or if in the opinion of the Redundancy Appeals Tribunal the notice does not clearly state that the interruption was of a temporary nature, it may be presumed that the employee was dismissed.  The amendment tries to achieve, in an indirect <Col N="651" /> way, the objective of amendments which were debated at length in the Dáil and which I rejected.  The main stand I took against the question of making it obligatory to have notices in writing was that, while any good employer and any well-established firm would, of necessity, give notice in writing it would of necessity place an unrealistic obligation on small employers and employers in industries in which casual employment was a feature, always to give written notice.  This would be imposing something that might not be easily complied with.  It is not desirable to press it against that background.  In the concerns where it would be most likely to be of importance, the employers in their own interests, would give notices in writing anyhow.  If small, casual employers who tend to take on people frequently had imposed on them a legal obligation of giving notice in writing it would not be practicable.  That is why I opposed a similar amendment in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EvelynOwens" hpid="Miss Owens Miss Owens">
      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>I was aware of the Minister's opposition to a similar amendment in the Dáil.  It is because these small-time, casual employers exist that the amendment is necessary. Very often such employers employ one or two people and it is not made clear to the worker concerned what the dismissal means.  We did not specify that the notice had to indicate what is involved.  We just wanted it left to the tribunal to judge the merits of what was said at the time of the lay-off as to whether the lay-off would be of a temporary nature.</P>
      <P>It is quite reasonable that anybody who is being dismissed should be told clearly whether the dismissal is of a temporary nature.  There should be no vagueness about it.  I do not accept the point that it would be putting a big imposition on employers, even those who employ in a small way, to make it quite clear what way they are treating their employees.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a word on behalf of that downtrodden section of the community, the small employer.  I fail to see why he should have to give notice in writing.  If he were taking on people on a casual basis why should he have to give them notice in writing to the effect that their services were about to be discontinued? There are many employers who take on seasonal workers; a number of people get temporary employment, and it would be enforcing an undue strain on the employers to give written notice.  If employers are just&mdash; and most of them are&mdash;they give adequate notice.  It is necessary to tell the employee in question when you are dismissing him, why you are doing so and when the dismissal will take effect, and I do not see any reason for written notice.</P>

Is notice given to those people, who are temporarily employed or perhaps semi-permanently employed?

      <P>To add to the section the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(g)  Where section 8 of the Principal Act applies, an employee dismissed for reasons of redundancy (on or after 1st January, 1968) who is or was not given a notice of dismissal in the form prescribed under section 17 of that Act shall be deemed to have been laid-off.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This also deals with the giving of notice.  When drafting it, we had in mind the seasonal worker, who is very often given very vague notice.  Generally, he is told that he is dismissed, and he does not really know what is involved.  This is why we put down this amendment, which deals with section 8 of the Principal Act.</P>
      <P>I presume that 1st January, 1968, would be covered by the Minister's previous remarks on the question of retrospection.  However, if we thought that the Minister was, in principle, in favour of this, we could redraft it and put an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;or such longer period as the Tribunal may consider reasonable if the employer failed or neglected to give the employee the written notice of dismissal for redundancy under section 17.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This again is to give the tribunal more discretion in deciding the time limit involved.  From my recollection, the Principal Act gives 52 weeks, and this Bill amends it to a further 52 weeks. When the employer neglects to give notice we feel that the time limit might be &ldquo;a reasonable time&rdquo; and the question of what is a reasonable period should be decided by the tribunal.  The statute of limitation is normally six years and that would be a reasonable time.  It somewhat extends the period in which claims can be made and this is the intention, where an employer has been negligent.</P>

      <P>As Senator Owens points out, section 12 gives the right to the tribunal to extend the period during which an application for redundancy payment can be made up to <Col N="655" /> 104 weeks.  This amendment seeks to extend that period even further in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to possible cases of hardship in this particular section.  A period of 104 weeks is quite a long time.  I can visualise that within that period much distress and hardship could be occasioned to, say, a small employer or a farmer, where possibly a deceased's estate was involved.  It might cause considerable difficulties if the full period of 104 weeks was extended by the tribunal, unless some consideration was given to the circumstances of the employer, in this case.  If it was a deceased's estate, such as a farm or a small shop, where a widow and her family were involved, the estate could not be wound up or probate taken out until all factors concerning the estate were finalised.  A possible pending claim for redundancy payment could be one of these factors.  It would apply equally in the case of a liquidation, where a liquidator would be unable to wind up an estate or a business, until such time as every contingency had been provided for.  I could see that in either of these cases &mdash;particularly in that of the small shop or small farm&mdash;there might be hardship involved.  Perhaps the Minister could make a provision somewhere in this section for special consideration involving hardship that would be considered by the tribunal and taken into consideration, when deciding the length of the period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The original time limit set out in the Principal Act, in which a person could lodge a claim for a lump sum is 30 weeks.  The experience of the working of the Act did not bring about very many cases or highlight any circumstance in which this limit was held to be inadequate. However, it did show there was some justification, for an extension of the period.  The extension proposed in the Bill is rather generous.  The former 30 weeks now becomes 52.  If the tribunal so rules it may be as much as 104 weeks.  The provision for appeals or claims cannot remain interminably. There must be some termination or <Col N="656" /> some defined period in which appeals may be made.  In my view 104 weeks is ample time.  I would not consider abolishing the time limit, as the amendment proposes.  I do not think there is anybody who is so ignorant of his rights as not to have found out within that time that he had a certain right to make a claim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the point Senator Russell made is really a valid one.  It referred to liquidations and cases of possible intestacies where there are transfers of businesses taking place or administration going through. There could not be a statutory provision in regard to redundancy in that event, because nobody could be aware of whether or not there might have been a redundancy claim.

      <P>A claim not made for redundancy is an intangible thing, something which is non-existent.  To prove that there was no claim made and that there would not be any claim made within a time limit, where there was a case of probate, would not be possible.  It is quite a different thing to clear the income tax with the tax office. It is easy to find out whether all tax against the estate has been met.  Other things have to be cleared before these probate cases are finalised.  I could not see how the fact that redundancy might be claimed could be brought in.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to have more faith in the tribunal than the Minister has.  The longer period which the tribunal has considered reasonable seems reasonable to me, too.  If the employer fails or neglects to give notice to an employee under section 17, this amendment would give the employee a balancing effect.  It is reasonable that the tribunal should have the power to extend the period further than 104 weeks.  I accept that the 104 weeks is quite a considerable improvement. <Col N="657" /> In a particular hardship case that could arise the tribunal could consider 106 weeks as being reasonable in a particular circumstance.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 13 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 13 quite rightly makes provisions for improved payments and benefits to the employee.  Would the Minister be prepared to make some improvement in the rebates payable to the employer?  Under the Act as it stands the employer may, in certain circumstances, earn a rebate up to 65 per cent which is an extra 15 per cent in addition to the 50 per cent that he would earn if he gives a two-week notice of dismissal to an employee and sends a copy of the notice to the Department.  If the employer gives notice up to eight weeks' rebate is increased to 65 per cent.  Would the Minister be prepared to consider extending that 2½ per cent per week so as to encourage an employer to give longer notice of dismissal, particularly in cases where a business or an industry was obviously going to cease operation in the reasonably near future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to this point on the Second Stage of the Bill.  Within the last couple of years some very substantial industries have shut down quite quickly. the maximum notice required under the 1967 Act was given to the employee. If the employer could have got a greater rebate under the redundancy scheme it would have encouraged him to give longer notice and given the employees concerned a better opportunity of securing alternative employment.  I should like if the Minister would consider doing that.  I believe it would help the conscientious employer who saw, due to changes in circumstances &mdash;possibly changes in technology or improvements or advances in his type of business&mdash;that he would have to close, so that he would be encouraged to make the earliest possible provision for his staff by giving them the longest possible notice thereby giving them an <Col N="659" /> opportunity of securing alternative employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the purposes of section 13 is to give the employer additional rebate for holding on to employees after the termination of the original dismissal notice.  This is something we consider useful as it gives our manpower service a chance to place the employees in other employment. Therefore, the employer's position when he continues to hold on his employees after the terminal date which he has notified for their dismissal is being clarified.  The employer can get a rebate of as high as 70 per cent of the lump sum depending on the length of notice he gives or the length of time he retains them after the notice expires.</P>
      <P>I know this is not the first time the case has been made on behalf of employers to have the rebate improved. But if the employers were not seen to have to pay something out of their own pockets their views on redundancy might be quite different.  One of the principles in this Bill, as in the original Act, is that the employer would have to pay something out of his own pocket; therefore we could not concede that it should be made easier for him in any way to render people redundant. This is one of the compelling features of the Bill, namely, to ensure that the employer will take a serious view of this whole matter of redundancy. If he were to be relieved entirely or to a great extent of the payment of the lump sum, he might be likely to take a lighter view of making people redundant.  This would operate to defeat the whole original intention of the redundancy legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was arguing from a different premise, that of trying to encourage the good employer whose industry has no future and who wants to give the maximum possible notice to his employee.  The mere fact of doing that and continuing them in employment places a severe strain on that employer.  What I was doing was seeking to encourage that type of employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This might not be the opportune time to do it, but the Minister might <Col N="660" /> accept the case I am making.  I accept the reply he has given.  I think it would be accepted in principle that everything possible should be done to assist both the employee who is going to lose his employment and the good employer who at cost to himself is prepared to give the longest possible benefit to his employee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Senator's point clearly.  The Senator may not be aware that there already is an incentive in the Bill for employers to give longer notice.  Basically, the amount of rebate to employers in respect of the lump sum is 50 per cent. Our legislation differs from the British legislation in as much as it provides for an increased rebate if the employer gives longer notice of dismissal.  In the British legislation the percentage rebate is a fixed figure and there is no incentive for longer notice.  We have such an incentive.  The rebate may go up to as much as 70 per cent depending on the length of the notice.  Senator Russell has asked me to go further than that, but I am afraid I cannot do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 29 of the 1967 Act if an employer gives eight weeks notice to his employee or employees he is entitled to a rebate of 65 per cent.  If he does that and one or more of his employees is offered employment within the period of eight weeks and leaves, the employer loses the 65 per cent.  If he leaves just two weeks after getting notice the maximum levy the employer can get is 50 per cent, although he has facilitated his employee by allowing him to take up a new job.  He has also saved the Minister's placement service the necessity and presumably the cost of securing alternative employment for the employee concerned.  I suggest the rebate should date from the date of the notice of dismissal and not from the date on which the employee actually left the firm, if it can be established that the man left to take up other employment and that the employer in the interests of his employee facilitated him by releasing him from his employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point but I think it is sufficiently covered.  I <Col N="661" /> have to have regard to the abuses that could arise if one section got more attractive benefits or incentives than the other.  This is something that could be subject to abuse.  Having had experience of the working of the Act and the type of case coming before the Tribunal, I do not think the case referred to by Senator Russell is a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether he accepts there is merit in the point or not&mdash; and I think he accepts there is some merit in it&mdash;the Minister is I believe being influenced by the fact that abuses could take place if he amended the Bill to provide for the situation I have outlined. I do not think the Minister in any section of the Act should be conditioned too much by the question of abuse.  I should like to make a point on behalf of employers&mdash;it is one that Senator Kennedy made himself earlier &mdash;and that is that the bulk of employers are decent, christian minded men.  That should go on the record of the House.  Obviously, there are black sheep in the employers' fold, as there are in every other section of our society.  But we should do everything we can to help the good employer who genuinely seeks to assist his employee. I would suggest to the Minister that the number of abuses that might arise because of an alteration such as I have outlined would be far outweighed by the number of cases in which the good employers genuinely sought to assist their employees.  I hope the Minister will take cognisance of the points I have made before we come to the Report Stage.  It would be an encouragement to the general body of good employers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Senator an assurance that I will look at it again before Report Stage, but it is something that we have already examined very closely and the consensus of agreement was not to make any change.  However, I will look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I referred to what I accept to be a certain lack of flexibility in the redundancy code and its operation.  I took as an example a case that had <Col N="662" /> come to my notice&mdash;of course, of necessity I only have the facts of this case at second hand and accordingly I cannot guarantee that they are accurate in every detail&mdash;concerned with the question of the payment of rebates and the amount of rebates which have to be paid.  I instanced the case of a small employer who had, to his credit, ensured that people employed with him for a long number of years would not suffer any break of employment in so far as he arranged for alternative employment for them.  The position in this regard is that, while there had been a change of employment there had been no loss of job; there had been the loss of accumulated service and the redundancy code applies.</P>
      <P>In replying at the end of a Second Stage the Minister indicated that he did not quite grasp what was involved in this case.  This arose from the fact that the Minister misunderstood the defect in the proceedings.  The Minister took me up as saying that this particular individual did not inform his employees.  As I understand it, in this case the employer who had acted as a most humane employer failed to notify the Department of Labour.  It was the failure to notify the Department of Labour that resulted in this employer, who had acted so creditably, not being entitled to benefit in any way under the Act.</P>
      <P>While not wishing to encourage anybody under this section or any other section of this Bill or under the Principal Act not to carry out the procedures, just as there are employees whom we must protect, there are also employers whom we must protect. What I was urging then and would urge again in regard to the provisions of this and other sections of this Bill is that there should be a certain residual discretion in the tribunal, that a mere defect of form which has done no harm to anybody, except perhaps caused some inconvenience to some of the Minister's officials, should not be something which would result in a loss of benefit either to an employee or a human employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was the net case, and I wish to clear up this misunderstanding.  As I understand it, under this section and <Col N="663" /> other sections of this Bill what can be called a defective form&mdash;indeed, failure to supply a particular form to the Minister's Department&mdash;can result in a loss for somebody who has acted beyond what the Minister expects of an employer under this code in conditions of redundancy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not at the time have grasped the Senator's point on Second Reading that he was referting to notice to the Department rather than to the employee.  Since then I have had regard to what he said.  It is not a case where any provision should be made.  In the unlikely event of hardship being caused of the type mentioned by Senator Dooge, I do not think it would justify our taking special measures in this Bill when we consider the importance which we attach to being notified under section 17. It is most important that if our manpower services is going to be alert and alive to the duties of replacing people we must get a minimum of two weeks' notice, as provided in section 17.</P>
      <P>If we made provision to cover the unusual type of case with which this exceptionally good employer was faced, when having done everything for his employees, he forgot to notify the Department in time, if we made the necessary provision in the Bill to provide for that exceptional type of employer, we might be leaving a loophole for so many others who would not bother giving the necessary notice.</P>
      <P>The possibility of such abuse is what I think outweighs the merits of the case which Senator Dooge has made with regard to notice to the Department under section 17 of the Act. I do not think he will press it when he takes into consideration the importance we attach to getting due notice of pending redundancies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful that the Minister acknowledges that there is a case of hardship here.  What he has done is to attempt to hold a balance between the hardship to the individual, who, after all, in this case is having his own business fold up under him, and the general good of having proper information for the manpower <Col N="664" /> service.  The Minister or anyone else in this House who has listened to me talking from time to time in regard to the manpower services will know that I have advocated these services and their improvement down through the years.  Nevertheless, I do not think the problem is quite as difficult as the Minister indicates, because what we are concerned with here is not a notification that there is unemployment, but a notification that there is no need for the manpower service to come into action.  It is not just a notification that certain persons are to be redundant and are seeking work, but a notice that some people are redundant in the sense that they have lost continuity of service but in fact they have not lost continuity of employment.</P>
      <P>This narrows the whole issue very considerably.  Where a person failed to notify the Department that certain people were redundant and would be coming on the labour market, here the balance would probably go in the Minister's favour.  But would it be possible to draw up an amendment to cover the case where there was a defect in regard to a notice, where there was continuity of employment but a change of employment? I am not asking that such notices should be regarded as unnecessary; all I am asking is that discretion be left to the tribunal that where there are special cases of hardship, something might be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look at it in this very narrow sense between now and the Report Stage.  I would expect that the tribunal in this instance would not exercise that discretion in favour of a large organisation.  If a large organisation, due perhaps to the very complexity of its organisation, fail to send in a notice, let that be on their own heads.  I am thinking here of the small man, the man who worked alongside those five or six employees whom he was not letting go.  He was not a boss to them in the sense of the larger employer.  They were men who worked beside him.  At the folding up of this business they were losing something but they were getting continuity of employment.  The employer was also losing a great deal.  In this narrow sense of the small organisation <Col N="665" /> which, as the Minister knows only too well from every aspect of the work of his Department, creates its own special problems.  In this regard we are dealing only with a small organisation, the case where there is redundancy only in the technical sense, because that is what we are concerned with here.</P>
    <P>We are not concerned with somebody coming on to the labour market. We are concerned with somebody who is redundant without being unemployed. I would ask the Minister to look at it in this very narrow sense to see if perhaps something might not be done here, not to introduce an amendment which would exempt such persons from the necessity but would give a narrow discretion to the tribunal in regard to such cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I just say a word in support of Senator Dooge's case? Most of the cases he probably has in mind, and certainly that I would have in mind, would be elderly men, say small contractors and those giving up business before they were forced to give up business on the grounds of either age or ill health; they had done everything possible to make provision for the men who worked alongside them rather than for them.</P>
      <P>I do appreciate, and I have said this already when speaking on other questions, the fact that he is bound to do everything he possibly can to avoid abuses.  I think we should all share his anxiety in that regard.  Again, I would emphasise that concurrently with that the Minister should do all he can to support the good employer and to ensure that employers who are not so good have more regard for the future of their employees.  It is possible that the type of employer Senator Dooge has suggested might give the requisite notice of dismissal to his employees, find them alternative employment and then, due to death or sudden illness, might not comply with the section regarding notice to the Minister's Department.  Is that provided for anywhere in the Bill?  Or is that another case, such as Senator Dooge has outlined, in which the employer or the employer's estate, would be at the loss?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>What may have escaped the Senators who have spoken on the matter of the person who forgets to give notice&mdash;and I think Senator Dooge may not have adverted to it on the occasion of the Second Reading debate&mdash;is that an employer cannot be deprived of getting some rebate of the lump sum.  What he loses is the amount he would have got by way of a bonus if he had given longer notice.  Even the man who failed to give notice would still get a rebate. Section 13, subsection (3) says:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding subsection (1), whenever an employer fails to comply with any provision of section 17, the Minister may, at his discretion&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in the case of a lump sum falling within subsection (1) (a) reduce the amount of rebate payable in respect of that lump sum; provided that the amount of the rebate when so reduced shall not in any case be less than 45 per cent of the said lump sum, and</P>
      <P>(b)  in the case of a lump sum falling within subsection (1) (b), reduce the amount of rebate payable in respect of that portion of the lump sum referred to in subsection (1) (b) (i); provided that the amount of the rebate when so reduced shall not in any case be less than 45 per cent of the said portion of the lump sum.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is one case on record where the Minister has reduced the rebate.  The basic amount of rebate was 50 per cent and the Minister takes power under that subsection to reduce it.  The fundamental thing here is that the type of employer to whom Senator Dooge refers would still be entitled to some rebate, so that narrows down further the necessity of making special provision for the type of case he has made.  It is only the incentive amount which is in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Stage of the Bill I suggested that, where there was a pension scheme in a firm and where an employee left by reason of redundancy, the employers' share of the pension contribution should be set off against the redundancy payment for which the employer would be liable.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in replying to the debate, just made a brief reference to the following point he made in column 467, volume 70, of the Seanad Debates of 17th June, 1971:</P>
      <P>The only thing I have to say about pension schemes is that redundancy relates to persons rendered redundant in their jobs due to no fault of their own and not to persons who leave jobs at normal retirement age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me quote an example of a situation that could arise.  If an employee retires from his firm at the age of 65, in accordance with the terms of the pension scheme, at a time when a redundancy situation exists in the firm, in other words when say, a number of temporary employees taken on for seasonal work during the summer or during Christmas are leaving.  If this employee, having reached 65 years, retires on pension from the firm he is then entitled to apply also for redundancy payment.  In the light of what the Minister has just said to Senator <Col N="668" /> Dooge, the employer can recoup a maximum of only 50 per cent, because his employee, retiring at the normal retiring age, would not receive notice of dismissal, because he would be retiring on pension.  I hope I have my facts right in that case, and if they are, the employer has a good case for a set-off of his pension scheme contributions against the redundancy payment which, apparently, he would be liable for as the Bill stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only provision with regard to offsetting amounts payable in respect of retirement pension against lump sum entitlements provides that this may be done by agreement between employer and employee. This is the only way in which there may be off setting arrangements.  It is not conceded that retirement pension or contributions paid in respect of a pension scheme have any relation to redundancy nor should they be used to off-set the lump sum payable in the case of redundancy.  It must be accepted that if a man, either by his labour or by his contributions, or both, has earned the right to a retirement allowance, this should not be taken as something that can be used to offset another payment to which, under other legislation, he would be entitled anyhow.  I am afraid that we were not able at any stage of our discussions with the FUE to concede this point, and I would be very strongly opposed to using the contributions in the pension fund to offset the lump sum for redundancy.  They are two separate matters and, I have already said here today, maybe, perhaps, irrelevantly, that there is a good deal of modern discussion and thinking now about the wisdom of providing occupational pension schemes for workers irrespective of what other retirement pensions they may be entitled to under State legislation or schemes.  I would not agree that they should be in any way linked-up, that one should be off-set against the other.  They should run concurrently and their provisions should be independent of one another. I could not agree that we should allow an employer to use the contributions to the credit of a potential pensioner in his employment to offset the lump <Col N="669" /> sum payment.  I think that is what the Senator has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe I am mistaken. I was hoping the Minister would tell me if I was right in the imaginary case I cited.  I understand that this situation would not arise during a period of normal employment.  There are certain times in a year when temporary employees are taken on in some factories.  The employee retires sometime during January following the busy period around Christmas and this coincides with a time when, say, 30 or 50 temporary employees are leaving the firm and are entitled to redundancy payment.  The only reason he would be entitled to redundancy payment is that he happens to retire in a redundancy situation.  If his retirement happened to occur at another period of the year in which there was a general level of employment he would not be entitled to redundancy payment. He would be entitled to his pension from his firm and his unemployment benefit up to the age of 70.</P>
      <P>If I am correct in the instance I have given, this situation would only arise where the coincidence arose of the man retiring at a specific time when a number of temporary employees were also leaving.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister has resisted strongly any linking of pension schemes with the redundancy scheme.  In the British Act that is allowed.  I may be wrong, but I got the impression from what the Minister said that there is less enthusiasm for pension schemes in firms.  I would strongly disagree with this.  I have been associated with these schemes for over 30 years and I think every encouragement should be given to employers to introduce all possible non-contributory schemes, including a death benefit.  These are of great help, particularly to young married employees. I hope I misunderstood the Minister in his reply on this when he said there was new thinking.  I hope the new thinking is not to discourage pension schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if I got my facts right in regard to this case, which is not altogether imaginary. It is related to at least one actual case of setting off the pension against the <Col N="670" /> redundancy payment for which the employer could not make any provision because he could not dismiss an employee who was about to retire on pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just said that. The question would not arise in that case if there was no redundancy in the firm but if there happened to be a redundancy situation, the employer would then be bound to pay him redundancy money in addition to the pension.  He could not get over it by giving him notice to recoup, say, up to 65 per cent, because he would not give dismissal notice to a man retiring on pension.  It is complicated.  If I have not got my facts right, perhaps the Minister would say something on that.</P>

      <P>I am not too sure that I clearly follow the arguments, but I think the Senator is putting forward the case made in Senator Farrell's amendment No. 5 that a man, even though he is over 70, still should get a lump sum redundancy payment.  Or is the Senator arguing that when retirement and redundancy coincide the redundancy should still be payable?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question here of whether the hen or the egg came first.  If the employee was rendered redundant before he actually retired from the firm he would have a case for redundancy, but if he was retired before redundancy occurred in the firm, then he has retired in the normal way.  There is no anomaly there.  It is already covered in the Bill.  Senator Farrell's amendment was that even though the man was over 70&mdash;and he cited some cases in Donegal&mdash;if he had 40 years service he should still get the benefit of the redundancy scheme.  I could not accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two different cases.  The point I am making is <Col N="671" /> that this employee is retiring on pension as agreed at 65 years of age.  Because there was redundancy in the firm, apart from his case, he automatically comes under the redundancy scheme.  The employer is, therefore, liable to make a redundancy payment to the employee, who obviously cannot get a dismissal notice because he is retiring in accordance with the firm's pension scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Russell's point would not arise under the normal pension scheme, because there is a contribution made each year, usually by the employer, which entitles a man to a pension at 65 or a choice of a lump sum plus a pension at 65.  Unless he retires, those contributions continue to be made, even if he continues working to the age of 70.  He is not being forced out at 65.  If you like, he is being encouraged to leave at 65, if he so desires.  If he retires at 65 he gets his pension plus his lump sum. If he does not retire at 65 under the ordinary pension scheme, he does not get either the pension or the lump sum until he retires.  If he retires at 65, there are more contributions paid into the pension fund and he gets a larger lump sum and a larger retirement benefit.  Most people prefer to take the pension and lump sum at 65, but they cannot be compelled to do so.  Therefore, either he retires voluntarily or he is forced out on redundancy. There are no two ways about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but Senator Nash was not referring to my case at all.  He was talking in a general way about pension schemes and I agree completely.  I am talking about a man who retired in the normal way but whose retirement coincided with a period of redundancy in the firm. Therefore, he was automatically entitled to claim a redundancy payment, but his firm would not give him a dismissal notice because he was retiring in accordance with the pension scheme.</P>

      <P>I understand the point that Senator Russell is making now. It might be a good thing to tease it out a bit further.  When you talk about <Col N="672" /> redundancy in a firm, does it mean mass redundancy or redundancy of one, two or three people?  How does one adjudicate on this problem of redundancy? Does it occur when two people are let go, or when 100 are let go?  A firm employing 15 or 20 people might say: &ldquo;It would be better to let this man go seeing that we can recoup 60 per cent of the redundancy payments from the Exchequer&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The point I am not clear about in Senator Russell's case is that this man would be retiring anyway.  When redundancy is mentioned, it is not clear whether one or ten or more persons are involved.  When one says there is redundancy in a firm, what exactly is meant?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 11 at the reference to Schedule 1 and before the proposed amendments to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The substitution in paragraph 1 of &lsquo;two-thirds&rsquo; for &lsquo;50 per cent&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to increase the weekly redundancy payment from 50 per cent to two-thirds of the normal weekly wage.  In rejecting a similar amendment in the other House and in rejecting amendments calling for increases in the lump sum, the Minister based his rejection on the cost factor.  He said that the Redundancy Fund could not bear the cost of implementation of this amendment <Col N="675" /> and other amendments of this kind.  I have already spoken today about the purpose of the Redundancy Fund, but I have a little to add to that, and I hope I am in order in so doing. The cost of the implementation of this type of amendment will not affect the Redundancy Fund to any great extent. What will drastically affect the fund will be a substantial increase in the number of redundancies.  If there are no redundancies there cannot be any expenditure from the fund, no matter how high the benefits are, whereas even if the benefits are low and there are a huge number of redundancies, the fund will be adversely affected.  This brings me back to the figures of redundancies mentioned last week.</P>
    <P>The Minister said last week the number of redundancies in the three years of operation of the Principal Act was as follows: 1968&mdash;3,863, 1969&mdash;3,696 and 1970&mdash;3,896.  The figures were almost constant.  The Minister added that for the five months of this year the number of redundancies was 3,092, in other words, for the first five months of the year the number had increased to almost the figure for the whole of last year.  I said at the time that these figures were alarming because with the implication in the increase in respect of the first five months of this year we could expect a figure of more than 7,000 for the whole of this year.  The figure could be 10,000 or even more.</P>
    <P>Several Members of the House, including myself, asked the Minister on that occasion to give some explanation for this steep increase in the number of redundancies, and also to advise the House of the steps being taken by the Government to arrest this alarming situation but during the debate last week he made no reference to either matter.  I do not want to embarrass the Minister, for whom I have very great respect, but it is quite impossible to divorce the question of redundancies from the general economic situation or indeed from the question of Ireland entering or not entering the EEC.  We have been told on many occasions by Government spokesmen that as we draw closer to membership of the EEC we get nearer to paradise.  We have been told that when we go in we may <Col N="676" /> expect a rapid improvement in all our standards and in every department of life.  We have been told that far from having 10,000, 7,000 or 3,000 redundancies every year we will rapidly reach a situation in which there will be far too many jobs for people to fill.</P>

      <P>May I remind the Senator that he has taken two steps away from the amendment now?  When he stepped away from the increase in rates to the level of redundancy, this was certainly permissible, but to take the further step, even if it is a reluctant step for him, into the EEC is not allowable.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  I accept your judgment, of course.  May I say in conclusion that I can state with some degree of confidence that if the Minister is unable to accept the amendment as it stands workers generally would be prepared to increase their weekly contributions to the fund in return for an increase in benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first real straightforward attempt in any amendment to improve the benefits in the amending Bill.  The Bill itself is already a vast improvement on the Principal Act.  It has gone as far as we thought it wise to go.  The Senator is now proposing an amendment to provide that a weekly payment instead of being 50 per cent of the pay immediately preceding redundancy should be increased to 66? per cent.  This would be a straightforward improvement of the weekly payment provisions in the Bill.  I can appreciate that this is what all of us would like to do&mdash;to give better provision in the legislation but we have had to accept some criteria with regard to past experience and future expectations. We came up with what we thought was measuring the cloth according to what was available to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite all right to talk of propaganda such as the paradise we will have, to use the Senator's own words, on entering the EEC.  I have never heard such a rosy picture painted of it before, wherever Senator Kennedy got this particular picture.  I have always argued more on the grounds of how we would stand if we did not go <Col N="677" /> in rather than on the paradise we will experience by going in.  Winding up the debate in the other House I pointed out that I anticipate greater industrial development and more industrial activity when we become members of the EEC.  It has been proved and is accepted by all that the more industrial development and the greater the complexity of industrial development there is, the more mobility we have in employees and the more the need is for redundancy measures. We are often accused of taking our cue from England in matters of legislation and other matters but I never apologise for taking example from the practicalities of other situations.  One of the advantages of having something tried out on the dog is to enable one to do better.</P>
    <P>The Senator concluded by saying that if necessary we can increase the contribution.  That it is always a possibility that if we ever reach the stage where the income to the fund was insufficient to meet the outgoing we would have to increase it but I do not think we should increase it until we reach that stage.  I would say to the Senator who is advocating an improvement of 16? per cent on what we are already proposing that I do not think our expectations for the future would justify it and I think we are already providing very generous provision for redundancy cases.  It should be kept in mind that redundancy cases are eligible to draw unemployment benefit for which they are most likely entitled, and in any event the total amounts that they are likely to draw cannot exceed 90 per cent pre-redundancy earnings. When all these things are taken into consideration, apart from the aspect of the EEC, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

      <P>not being disentitlement due to the employer's failure or to pay contributions under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied with the new paragraph 4 of Schedule 1. The provision in question will not have the effect visualised in the amendment. I think this is an unnecessary amendment. The paragraph specifically provides for disqualifications from weekly redundancy payments of persons disqualified from disability benefit or unemployment benefit solely because of <Col N="679" /> section 15 (2) of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, which refers to the waiting period only.  Disqualification from receipt of disability or unemployment benefit arises from section 15 (1) (a) of the 1952 Act, which is a separate matter.  I think the Senator is expressing unnecessary fears here.  I am sure the Senator will agree to withdraw this amendment because I regard it is unnecessary.</P>

    <P>The effect of these two amendments would be to increase the lump sum benefit.

Related to recent circumstances it would not be a fair burden to impose on industry at this time.  The amount of contribution we are already requiring from the employer is sufficient and is regarded by him, in many cases, as a fairly heavy imposition.

      <P>In page 13 at the reference to Schedule 3 and before the amendments to paragraph 5 to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The deletion of paragraph 5 (1) (a) of &lsquo;78 consecutive weeks&rsquo; and the substitution of &lsquo;104 consecutive weeks&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment again seeks an improvement in benefits and it deals with the breaking of continuity of employment. Paragraph 5 (1) (a) of the Principal Act states:</P>
      <P>When an employee's period of service has been interrupted by any of the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a period of not more than 78 consecutive weeks by reason of sickness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment proposes to increase the 78 consecutive weeks to 104 weeks. Although the 78 weeks represent 1½ years we certainly feel that two years is a reasonable period because it has occurred, and unfortunately will occur again, that people often have a protracted illness through no fault of their <Col N="681" /> own.  There has been special provisions in other legislation dealing with people who are out of work with a protracted illness such as TB, which is still with us, to some degree, and there are other illnesses which might require at least two years' absence from work.  We are asking the Minister, in this amendment, to extend the period of 78 consecutive weeks to 104 for those reasons, I do not anticipate that there would be very many people involved in that kind of situation but the extension of the period to two years would avoid a break in their service which would wipe out all their previous credit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important amendment but I do not propose to accept it.  The reason why 78 weeks was arrived at is that it is a figure struck between two opinions in discussing the preparation of this legislation. The worker side would, naturally, like a longer period and the employers would, naturally like a shorter period. The 78 week period is an in-between figure which, I think, is reasonable.  A point I would like to make here is that the 78 weeks would not date from the start of a person's illness.  It would only count from the date of the person's dismissal by his employer after he became ill.  If he is not dismissed there is no limit at all.  The 78-week period is thus a rather justifiable period.</P>
      <P>In any event, experience goes to show that very good relations exist between employers and employees in the event of illness.  Experience would not justify us taking any drastic measures to stipulate a longer period.  Again, we are inclined to think of the not so good employer who might not be sufficiently humane to have regard to what should be done for a person in his employment who is suffering from a protracted illness. The 78-week period is a reasonably optimum period struck between the thinking of the two different sections of industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EvelynOwens" hpid="Miss Owens Miss Owens">
      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be.  You can have as many opinions as to what is reasonable in this context as you have people.  I would think a period of 104 weeks is more reasonable.  The point is that it is not a matter of employers having a discretion in this.  If a person <Col N="682" /> has more than 78 consecutive weeks of sick leave his continuity of employment is broken.  Am I correct in assuming this?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The deletion in paragraph 5 (1) (b) of &lsquo;26 consecutive weeks&rsquo; and the substitution of &lsquo;34 consecutive weeks&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was some confusion in people's minds about this matter because the 34 week period appears again.  It has nothing to do with retrospection this time.  The amendment is to cover the breaking of continuous service.  Paragraph 5 (b) of the First Schedule to the Principal Act mentions a period of not more than 26 consecutive weeks by reasons of lay-off, holiday service pay and any other causes which result in an employee leaving his employment not <Col N="683" /> authorised by the employer.  This applies very much to seasonal workers. Experience has shown that the 26 week period is being used in some areas to avoid the provisions of this section. Very often the seasonal worker is just told he is being laid off and this provision is operated in such a way that it mitigates against the seasonal worker building up his continuity of employment. The 26 weeks, of course, is half a year and there seems to be something about a half year in seasonal work.  For that reason we ask that it be amended to 34 consecutive weeks.</P>

      <P>In the Dáil I could not accept the extension from 26 to 52 weeks, which was the proposal.  I do not want to repeat what I have said in support of my view on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  I stressed the point, which is most important and relevant to this whole question, that the periods specified in paragraph 5, Schedule 3, do not commence automatically from the date of layoff, holidays, etc., but only from the date of dismissal.  If there is no dismissal there is no limit to the period for which an employee's continuity may be preserved.  That is much the same argument we had in the case of the seven to eight weeks.</P>
      <P>Again the period we arrived at here is a compromise.  I do not want to put it off lightly.  I do not want to be repetitive because we have had a long discussion on this and the Senators are aware of the pros and cons.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 13 at the reference to Schedule 3 and before the amendments to paragraph 13 to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That insertion after paragraph 6 of the following new paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;If there is a change in the partners, personal representatives or trustees who employ any person, the employee's period of employment at the time of the change shall count as a period of employment with the partners, personal <Col N="684" /> representatives or trustees after the change and the change shall not break the continuity of the period of employment&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This again is to protect the employee when the firm has come change in a partnership, a personal representative or trustee.  It appears that this type of change of ownership may break the employee's continuity of service.  Some of the arguments regard transferring the liability from one employer to another are not quite valid here because we specify partners, personal representatives or trustees.  The whole nature of the employment would not change but certain aspects of it might.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider this amendment necessary because I believe that continuity of employment is preserved under existing provisions of the legislation.  It is rather important that they are, I would not like technicalities in the legislation could be used as a means of avoiding one's responsibilities.  But the existing provisions cover these the types of case described in the amendment.  I am advised that they do.  I will have a look at this again before Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>In page 13 at the reference to Schedule 3 and before the amendments to paragraph 13 to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The insertion after paragraph 6 of the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(a)  If an employee's employment is interrupted (including voluntarily leaving the employment) and the employee resumes employment at the employer's request or with the employer's consent within 52 weeks, continuity of employment shall not be broken by such interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  Where before or after 1st January, 1968 an employee is or was indirectly employed or engaged by an employer (through an agency, contract or otherwise) and subsequently that employee became employed directly by that <Col N="685" /> employer, that employee's employment shall be deemed to be continuous.&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is to cover periods of interrupted employment.  It is to ensure in the case of an employee voluntarily leaving the employment and subsequently resuming employment at the employer's request or with his consent within 52 weeks&mdash;that is a period of one year&mdash;that the continuity of the employment should not be broken by such interruption.</P>
    <P>This is largely to deal with the position of a female worker who leaves voluntarily to get married and the employer asks her or she applies for her job back.  This is something that has happened quite frequently.  We feel that this should not necessarily break the continuity of the employment.  We accept that the period of interruption, of course, should not be reckonable. This is something that is occurring more and more, where married women are now being actively encouraged in certain areas to re-enter the work force, because there is a shortage of women workers, as the Minister I am sure would agree, particularly in Dublin.</P>
    <P>On 29 (b), as it has an element of retrospection in it, with the permission of the House I will withdraw that part, and the Minister need not include it in his reply.  I would like the Minister's views as to how the service of such workers would be reckonable.  Has she broken her continuous service?  I do not think this should be so.  She should be allowed to continue when she is with the same employer before and after her marriage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Senator is thinking here of the period during which a married woman is permitted to be absent which should count for continuity.  I think the provision we make in such cases is ample. My reason for opposing section (a) of this amendment&mdash;I notice the Senator will not press section (b)&mdash;in the other house was because I do not want to encourage people who flit around from one job to another if they can.  It tends to provide for that type of person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have sympathy for the type of case where it may occur due to circumstances beyond the control of the <Col N="686" /> person, but the amendment would appear to be making provision for people who flit from this job to that job and the other one.  Everybody knows that a good employee is one who stays in the same job, is interested in the work he is doing and gives a good long service.  I do not think we should put a premium on the person who is inclined to be tripping around.  At the same time, I am not denying them the right to do so.  While the amendment seeks to provide for another type of case, it definitely would be benefiting the type of person who would never be content in any job.</P>

      <P>I do not know about the flitting around.  At some stages I suppose we encourage mobility of workers as well.  However, that was not the intention of the amendment &mdash;to encourage flitting around.  However, if that is the problem and if the Minister were prepared to accept the principle of the female worker leaving on marriage and resuming after an interrupted period of less than 52 weeks, I would certainly ask him to bring in an amendment to cover that point on Report Stage.  If not, I will draft it myself.</P>

I do not think it would be necessary to cover it any further.  I think this is really splitting hairs about the cases that are already covered in a general way.  Many of the amendments made here appear to have arisen from exceptional cases of hardship.  It is impossible to legislate for such extreme cases. I doubt at the same time if there would be any extreme cases under this section that are not already provided for elsewhere in the legislation.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, but I fail to see where it is covered in other sections. This is where an employee leaves voluntarily; it is not dismissal as such.  It is not necessarily redundancy. Then they return at the request of the employer or they ask for their job back with the same firm.  The point is that this interruption should not mean a break in continuity for reckoning continuity under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 13 at the reference to Schedule 3 and before the amendments to paragraph 13 to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The substitution in paragraph 8 (c) of &lsquo;26 weeks&rsquo; for &lsquo;13 weeks&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope I do not keep up my 100 per cent failure rate today.  This is the last of the amendments.  When I spoke on the Second Reading of the Bill I referred to the problem of pregnancy leave.  I think I was confused at the time because I referred to it as continuity of employment.  The Minister in his reply mentioned that the 26 consecutive weeks by reason of lay-off, holiday, service by employees or any other cause does not break continuity. I presume the &ldquo;any other cause&rdquo; would, in fact, cover leave on pregnancy where there is an agreement between both sides.  Then we come to &ldquo;reckonable service&rdquo; and the reference to &ldquo;absence in excess of 13 weeks in a period of 52 caused by any reason not referred to paragraphs (a) or (b).&rdquo; Paragraphs (a) and (b) refer to &ldquo;occupational accidents or diseases within the meaning of the Social Welfare Acts and absence through illness.&rdquo; I do not know if pregnancy has been defined legally as an illness.  I suspect it has not, but I should like some idea <Col N="689" /> on whether it is covered by the 26 weeks; if not, it must fall within subsection (8) paragraph (c) which is 13 weeks and this is why I put down the amendment to increase 13 weeks to 26. The Minister did indicate that he considered 26 weeks as reasonable for pregnancy.  I do not wish to start horse trading on this but I think that, if 26 weeks is in for illness, we should cover a similar period for pregnancy leave, where it is by agreement and authorised by the employer, by increasing the 13 weeks for reckonable service up to 26.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks an extension from 13 up to 26 weeks of the period of the employee's absence from work with his employer's consent for reasons other than sickness, lay-off, holidays, or service with the Defence Forces, which is allowable as reckonable service under Schedule 3. I consider that it is right that we should adhere to the general principle that employers should not be obliged by law to incur liabilities towards their employees in respect of periods when their services are not available to them. Certainly not in respect of long periods anyhow.  The 13 weeks period allows for a certain relaxation of this principle and I think it was accepted by everybody with whom we discussed the provisions of this legislation in the course of drafting that this was a reasonable relaxation of the principle.  I think this 13 weeks is quite reasonable.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that Senator Owens would like to make it 26 and somebody else would like to make it 52 but I am afraid I must retain the existing 13 weeks period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EvelynOwens" hpid="Miss Owens Miss Owens">
      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, we are in the process of negotiation in many areas the type of agreement to allow for pregnancy leave.  I do not know but I do not think it will necessarily be 13 weeks.  It may be more in certain areas, it may be less.  But the fact that the 13 weeks is specified there means that even if we come to an agreement with an employer which allows more than 13 weeks it still would be precluded from this because this is in legislation and would cut across an agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="690" /> The ILO, I think, recommend 14 weeks for pregnancy leave as being reasonable.  I took the 26 because it tied in with the 26 weeks which has been allowed for illness, and I still do not know whether pregnancy would be deemed an illness under this section or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The 13 weeks is considered to be fair towards what the Senator describes and what has now become to be known as pregnancy leave for women.  We have examined it.  We promised to look into this before the Committee Stage.  I have had a look at the ILO Convention since.  In fact, I have been there since and I still think that our 13 weeks is accepted by everybody as being reasonable.  I will have another look at it before Report Stage but I am not promising to come back with any improvement, unless I find some reason that does not occur to me now.</P>

      <P>This Higher Education Bill, to which the Seanad is giving a Second Reading today, forms an integral part of the development and improvement of the entire educational system of our country, a development which has been proceeding with marked acceleration in recent years.  I might, perhaps, give Senators a brief summary of the circumstances which led to the Government's acceptance of the idea of establishing a Higher Education Authority&mdash;An tÚdarás um ArdOideachas&mdash;and of the preparation of this legislation for the establishment of such an authority on a statutory basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> The necessity for some method of co-ordinating the development of higher education, of eliminating wasteful overlapping and of ensuring that the substantial sums of State money invested annually in higher education would be used to the best advantage, had been recognised by many people for quite a considerable time.  When, in 1967, the Commission on Higher Education included in their report to the Minister for Education a recommendation that a special body should be set up to achieve these and other ends, the Government decided that such a body should be set up and that they be called An tÚdarás um Ard-Oideachas.</P>
    <P>Recognising, however, that much thought would need to be given to the form which the body should ultimately take, and the duties and responsibilities which should be assigned to them, and not wishing to delay for longer than was avoidable the implementation of their decision, the Government gave authority for the establishment of an <i>ad hoc</i> body which came into being in August, 1968. Their terms of reference, though set out differently, were substantially the same as those now covered by the general functions and the specific functions which it is proposed in this Bill to give to the statutory Higher Education Authority to be established under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Let me at this point say that the manner in which the <i>ad hoc</i> body have worked, and the achievements of that body in the short time since their institution have amply illustrated the usefulness of a Higher Education Authority and have given every grounds for confidence that the statutory authority now to be established will be of very great benefit in, to re-state the objectives listed at section (3) of the Bill:</P>
    <P>(a)  furthering the development of higher education;</P>
    <P>(b)  assisting in the co-ordination of State investment in higher education and preparing proposals for such investment;</P>
    <P>(c)  promoting an appreciation of <Col N="693" /> the value of higher education and research;</P>
    <P>(d)  promoting the attainment of equality of opportunity in education;</P>
    <P>(e)  promoting the democratisation of the structure of higher education.</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás as at present constituted, that is, the <i>ad hoc</i> body, consist of a chairman and 14 other members.  In paragraph 2 of the Schedule to this Bill it is proposed that the statutory body shall comprise a chairman and not more than 18 ordinary members of whom at least seven shall be academic members and at least seven shall be members other than academic.</P>
    <P>As I explained in the Dáil, it is not the intention, at least at the outset, to appoint the full permissible number of ordinary members, but this provision has been put in so that, if at any time it were felt desirable that an additional member or members, having special competence in particular fields, be appointed, this could be done.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable, I suppose, that in the discussion on any legislative proposal in relation to higher education, the question of academic freedom and the autonomy of university institutions should come up.  It has been suggested, without, to my mind, any justification, that the provisions of this Bill might result in some inroads being made on that autonomy which is so jealously guarded by the authorities of universities and other institutions of higher education.</P>
    <P>I have already stated, and I repeat, that the concept of university autonomy is one which must be respected in any society which adheres to democratic principles.  But as with every other section of our society, the rights which the universities claim and which the community agrees they should have in this regard have corresponding responsibility.</P>
    <P>The university has a dual responsibility: it has a responsibility to pure learning and a responsibility to the society which sustains it.  If our universities or other institutions of higher education continue to fulfil their responsibilities, they have no real need to worry that their academic freedom and autonomy will be curbed or interfered <Col N="694" /> with.  There is certainly nothing in this Bill which could justifiably be a reason for disquiet in this regard.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words on section 12 of the Bill, which deals with payment of State grants to An tÚdarás and the allocation of these grants as between the various institutions of higher learning.  I was amazed at the misunderstanding of the purport of this section which was expressed when the Bill was under consideration by the Dáil and I feel that I should explain at the outset of our deliberations here in the Seanad what I had to explain on a number of occasions during the debate in the lower House.</P>
    <P>Under this section, two global amounts will be voted by the Dáil to An tÚdarás on the occasion of the Vote on the Department of Education Estimates each year.  These will be in the form of grants-in-aid, one in respect of recurrent grants to be paid to the various institutions, and the other in respect of capital grants for the institutions.  There will be no element of &ldquo;ear-marking&rdquo; in relation to these global amounts, in that the Dáil will not be asked to allocate a specific amount in respect of current grants and a specific amount for capital expenditure for each of the various institutions.  But there will be an appendix to the Estimate, indicating how An tÚdarás propose to allocate the recurrent and capital grants.  This will be, in fact, a statement of information for the Dáil and for all persons interested but, being an appendix to the Estimate, it will not rigidly commit An tÚdarás to make the grants exactly as indicated.  Such rigidity would be undesirable, because it would mean that if it were found, after the Estimate had been passed by the Dáil that for some reason or other the allocation proposed for a particular institution would not be fully required by that institution in the year in question, An tÚdarás would have no power or authority to transfer the surplus amount to some other institution where circumstances might have arisen which made the allocation originally proposed for them inadequate.</P>
    <P>The sanction of grants by the British Parliament to the University Grants <Col N="695" /> Committee is done on a pattern similar to this, and the Estimate for Universities and Colleges under the British Department of Education and Science has appendices indicating the capital and recurrent grants which it is proposed to pay to the various institutions.</P>
    <P>I consider that it is most desirable that An tÚdarás should have this degree of autonomy in relation to their being able to adjust their grant proposals in any particular year to meet an unexpected change of circumstances. Generally speaking, as far as recurrent grants are concerned the amount published in the appendix to the Estimates and the amount paid to any particular institute would be unlikely to differ in any significant way.</P>
    <P>It could happen that a significant variation would occur on the capital grant side arising, for instance, out of the fact that progress in relation to a large capital project might have been greater or lesser than had been expected. Of course, An tÚdarás would have no authority to exceed the total amounts, for recurrent and capital grants, respectively, provided in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>I should like again to stress the importance of this measure and to commend it to the Members of the House.</P>

      <P>We in the Fine Gael Party recognise the necessity for an authority of the kind envisaged by this Bill, which will act as a sort of buffer between the Department of Education and the institutions of higher education.  I will have a fair amount to say at a later stage in this debate about the larger context in which university and higher education generally must be examined.  The Minister spoke of education as being a seamless web.  I agree with him.  I have admired the way in which he has put this point before.  I know that he believes in it sincerely himself and I unreservedly share that point of view.  Not only is education part of a seamless web in itself, it is also increasingly part of the greater web of the society which contains it, and questions affecting education <Col N="696" /> are increasingly becoming political questions.  I do not mean political questions of a party kind but political questions of a more serious kind which every party will have to look at, no matter who is in or out of government.</P>
      <P>In the later stages of my speech I will show the House what I mean by this and show the respects in which this Bill, perhaps, falls short of taking account of these larger perspectives. I shall begin by pointing out the respects in which the individual sections are not yet satisfactory.  I realise that many of them have been given reasonable treatment in the other House but we will have to look at them again to see if they cannot be improved.</P>
      <P>Before I do that I should like to refer to the circumstances in which this Bill came before the House.  In his opening speech the Minister said he might give Senators a brief summary of the circumstances which led to the Government's acceptance of the idea of establishing a Higher Education Authority, An tÚdarás um Ard-Oideachas, and of the preparation of this legislation for the establishment of such an authority on a statutory basis.  However, he said nothing at all about the events of the year 1967 which were crucial in the history of this legislation.</P>
      <P>In that year the then Minister for Education announced virtually overnight a proposed merger of the two university institutions in Dublin and subsequently promised a White Paper on the topic at a meeting at which I was present.  The White Paper never appeared.  It was as a result of the controversy which developed out of that promise of the then Minister that the present legislation is before us.  It appears to be unreal.  I am not in any way accusing the Minister of deceiving the House or of trying to short-circuit a discussion on the matter: I know he will not do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unreal to look at this Bill otherwise than against its historical background of which the most conspicuous milestone in the public mind was the merger announced by the late Deputy O'Malley.  It was announced with minimal information at his disposal from his Department as to the educational <Col N="697" /> implications of the merger and announced with no consultations whatever with any of the people concerned, teachers or students.  It will be necessary for me to refer repeatedly to the historical origin of the legislation before us of which the most conspicuous feature is this proposal, now very much put on the long finger, to merge the two higher institutions of education in Dublin.</P>
    <P>These are a couple of introductory remarks.  I shall come back at a later stage to deal in larger perspective with the objects of the Bill and with the capacity of the Bill, as it stands, of attaining these objects.  The Minister and his advisers will naturally with to have some idea of the form which our amendments will take so, I shall go rapidly through the Bill and point out the sections that are defective or leave room for doubt or suspicion.  The first of these is section 1, the interpretation section, in which an academic member of the authority is described as a member of An tÚdarás who, at the time of his appointment as such member, had an academic post.</P>
    <P>I realise this matter has been well dealt with in the other House but I have to accept that this is a bi-cameral legislature and that we are not bound by anything they do.  It must be exasperating to a Minister or to his officials to hear the same arguments being put time and again and I will try not to be repetitious and not to repeat arguments unduly which have already been made in the other House. However, I am not at all happy with the outcome of the decision in the other House with regard to the definition of &ldquo;academic member&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>An academic post should mean something more than this Bill appears to make it mean.  It should be possible for somebody to be given an academic post of a purely nominal kind.  This could be a nominal academic post involving, perhaps, minimal attendance &mdash;even less than is expected of fulltime academic professors or lecturers &mdash;and that such a person would qualify for membership of the authority.  There are persons with part-time academic posts who would be good members of a higher education authority.  I recognise <Col N="698" /> that, but the House ought not to forget that we are legislating for a long time ahead and once a Bill like this has been passed it is not easy to amend it.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to recognise that this interpretation section, as it stands, is open to abuse.  I can easily conceive that a situation might arise&mdash;not necessarily under this Minister or under this Government but under some unthinking Government at a future date&mdash;in which it might be desirable, for non-academic or political reasons, and, perhaps, bad political reasons, to appoint to the Higher Education Authority someone who was not really an academic at all and who had very little experience of the academic world. It might be possible to contrive for that person an appointment of a nominally academic kind, thus qualifying him for membership.  I shall not reiterate the arguments put up in the other House in regard to that.  I know that the Minister's intentions are good and he will regard me as being unduly suspicious, but that is a point with which I propose to deal at length at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Further on in the same section, under the definition of &ldquo;institution of higher education&rdquo;, we are told that the institution is one which the Minister, after consultation with An tÚdarás, designates by regulations as an institution of higher education for the purposes of this Act.  Some members of my party expressed the view in the other House that it was worth making it quite clear that the College of Surgeons was an institution of higher education and this should be stated in the Bill so that it should not be left more or less in doubt.  The Minister gave an assurance that he would designate the College of Surgeons.  My fear is not so much that institutions worthy of inclusion will be left out but that institutions not worthy of inclusion will be put in, not necessarily by this Minister or by this Government but some time in the future. I think that the debate in the other House proceeded too much on the basis that the present Minister, with whom I have no fault to find as a Minister, would be Minister for Education forever or that his own good intentions <Col N="699" /> would be reproduced in his successors.</P>
    <P>I do not think one should legislate in that way.  One has to legislate on the basis that the good intentions of the present member of the Government recommending legislation are not necessary to be imputed to his successors and it should be guarded against in legislating against the possibility that the present Minister's successors may not have the same good intentions. When the time comes I propose to put down an amendment dealing with this part of the interpretation section.</P>
    <P>The Minister accepted in section 3 an amendment in the other House which entrusted to the authority a further function beyond those in the Bill as he originally produced it&mdash;the function of promoting that democratisation of the structure of higher education.  I know that my own party supported this amendment and were glad when the Minister accepted it. For myself, I should like to have seen something more said about what exactly was meant by democratisation. Let me say, without disloyalty to my own side, I would not, if I were in the Minister's position, have accepted this amendment quite so readily without building into it some kind of directive to a later Minister or authority as to what exactly was meant by it.  I do not think that a school or an institution of learning is necessarily the right place for the application of direct democracy in the sense that one man one vote takes everybody under the roof as being equal.  I know that the Minister does not think this and I know that the people on my side who suggested this in the other House do not think it either.  I will not put an amendment down about it because it was as a result partly of my party's pressure that it was put in the Bill in the first place, but I should like to have seen something more definite as to what this rather vague word was intended to mean in practice.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, and I propose to put down an amendment to this effect, I should like to see the authority given yet another function&mdash;if it will not sink beneath the waves of all their various functions&mdash;the function of planning the absorption of graduates. <Col N="700" /> It is already a serious problem, as the Minister knows.  It is not very long since there was a deputation in Leinster House of Higher Diploma in Education students.  I believe the Minister saw them; certainly representatives from my party saw them as well as the Labour Party.  They were people who were afraid that their educational expectations would end up in disappointment, that they had been led along a path which would end in frustration for them, that they would not be absorbed as teachers in Ireland once they had qualified, and they wanted the Minister to do something about it.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the State is not the automatic employer of everybody in the country.  I sometimes feel sympathy for Ministers who are confronted by people who suggest that they ought to guarantee their jobs in some way.  I do not say that about this or any other Minister but I think that an authority of this kind would be doing a more useful function than some of the ones already recited if they had the job of planning the absorption of graduates so far as that can be done by an educational authority.</P>
    <P>There is a problem here which is one of humanity and justice.  I often hear people ask: &ldquo;What is to be done with all those people getting secondary education and who are going to the universities?  Who will be left to do the plumbing and the carpentry?&rdquo; I think it would be inhuman if, in this country we were to deny to somebody who was able to profit from education, whether it be secondary or university education, the chance to do so simply because we wanted him to be a plumber.  If we got to that stage, then what is said about a capitalist society would begin to be true about us&mdash;that one section of the population was exploiting the other.</P>
    <P>I am not at all suggesting that and I want to make it clear at the outset.  At the same time, there is a serious problem that there are people in the country who are going into secondary education in large numbers with the undifferentiated subsidised secondary education and who, four or five years <Col N="701" /> later, will be pounding on the door of the universities.  The university that takes them in will find itself saddled with the blame, and already has been saddled by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister with the responsibility for turning out large numbers of graduates in subjects for which there is simply no market.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the Higher Education Authority to provide a fixed income for BAs.  I think that the authority ought to have some standing, more than they already have or appear to be given by this Bill, to plan or to prepare for the absorption of graduates in various branches of life here.  I know that this is easier said than done but I will have more concrete suggestions to make about it at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister now that he might give thought to the possibility of extending the functions of the authority so as to allow them to take into account the serious social and political problem which an excess of unemployable BAs or barely employable BAs will represent in this country in a very short time unless the universities drastically curtail their entry.  If they did they will have to bear a great deal of public odium which I do not see many politicians anxious to share.</P>
    <P>In section 4 the authority are required to bear constantly in mind the national aims of restoring the Irish language and preserving and developing the national culture and they are told to endeavour to promote the attainment of these aims.  This section is copied virtually word for word from the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, and it reproduces the obligation which was laid by that Act on Radio Telefís Éireann.  Of course, this is a healthy aim.  It is one that I know the Minister himself is personally committed to as are some other people in his party and some people on this side of the House. It is not enough simply to enact this section which will only be a nuisance to this authority unless we know how the authority will be enabled to carry out the duty so laid upon them.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly clear now that part of the trouble in Radio Telefís Éireann <Col N="702" /> has arisen from the fact that they have been asked to do conflicting things.  I do not want to stray from the point of issue.  I hope the Leas-Chathaoirleach will allow me to go a few inches from the path of relevance if I say that one of the reasons why Radio Telefís Éireann are in the public eye while a review body are being set up to inquire into their workings is that there is an unresolvable conflict in their situations as between the cultural aims which they are supposed to pursue on the one hand and the sheer economic necessities connected with advertising on the other.  Nothing relating to advertising arises in this context but a similar conflict will arise.  If the authority will have to bear these national aims constantly in mind they will have to be given the means to be able to pursue them as far as they can.</P>
    <P>Let us not make a pretence in the Seanad about this.  Everybody knows that in the one college in which Irish has a special status&mdash;University College, Galway&mdash;the recruitment of staff capable of teaching subjects is a very severe difficulty, let alone in Irish.  I do not know if these are matters of public knowledge or not.  I hope I am not in breach of confidence&mdash;I do not think I am because I am not a member of the Senate of the NUI&mdash;but I know that in recent years recommendations have been sent up by the Governing Body of University College, Galway, in desperation to make appointments because they could not get anyone else to take up these appointments.  These appointments were turned down by the Senate of the NUI as not being of sufficiently high standard to justify being approved.  These were people who were being required only to teach in English.  The whole problem of university recruitment is a very serious one. I am quite sure the Minister is conscious of it as it was hammered home quite strongly in the other House by Deputy FitzGerald for us and by Deputy Thornley for the Labour Party.  It is a very serious problem indeed to recruit people capable of teaching even in their mother's tongue&mdash;I am not talking about what is called the native language of this country, but in the tongue they learned from their mother. <Col N="703" /> It is even harder to recruit people who can teach through Irish.</P>
    <P>Probably, I could teach my law classes in UCD through Irish if I put my mind to it but I would not be able to teach as well and it would be futile for me to pretend that I could do so. I might be making a brave national gesture but the people listening to me would not be getting as good a service as I could give them through the language I learned from my parents. I am afraid that is a truth that people here are reluctant to face.  Accordingly, I hope the Minister will not close his mind to such amendments that we might put down which are designed to ensure that the operation of this section will not be an albatross hanging around the neck of any institution of higher education.</P>
    <P>If it were possible to provide an all-Irish university, staffed with people who, in their own subjects, were of normal university competence and able to communicate their knowledge through Irish, I would be the first to promote and encourage the establishment of such an institution.  It may be that in some departments that will be possible.  However, we will have to differentiate and recognise the difficulties of this problem.  Above all, we will have to realise that it is only part of the general problem of recruiting university staff.</P>
    <P>We, in University College, Dublin, have had to look not just to Ireland but to England and further afield for university staff.  We like&mdash;at least it is <Col N="704" /> my preference&mdash;to keep as many Irish staff in the college as we possibly can. I notice in the new university in Coleraine there are hardly any Irishmen at all, Orange or Green.  There are hardly any Irishmen teaching in the university in Coleraine because they cannot get them.  There are not enough people in this country to provide staff for the necessary faculties for the number of higher institutions of education that we have and we must recognise that problem and the difficulties that arise from it.  In recognising that fact we must, fairly and squarely, relate it to the problem in regard to the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I hope I will not be accused of making a cheap or political point in saying this.  I do not mind leaving the section in the Bill but we must add something to it in such a way as to make it clear that it will not become an ostacle to education generally.  It would be a marvellous thing if it were possible to ensure higher education through the medium of Irish&mdash;effective education and not just sham education &mdash;at third level.  It would be a marvellous thing and I would be very happy if we could do so.  Until that can be done it is important that this section should not be used, or should not even be capable of being a threat to be used, as a clog on the freedom of the universities to do their work.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
