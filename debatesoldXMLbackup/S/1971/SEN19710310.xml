      <P>When is it proposed to take No. 1 on the Order Paper, the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, 1971&mdash;First Stage?  I know Senator Horgan raised this matter last week and that the Leader of the House said that it was under consideration. I should like to emphasise that this is just the First Stage, the right to publish, and that in the Parliamentary process in a democratic society it is necessary on an issue like this that the Bill is published, so that there may be a debate on it.  It is important that this merely technical Stage is passed so that the terms of the Bill may be made known and that the democratic process may take place.  I should be glad if the Leader of the House could give us an indication when this First Stage of the Criminal Law Amendment Bill may be taken.</P>

      <P>I should like to associate myself with Senator Robinson's remarks and to express my disappointment at the continued inaction of the Government on this point.  Although in some ways this cannot be said to be a particularly urgent piece of legislation, it is obvious that the debate which the mere formulation of this proposal has aroused outside the House makes it very necessary that we, in this House, <Col N="1152" /> should be seen to be responsive to public opinion and to public interest.  I urge on the Leader of the House, when he is considering the Order of Business for next week, the consideration that, when long speeches such as were made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Dáil Éireann yesterday continue to be made, and when no action is taken by the Government on the basis of the kind of sentiment expressed by him, the credibility of the Government and, to a certain extent, of this Parliament, is involved.  What we are asking for is a very simple and yet necessary Parliamentary step.  It has to be taken in order to allow the necessary process of amendment, clarification and discussion to begin on a matter of such public importance.  I conclude by saying that I do not think any of us who was involved in the preparation of this Bill is prepared to consider indefinite postponements of it.</P>

      <P>I merely wish to inquire if the Leader of the House could give me any idea when No. 2 might be taken.  It is a Private Member's Bill in my name and that of Senators O'Brien and Butler, the attempt being to make better provision for the maintenance of deserted wives. I realise that this Bill was put in only last week and I am not pressing Senator Ó Maoláin on this.  Nevertheless, I should be grateful for some indication as to when the First Stage might be taken.</P>

      <P>In regard to No. 1, there is no emergency about it. There is no great overwhelming public demand that we should take any immediate action.  I do not agree with Senator Horgan's interpretation of the situation either in regard to what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said or the necessity for immediate action to display the credibility of this House.  The matter is under consideration and as soon as we have considered it we will acquaint the Seanad of our decision.</P>
      <P>In regard to the sittings of the House, it is proposed to sit tomorrow from 3 p.m. to discuss Motion No. 12.  In regard to Senator Kelly's Bill, I hope to be able to inform him of the position on the next sitting day.</P>

    <Title>Irish Steel Holdings Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1971    (Certified Money Bill):   Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="1153" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill proposes to raise the ceiling of borrowings which may be guaranteed by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, for Irish Steel Holdings Limited from the present limit of £1 million to £3 million.</P>
      <P>Irish Steel Holdings Limited are a wholly owned State company with equity capital of £6 million subscribed by the Minister for Finance.  Crude steel is produced in the company's mill at Haulbowline from basic raw materials in a single open hearth furnace.  The principal product of the firm is reinforcing steel bars for the building industry.</P>
      <P>The company are embarking on a major expansion of its steel making capacity following a detailed study of its operations and potential by external consultants&mdash;Messrs.  Guest, Keen and Nettlefold.  A second furnace, which will be an electric are furnace, is to be installed and there will be additions and modifications of the rolling mills and other parts of the undertaking.</P>
      <P>The proposed expansion will almost double the basic output of steel ingots, bringing it up to between 135,000 and 150,000 tons per annum.  A major consideration in this scheme is the introduction of processing by electric are furnace.  This will give faster and more flexible production and will also open up the possibility of getting into the more lucrative side of the trade in special steels for the export market. It should be mentioned that while this expansion will give a greatly increased capacity for ingot production, the addition to the employment force will be a modest one.  The company at present employ 830 and the numbers may go up to about 1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main factor in the scheme is that the more up to date electrical process should reduce the company's unit costs of production to a more competitive <Col N="1154" /> level and thus assist the company to face the competition of free trade.  This development of the mill will, I hope, be only the first of further expansions but progress will depend on the efforts of everybody connected with the company to make it an efficient and competitive undertaking.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of the present expansion will be in the region of £3 million.  The company are proposing to finance the scheme from its own resources and from borrowing over a fairly short term.  The company at present has borrowings of £½ million guaranteed by the State.  The Bill before the House will increase to £3 million the amount of loan which may be guaranteed by the State although the loan required for the present transaction will not reach this figure.  The company have built up some resources from their profits particularly during the past three years.</P>
    <P>There are other related amendments to the Principal Act proposed in the Bill.  Section 2 (b) is to enable the State to give a guarantee where credit is got from a supplier of equipment on a deferred payment system instead of outright loan.  This amendment is in line with legislation for other State companies.  Section 3 (1) is to deal with the position in which this company's first loans were guaranteed under the State Guarantees Act, 1954, before the passing of the Irish Steel Holdings Acts, 1960 and 1963, and to bring all loans guaranteed into the one group. This will enable a single statement of guaranteed borrowings by this company to be given annually to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that the object of this Bill will commend itself to the Seanad and I recommend the Bill for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can be assured of the approval of the Seanad to the Bill.  It offers us an opportunity to congratulate Irish Steel Holdings, particularly on their progress during recent years.  As the Minister said in his introductory statement, the object of the Bill is quite simply to increase the borrowing powers of the company from £1 million to £3 million.  Of that increased borrowing facility the company <Col N="1155" /> propose, apparently, to use only a small amount.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the extra capital is one that we strongly support.  It will enable the company to introduce a new and up-to-date method of steel production which will increase capacity and lower costs.  At this stage, when we are almost of the threshold of entering the Common Market or free trade competition, it is absolutely essential that all industries&mdash;in particular the State industries&mdash;should equip themselves to face the competition of worldwide companies and manufacturers.  Every Member of the Seanad would support the view that any steps to rationalise or modernise State companies should be availed of.  Whenever any Minister finds it necessary to come to this House for the necessary finance to carry out these modernisation programmes, he can always be assured of a very warm welcome from this House.  I should also like to commend the method of financing which this particular State company are using in this instance.  It is very heartening to read of a company&mdash;and I do not wish to cast any aspersions on any State or private companies in this regard&mdash;which propose to finance these additions largely from their own resources.  Although they are getting increased borrowing powers, they do not propose to avail completely of these powers.</P>
      <P>A look at the balance sheet of Irish Steel Holdings will indicate the sound and progressive policy which the directors have pursued, particularly in recent years.  That is the reason why they are in the happy position of not having to call on the taxpayer to assist them in modernising their mill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned that, although the proposed rationalisation programme will lower costs and make the steel mill more efficient, it will not very substantially increase employment. In these days, when unfortunately we hear almost weekly of factories getting into trouble for one reason or another, an increase of 170 people is a very important addition to the labour force.  Any further additions on top of this that would follow increased export sales would, of <Col N="1156" /> course, be very welcome too.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister a few questions generally on the question of steel production in this country and perhaps he might be good enough to refer to them in his reply.  What are the sources of raw material?  Are Irish Steel Holdings completely dependent on scrap and from where do they purchase that scrap?  Is it imported or collected from home sources, or both? Has any consideration been given by the board of Irish Steel Holdings to the treatment or smelting of iron ore from abroad?  In other words, I feel in the long term, that if Irish Steel Holdings are to continue as a viable proposition in the face of European competition they will have to be organised in greater depth.  I think it is not too fanciful to suggest that at some future date they should consider the importation of ore from abroad, probably even from as far away as Australia, and the smelting of ore to provide the raw material for steel production.</P>
    <P>In this connection, it might be of interest to Senators to hear that within the last two years the Limerick Harbour Commissioners commissioned a study from an international firm of consultants in regard to the possibilities of transhipping ore from as far away as Australia.  It does become an economic proposition if the size of ships reach something like 300,000 tons.  With the huge expansion in shipping and the size of ships, I do not think we are looking too far ahead in anticipating that within the next three, four or possibly five years you will have ships big enough to carry iron ore from as far afield as Australia and to bring it into the Shannon, tranship from there, if necessary, to a smelter at Cork, or preferably in the Shannon area, and make it a viable proposition.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister what will be the position of Irish Steel Holdings when they have to face the full blast of competition from the huge steel mills in the United Kingdom and on the Continent?  Has any consideration been given by the directors to a possible merger with one of the bigger steel mills, or one of the bigger industries <Col N="1157" /> in the production of steel products, such as the consultants who were brought in to advise Irish Steel Holdings&mdash;Messrs. Guest, Keen and Nettleford&mdash;who apart from their interest in advising the development of Irish Steel, also have an interest for quite a number of years in a wire mill in Limerick, Irish Wire Products Ltd.?  Is it possible that Irish Steel Holdings could manufacture the type of steel rod which Irish Wire Products in Limerick and other wire drawing firms could use?  I have particularly in mind the large new factory which is to be established, and the construction of which is now under way, on the outskirts of Limerick to manufacture steel cord for tyres and which will be using, as the Minister I am sure is fully aware, a very substantial amount of steel wire in its production.</P>
    <P>I should like to think that the directors of Irish Steel Holdings have shown themselves to be progressive and fully alive to the changing situation in Europe and will carefully consider the organisation of their factory in greater dept, both from the point of view of raw materials and of widening their range of products.  I may be quite wrong but I do think that, unless some organisation or some development like this takes place, Irish Steel Holdings in the years ahead may find themselves in a very difficult situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the giant steel mills of the Continent and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister if any consideration has been given by the directors of Irish Steel Holdings to apply for membership of the European Coal and Steel Community when and if we enter the EEC.  Finally, a very small point&mdash;one to which perhaps other Senators may have the answer but I have not&mdash;is why is the name of the company &ldquo;Irish Steel Holdings&rdquo;? Is it possible to drop what seems to be an unnecessary word in the title?  Why could it not be &ldquo;Irish Steel&rdquo;, just simply that title without adding the word &ldquo;Holdings&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>If the Minister in his reply would touch on some of these points I have made I would be very grateful, or if he can add any further information on the future plans of Irish Steel Holdings <Col N="1158" /> I am sure this House would be very interested to hear them.  I should also like to inform the Minister of the full and warm support of my party on this Bill.  Certainly, he need not be in any way reluctant to come back again if the necessity arises for further capital to expand what is very obviously a successful Irish enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelGallanagh" hpid="Mr. Gallanagh Mr. Gallanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to ask the Minister if we could have co-operation on a particular matter. Although Irish Steel Holdings have built a bridge from Ringaskiddy into Irish Steel Holdings, the troops stationed there and the naval personnel there still have to travel by boat.  If we are to guarantee this type of money to Irish Steel Holdings, I think that the Minister should, with the Minister for Defence, press for facilities for these people to use this bridge.  I agree this bridge was built by Irish Steel Holdings without the help of the Department of Defence, but, nevertheless, I believe that the troops or naval personnel serving there should be allowed to use this bridge, the use of which has been denied to them up to now.</P>
      <P>The other point I should like to ask the Minister is if he would take steps to ensure that as little scrap iron as possible leaves the country.  It is terrible to think that we import goods here and when they become unserviceable they are allowed to go out of the country again when they could be very readily used here as scrap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome this Bill. The fact that the money for the present expansion is to be raised from the company's own resources is something we should all be very pleased about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if in his reply to this debate he would say something about the company's chances in the increased competition they will have to face in the European Economic Community.  The company have shown quite a bit of stability. Certainly, we should all welcome the fact, as the Minister and Senator Russell pointed out, that the employment is to be increased and that the plant is to be modernised.  This is tremendously important if we are to <Col N="1159" /> remain competitive in this area.  But Irish Steel Holdings, in relation to the competition it will meet in the European Economic Community, are very small beer.  The plant will be very small relative to the major steel concerns which will be providing competition to it.  Therefore, I should like the Minister to say something about the long-term prospects of a firm which have been fairly heavily protected, I think it is correct to say, bearing in mind the fact that the sale of galvanised sheeting has dropped considerably over the last few years.  Will Irish Steel Holdings be able to maintain an export market? Will they be able to maintain their position in the Irish market with increased competition and the tariff barriers coming down?  I should like the Minister to say something about the long-term prospects of the company.</P>
    <P>There is one further point, and on this I should like to support Senator Gallanagh.  Seeing that the purpose of this Bill is to increase the Government's guarantee in respect of moneys borrowed by the company from £1 million to £3 million, certainly some arrangement should be made by which the personnel living at Haulbowline should be able to use the new bridge from the island to the mainland.  The Army personnel would benefit a great deal from such an arrangement.</P>
    <P>I should also like to raise the question of the storage of scrap iron.  Scrap iron must be stored somewhere prior to its use in the company's process.  I should like to see that the company would not allow the place where the scrap iron is stored to become an eyesore. It is unpleasant to see large quantities of scrap iron which are open to the public view in such pleasant towns as Howth and in the Rushbrooke area.  It should be ensured that the storage of large quantities of scrap iron in areas which attract tourists should be done in such a way as not to attract adverse comment.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to ask the Minister what effect, if any, the proximity of the Verolme dockyard has had on the production of steel?  Is there much of a link up between the two firms?  Do Irish Steel Holdings <Col N="1160" /> produce suitable grades of steel for use in shipbuilding, since the dockyard is less than half a mile away?</P>
    <P>I should also like to have some information from the Minister on the amount of steel which is produced for the export market and what are the chances of maintaining that market in the European Economic Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators, I should like to welcome this Bill and also to congratulate Irish Steel Holdings. It is not necessary for me to speak other than briefly because the sort of questions that have occurred to me have already been put by other Senators.  The modernisation of the plant is a very welcome development in itself and also the prospect that the company may be putting themselves in a position, as the Minister has already suggested, to get into the export market. Naturally, we are all concerned about the future prospects of a company of this nature and I would be interested in hearing the Minister's reply to a number of the queries put by the other Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a small question on this Bill.  I noticed in the course of his opening remarks, when he was referring to the fact that the company were embarking on a major expansion, he mentioned that this was following a detailed study of their operations and potential by external consultants whom he named.  When the Minister referred to external consultants, in this context, am I right in thinking that he means not only consultants that are external to the company themselves but that they are also external in the sense that they are a non-Irish group of advisers?  If the answer to that is that they have not been advised in this connection by Irish consultants I want to know why should that be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that the consultants who were mentioned by the Minister are extremely good and extremely expert in their field.  But it would seem that, in the case of a wholly owned State company such as this, if Irish consultants are available they should be consulted before seeking advisers from outside.  There may be reasons <Col N="1161" /> why this should not be so.  Senator West has referred to the type of competition likely to be met with in Common Market conditions, and it may be that some expert knowledge in that particular sphere would be desirable. However, I should like to have some information from the Minister on this point.  I should like to make it clear that I am not in any way downgrading the value of advice they have got.  As I have said before, I am quite sure that the particular consultants in question are excellent and expert in every way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks just made by Senator O'Higgins have urged me to get to my feet.  The point he has made about consultants is something which we hear automatically from many critics of the use of consultancy in this country&mdash;why should we have to go outside the country for consultants? On listening to the Minister in this regard, and particularly when Irish Steel Holdings Limited are virtually the only company of this kind, it seems to be obvious that we should have to go outside the country for specialist technical advice for this sort of industry.  I would be surprised if we had a consultancy of this kind readily available in this country.</P>
      <P>What was of interest to me in listening to the Minister's speech was that the company he referred to as providing the consultancy are, as I understand it, a major steel company in Britain and that some aspects of their operations might conceivably be in competition with Irish Steel Holdings Limited inside the Common Market. Is it not a real problem if an Irish steel firm finds itself turning for consultancy to a firm in a neighbouring country which are in the same business? That is the query that comes to mind and not the patriotically intended query about the origin of the consultants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested in the questions which other Senators have raised regarding the future of Irish Steel Holdings Limited in the competition likely to emerge on our accession to the European Economic Community. On reading the reference to Irish Steel <Col N="1162" /> Holdings Limited and the European Economic Community in the Government's White Paper, I was considerably encouraged to find this point made with regard to the work of Irish Steel Holdings Limited&mdash;and I quote from the Government's White Paper <i>Membership of the European Communities</i> at page 93:</P>
    <P>Whilst economies of scale are certainly important in relation to steel production, there is growing evidence in both the USA and Europe that the smaller specialised steel plants can more readily adapt their production to take maximum advantage of variations in market conditions than the larger units.</P>
    <P>I am taking the opportunity to put that sentence on the official record because it seems to me, looking at the European Economic Community, that this is one of the things that one finds there as one finds in the United States: large operations in any field do not necessarily mean the death of the small firm.  This is an important point that our people should have at the back of their minds before they get too great an inferiority complex about the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister might enlighten me on this.  The Minister's statement says that the principal product of this firm is reinforcing iron.  If my memory serves me right, up to a few years ago this firm were not able to produce sufficient reinforcing iron to meet the demand on the home market.  Senator West wondered, and rightly so, what amount of iron this firm are exporting.  I certainly would be curious to know what is the position.  The Minister conveyed in his statement that they are producing enough to supply the home market.</P>
    <P>I think they import the iron in ordinary sheet form and it is galvanised dipped in Cork.  They produce two or three different grades of iron&mdash;26, 24 and 22 gauge.  I often wondered why they produced the 26 gauge iron.  It is galvanised iron sheet I speak of, a rather light inferior type of iron.  It does not take the galvanised dip as well as the heavier gauges.  In my opinion, it merely gives an opportunity to those people who would be anxious to criticise an Irish-produced article.  I <Col N="1163" /> should like to hear the Minister refer to this in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the House unanimously welcomed this Bill. Naturally, questions will arise, but in general the House welcomed the fact, as Senator Russell pointed out, that it is good to see a State-sponsored body being in a position to finance expansion out of their own resources.  The debate indicated general agreement with the idea of Irish Steel Holdings, Limited borrowing and going ahead with their expansion programme.</P>
      <P>Some Senators may have had doubts about this being a wise decision in view of our expected entry into the EEC. In addition, questions were raised about the advice Irish Steel Holdings received from the external consultants Messrs. Guest, Keen and Nettleford. Senator O'Higgins asked whether &ldquo;external&rdquo; meant external to the steel industry or external to the State.  The consultants are outside the State, but they are not external to the industry. The board of Irish Steel Holdings examined the consultants' proposals carefully and are satisfied that they are national proposals in view of our expected entry into EEC.  As I said, introducing this Stage, the proposals will have the effect of doubling output by improved efficiency.</P>
      <P>Senator Russell pointed out that the implementation of the consultants' recommendations would have the effect of reducing unit costs, thereby putting Irish Steel Holdings into a more competitive position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made by Senator West to the question of export. Export sales have fluctuated.  The latest report and accounts for the year ended 30th June, 1970, indicate that the export sales for 1969-70 were £691,000 as against £656,000 for 1968-69.  As against that again, the export sales during 1965-66 were £942,000.  This, on the overall, would show that in 1969-70 there was quite a falling-off in export sales by comparison with the figure for 1965-66.  Of course, home sales have been progressively increasing.  The figure is <Col N="1164" /> £4,962,000 for the home market during the last financial year for which we have accounts, 1969-70.</P>
    <P>The figures over the past few years for Irish Steel Holdings indicate that they are running their business quite intelligently and satisfactorily.  If they can raise this loan and introduce the new arc furnace and the other ancillary improvements, there is no reason why greater benefits will not accrue.  I am hopeful that Irish Steel Holdings Limited will go further and achieve even greater things.</P>
    <P>Senator West, Senator Brugha and Senator Russell referred to the company's prospects in the EEC.  Senator Keery, in reading the extract he did, put on record the appropriate answer to that.  Even in the context of a greater Europe, with mass produced steel units, the fact remains that there is room for a small, adaptable and versatile steel mill.  This is what is proposed as soon as Irish Steel Holdings Limited have carried out the operation they are proposing to undertake following the borrowing of this money.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell raised the question of the sources of raw material.  About 75 per cent to 80 per cent of the raw material used by Irish Steel Holdings Limited is scrap iron and steel which is obtainable locally.  The balance is obtained by the importation of pig iron which is used with the scrap iron.</P>
    <P>I have no information on the viability of the project Senator Russell mentions: the possibility of importing iron ore here and having it smelted.  He made the point that it could be imported economically from Australia in huge carriers and smelted here.  I have no information on that aspect.  I do not know what proportion of the iron ore would be usable.  I imagine that the shipping costs of such large quantities might be prohibitive.  On the other hand, Senator Russell said he had studied figures and that it could be economic.  At the present time there is no proposal to smelt iron ore.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell also mentioned the possibility of Irish Steel Holdings Limited merging with some outside steel producer from the point of view of competing in free trade conditions. As I said earlier there is no proposal of that nature being considered at the <Col N="1165" /> present time.  However, it would be wrong of me to suggest that it is not extremely necessary that this be done from the point of view of protection. There is room for a small versatile steel mill.  Irish Steel Holdings Limited, having examined the position in the light of and expected entry into the EEC and into the Coal and Steel Community, are satisfied that they can become an economic unit within that Community following the proposed expansion which they intend to undertake.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallanagh and Senator West asked that Army personnel have access to the bridge built by the company. I have no up-to-date information on this.  However, since becoming Minister for Industry and Commerce, I inspected a guard of honour of naval personnel there and I did not realise they had to swim across to Irish Steel Holdings. If there is a problem in this regard I assure the House I will have it looked at to see if anything can be done. It would strike me as rather peculiar if Army personnel could not use the bridge and I will certainly have a look at it.</P>
    <P>Senator West also spoke about a pile up of scrap iron in the Haulbowline area.  Naturally, there must be a build up of scrap around the plant itself.  Perhaps I have not got an eye for beauty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I referred to companies supplying the home market with certain types of drawn wire, companies such as Irish Wire Products.

      <P>I think Senator West raised the point that Irish Steel do not produce suitable steel for the shipbuilding industry across the harbour.  Irish Steel have not the capacity to produce steel cord for radial tyres, which was also referred to.  Up to now there had not been a market for this, but the development of this industry in the Limerick area opens a side of the business that Irish Steel would be interested in.  Any Minister for Industry and Commerce coming to the Seanad seeking a broadening of credit facilities for a project of this nature would be welcomed.  I know that, if I found it necessary to come back to the House seeking a further expansion in guaranteed credit facilities to put Irish Steel Holdings in the position to produce the radial wire for those tyres, the House would be in agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister a question in regard to this section? I am not quite clear from reading the Minister's speeches in the Dáil as to the number of licences that will be in effect after this Bill becomes law. When the Minister spoke in the Dáil on this section he referred to 850 and 900 licences.  During his introductory speech here in this House he mentioned 840 licences.  I am just wondering which is the correct figure.  Could the Minister indicate how many vehicles will be attached to each licence when this Bill is passed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I also ask the Minister if there <Col N="1168" /> is any limit to the size of vehicle which an operator may now employ?  If he has a licence to use two trucks, can they be two 40 ton trucks or two trucks and trailers 50 feet in length? Can he go on, so long as the roads stand up to these gargantuan trucks, adding to the size, but not the number of his fleet?  Could the Minister say in regard to the 100 Twenty-six County licences, which apparently have been in force since 1933, if they are still in force as the same licences, but with changed ownerships in a large number of cases?</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on those points: (1) the number of licences; (2) how many vehicles will be attached to each licence; (3) is there no limitation in size?  I speak of size having regard to the wear and tear on the roads.  There seems to be no reference to roads anywhere in this Bill.  It will cost the local authorities concerned quite a substantial amount of money to have 850 licences with no limit regarding the size of the vehicles which may be employed by the operators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>To be precise, the professional road haulage industry as it now stands consists of CIE with 860 vehicles unrestricted as to size or area.  Then there are 840 professional hauliers with various restrictions as to area, ranging from a limited number of miles, from one county to 26 counties. We have 840 professional hauliers with varying types of licences, as to area, as to commodity and as to weight.  Of that 840, 700 are restricted to only one vehicle and not more than 20 can operate three vehicles or more.  Again, of that 840, only 100 are licensed to carry throughout the State.  In regard to this 100 who are getting no advantage under the Bill but who have, in many cases, purchased a business and paid a price for the particular licence they have, I have decided, in equity, to bring in the amendment which I brought into the Dáil to give a concession to them of an extra vehicle in addition to the vehicles to which they were entitled on the 1st January, 1969. <Col N="1169" /> The situation which will exist after this Bill becomes law is that we will have 840 private enterprise hauliers who will have a right to carry throughout the Twenty-six Counties without any restriction as to area, commodity, or weight.  They will all operate on a uniform licence.  Of these 840, 100 will be entitled to an extra vehicle which will add another 100 vehicles to the total private enterprise fleet.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Russell that this will undoubtedly mean more road transport activity in the private enterprise field.  I hope that there will be no diminution, either, in road transport in the public enterprise field and that the combined effect of the increased competition within the private enterprise sector and between the private enterprise sector and the public enterprise sector will be to reduce the own account haulage figure of 81 per cent, which is the main purpose of this legislation&mdash;to rid ourselves of a situation where we have under-utilised vehicles operated by private enterprise, by business people, who have been forced into the situation of having to purchase their own trucks and vehicles, forced into that situation by reason of the restrictive nature of the service that has heretofore been offered.  In Britain it is 30 per cent below that&mdash;it is in the region of 51 per cent; ours is in the region of 81 per cent own account haulage; on the Continent it is lower again than the British figure.  In America it is far lower still.</P>
      <P>In other words, we have here far too high a proportion of our trucking purchased by people in business who, in many cases, can ill afford the purchase and ill afford the capital commitment. There is, therefore, under-utilised vehicle plant.  We should have more road transport hauliers in the private and public sectors competing against one another and providing a competitive and efficient service for business. Thereby business will tend more and more to hire the professional haulier and less and less to engage in wasteful capital expenditure on its own account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In broad outline, that is the thinking behind the Bill which is very important long-term thinking.  I regard that aspect as of more importance than the complete <Col N="1170" /> liberalisation that is involved in regard to cattle, sheep and pigs.  It is more important to build up a professional haulage industry here.  As it happens, the public sector and the private sector will be roughly of the same vehicular strength.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to another point raised by Senator Russell and that is the question of the weight restrictions. This is a matter for the Minister for Local Government.  He has ample power already under the Road Traffic Acts, as distinct from the Road Transport Acts.  The Road Transport Acts are my responsibility, the Road Traffic Acts &mdash;the safety of vehicles on the roads and road safety generally&mdash;are his responsibility. Under the road traffic code he has power already to restrict, curtail or contain in any way the size of vehicles or the safety operations involved in the driving or management of vehicles.  That lies with him and he can, by order, do this in any way that he may wish from the point of view of benefit to the community.  The Minister for Local Government also has responsibility, which will be required in view of this development, for improving the whole highway system.  That is separate from what is involved here, although very closely related to it.</P>

      <P>Section 2 deals with the amendment of section 9 of the Road Transport Act, 1933.  The holders of merchandise licences under that Act were confined to certain counties.  The Minister indicated to us that there were approximately 100 holders of merchandise licences who could operate throughout the State. More than 700 were limited to certain areas and, as I see it, this particular section is just dealing with areas and we shall be dealing with weights under sections 3 or 4.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is completely gone.  There may be cases that arise in regard to specific provisions that were brought in under subsequent legislation for remote areas like Achill Island and Valentia Island.  There <Col N="1171" /> were particular limited licences&mdash;not &ldquo;existing carrier&rdquo; licences under the 1933 Act&mdash;brought in to cover the case of these people.  There were also licences brought in for the transportation of newspapers under legislation in 1944.</P>
      <P>What is envisaged here is that all the carrier licences that were set up, and they were of an infinite variety within the overall total of 840, will now have all limitation removed in regard to miles, counties and areas. This will also apply to limitations in regard to commodities.  Some licences at that time applied to certain commodities only.  There were, therefore, variations ranging from ten miles to 150 miles, from one county to 26 counties, from limited commodities to other commodities, from four tons to six tons to eight tons.  All these restrictions are gone and there will be 840 uniform licences of a common category.  That is the proposal in the Bill.  It is the nub of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The only people who do not get any benefit are the existing Twenty-six County hauliers. All the other hauliers who have been limited over the years in regard to area, distance, commodity, weight, are now getting a bonus, as it were, under the Bill.  It is not designed to benefit them: it is designed to benefit the public and to encourage competition, but they are all getting something that they had not got before.  For instance, a haulier confined to County Leitrim who now gets a Twenty-six County licence is obviously benefiting under the Bill, and that, in turn, will benefit the whole community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only category in the private sector who did not benefit under the Bill were the present Twenty-six County people, of whom there are 100.  They made representations to me through their associations.  There were amendments put down in the Dáil by Deputies from all sides of the House <Col N="1172" /> and representations were made to me by Deputies and Senators from all sides of the House that it was inequitable that these people, who were the leading investment people in the industry, those who put most money into it and who are the most professional&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They are the only people who are not getting anything at all out of the Bill.  Therefore, I decided as a concession to them, and in answer to the various representations made, that they should get an extra vehicle in addition to the number of vehicles they were entitled to have on their licence on 1st January, 1969.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Senator Reynolds' view is that I should go even further in liberalisation than I have gone.  The important liberalisation is that there are 840 less 100, that is 740, carriers with various limitations on their licences.  These particular licensees will now be able to haul throughout the whole country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, on the cattle, sheep and pigs side but not so much on the general merchandise side.  Well, to some extent, they were.  We will have a situation now, if it is wide open <Col N="1173" /> over the whole country for 840 of them, that there will be amalgamations and mergers and get-togethers and more efficient firms operating with a number of vehicles at their disposal and available to business generally.  I think it will lead to a competitive situation.  It will lead to the growth of small and medium size firms engaged professionally in the haulage business.  What will very likely take place here over the next few years is an amalgamation of a number of these licenses into a number of firms.  You could have nine or ten licensees coming together now into one firm and that would be a professional, highly organised, efficient type of firm that would have nine or ten trucks and be able to give a very real service to a whole region.</P>
      <P>That type of development I would see happening because there is going to be a far freer market now in these licences than there was heretofore. Heretofore one was confined to a particular centre and there were the various restrictions and limitations.  I have mentioned.  Now if it is on a State-wide basis there will be a far freer market in the sale and purchase of these licences and we will have people who really know their business going into the purchase of licences and building up an efficient fleet of an economic and viable size.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking at the section from the agricultural point of view I quite appreciate the fact that in subsection (5) the Minister has taken restrictions off cattle, sheep and pigs &mdash;mainly I suppose because it would be difficult to control them.  Since the Minister has allowed the free haulage of cattle, sheep and pigs a greater case can be made for seasonal agricultural produce.  I am thinking of cereals and <Col N="1174" /> beet.  For instance, under this section two brothers who might perhaps buy either a lorry or a tractor between them would not be able to transport their own beet crop to the factory. This is a pity.  We talk about becoming more competitive and becoming more efficient and we pay a great amount of lip service to co-operation and expanding the co-operative system; yet it is not possible for two brothers to buy a lorry between them and each of them transport his own beet under two separate contracts to the sugar factory.</P>
      <P>This is surely something that should be rectified.  I would like to see the Minister including in subsection (5) agricultural produce, especially the produce that is seasonal.  The beet season lasts about four or five weeks. I would like to make a case for the people who are providing their own lorries.  The same applies to cereals. This is not the type of haulage that contractors want because there is a lot of heavy work attached to it.  Again, the season lasts only a month or a little more in the spring.  The harvest, with so many combines and machinery now in existence, was completed, I think, last year in four or five weeks. It is not really an economic proposition for people in the haulage trade to specially equip themselves for this type of work.  Therefore, what we in the agricultural industry would like to see is farmers co-operating with each other and providing themselves with a truck or a trailer for this purpose.  Under the Bill, a farmer can only take in his own produce: he cannot take in his neighbour's or his brother's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have in the past promoted co-operation.  I should like to quote the example of the scheme for the combined purchasing of forage harvesters. This is a piece of machinery that is used for only a few weeks in the summer.  It is quite expensive and the Department introduced a scheme some two or three years ago whereby a grant would be available towards the purchase of this machine provided three or four farmers co-operated in buying it, so that greater use would be made of it.  The same should apply here for bulk grain haulage.  A special <Col N="1175" /> body on a trailer is required.  We have not sufficient farmers in the country who can afford or should be asked to equip themselves with this bulk grain haulage trailer.  Therefore if two or more farmers should pool their resources and purchase this machine they should be allowed to use it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has granted a concession in regard to cattle, sheep and pigs but the haulage of cattle, sheep and pigs goes on non-stop the whole year. Yet for the agricultural produce that is only seasonal&mdash;and very short seasons at that&mdash;it is impossible for people to haul their own.  I would ask the Minister to have a second look at this and if possible to lift the restriction on the haulage of both cereals and sugar beet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator McDonald on this.  I realise the Minister is in a difficult position because he is making special regulations for one section of the market and is excluding another section of the market. The particular instance in subsection (5) is that cattle, sheep and pigs are included and other commodities, parts of the agricultural produce market, are omitted.  I should like him to answer the points raised by Senator McDonald as to why he is restricting this subsection to cattle, sheep and pigs.  What are the arguments against such produce as cereals and beet?  I come from an agricultural part of the country, too, and I have had a good deal of connection with the production of cereals.  I know that, as the Minister said, the problem of illegal haulage has increased considerably and it would be difficult to reverse the trend. In the cereal business the transfers of plates and cereals being delivered outside their area by non-plated lorries were certainly rife recently, and I should like to see something being done to regularise this situation.  Why is subsection (5) restricted to cattle, sheep and pigs?  What is the case against widening it to include cereals, sugar beet, poultry and other agricultural products?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do not want to take anything from what <Col N="1176" /> Senator McDonald or Senator West have said because I come from an agricultural part of the country, too, but unfortunately the land does not allow us to produce much cereal.</P>
      <P>The Minister said earlier that when this Bill becomes law he feels that a number of private hauliers will amalgamate. I could not agree more with him, but he is only thinking of places such as Dublin, Cork or Limerick.  He cannot see them amalgamating in his own county, or the county I live in, because they are just not there.  That area will not benefit in any way from the Bill. If the Minister would consider having another look at it and leave the transport of all merchandise open, or confined in some given areas, it probably might meet my idea on it.  I fully agree with the Minister that there will be amalgamations in the areas that I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the last point first, at present one of the restrictions is that the licensee must operate from a certain centre and is limited again to area, weight and commodity. If every licence is the same and if there is no area or centre it means that a man in Roscommon, Galway or Leitrim can purchase one or two licences, as he wishes, in any part of the country and so can establish a business wherever he wishes, so that there will be complete freedom of location or establishment in regard to establishing a road freight business or adding to the strength of a particular fleet that a licensee may have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the extension of agricultural commodities, I am against this for the very reasons I mentioned earlier on.  I do not want to encourage farmers to start buying trucks and going into own account haulage and again under-utilising their plant capacity.  There is too much of that already in regard to agricultural machinery.  If this is encouraged in regard to trucks there would be no end to the amount of wasteful investment we would have. There is a particular case in regard to cattle, sheep and pigs in that these are live commodities and involve an uncertain type of trade&mdash;24-hours a day haulage&mdash;which is now being carried <Col N="1177" /> on to a very large extent by an illegal haulage trade.  What we are proposing to do is to legalise a reality&mdash;a reality which arises from the live nature of the particular goods that are involved, and the very nature of the whole trade which involves calling to farmers' houses or their land at all times of the day or night and making immediate man-to-man contact and man-to-man arrangements.  In that sort of situation this was obviously not a field suited to any sort of organised transportation. That is why the logic of events has driven me to see the reality here, with which I was well aware myself coming from a rural constituency, and the reality is incorporated in this legislation.</P>
    <P>The same does not apply at all to beet.  Beet is a highly organised transportation campaign in which both CIE and private hauliers provide a very efficient service.  This has been acknowledged to me by beet growers and by everybody concerned in the industry. This is a specific service needed at a particular time and both CIE and the private haulage interests have themselves highly organised for it.  I do not see a case for that business being taken away from them and handed over to unlicensed people.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a balance, a balance that takes cognisance of rights and equities that reside with various people.  There are workers in CIE who are concerned with an arm of CIE that is making money, and they contribute to the making of a profit by CIE on the road freight side. Similarly there are licensed hauliers who have purchased businesses and who are operating these businesses efficiently.  As long as they are doing the job well we should let them continue to do so.  I am satisfied that outside cattle, sheep and pigs&mdash;where they were not able to do the job well, by reason of the very nature of the particular trade and where the existing legislation is being flouted&mdash;in regard to other agricultural commodities, I am satisfied that existing legislation deals with the matter adequately.  I should say that, apart from cattle, sheep and pigs, turf, creamery milk and, substantially, wheat are already exempted <Col N="1178" /> anyway from the Road Transport Acts.  There is decontrol in regard to these commodities so that what we are talking about now is, first of all, beet, which as I have said calls for a very specialised type of campaign, highly organised, and which is being dealt with adequately by the existing transport organisations.  Then there are various cereals but again where does one stop here?  If cereals are all right then why not fertilisers, or materials for building farmhouses? There is no end to the complications that could arise in regard to this matter and I do not think it is worth it.  The only substantial trade outside cattle, sheep, pigs, wheat and creamery milk, which are virtually exempted, is beet. Beet, to my information, is being dealt with adequately so that I do not see the justification for extending the Bill on any selective basis towards agricultural products that do not count as regards business in any event and for which there is no real demand.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is being a little bit inconsistent.  While he is allowing farmers to equip themselves with lorries he is not allowing them to carry all their own produce.  I should like to impress on the Minister that the modern haulier is now more and more putting a 30 or 54 foot body on his truck.  It is not much use to me, if I order a few barrels of seed barley, or seed wheat, and find it can come only to within a mile of the farm and I then have to collect it because it cannot negotiate country roads.  While the point I was making was for the co-operatively owned lorries most farmers will provide themselves with lorries for the carriage of their own produce in the line of animals.  In my part of the country it is quite common to see two or more farmers getting together and equipping themselves with a lorry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Still, you are not letting out two fellows who own a truck between them.  I am not asking for the complete exemption of these.  I only want it in a case where there is co-operative ownership.  I am instancing a case where two brothers buy a lorry between them but their beet contracts will be two separate contracts and therefore the man sitting in the cab cannot say: &ldquo;This is my beet&rdquo; if it is going in under the other brother's contract. He is certainly caught.  In regard to cereals, the Minister did say that wheat is exempt.  For barley and wheat there is a short harvest period and also they are very perishable commodities. The animals are not perishable commodities. In a bad harvest, and we are due one now at any time, a day or two of a delay can put a man's wheat into the unmillable class.  That is a sizeable financial loss to a farmer. There are very few lorries available. Even in a good year we have had the experience of having to wait two or three weeks with the corn in a field waiting to be collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The least the Minister can do is allow CIE to treat these seasonal hauliers a little more liberally, give them a temporary licence to cover cereals for, say, a flat rate of £5.00 rather than the present 10 per cent which leads people to make false returns.  With the cost of maintaining a truck on the road, especially for these poor men who would be doing this jobbing type of work, the tax licence is all they should be required to pay. I would ask CIE, through the Minister, to be more liberal in spring and autumn, especially with regard to <Col N="1180" /> cereals, and provide seasonal licences to cover these commodities for, say, £5.00.  It is too much to ask the farmers to suffer and take the chance of having their wheat declared unmillable because transport is not readily available to deliver it immediately to the mill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another serious point here to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention. On the preparation of this Bill did he ever consider why so many private people purchased their own lorries after the introduction of certain Acts here over the past number of years? It was because they were compelled to do so because of the high rates being charged by CIE and the private haulier.  Now we are moving back again into square one.  What protection has the private individual from these extra 100 plates that the Minister is going to issue now?  You may say that competition is the answer but I do not think it is the full answer.  I believe that prices will soar again.  I cannot go the whole hog with Senator McDonald because certainly if there were two brothers in my county who owned a lorry between them they would transport their own goods and I should like to see anybody from the Department of Justice catching them out.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister clear up a point?  If a lorry is privately owned and if the produce is not carried for reward it surely does not come under the scope of the Bill?  The point that Senator McDonald raised, about two brothers owning a lorry and having two different beet contracts, does not really arise because unless one brother is paying the other for transporting one load of beet, and <i>vice versa</i> for the other load of beet, which is unlikely, they would not be operating illegally. Wheat, surely, is also exempt under <Col N="1181" /> the Bill so the regulations do not apply to the carriage of wheat.  I would like to ask the Minister if wheat is exempt why not barley?  He said that the other cereals were insignificant in comparison.  If the barley carried is so insignificant in comparison to wheat, as he says, it may be because Messrs.  Guinness, for example, for whom most of the barley is grown, or a great proportion of it, provide a very efficient service.  I know Guinness's do have a number of their own lorries and a large number of tankers and do a lot of the haulage.  Could the Minister tell us how insignificant the barley trade is in comparison with the wheat trade?</P>

Seriously, there is not much reality in this agricultural business.  Farmers will continue to oblige their neighbours, their cousins and so on, but there was a wholesale cross-country trade in regard to cattle, sheep and pigs. This was big business from fair to fair, from mart to mart, and it was being flagrantly breached, and rightly breached in my view.  That is why this section is in the Bill, because the existing CIE and private haulier organisations were not able to cope with this type of trade and we are making a legality out of a reality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I completely agree. As Senator Reynolds said, many merchants would not go to the expense of purchasing trucks to carry their own goods if they could get a competitive low-cost service from a professional operator.  There is no doubt about that and I think the Minister would accept that.  I do not know what the total number of merchant trucks in the country is.  In 1964 there were 44,000.  There must be 60,000 now at a guess and that is only an increase of one-third over six years.  There must be somewhere between 50,000 and 60,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>So there has been very little change.  If the Minister hopes to encourage merchants, traders, factories and such people to give up the carriage of their own goods and employ professional hauliers, how does he expect that 1,200 vehicles are going to make any inroads into the amount of goods carried by 45,000?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same number of trucks.  The point I should like to make is this.  If there is going to be a swing away from the carriage on own account to carriage by professional operators, either individually or as the Minister visualises in larger professional groups, which I hope will come, you are going to have to make provision at an early date to increase the number of vehicles attached to these 850 licences.  I would again refer to Senator Reynold's point: the Minister may have to issue new licences in areas or counties where there is not a sufficient number of licences at the moment.  The Minister's own county was mentioned and so was Leitrim. For all I know there may be no licensed carriers in the whole of Leitrim or there may not be a sufficient number of carriers.  How are they going to take on the business of merchants who want to give up carrying on their own account if there are no licensed trucks to take over that business? People will not be able to buy licences just now.  The value of these licences will jump the minute this Bill is passed and no professional operator worthy of the name is going to sell his licence at anything but an astronomical figure.  The transfer of licences by purchase is going to be very small. The transfer of business to the professional operator will come about reasonably quickly and effectively. Within a very short space of time the Minister will have to come back to the Seanad with an amendment to this Bill.  That is my view.  The tonnage involved in the carriage of own account goods is so enormous that any substantial transfer to professional operators could not be effected without some increase in the number of vehicles owned by licensed operators. I want to make that point because this is going to be one fallacy in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Senator Russell asked the question: &ldquo;Did the Minister just envisage 100 more trucks coming on the roads as a result of the passing of this Bill?&rdquo;  In other words, the compensation for the 100 people who have Twenty-six County merchandise plates.  It is rather difficult to follow <Col N="1185" /> this point.  The Minister when introducing this Bill in the Seanad said, in Volume 69, No. 12, at column 1093 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>Most licensed hauliers are now operating the size of lorry which suits them best and the relaxation provided for in this Bill goes little beyond recognising the existing position. Instead, therefore, of being confined to the standard lorry weight prescribed by their licences, as modified by existing concessions, hauliers will be free under the Bill to use the size of lorry best suited to their business but they will be limited to the number of lorries which they had in operation or were entitled to have in operation on the 1st January, 1969.</P>
      <P>If a person has a licence for a lorry at present&mdash;he just has one lorry of say ten-ton carrying capacity&mdash;is there anything in this Bill to prohibit that man, if he decides that he would be better employed by the county council with a tipper truck, changing to two-five-ton trucks and putting them on the road? This is not very likely to happen but is there anything in the Bill to prevent it from happening?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is going.  I agree with the general view advanced by Senators Reynolds and Russell in regard to future developments in this field.  This is a first step towards liberalisation. I said in my Second Stage speech that I only regarded it as a <Col N="1186" /> first step.  It is a big change from what has been the policy since 1933 and I feel it should be tackled in stages.</P>
      <P>Now we will have 2,000 trucks&mdash; between CIE and the private sector&mdash; in the professional haulage business. There will be roughly 1,200 vehicles, of unlimited size, in the private enterprise sector and 800-odd on the CIE side.  The total own-account figure is 40,000 taking the 1969 figures.  You will have a substantial injection of professional haulage capacity in the existing vehicle area.  One point that will meet the point of view expressed that areas might be neglected is the fact that there will be complete freedom in regard to location of licences.  In other words, a licence in Skibbereen, which was heretofore confined to an area within 20 miles of Skibbereen, can now be bought by a man in Carrick-on-Shannon and operated on a Twenty-six County basis.</P>
      <P>Contrary to the point of view expressed by Senator Russell, my reading of what will happen here is that the freedom of exchange, in regard to licences, is going to bring a diminution in the value of licences.  This viewpoint has already been very forcibly expressed to me by the people in the licensed carrier business&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;particularly by people with Twenty-six County licences.  They were in a scarcity market with 100-odd Twenty-six County licences and various other licences going down from the Twenty-six County licences to one-county licences, and diminishing in value as they went down.  Now we will have every one of the 840 licences brought up to the same level and we will have competition. Eight hundred and forty licences in the Twenty-six Counties, with 1,200 trucks involved, is quite a competitive situation. My reading of the matter is that we are going to cut the value of these licences substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Conversely, what about the 740 that go from, say, one county to 26 counties.  Will their value go up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1187" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Their value would go up if they were in a scarcity situation, but they are not in a scarcity situation now.  There was a scarcity situation when only 100 of them had this high value in the Twenty-six Counties.  Now you are going to have 840 of them carrying the same rights so that you dilute the monopoly or scarcity situation that tended to exist. This, in my view, will lead to increased competition in the buying and selling of these licences and this is all to the good.</P>
      <P>However, I do agree with the overall principle involved.  This is just a stage and we are moving towards an era of greater liberalisation in this field.  This is what is happening in Britain, the Common Market and throughout the world.  The areas of distribution and transportation are tending to become more and more competitive.  It is vital so far as we are concerned in regard to our exports that that competitive situation be maintained.  Our policy must aim towards securing greater competition in this field in order that goods can be transported as efficiently as possible and at minimum cost so that internally, so far as home consumption is concerned, and externally, as far as our exports are concerned, we can deliver our goods from destination A to destination B as efficiently as possible.  We may have to go much further than we do in this Bill in the very near future. I suggest that we take this as a first stage in liberalisation, see how it works, learn from the lessons and come back in two or three years time with further legislation in the light of how developments arise under this first process of liberalisation.</P>

      <P>Could I raise a different topic under this section, namely, the power of the Minister to grant licences? I am seeking information as well as making a comment in that my interest in road haulage is limited and is largely confined to safety aspects which affect me as a road user.  It would be helpful if the Minister would outline his powers in granting licences.  The conditions which he may impose, and so on.  I understand that these conditions are mainly concerned with matters like <Col N="1188" /> hours and conditions of work.  Here the Minister has a power which is relevant to the safety issue in that a driver who is working reasonable hours and under good working conditions is more likely to be a safe driver than a driver who is working long hours under unsatisfactory conditions.  When other Senators made some of these points the Minister quite rightly said that road traffic issues and safety issues are, in general, the responsibility of another Minister and are covered by road traffic legislation.</P>
      <P>Where traffic is concerned, road traffic legislation really only steps in to safeguard the community and set an example after a disaster has occurred. It is only when somebody is run over by a lorry that the defects in that lorry are discovered and there is a prosecution for having a defective vehicle.  I do not know if the Minister has powers in this regard, or if, as he mentioned, he will take a look at the transport situation for future years.  If it is a worthwhile suggestion I should like to ask the Minister to consider the possibility of building into licences conditions which would mean that minimum standards of maintenance and safety precautions would attach to the vehicles of licensed hauliers.</P>
      <P>I can give an example of this.  Under road traffic legislation there are moves to ensure that lorries will have illuminated signs on the sides and back. There are still quite a number of lorries and trucks which have not got this type of safeguard.  It would be a reasonable support if the Minister for Transport and Power, when issuing a licence, only issued it on condition that all the vehicles involved fulfilled the requirements of the existing traffic legislation and had the appropriate markings.  This would be an additional sanction on road hauliers from a safety point of view.  Apart from having to deal with the road traffic aspect of legislation they would also find that there business or their licence might be affected if they did not comply with recognised safety conditions.</P>

      <P>To meet Senator Keery's point, first of all I have the power of revoking a merchandise licence if conditions are not complied <Col N="1189" /> with.  There is also an annual renewal of the licence and under this licence it is made obligatory on the licensee to comply with every lawful order and regulation made in respect of mechanically propelled vehicles or traffic.  Any regulations made by the Minister for Local Government, by the Commissioner of the Garda or, by the Minister for Labour in regard to the safety of employees must all be complied with by the licensee.  Under the Common Market transport policy there will be full coverage of all of these matters relating to safety both of vehicles and employees.  A code is being drafted in regard to employees who have to undertake long journeys.  If the conditions are not observed the licence can be revoked at the annual renewal.</P>

      <P>Now that the Minister is giving a certain amount of scope to the haulage contractors, I wonder if he will ease the restrictions on the more progressive hauliers who wish to <Col N="1190" /> engage in continental traffic, that is taking some of our exports from door to door <i>via</i> the car ferry?  I understand there are some restrictions on hauliers here importing the continental type lorries.  When passing the chilling factory in Kildare I have noticed that quite a number of the big lorries taking on meat appear to be foreign. There must be some restriction which is preventing our hauliers, whether they are CIE or more progressive private concerns, from doing this type of export trade.  We should give assistance to the haulage business in tackling this trade and enable them to take our produce to wherever there is a market.  The hauliers have to pay a huge tax and insurance and they should get some concession, perhaps by way of a rebate on the diesel oil.  It would help to keep prices and transport costs down if the licensed hauliers could get some such rebate or if the tax on the fuel was not so high as at present.</P>

      <P>I should like to clarify a point on section 8.  The Minister may by order under subsection (1) (a) grant a restricted licence to a person authorising him to import a vehicle and to use it for the purposes of merchandise road transport.  To which category of person exactly do you intend under this subsection to grant licences? Obviously, it is intended to cover people bringing in trucks on the ferries. To which other category of persons, if any, does the Minister intend to grant licences?  The persons specified under this subsection will be foreign nationals?  It will not apply to vehicles from the Republic of Ireland but will specifically apply to vehicles coming in from outside.  There is another point in paragraph (b) which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1194" /> A vehicle in respect of which a restricted road freight licence has been granted shall be used when laden only if carrying merchandise which has been or is intended to be imported or exported in or on the vehicle.</P>
    <P>It could happen that merchandise which was intended to be imported or exported was being transported between two points inside the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is Senator Fitzgerald's point and what we want to exclude, point to point transportation within the State.  We want to allow this type of concession only where there is transportation directly from a point outside the State to a point inside the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but surely this will require some alteration, because there is nothing about sending the vehicle back to a destination outside the State.  All it says is that merchandise can be carried which has been or is intended to be imported or exported, but that does not prevent the carriage of such merchandise between points in this State.  Such a large volume of merchandise would come under this heading of merchandise which has been or is intended to be, imported or exported, or was in the process of travel between two points inside the State, that if you want to exclude the type of traffic Senator Fitzgerald referred to, you have to amend this subsection.  There is nothing about vehicles having to take it from a point here to a point outside the Republic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I still do not quite see the Minister's point that this is to deal with a breakdown situation. The only breakdown that I can see it effecting would be if an Irish lorry broke down when this other one was passing and that the load was lifted.  Surely if the international one breaks down there is no necessity to have this intention put in at all because the remainder of the journey could be done by an Irish lorry which would be legally entitled to do it anyway.  I still <Col N="1196" /> do not see the force of what is intended.</P>

      <P>I raised some points on Second Stage and I said that I would ask the Minister for more information at this Stage in connection with the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee and the Strabane and Letter-kenny Railway Company.  I wanted information, specifically, on the present extent of services which CIE will now be undertaking.  Senator Gallanagh, as a Donegal man, also spoke on this.  We wanted, at least, a verbal assurance from the Minister that this would not be the opportunity for reducing what are, in my small experience of County Donegal, very important services.  The areas covered are quite large.  The people in general are not members of the high income group and the onus of maintaining the present level of services is very important. I should like to ask the Minister what is the extent of the present services&mdash;bus services and road freight services&mdash;and if he intends to maintain them.  He has already made statements about maintaining the personnel but I wish at this Stage to ask about these services.</P>

      <P>I can assure Senator West that the services that have existed heretofore will be maintained by CIE.  These services have been maintained by CIE since 1966 when the agreement was made.  This legislation is primarily designed to <Col N="1199" /> legitimise an agreement that was made some years ago, and which is attached to the Schedule.  This agreement was made on 31st May, 1967, between the British Railway Board and CIE although CIE had, in fact, taken over management of the undertaking since 1966.  The scheduled passenger services which had been operating daily under the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee between Strabane and Letter-kenny, Strabane and Ballybofey, Killybegs and Donegal, Donegal and Ballybofey and Strabane and Killybegs are being run at the moment by CIE.  This has been the position since 1966.  There are additional services which have always been operated by CIE.  Apart from the obligations they have taken over from the County Donegal Railway Joint Committee CIE also operated road passenger services on the Killybegs-Ballybofey route <i>via</i> Donegal.</P>
      <P>Special school services are also operated.  Passenger services are operated by the Joint Committee between all the centres of population in the southern part of County Donegal, as are road freight services. The Bill will give a legal stamp to the future operation of these services by CIE.  The territory under the old County Donegal Railways Joint Committee can be roughly defined as north of Ballyshannon and south of the line from Derry city to Dungloe on the west coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from its scheduled mail and freight services, special trunk or nonstop road freight services are operated daily by the Joint Committee from the principal towns in this territory to and from Derry and Sligo.  There is also a direct service between Sligo and Derry. The committee also operate general haulage services to all points of its area.  The mileage operated in 1970 by the old CDR road transport fleet, which at 31st December, 1970, comprised 40 lorries, vans and tractors as well as trailers and containers, exceeded 1 million miles.  The transition has taken place and the full road passenger and road freight services which were formerly operated by the <Col N="1200" /> Committee are now being operated by CIE.  There is no difficulty anticipated in maintaining that service.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to hear the Minister giving an assurance that there will be no restriction in the services here.  The first indications of the CIE takeover would show that they plan to restrict the services here.  I am delighted to have the Minister's assurance that there will be no restrictions in the service.  I will instance a case where we had a service between Letterkenny, Lifford and Strabane <i>via</i> Raphoe but already there is a restriction and a cut down of road transport service here.  I have had occasion to write complaining about this but I have got very little satisfaction.  The answer I received was that it was done for economy reasons.  Therefore I am glad to have the Minister's assurance.</P>
      <P>The proposed takeover by CIE has been a great cause for concern in Donegal.  CIE may express the best of intentions.  However, the remote areas of the county were looked after very well by the County Donegal Railway Joint Committee, both in road transport and freight transport.  We fear that CIE will not give such an efficient service for the county.  There is no special welcome for CIE in Donegal.  We had a very effective transport company operating there.  It was a company that was closely in touch with the community using that transport system. CIE's operations in Donegal are administered from Galway and any difficulties or complaints must be communicated to Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to have the Minister's assurance that there will be no cut down.  The Minister said that this is a logical development, that it was very satisfactory to be able to record that CIE are taking over a very efficient and profitable unit and that he hopes <Col N="1201" /> this position will continue.  That is a summary of our hopes and wishes in County Donegal also.  Apart from that, our main concern will be for the staff because we have fears that there could be redundancy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a point which I made several times before here on Bills which deal with CIE.  I realise there may be difficulties with section 9.  I should like to ask the Minister, first, what are the obligations on the Joint Committee by statute?  While asking this question, I feel we have always to look at our State transport system from more than one point of view.  The onus is on the company and, therefore, indirectly on the Government.  It is up to Members of the Oireachtas to ensure that this onus is being fulfilled and that the company are fulfilling their obligations in providing a service to the public. We must be especially careful that the less economic sections of the company's operation are not sacrificed when they provide an important service. Although, as has been pointed out, the County Donegal company are making a profit at the moment, it may soon happen&mdash;I hope it will not&mdash;that the profit will diminish and that we may be faced with a position in which the service is uneconomic&mdash;but the number of people using it will still be large enough to justify the company providing this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would never look askance at the Minister if he came, in certain circumstances, and asked for money specifically <Col N="1202" /> for certain aspects of the operation or explained to us that the company were running certain services at a loss because they were of social benefit to the community.  I imagine it could easily happen in County Donegal that this would be the case in a certain number of years.  However, it is absolutely essential that we provide these services and that they be subsidised by the more profitable parts of the company's operation in Dublin city, for example, or in other parts of the company's working where a good profit can be made.  If necessary, if the money cannot come from there, it must come from central funds.  It is something we have to bear in mind when we are thinking of our transport company: that there are parts of the company which must be serviced but which will not show a profit.  They may show a loss but the service must be kept to provide facilities for people who may not have very much money and who may be unable to pay for private transport.  I should like to ask the Minister, therefore, what are the obligations imposed by statute on the Joint Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the obligation that was imposed on all railway companies under section 9 of the Railways Act, 1933.  Under section 9 of the 1933 Act before any railway service could be terminated the railway company were obliged by statute, by that section, to satisfy the Minister that adequate substitute road services would be provided for all the rail services being discontinued and to give public notice of their intention to do so.</P>
      <P>I can give the Seanad an assurance that, even though it is proposed to remove the statutory obligation in respect of substitute services for the discontinued rail services, adequate substitute road services will continue to be provided.  In fact, the road services that have been operated there, both on the passenger and freight side since 1966, have been operated by CIE; these will be continued by CIE and there will be no diminution in them and there has been no diminution in them since 1966.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1958 Transport Act relieved <Col N="1203" /> CIE of the obligation to provide substitute road transport services on the termination of railway services.  The net effect is that we are relieving CIE from any such obligation imposed on the Joint Committee under the Transport Act, 1933.  I agree that the point is largely academic now in that the rail services have, in fact, been discontinued and what has been operating since 1966 is a road passenger service and a road freight service.  These have been operated by CIE on behalf of the Joint Committee and will be operated solely now by CIE in the future and have been so operated since 1966.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I should like to ask for clarification.  If you had not this section in the Bill is it the position that when CIE officially take over the Joint Committee's operations they would legally be obliged to maintain adequate road passenger services in lieu of rail services which were operating when the railway company closed down?  Does this only apply to rail services which might be there at the moment and which are, in fact, not in operation?  Is the idea of this section to remove the obligation which exists as to rail services which last ran, say, ten years ago?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Minister's assurance that adequate road services would be provided, will he give a further assurance that they will not be provided by old worn-out coaches that CIE are not anxious to run in places like the city, that they are not just dumped off to rural areas? I understand that a remote area is not the best place to run a new coach; nevertheless, it is a second-class service if you run an old worn-out coach on some of these routes.  I would therefore, ask the Minister for an assurance that this will not be the dump for the company's worn-out vehicles.</P>

      <P>While Senator West may thank the Minister for clarifying the situation, I must confess I still do not quite understand.  It is either unnecessary or else it means something different from what I thought it meant. If it only refers to the changeover from rail to road, there are no railways running, so from that point of view it is not necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is all this is doing, then it is doing it in an unusual way.  I have always seen statutes removed by specific reference that such and such an Act now ceases to have any effect, and it is usually mentioned in a schedule.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>If that happens I could envisage the Minister or his successor coming in with a new Act. I do not think it will happen under existing legislation.  Perhaps I am being unduly suspicious&mdash;the Minister in another Bill referred to my warfare, which is very one-sided, with the parliamentary draftsman&mdash;but the parliamentary draftsman and the Department <Col N="1205" /> are unlikely to put in things unless they really have some meaning.  As there are no railways in these areas reference to the changeover to roads does not appear to be necessary from that point of view.  I am suspicious that it may mean something else. There is a statutory obligation to maintain the road services which replaced the rail services, so it does effect the existing road services.  Once this Bill is passed all obligation on CIE to maintain the services they were forced to put on will cease to have any effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is largely academic.  If you maintain the statutory obligation there is the outside interpretation that somebody might demand that, because a road service was not brought in for a particular piece of rail that has been non-existent for 11 years, it could be legally argued, on behalf of this person or group of people who were on a rail service before 1960, when the rail service was discontinued, that the statutory obligation in the 1933 Act, if not removed by section 9 here, would still apply.  This would obviously be anomalous when CIE had this statutory obligation, which, I am informed, is the only statutory obligation that section 9 refers to, removed in 1958, 13 years ago.  We are still in a situation where CIE, since 1958, are relieved of this statutory obligation in the country as a whole and yet, if you do not put in section 9, they will again have a statutory obligation.  However academic or however real that may be, they will have a statutory obligation in respect of the County Donegal Railway Committee area that they do not have in regard to the country as a whole.  It seems to me to be a very logical tidying-up operation to put CIE on the same basis <i>vis-á-vis</i> their statutory obligations throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheridan</NameTxt>

      <P>I am only arguing <Col N="1206" /> a possible hypothetical case.  I am not saying anybody intends to do this to CIE.  It is open to argument that a legal action would lie under section 9 of the 1933 Act unless removed here. It would certainly be anomalous to put CIE in peril of litigation in respect of this part of County Donegal when they had, by Act of Parliament, in 1958, removed themselves from any such peril of litigation throughout the rest of the country.</P>

      <P>Our concern here is for the salaried staff and workers of the County Donegal Railways.  We fear that the conditions will not be as good, despite the assurances given in the Bill, for the salaried staff and workers.  Here again we have evidence that conditions will not be as good.  Opportunities for promotion will not be as good.  As I have already said, this was a small, efficient and very compact company and their workers had all the benefits of the efficiency of that company.  The Minister has said that, as far as possible, the workers will not be changed from their place of employment in Donegal but that provision would have to be made in the Bill whereby the company, if they found it necessary, <Col N="1207" /> could change salaried staff and workers to other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>This is the part of the Bill we fear.  I would like a strong assurance from the Minister that the staff and workers will not be less well off.  He has already stated this, but I would require a very strong assurance in that regard. In particular, as far as possible, I should like the assurance of the Minister that he will take special care, in any negotiations regarding redundancy, that a fair and square deal will be obtained for the workers of this company. I noticed, in particular, one of the benefits, which is not obtainable in CIE, that the salaried staff and workers of the County Donegal Railways had &mdash;free travel for themselves and their families.  If this benefit is lost by these workers the Minister should see that CIE compensates them for this loss.</P>
      <P>I would not like to see either the lorry drivers or bus drivers saddled with the cast-off vehicles from CIE.  I do not want the situation to arise in which we have Dublin-registered vehicles, which are 20 years old, providing the transport in Donegal.  That would be a deterioration in the service and certainly would be a deterioration in the conditions which the workers in County Donegal now enjoy.</P>

      <P>In answer to Senator McGowan, I assure him that, so far as the staffing situation is concerned, no member of the Joint Committee staff will be disemployed as a result of the transfer of the CDR undertaking to CIE.  This is absolutely factual and has been the situation over the past five years of operation.  There may be staff rearrangement matters to be dealt with, but these will only be dealt with after full consultation with the trade union, as applies in regard to any such dealing by CIE with their staff in any part of the country.

      <P>These are moneys which will be required by the Joint Committee in discharging obligations, that is, obligations arising out of the superannuaton fund.  It is a transitory matter and will cease to have any effect as CIE take over the entire fund. However, in the interim period, there will be money required by the Joint Committee to discharge obligations. The CIE board are committed to meeting such obligations in this interim period.  As the new CIE superannuation fund takes over entirely the Railway Clearance System Superannuation Fund, the need for subsection (3) (b) will disappear.  It is really a transitory provision to enable obligations incurred by the Joint Committee to the former employees in respect of the fund to <Col N="1209" /> which the employees belonged to be discharged on demand by the board of CIE.</P>

Since this Bill means the dissolution of an old railway company, I was wondering if anyone has given any thought to the value of the books as historical documents.  I understand that there is a growing interest in the archives of companies of all kinds.  For example, there was a great interest in the books of the Castlecomer Colliery when that closed down.  Has anybody given thought to the historical value of the records of these railway companies? If not, could the Minister have the matter looked into before they find their way to the rubbish heap? Material of this kind is a very valuable contribution to the study of social history in the years ahead and I am sure that books of companies like this, which have served an open area and carried goodness knows what cargoes from point to point, will be of very great interest to those who follow it in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>I should like to reinforce what Senator Keery has said.  The point he makes about the records is very important.  I, myself, have been involved with&mdash;not specifically the records of a railway company&mdash;the records of another company in trying to get them preserved for the social historians to work on.  The general feeling is that far too few company records in Ireland have been preserved. As a result, there is a great gap in our knowledge, and a famous old railway company like this would be of interest, not just to social historians, but more specifically to railway historians. I certainly consider Senator <Col N="1210" /> Keery's point to be a valid one and I should like the Minister to do whatever he can in his power to ensure that the records of the County Donegal Railway Company would be preserved and put in their proper place in the National Library or any other suitable Irish library.  It might be more appropriate, in this case, to put them in a County Donegal library.  The whole thing is to preserve them so that the historians and people who have this as a particular interest can study them at a later date, and that they will not be lost.</P>

I can assure the Seanad that CIE have a most comprehensive library available at Seán Heuston station and this library does provide what the Senator has spoken about; a comprehensive history of the railways, the various developments and so on over the years since the railways were established. Any records now in the possession of the County Donegal Railways will pass into the CIE library for the edification of future historians.</P>

      <P>The Board shall not be subject to any liability in respect of any stocks or shares of the Strabane Company or in respect of the payment of interest or dividends on such stocks or shares and no cause of action shall lie against the Board in respect of any such stocks or shares or in respect of the payment of any such interest or dividends.</P>

    <P>This deals with the Strabane Company. What is to happen to the holders of <Col N="1211" /> shares in the County Donegal Railways Company?

      <P>On the question of compensation to the holders of the guaranteed stock, I wonder would the Minister elaborate a little on this.  The Minister told the Dáil that the Donegal County Council and Letterkenny Urban District Council guaranteed dividends on these particular shares to the owners and they were liable respectively for an annual sum of £640 and £60.  They decided to terminate these payments on the 1st January, 1960, having being advised that once the railways ceased to operate they were no longer liable for payment.</P>
      <P>Apparently the Strabane Railway also took advice.  They were advised that they were entitled to get the payment in continuation notwithstanding the fact that the railways had ceased to exist.  I wonder which advice was correct and did the Minister or CIE get any advice on the matter.  In other words, two local authorities decided they were not liable, presumably legally, to pay these but the Minister has accepted liability and is paying the stock-holders concerned a sum of £17,000.  I wonder is he strictly liable for this?</P>

      <P>Subsection (1) gives power to the Minister to make an order so that certain specified level crossings do not have to be manned.  The wording is:</P>
      <P>to provide, make or maintain gates or other specified works at a specified level crossing.</P>
      <P>I think this means certain level crossings on roads that at one time had been heavily used by the public and these roads have changed in character. They have now degenerated perhaps into crossings purely used by local farmers and used very infrequently.  I should like to get some more detailed information from the Minister on the point as to which type of level crossing he intends to include under subsection (1) because in fact he could, under subsection (1), if the Minister for Local Government agreed, exempt every level crossing from these provisions.  I should like to ask him which level crossings he will exempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we are dealing with the problem of level crossings, I should like him to say what the feeling in the company is about these unstaffed level crossings&mdash;unstaffed and without barriers. These crossings, I think, are called graded crossings in the United States.  This is another area in which a transport company, CIE in this case, have got to lay out a great deal of money on maintenance of gates and on <Col N="1213" /> maintenance of staff at level crossings. I think we have got to be realistic here. We have got to replace staffed level crossings by unstaffed level crossings with barriers and, as I said on the Second Stage, the company are to be congratulated on their warning advertisements on television.  They are extremely good.  I feel the public has got to face the fact that the level crossing gate will be replaced by automatic barriers, lights and bells.  The public may have to face the further unpleasant fact that there will be level crossings on roads which are not heavily used and which may be marked, without a barrier, by a post with the criss-cross sign of a railway crossing and that it will be up to the public themselves to ensure that there is no train approaching and that it is at their own risk they cross without ensuring that there is no train coming in either direction.  The cost of maintaining level crossings is extremely high and for less used roads such as boreens the level crossing will have to be replaced by just a grade crossing.  I should like to ask the Minister what is the opinion of the company on the problem of level crossings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the problem is not too great because we do not have a railway at all in my area, and we do not have level crossings. What we do have is a legacy of the remains of level crossings, the dangers of which have been unheard of by the local authority in County Donegal.  There are gates and dangerous corners which in themselves present a very serious problem in the county.  I am sure that those Senators who have had the pleasure of coming to our county can remember that we had a lot of winding roads and the railway had to find its way through these roads.  In a number of places there are dangerous corners which are a problem to the local authority.  Under this section the greatest problem that we have in the county is how to find funds and sufficient time.  I do not think sufficient provision is made in this section or that sufficient recognition is taken of that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder how far the assurance in this Bill goes in respect of maintaining <Col N="1214" /> crossings which are no longer railway crossings but are actually ragged ways for landowners in so far as they may cross the railway and have gates which were there as crossing gates.  I wonder how the company's responsibility will continue to maintain gates at these which could be classed as private crossings between one farm and another.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, this section applies only to crossings where CIE have now a statutory obligation to provide attendance.  It does not refer to level crossings which are on main and secondary roads.  If I am correct in that I should like to follow up on what Dr. West has said and ask the Minister what is CIE's policy in regard to railway crossings in general. It is obvious that in the years to come we will have to fall in line with the modern practice in other countries where attendance at level crossings is unknown.</P>
      <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister that this would be only a beginning of a policy gradually to do away with attendance at railway crossings. The best policy to adopt would be to take this as a starting point and then have secondary or by-roads, eventually followed up by having automatic crossings on the main roads.  As I understand it, this is only a very limited provision which affects only some 70 level crossings where CIE do not have to provide anybody to open or close the gates.  Generally speaking, now is the time for CIE to consider a general policy in regard to level crossings so that we will know what is in store for us in the years ahead.  The public who are driving cars will have advance notice of any change in policy by CIE in regard to railway crossings.</P>

      <P>Along with Senators West, McGowan and Russell, Senator Dooge also raised this point on the Second Stage.  First of all, to remove any misconception, the power that Senator Russell speaks about in regard to the important roads exists under section 9 of the Transport Act, 1958.  Under that section the Minister has power to allow for the substitution of automatic controls for gates at level <Col N="1215" /> crossings where the railway company have a statutory obligation to provide attendance.  These are crossings which crossed public roads when the railways were first laid down.  This obligation was placed on the railway companies in statutes back in 1845 and 1863.  We have already dealt with those roads under section 9 of the Transport Act, 1958, so the policy is quite clearly in the direction of having a substitution of automatic warning devices and other controls for the old-fashioned attended railway crossing.  Many of these are already in existence on public roads in many parts of the country.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to go further than section 9 of the Transport Act, 1958, so as to enable CIE to substitute these automatic warning devices and controls for gates on public road level crossings at which the board are at present obliged to provide and maintain gates but are not obliged to provide attendance, that is, crossings which were not public road crossings when the railways were constructed and therefore did not need attendance under the railway transport legislation of the last century.  This provision in section 22 is an extension of a principle that exists in section 9 of the Transport Act, 1958, which already covers level crossings at which there is an obligation to provide attendance.  Section 22 of the Bill empowers me to make orders in respect of the type of crossing which was not covered by the 1958 Act and which we are now seeking to cover in view of the experience of the operation of the 1958 Act which is, in the main, favourable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dooge asked me, on Second Stage, to make some observations as to the general experience of how these new automatic devices had worked since being introduced after the 1958 Act.  During the last ten years, accidents at level crossings in the State dropped from 38 in 1961 to six in 1970.  This bears out the change in policy towards the automatic devices in that the accident rate at level crossings has dropped steeply, even though automatic devices have gradually replaced the old unattended railway crossing, and in a few years these <Col N="1216" /> should be fully replaced wherever it is practicable.</P>
    <P>Many of these automatic crossings are located on busy main roads and they have greatly helped the flow of traffic.  The experience in other countries, particularly in densely populated countries with a very high traffic flow like Belgium and the Netherlands, has been generally good and follows an overall pattern of an actual reduction in accidents rather than an increase.  In the United States of America the accident experience has been similar.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with Senator Dooge's comment about the necessity for an educational campaign in regard to the dangers of automatically controlled crossings.  CIE are very aware of this. Whenever an automatic crossing is brought into operation every householder within a five miles radius is circulated with a brochure explaining how the crossing operates.  In addition, the district manager gives talks in the schools in the area to explain the operation to schoolchildren.  Section 22 therefore is designed to ensure that we diminish the risk of accidents at unattended level crossings on minor roads which have become public roads. Many of the accidents in recent years have been at these unattended level crossings.</P>
    <P>The onus of closing the gates at such crossings rests on the user and frequently results in the gates being left open to the road causing a serious hazard for both road and rail users. The section is designed to improve safety at this type of crossing and to enable me to make orders to permit automatic controls to be installed at the more dangerous of these crossings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>The company, through the Minister, are to be congratulated on their reduction in the accident rate from 38 to six in view of the fact that there are fewer manned crossings.  I thought for a moment, when the Minister gave us this information, that perhaps 32 of the accidents had been caused by gate keepers pulling the gates over them or some incredible situation which might occur at manned crossings.  I understand that the <Col N="1217" /> majority of these accidents occurred at crossings at which there were gates but which were not actually manned&mdash; that people left them open.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>In the United States of America one gory fact quoted every year is that, at certain of these crossings, the number of accidents is statistically constant every year: a more or less fixed number of people are killed.  I am afraid that, unless our campaign is exceptionally successful, we will find that we will have a constant rate of accidents at these unmanned crossings.  It is therefore very encouraging to learn that the rate has fallen from 38 to six.  I did not see how it could be as high as 38 in this country, but we must all welcome the fact that it has fallen to six.  Further, I should like to ask the Minister if the company intends to introduce what I term these &ldquo;grade crossings&rdquo;&mdash;that is the American phrase for them.  These are crossings which do not have an automatic barrier, do not have a gate, which just have a warning post saying &ldquo;level crossing&rdquo;.  These are very common in the USA on the less heavily used lines.  Is it the company's intention to introduce these in certain places here?</P>
      <P>I should also like to ask the Minister, under subsection (4), about the persons who would propose to apply for such an order.  Is there a possibility that anybody besides the company itself would be applying to the Minister to make an order in this case?</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An order under this section may require the Board to provide and maintain such barriers, lights and automatic and other devices and <Col N="1218" /> appliances and to comply with such other conditions and requirements for the protection, safety and convenience of the public as the Minister thinks fit and specifies in the order.</P>
    <P>What CIE found most effective are automatic barriers and light devices. A combination of these two is the most effective warning device.  These are kept under constant review to ensure that the warning is as early as possible and as effective as possible.</P>

      <P>Reading this section, I wonder how realistic is this procedure of supervising the condition of the gates, whether they are open or closed, or what a driver of a vehicle does, or fails to do, when he goes through.  I take it that we are thinking here of roads that are not <Col N="1220" /> very important, where the gates may be manually operated and where, normally, you would not have a guard on duty.  Where is the evidence to come from that an individual has gone through and failed to close the gate? How often is a prosecution likely to arise under this section?</P>
      <P>I take it that when a regulation is made to give affect to this section, and section 22, the direction in which the gates open, and that sort of thing, will be spelled out so that when the gate is opened for somebody going along the road it will not be put across the railway line and left there for the next train to smash into it.  It will be opened, presumably, across the road so that, in effect, if the person who is making use of the road does something wrong, or does not do what he is supposed to do and close the gate again, it will not be the next train which will suffer under this piece of legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the earlier section we dealt with two types of level crossings involving gates: the attended level crossing and the unattended level crossings on public roads.  Both the Bill and the 1958 Act allow for orders to be made to replace both the attended and unattended gateways at level crossings on public roads by automatic devices.</P>
      <P>This section relates to unattended crossings including a third category of crossing called accommodation crossings. The gates at these crossings are gates across the road, so there is no danger there with regard to the railway. They include accommodation crossings involving local farmers who may have land on both sides of the railway.  They would have a gateway into the railway and another gateway out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The danger here lies in leaving the gate open and allowing stock to stray on to the railway line.  In this regard the fine has been at a level of 40s since 1845.  CIE have found that, because of the legislation and the small nature of the penalty, offences have tended to be dismissed.  We want to bring it home to district justices, and the public generally, that this can be a serious offence.  For that reason we are providing here for a maximum penalty of <Col N="1221" /> £25 instead of 40s for failure by a user to shut and fasten gates at unattended level crossings.</P>
    <P>Senator Jessop spoke about the difficulty of proving cases like that.  Of course he is right.  Prosecutions have been brought on the basis of information supplied by CIE employees working on the railway in the immediate area.  CIE workers such as plate-layers and so on who have to tend, mind and repair a stretch of railway line, have notified these offences from time to time and there have been prosecutions on foot of them.  We want this to act as a salutary example to people that this is a serious matter and can have dangerous repercussions.  Stock straying on to the railway line, through an open gate, could obviously dislodge a train and this could have very serious consequences.  The purpose here is to bring the penalty fixed at 40s in 1845 into realistic terms in 1971.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Jessop referred to the difficulty in ascertaining the guilty person.  Those accomodation crossings are, in general, adjacent to a farmer's house. The farmer is supplied with a key to the gate.  There is an obligation on the farmer to lock the gate and to take possession of the key.  If the gate is left open he is responsible.  That is how the guilty person is ascertained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a local authority in Donegal I am particularly interested in this section.  Subsection (1) deals with the case of &ldquo;where a public road crosses by means of a bridge&rdquo; and here it is suggested that the company's responsibility to maintain the road surface on that bridge shall cease.  The road authority, which is the local authority, appear to be liable for the road surface.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection 2 (c) provides that the board shall pay to the road authority, which is the local authority, compensation for any expenses which it incurs in surfacing or maintaining the road thereafter.  This is of particular importance to the local authority in County Donegal in so far as it has a very big number of these bridges.  The local authorities in County <Col N="1224" /> Donegal are being pressed very hard at present to have some policy regarding these bridges.  I would ask the Minister what he means by paying compensation to the local authority.  Does he envisage paying for the realignment of bridges where the railway is no longer in use?  In this section it says the bridge includes the approaches to the bridge.  This is of great importance to the county.  It is a part of the Bill which will affect the local authorities very much and I hope the Minister, his Department, CIE and everyone concerned fully realise what is involved here for the local authorities and for the company.</P>
    <P>Maybe I am not fully qualified to read this, but I feel that here the company will be committed to the local authority for the maintenance of the road at these bridges.  A problem could arise where realignment takes place and I do not see provision for such an occurrence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McGowan has made a very good point here.  It applies not just to Donegal but all over the country.  Again, I would make a plea. I look at this rather differently from Senator McGowan.  I can see that a lot of the bridges over no longer existing permanent ways will have to be realigned to improve the roads.  This section means that the financial liability for this is borne by the railway company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Financial liability for road surfaces over bridges, whether they are crossing railways or canals, should come out of the appropriate finance provided by road users.  This affects the accounting in CIE and specifically in the railway section of CIE.  The railways are subsidising the road users and I think this is wrong.  It is purely a matter of accountancy.  The money will come out of State funds, whatever way it is done.  I should like to see road surfaces and road alterations and the maintenance of road surfaces over railway bridges being financed by the appropriate road funds, not necessarily local authority funds, or general funds. Why should these constantly have to be a charge on CIE's railway operations? It is one of the many ways in which the <Col N="1225" /> railways are made to look financially much worse off than they actually are.</P>
    <P>When we look at CIE's railway bill, which is presented by the Minister to the public occasionally, we should realise that railway finance covers the total cost of the railway operation, whereas road finance often just covers part of the cost.  For example, the actual cost of transporting goods by lorry will be subsidised to a great extent by the actual funds used to maintain road surfaces.  The road tax on the lorry is only a small part of it. The railway expenses, when one takes into account the State subsidy given to CIE to maintain the railways, cover the total cost of rail transport.  I should like to see the full liability for road surfaces being paid by some other method and not being made as a charge to CIE and, in particular, to the railway side of the operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fencing on ramps or overhead bridges is part of the responsibility and should remain the responsibility of the railway company. It is not mentioned here. &ldquo;Bridge&rdquo; includes an approach to a bridge, but not the fencing on the ramp. Even on a railway line which is continually in operation, if there is a breakdown on the fencing on the approach, the land on the inside is always the property of the railway company. Stock can wander off the public road on to the railway and this is not covered in the section.</P>
      <P>When bridges are demolished and roads are realigned, this can always be met as a charge against the road fund, a road improvement grant.  Maintenance charges only should fall on the railway company.  Improvements could always be made a charge against the road fund.</P>
      <P>That omission about fencing is important.  A bridge includes an approach to a bridge and the fencing on the approach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Senator Russell is on the point.  They are not. They were covered under section 21 of the 1950 Act.  These deal with public roads, where they cross by means of a <Col N="1226" /> bridge a functioning railway line.  As we did in an earlier section, this is extending the powers that exist already in regard to certain bridges under the 1950 Act.  Under section 21 of the 1950 Act, the liability in regard to bridges on abandoned railway lines was transferred to local authorities and has been a charge on local authorities since 1950.  This section is designed to deal with the anomaly that has existed, as Senator West points out, since 1845 whereby CIE have a liability in regard to bridges over functioning railways. They have a liability in regard to the surfacing of the bridges and it is now agreed, again with the Department of Local Government, that this is anomalous.  This is a matter for the road authority, with engineers and engineering staff dealing with repairs; it is obviously anomalous that they should be dealing with full road repairs, construction and reconstruction up to the approach to the bridge, and that CIE should have the liability for doing it after that.</P>
      <P>It is obviously a situation that does not make sense.  For that reason under this section we are transferring to the local authority the liability for maintaining such bridges, subject to an assessment of compensation which should be paid by CIE to a local authority in view of the fact that the local authority are taking over a liability from CIE.  That can be fixed actuarially but at least it will be a once-and-for-all job; compensation will be paid by CIE to the local authority and from there on the local authority will take over 100 per cent responsibility.</P>

At least it will get rid of a situation where CIE are, year in, year out, dealing administratively and having a staff devoted to this task which is so logically within the realm of the local authority whose staff are doing all the <Col N="1227" /> works adjacent to the particular bridges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this particular section regarding the medical examinations for drivers of locomotives.  I am very conscious of accidents involving any type of public transport, whether aeroplanes or railway engines.  In a large number of cases the cause of the accident will be found to be human error.  I am quite sure that a health defect of some kind can be a contribution to human error. I live near Dún Laoghaire railway station and in the past 18 months or so there were three minor derailments there.  My admiration went out to CIE when I made an inquiry as to what investigation had been made into these derailments and what the cause had been.  I received back a very prompt letter which made the straightforward admission that human error had been the factor in each case.  I was very impressed by that frankness and I welcome this section of the Bill, which provides for medical examinations for locomotive drivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note the point that, if a driver is <Col N="1230" /> found to have a health or an eyesight defect of some kind, he may not be retained in the employment of the board as a locomotive driver.  I should like to point out to the Minister that there may be an element of domestic hardship here.  A man may have been driving a locomotive for a number of years and may have become used to a salary at a particular level.  If that man loses his job as a result of a medical examination, I think it can on occasions be very difficult for CIE to find alternative employment for him which will give him a salary equivalent to what he has been used to in his particular capacity.  I know this is true of bus driving and bus conducting, for example.  I have no particular experience of locomotive driving, but I imagine it is the case.</P>
    <P>Although I know that CIE make efforts to try to meet such cases by finding alternative employment, may I just make the point to the Minister that, even if a man has to be satisfied with a form of employment with CIE which does not give him the income to which he has been accustomed, I think it would be a very welcome step by CIE if, only for a limited period, they might agree to continue the man at his wage or at least reduce the wage by degrees so that the man could adjust his domestic circumstances to the change.  This is the type of change which should be fully discussed between management and unions.  I imagine there has not been a case of this kind so far.  If and when the situation does arise that some locomotive driver loses his job as a result of a medical examination, I hope we will not suddenly find ourselves involved in an industrial dispute because nobody has taken the trouble to anticipate the likely difficulty and thrash out the problem in advance.  I should just like to make those comments in welcoming this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it should go out from this House that CIE have not, in fact, been carrying out medical examinations on their drivers and their other staff.  As far as I know, they have.  I think Senator Dooge mentioned that this was only <Col N="1231" /> giving statutory enactment to what, in fact, was being done by CIE.</P>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Keery's observations on the question of a man disemployed as a result of a medical examination.  I should like to go even further than that.  There should be some system of rehabilitation, because it is quite possible that a man might be found medically unfit to drive a locomotive for reasons which are only temporary and I would like to think that CIE would accept the responsibility of rehabilitating him so that he might be in a position to return to active service as a locomotive driver. If that were not possible and if his defect were a permanent one, then I would support Senator Keery because there is a substantial difference between what a man might earn, say, in a lesser position in CIE and what he would be paid as a locomotive driver.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the two previous Senators.  As Senator Russell has said, it would not be right for people to get the impression that medical examinations are not carried out in CIE.  As a matter of fact, without this section, even if an employee is out ill for, say, a month or six weeks, the company can send him to their medical officer to have him examined and if the medical officers decide he is unfit to drive then he is not allowed to.</P>
      <P>CIE make every effort to arrange alternative employment.  It is not easy at all times, but then there is an early retirement pension, which is good.  It is not as good as one's wages but when one is unable to drive it is some source of consolation.  In my experience CIE never lose an opportunity of trying to get alternative employment for somebody who can no longer drive.</P>

      <P>The position is that CIE have always made a medical examination a condition of employment for new entrants to the grade of locomotive driver.  They are very concerned about the need to have periodic medical examination extended to all locomotive drivers, not just new entrants into the grade.  This is the reason for this section: to ensure that <Col N="1232" /> there will be periodic medical examinations extended to existing working locomotive drivers apart from the compulsory medical examination that is there in regard to entrants into this category.  I think it is a very important section to have in the Bill.  It is common practice in all European railways to have this periodic medical examination compulsory as far as working locomotive drivers are concerned.</P>

      <P>Section 36 applies to penalties for pulling the communication cord in circumstances in which it is not warranted.  This happens extensively in trains known as &ldquo;football specials&rdquo; and very little elsewhere. This penalty really applies to the returning footballers or, perhaps, the more enthusiastic football fans.  I should like to ask the Minister, seeing that this offence is committed specifically by this group of people&mdash;and by football I include, of course, hurling and other such dangerous sports&mdash;what provision have the company made to deter the more enthusiastic football fans from swinging out of the communication cord on these trains, apart from increasing the penalty.  I ask this because unless one has officials in every carriage it is difficult to discover who has pulled the cord because these trains are generally packed full of people, none of whom is liable to cooperate with the officials of the company. Could I ask if the company have any means of putting a stop to this? Perhaps the information is top secret and the Minister would prefer not to give it to me, as there may be some secret detector devices employed on &ldquo;football specials&rdquo;.  I should like to know if there are any ways of deterring people apart from the £25 penalty.</P>

      <P>Short of the company exercising discretion regarding <Col N="1235" /> groups for which they run special trains, there is nothing very much that can be done about it.  This is very good business.  They will only get a large crowd on a special occasion such as for a football match or something of that kind.  This type of irresponsible operation in regard to the communication cord has been substantially on the increase.  It is a reflection, unfortunately, of the society in which we live. CIE are very concerned about it.  On some of these special occasions there is continuous cord pulling going on, which delays trains.  There is very little that can be done about it beyond imposing as stiff a penalty as possible.  We are raising the penalty from £5 to £25. Beyond asking the courts to impose severe penalties, there is little more we can do.  It is a totally irresponsible type of offence that has no justification.  It is complete vandalism and it should be treated very severely in the courts.  I cannot see what else can be done in the way of deterring it.</P>

      <P>This is another outdated provision that we are cleaning up under these very interesting miscellaneous provisions.  This relates to what used to be called turnpike roads, going back again to the 1845 Act. Turnpike roads are no longer in existence. Section 48 of the Railway Act, 1845 imposed certain obligations that, where any railway crossed a turnpike road at a level crossing adjoining a station, all trains should be made to slacken their speed before arriving at such turnpike road and should not cross the road at any greater rate of speed than four miles per hour.  Turnpike roads and public carriage roads were what are now public roads, but it could not be established without considerable research which particular public roads were originally turnpike roads.  CIE are anxious that what is now a completely outdated provision&mdash; for all practical purposes a dead letter &mdash;should be repealed.</P>

      <P>May I make a small point here, which I might not otherwise get an opportunity to make, regarding speed at level crossings?  One thing which we are very much inclined to overlook is the tremendous increase in the speed of trains and indeed the weight of trains.  Even though the distance may be quite short there are occasions on which I, as a commuter, shudder to think of the speed at which trains from Dublin to Dún Laoghaire, for example, cross at Merrion Gates. <Col N="1237" /> I am not quite sure if that would have been a turnpike road or not, but the speed is enormous.  I was very impressed at the precautions taken in Britain in anticipation of a major train disaster, where literally the resources of several counties have exercises regurarly because of the speeds and numbers of people involved.  This may well be a routine here but it is certainly the sort of thing that Civil Defence, hospitals and so on need to plan for: this awful contingency should anything go wrong.</P>

      <P>This has been described as a tidying up Bill and it certainly does affect many previous Acts dealing with railways.  A person who wanted to find out as quickly as possible to what extent previous Acts had been affected would turn to the end of the Bill to find what repeals were effected by the Bill.  The repeals are normally put at the end of an Act.  He would find the section dealing with repeals and might come to the conclusion that these were the only repeals involved.  But on looking back through the Bill there is another section, section 20, which deals also with repeals. The justification for that, to some extent, is that these are the repeals effected under Part II.  That, unfortunately, is not the end of the story because if you look further through the Bill you find there is a completely separate repeal under section 25 and there is another repeal under section 31. It is, therefore, extremely difficult for a person who wants to know what repeals have been effected under this Bill.  He has to go right through the Bill, and I would suggest to the Minister that he should consider putting a Schedule of repeals at the end of the Bill which would show what previous Acts have been affected.  It is the kind of Bill in which this separate Schedule is particularly appropriate and I would urge him to consider doing that.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Senator Eoin Ryan for that suggestion. On going through the Bill I take his point very well.  There are a number of amendments and outright repeals throughout the Bill, being of the miscellaneous <Col N="1238" /> nature that it is.  It started out originally as a County Donegal Railways Joint Committee Bill and then we decided to do a tidying up operation on a lot of legislative deadwood so that the miscellaneous provisions now cover as much of the Bill as the original Bill itself.  It is appropriate in a Bill of this kind to have the type of Schedule suggested by Senator Eoin Ryan.  Certainly we can incorporate that in the Bill between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>First of all, there are no private shareholders in the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee. That is the point.  The County Donegal Railways Joint Committee is owned equally by the British Railways Board and the Great Northern Railway Board.  The GNR Board is made up of CIE and the Ulster Transport Authority, now the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company.  The Schedule to the Bill represents the agreement entered into by CIE with British Railways.  In effect, that is where the real agreement lies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Schedule means is that CIE, by agreement with British Railways, are taking over the British Railways interest in the Joint Committee and merging the Joint Committee as a whole into CIE.  CIE have also entered into a separate agreement, which is not incorporated here, with the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company to take over their interests.  This agreement <Col N="1239" /> in the Schedule is an agreement between British Railways and CIE in relation to their joint shareholding in the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee.</P>
